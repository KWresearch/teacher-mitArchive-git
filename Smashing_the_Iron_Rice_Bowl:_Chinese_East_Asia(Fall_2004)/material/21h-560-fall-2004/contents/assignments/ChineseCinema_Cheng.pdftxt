Chinese Cinema  in the 1980s  and 1990s

Chinese history, particularly  after  the fall of the Qing dynasty, has been

wrought with turmoil  and  instability,  especially  in  the structure  of  the

government.  The Qing dynasty was overthrown  in 1911 and  the Nationalists

took over under  the  leadership  of Yuan Shikai, who was named  president.

Eventually he made  the mistake  of declaring  himself  emperor,  which made  him

wildly unpopular  among  the general population.  Following  his death  in 1916

was the  “warlord period.”  China was basically divided  into  separate  regions  with

individual  leaders  or “warlords.”  No one was  really able  to unify  the country

until 1926, when Chiang  Kai-shek  formed  the National Revolutionary  Army  to

fight against  the warlords. However,  the  fighting wasn’t  over  after  the defeat  of

the warlords;  the Communist  party was  formed  in 1921, and  in 1927,  Chiang

Kai-shek  and  the Nationalists  began  their  crack  down on the opposition  party.

With the exception  of a few years spanning World War  II (the  two parties  formed

a united  front against  Japan),  the  two parties  constantly  fought  each  other up

until 1949, when  the Communists  took  over China and Chiang  Kai-Shek was

forced  to flee  to Taiwan. Even  after  the Communist  takeover,  when  things  looked

like they were going  to stabilize,  indecisiveness  and paranoia  (mostly  of  rebellion

Cheng 2

among  the people) within party  leadership  led  to several  failed  campaigns,  such

as the Great Leap Forward  and  the Cultural  Revolution.  With  the entire  country

as “drama-ridden”  as  it was,  it is only natural  to see that drama  reflected  in

Chinese  cinema. The  two  films, Yellow Earth  and To Live, both reflect  life  in

twentieth  century  China, but  in very different  ways; Yellow Earth,  being a

product  of the  so-called  “Fifth Generation  Film”  era of the 1980s,  leans more

toward  the non-dramatic  side, whereas To Live errs on the dramatic,  though  not

so overly dramatic  as to stray  from  reality.

Yellow Earth  takes place  in the early  spring  of 1939  in a small village  in

the northern  part  of the Shaanxi  province.  It opens with  the wedding  of a young

girl to a middle-aged  man. During  the wedding  feast,  a Communist  soldier,  Gu

Qing arrives  from  Yan’an. He has been  sent to the village  to collect  folk songs,

which he will bring back to the Eighth Route Army  to sing as they  travel. He

requests  to be housed with  a poor  family,  so he stays with  a family  (comprised  of

a father, Cuiqiao,  the  thirteen year-old  daughter,  and Hanhan,  the younger  son)

in their cave home. Cuiqiao walks  three miles  everyday  to  fetch water  from  the

Yellow River  (Huang He). Throughout  the  film, Gu Qing helps  the family with

household  chores  as he tries  to gather  songs. But his search  seems  so futile

because all of the songs  that are sung  seem  so bitter. When  asked about  this,  the

father responds  that  there  is no point  in singing.  People  only sing  if they’re

really happy or bitter,  and  it’s usually  because of  the latter.

Cheng 3

Gu Qing  also develops  friendships  with both Cuiqiao  and Hanhan. He

explains  to Cuiqiao  that  in the south, women  are starting  to choose  their  own

spouses. They’re  also allowed  to  join  the Communist  party.  Cuiqiao’s  father

scoffs at this, saying  that  if girls were allowed  to choose  their own partners,  then

that must mean  they are worthless.  He believes  in arranged marriages.  His  elder

daughter  is married,  but  she suffers;  she  is starving  and her husband  beats her.

The father knows  this, but he won’t allow her to come  back because  she  can’t  “go

back on her word.”  The father  says  that, “Marriage  for  a man  is happiness.

Marriage  for a woman  is sadness.”  Even  though  he believes  this,  he still holds

onto tradition  and  even arranges a marriage  for Cuiqiao. When  the betrothal  is

finalized, Cuiqiao  goes  to Gu Qing and asks him to take her with him back to

Yan’an;  she wants  to  join the army. Gu Qing  refuses,  stating  that one of the

conditions of army membership  is  that you have  to apply  first. He promises  to

apply for Cuiqiao, and  to come  back  in the spring  to get her.

In the meantime,  Cuiqiao’s  father pushes  for  the marriage  to  take place,

and in early  spring  another wedding  occurs.  Sometime  after  the wedding, Gu

Qing still has not returned;  Cuiqiao  can no  longer wait  for him.  She decides  to go

to Yan’an  herself  and  try  to find Gu Qing. As she  is crossing Huang He, she sings

a song of being  free and  suddenly her  singing  is  interrupted  and  she disappears.

One can only  assume  that  she drowns.

Cheng 4

The closing  scene  of the  film shows  the village  in a drought. Huang He is

completely dried  up and all of the male villagers pray  to  the Dragon God  for

rain. Gu Qing  finally  returns, but  the only person  to notice  is Hanhan.

This film  took place  in 1939,  shortly  after  the Communists  and

Nationalists  agreed  to  form a unified  front against  the  Japanese.  The Nationalists

consolidated  their  army  towards  the  south  in Chongqing  while  the Communists

settled  farther north  in Yan’an.1 The Red Army was renamed  the  Eighth Route

Army and nominally  under  the  command  of  the Nationalists,  per  their

agreement. During  the period  from  1937  to 1940,  the CCP saw an increase  in

their membership  from  40,000  to around  800,000  people.2

Chinese  cinema  tends  to fall under  the  category  of “melodrama.”

Melodrama  is a “representation  of historical  victimization  as a social  catastrophe

[that  is] registered  by  narrativizing  the  subjective  and  ethical  aspect  of the

drama within  an economic  interpretation  of class relations and by viewing  the

story’s  individual  protagonist  as an overdetermined  ideological  figure.”3  The

story is always highlighted  by  a so-called  “fate  of suffering”  and  an ultimate

acceptance  by  the protagonist  of  the oppressive  social  order  he must  endure.4  In

more contemporary  cinema,  the melodrama  focuses  on  sexual difference,  in

particular,  feminine  sexuality  and  its constrictions  in  society.5 A third  type of

melodrama described  by Browne  is Chinese political melodrama.  In this genre,

the political  process  is portrayed  through  a trial  that  takes over  the theme of the

film.  In the contemporary  period,  the political perspective  is also  contrasted with

Cheng 5

an ethical  one.6 This usually  then  leads  to a “definition  of  the self and of the

relation of the individual  to  [society].”7

Although  the  film was set during World War  II when  the Red Army was

based in Yan’an,  its main focus was around  a small  farm village  that was located

near the Yellow River.  The melodrama  was  hardly political with  the exception  of

the irony  of the soldier’s  presence. He  fails  to bring  any change, be  it material or

ideological  to  the village.  In the end,  they still rely more heavily  on superstition

and praying  to  the gods  for help than  themselves.8  But  even  this irony  is

balanced out by  the portrayal  of the  soldiers  in Yan’an. Gu Qing returns  to

Yan’an  to see  liberated  peasants  dancing  and  singing optimistic  war  songs.

Furthermore,  Cuiqiao  and Hanhan were  very receptive  and positive  about  the

revolution when Gu Qing  told them about  it. The film as a whole  carried  very

few political messages.  The Chinese  government  found nothing  so politically

offensive  in the  film that gave  it grounds  for  banning.9

If there was any melodrama  at all,  it would probably  be of the gender

differences  variety. The  protagonist,  Cuiqiao  struggles  with dealing with  an

arranged marriage  in a time when,  if she had  lived  in a different part  of the

country,  she could have had  the freedom  to choose her own husband.  But  even

that plot  is subdued  and  emotionless.  The whole  film  is lacking  in dialogue. Most

messages  are conveyed  through  the  folk songs  that Cuiqiao  sings. Two

opportune moments  for  the aspects  of a typical Chinese melodrama  to  emerge

would have been  the scene where Cuiqiao  is  forced  to marry,  and when  she

Cheng 6

attempts  to cross  the Yellow River  in her  little boat.10  In the wedding  scene,  all

that is seen of her husband  is a dark hand extending  from  off-screen  to  take off

her veil. The only  significant  indication  of emotion  is Ciuqiao’s  heavy  frightened

breathing.  In the second  scene,  Cuiqiao’s  drowning  is shown  through  the  sudden

interruption  of her singing by  silence, and  empty  shots  of the river. Her death

seemed  almost  ambiguous.

Yellow Earth  is considered  a  “Fifth Generation”  film.  It was directed by

Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou, who were  fresh out of Beijing  Film Academy.  They

were among  the first class  to graduate  “post-Cultural  Revolution.”  The  reason

why the term  “Fifth Generation”  was even  coined was that  the films produced  by

these  filmmakers  were  considerably  different  from  the  typical  Chinese  films  of

the previous  generation.  The  topics of these  films weren’t  “officially  sanctioned”

or ubiquitous  throughout  mass media. Moreover,  the  cinematography  changed

completely.  “Darkness  and  asymmetry  replaced  centeredness  and  full  lighting.”11

In Yellow Earth,  there are a lot of night  time  scenes with dim  lighting.  Inside

Cuiqiao’s home,  the only  things used  for lighting were  a couple  of oil lamps.

The makers of Yellow Earth were probably  some of  the first Chinese

filmmakers  to  see cinema  solely as art,  rather  than  falling  second  to  literature,

like their  predecessors.12  Having  graduated  from  film  school  after  the Cultural

Revolution,  they were  exposed  to international  cinema  as well. The visual  style of

the film  looks  international,  but  still maintains  its Chinese  roots,  though  it

definitely  steers  away  from  the drama  of previous  Chinese  films, which  tended  to

Cheng 7

be fast-paced  in an effort  to fend off criticism  that  Chinese  film  lacked

excitement.13  In particular,  the  landscape  shots  are reminiscent  of Chinese

painting. The majority  of  the screen  is filled with  landscape:  earth, mountain,

and rock. The  sky fills only  the  top one-fifth  of  the screen or  so. The  landscape

dwarfs human  figures  throughout  most  of the film. Much of the cinematography

consists of a series of  static  landscape  shots. Overall, Yellow Earth  is not overly

dramatic.  In fact,  it is more  “undramatic”  with  the  lack of activity  and dialogue.

Though  it does  convey  some points  related  to social  issues  in China,  it doesn’t

use traditional  means.

To Live,  though made  in 1994, 10 years after Yellow Earth was  released,

seems  to fit the more  traditional  mold  of Chinese  cinema.  The  film focuses on  a

Chinese  family  and  takes viewers  through  their  lives  over a span of three

decades,  the 1940s  through  the 1960s.  It opens  in a Chinese  village  in  the 1940s.

The protagonist,  Xu  Fugui  loses his family’s  home  to a man named  Long’er

because of his gambling  addiction.  His  father has a heart  attack and dies upon

hearing  this, and his pregnant wife,  Jiazhen,  leaves  him  and  takes  their daughter

with them.  Fugui  is left alone  to start his  life over and  take care of his sick

mother. Within  the first  ten minutes,  the  film is already  filled with drama.  Fugui

moves out of his home and becomes  a street peddler. Upon hearing  that  her

husband  had changed,  Jiazhen  returns  to make  their  family whole  again.  Fugui

forms a puppet  troupe  and  travels  the country  performing  puppet  shows  to

Cheng 8

make a living. The  puppets he uses are present  throughout  most  of the movie,

almost as a symbol  of all the hardships  the  family  endures.

The film starts out during  the 1940s, probably  just after  the end of World

War II, when  the Communists  and Nationalists  resume  fighting  against  each

other.  It takes viewers  through  the Great  Leap Forward  and  ends  in the midst  of

the Cultural  Revolution.  This  film  is very  obviously  a political  film  because  it

focuses on these  campaigns.

One night while  Fugui  is performing  a puppet  show,  he is interrupted  by

some Nationalist  soldiers  and  recruited  as a soldier. He served  for a few months

with the KMT, but one day his entire army base  is abandoned.  He  is captured  by

Communists  and  serves  in the Red Army  for a few months  by entertaining  the

soldiers with his puppet  shows. This  abandonment  by  the KMT was typical

during  this period.  The CCP had gradually  been  gaining  power  since  the

beginning  of World War  II, and  leadership  within  the KMT was weak. Having

once been  the dominant  party,  they weren’t used  to being  the hunted  instead of

the hunters,  and  therefore  became more  likely  to run away  from  confrontation

rather than  face  it.

Fugui returns  home  to find  the entire village has  transformed  into a

Communist  town;  the Communists  have defeated  the KMT.  Long’er  is about  to be

put on  trial  for being a landlord. Fugui  realizes  that  if he hadn’t  lost his property

to Long’er,  he would have been  the one put on  trial. The village  leader  that

breaks  this news  to Fugui  tells him that Long’er  burned  down  the house because

Cheng 9

he wouldn’t  turn  it over  to  the government.  He  told Fugui  that his  family’s house

burned  for so  long,  and said  the wood must have been  very good quality.  But

Fugui  immediately  turned  around  and  said  that  it wasn’t his wood,  it was

“counter-revolutionary”  wood.  People were  very careful  about what  they  said;

they didn’t want  to get on  the CCP’s bad side or ear-marked  as counter-

revolutionary.  In the early 50s,  the CCP started  a campaign  to “suppress

counterrevolutionaries”,  or  people who were  supporters  of  the KMT or had any

sympathy  for  them.14  Jung Chang describes  in Wild Swans  the execution  of a

KMT officer, Hui-ge, whom her grandmother  was  fond of and had hoped would

marry her mother. Chang’s  grandmother  went  by herself  to  the execution

ground  to collect his body  only  to be denounced  by her own sister-in-law  for

being a counterrevolutionary.15  As  a result, her grandmother  had  to attend  a

meeting where her neighbors  attempted  to help her understand  her  “faults.”

Later, Chang’s mother  also  came under  investigation  for having KMT  ties  in the

past.

The film fast  forwards  into  the 1950s, during  the beginning  of the Great

Leap Forward. One of the most memorable  markers  of  this campaign was  the

“backyard  steel”  production. Mao proclaimed  that  they would  surpass  England

and catch up to the United  States  in industrialization  within  the next 10 years.  In

order  to achieve  this, he appealed  to  the small  towns and villages  to contribute

their share  by melting  any  scrap metal  into  steel. All villages had a quota  they

had to meet.  In To Live,  the village  leader  goes to Fugui’s house  to collect his

Cheng 10

contribution  of  scrap metal. After  the start of the Great Leap Forward,  people

had to give up  their cooking wares  for  the steel-producing  cause  because  they no

longer needed  them. All of the cooking  and eating was done  for the entire  village

in the canteens.

The village  leader  even tries  to take  the pins  that hold  together  Fugui’s

puppets,  saying  that it would be enough  to make  two bullets. Fugui  pleads with

him to spare  the puppets. He  says he can use  them  to perform  revolutionary

shows  for the village  to boost morale,  and  the leader  agrees. Making  steel  seems

to occupy  everyone’s  time.  Furnaces  are  constantly  burning  to melt what  little

scrap metal  is collected  to make  sure quota  is met.

Chang was  six years  old when  the Great Leap Forward  started.  She  talks

about how everyday while  she walked  to school,  she and her classmates would

scour  the pathway  for any metal  objects  that  could be melted down. The  schools

had installed  large  vats on the giant  stoves  in the kitchen. The  stoves were

constantly  lit, melting down  all the metal  that  the children  collected.  Teachers

would take  turns  feeding  firewood  to  the stoves  and stirring  the vats until  the

metal melted down.16 The  teachers were  so busy with the vats that  there was

hardly any  time  to give  lessons. The backyard  steel  industry  even went  so far as

to have  furnaces  outside  hospitals.  Doctors  and nurses had  to constantly  feed

the furnaces,  even  in  the middle  of operations  and  through  the night. Chang

rarely saw her parents because  they had  furnaces  in  their offices  and  they had  to

make sure  the temperature  was always high  enough  to melt metal.17

Cheng 11

Tragedy  struck  during  this part of To Live. Like Jung Chang,  Fugui’s  son,

Youqing had  to go to his school  to help make  steel with his schoolmates.  Even

though he hasn’t had a good night’s  rest  in several days,  Fugui  forces him  to go,

because he doesn’t want  to look counterrevolutionary,  especially  since  the

district  leader was coming  to judge  the village’s  progress.  Youqing  falls  asleep

behind a wall and when  the district  leader  arrives, he accidentally  backs his  jeep

into the wall, knocking  it over and killing  Youqing.

In the 1960s, Fugui’s daughter,  Fengxia  has  reached  the age where  she

should be getting married.  The  village  leader  helps  the family  by introducing

them to a comrade who  also has a handicap  (Fengxia  has  been mute  since

childhood). This man has a bad  leg, but he is still able  to walk on it and “run

when he has to.” The two get married  and  Fengxia  leaves  home. During  the

Cultural  Revolution,  it became  common  practice  for marriages  to be arranged  by

“the Revolution.”  Women  would  join  the party,  thinking  that  they would be

playing a major  role, only  to be married  off  to officers who were  looking  for

“good Communist  wives.”  In the book, The Good Women of China, Xin Ran  tells

the story  of a woman who  left home  to join the Communist  Party because  she

wanted  to make a difference,  and be written  about  in history books. On the day

of this woman’s 18th  birthday,  she was approached  by  some Communist  officials

and given  a “mission,”  which  she readily  accepted.  Little did  she know, her

mission was to marry a Communist  officer.  She was written  about  in books,  but

only mentioned  as a wife.18 This happened  frequently.  Many Communist  officers

Cheng 12

had been married before  they  joined  the party, but had  to leave  their  families  to

serve  the Party. During  this  time, situations  were  unstable,  and  the officers

didn’t know  if they would  ever see their wives again,  so they would  remarry

members  of the Party, even  if their wives at home were  still alive.

Fengxia’s  situation was not as bleak.  She and her husband  grew  fond of

each other  and had a happy marriage.  Eventually,  Fengxia  became  pregnant.

When her pregnancy  came  to term,  she was able  to deliver  the baby, but  she

suffered  from excessive  bleeding  and died  from  the loss of blood. The hospital

had no doctors because  they had  all been  labeled  as  intellectuals.  During  the

Cultural  Revolution,  intellectuals  were  seen as elite and were  persecuted  and

sent to  the countryside  because  of  that. The only “doctors”  in  the hospitals were

students  in their  twenties who had  little or no medical  experience.

During  the Cultural  Revolution,  the  term, “capitalist-roader”  was  coined. A

capitalist-roader  was  anyone who held any position  of power. Mao  felt

threatened  by  these people because  they had  the power  to disagree with him if

they wanted  to.  In To Live  the village  leader was accused  of being a capitalist-

roader, but he had put  so much work  into making  sure  the idea of communism

thrived. A lot of people who had devoted  their  lives  to the Party  and worked

hard to gain their positions were  turned  on and deemed  capitalist-roaders.

Chang describes  this  as well. The deputy headmaster  of her school, Mr. Kan was

accused  of being a capitalist-roader.  Everything  he had done  for  the school was

Cheng 13

considered  “capitalist.”  Mr. Kan had been devoted  to  the Party,  so as a result he

felt he had been wronged  and he committed  suicide.19

At times To Live does  seem overly dramatic  because  it  is hard to believe

that so many  terrible  tragedies  could  happen  to one single  family. However,  the

film stays true  to the history.  It  is likely  that if the events  portrayed  in  the film

didn’t happen  to one family,  they probably  happened  to another.  Everyone  had

to produce  steel;  everyone  lived  through  the Cultural  Revolution  and  suffered

through  the effects of losing  the “intellectuals”  to  the countryside.  The  film

emphasizes Mao’s  large  campaigns,  and  the events  that affect  the majority  of the

Chinese population.  The  film  succeeds  in  sending  a message:  that  during  this

period  in China people  suffered,  and  though  they  tried  to remain optimistic,

believing  that all the  suffering  they went  through would make up  for  itself  in the

long run,  it became  hard to have faith  in the Party.

To Live and Yellow Earth are  two very different  films, both  in subject  and

in message. On employs  drama  to send  across a political message, while  the

other attempts  to use cinema as art without being  overly  concerned  with

conveying  a specific message. Yellow Earth  is not so much a political  story  but a

story of gender differences  in  traditional  Chinese  society. To Live serves  up a

dose of reality;  it makes people more  aware of what went on  in China  after  the

Communist  take  over and shows  that not everything was  the utopia  that people

had envisioned.
