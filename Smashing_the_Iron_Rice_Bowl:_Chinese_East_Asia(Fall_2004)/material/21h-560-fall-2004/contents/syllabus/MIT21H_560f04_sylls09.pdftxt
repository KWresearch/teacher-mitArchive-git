Smashing the Iron Rice Bowl: Chinese East Asia 

 
Instructor: Ian Chapman 

 
This subject examines the experiences of ordinary Chinese people as they lived through 
the tumultuous changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We look at personal 
narratives, primary sources, films and scholarship to think about how individual and 
family lives connect with the broader processes of change in modern China. In the 
readings and discussions, you should focus on how major political events have an impact 
on the characters' daily lives, and how the decisions they make cause large-scale social 
transformation. No knowledge of Chinese language or of Chinese history is necessary to 
take this subject. Students who signed up under 21F.191 will be expected to complete 
one assignment based on Chinese language sources.  

Requirements  

Class participation  (30%) 
Do the readings, come to class, join the debate. In addition to general participation, two 
students each week will be asked to lead discussion of the focus topic and readings.

I will ask you each to contribute to a weekly online discussion on the readings and related 
issues (not required in weeks of assignments or tests). This will be in the Forum section 
of the the course website. Each person should make at least one substantial and formally 
composed contribution (of, say, around three paragraphs), before the day on which a 
reading is discussed. Your posting may be an independent response to readings, or 
engage with questions raised in other students’ posts. In addition to this more formal 
response, I strongly encourage you to append comments and discussion to other people’s 
contributions.
