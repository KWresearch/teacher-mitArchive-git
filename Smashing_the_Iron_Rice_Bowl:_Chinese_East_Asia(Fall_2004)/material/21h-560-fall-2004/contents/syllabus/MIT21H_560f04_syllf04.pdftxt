This subject examines the experiences of ordinary Chinese people as they lived 
through the tumultuous changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We look at 
personal narratives, primary sources, films alongside a textbook to think about how 
individual and family lives connect with the broader processes of change in modern 
China. In the readings and discussions, you should focus on how major political events 
have an impact on the characters’ daily lives, and how the decisions they make cause 
large-scale social transformation. 
 
No knowledge of Chinese or of Chinese history is necessary to take this subject. 
Students who signed up under 21F.191 will be expected to complete one assignment 
based on Chinese language sources.
