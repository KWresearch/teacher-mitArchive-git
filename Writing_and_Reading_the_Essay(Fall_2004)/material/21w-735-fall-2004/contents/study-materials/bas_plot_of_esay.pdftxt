Basic Plots of the Essay 
 

Plot 1: The Review 
•  The review begins with the work of others and develops 
a set of ideas and narratives that depart from that 
work. 
•  Example: Woolf, “The Modern Essay” 

 
 
Plot 2: The Ramble/A Walk through the Mind 
•  The ramble begins with a bit of personal experience 
and develops a set of ideas and narratives that depart 
from that experience. 
•  Example: Chris Wright, “I, Possum”; anything by 
Montaigne. 

 
Plot 3: The Meditation 
•  The meditation begins with an abstract idea or 
metaphor and relates it to personal experience, other 
texts, and concrete objects. 
•  Example: E. B. White, “The Essayist and the Essay”. 

 
Plot 4: The List 
•  The list begins with a series of objects, stories, or 
ideas and unifies them through some persistent idea 
or pattern. 
•  Example: Sei Shonagon, “Hateful Things”.
