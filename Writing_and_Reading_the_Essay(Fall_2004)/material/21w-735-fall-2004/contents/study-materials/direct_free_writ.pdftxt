Directed Free-Writing 
Lioi/21W.735 
 
Free-writing is tool for breaking writer’s block and overcoming the internal critic/editor who 
stops you from composing by criticizing what is being written as it is being written. Pure 
free-writing consists of writing in a stream-of-consciousness mode without concern for 
subject, audience, or organization. Directed free-writing, the kind I will ask you to do most 
often, asks you to respond in stream-of-consciousness to a quotation or some other source. 
This kind of writing can easily become the seed of an essay, though we do not worry about 
its status as potential seed during the process of composition. Free writing is usually timed to 
provide a predetermined end-point for a potentially endless process. 
 
Example: 
 
“My father, as he lay dying at home of bowel cancer, used to enjoy watching Tarzan reruns 
on the children’s hour of television. Like a strong green vine, they swung him far away from 
his deathbed to a world of skinny-dipping and friendly animals and scenic beauty linked to 
the lost realities of his adolescence in Kansas City.” 
 
 
 
My free-writing (5 minutes): 
 
 If I were dying I wouldn’t watch Tarzan reruns. The problem isn’t the reruns, it’s the 
Tarzan. The tv jungle might be okay for a Kansas City adolescence, but I’m not from that 
part of Jersey. I should probably watch reruns of “Green Acres” to remind myself of all the 
city people who moved to the suburbs and didn’t know what to do with their lawns. My 
father included. Being from Newark didn’t give him a lot of experience with tractor-mowers. 
It’s a miracle that mimosa tree survived being run over so many times. Maybe that’s why 
those drunken neighbors ran into that brick mailbox he made from scratch. It was always a 
little lopsided. Maybe they watched from their windows as he mowed down that sapling over 
and over again and wanted to deliver some vengeance on the rest of the yard. That time-
capsule I put inside the mailbox as he cemented over the last hole exploded like everything 
else on impact. I remember sealing the mason jar with wax to keep out the moisture so my 
little account of our lives would survive the ages. I explained why we had named a boy-cat 
Isis and why we had bean-bag chairs in the living room and how our Labrador retriever was 
always running into doors.
