Some Logics of the Essay 

Logic 
Argumentative or 
Rhetorical 

Narrative 

Metonymic or 
Associative 

Expository 

Lyrical 

Hybridic 

Explanation
 
Argumentation is based on the elaboration of a principle 
or series of principles. It relies on structures of classical 
logic, such as the syllogism, causality, and the exclusion 
principle. The academic article is a version of this type 
limited by empirical evidence and an exclusion of the 
personal perspective. 
Narratives are stories. In an essay, the protagonist of the 
story may be a person, as in fiction, or it may be an idea. 
Philosophical essays are often structured around the idea-
protagonist. 
Metonymy (Greek for “name change”) is a figure of 
speech in which one thing is substituted for something 
closely related to it. “The pen is mightier than the sword” 
means, metonymically, that the written word is stronger 
than military action. Metonymy can be extended as the 
structure of an entire piece. 
 
 
Associative logic is related to, but looser than, metonymy. 
It can be a stream-of-consciousness structure based on 
sensory or intellectual experience. It can include gaps in 
logic. 
Exposition, as the name implies, exposes or clarifies a 
complex structure in need of explanation. The academic 
expository essay is a version of this style limited by strict 
rules of evidence. The review is a more flexible version of 
this style which can include narrative and rhetoric. 
Lyricism concentrates on the beautiful expression of 
personal emotion, as if in extended song. 
A combination of one or more of the above styles.

Sei Shonagon, the beginning of The 
Pillow Book (xerox), in which she moves 
from the beauties of spring to the holiday 
in which court ladies beat one another 
with sticks. Thus, the desire for comedic 
social violence becomes a metonym for 
the energy of springtime. 
 
Kenko, “Essays in Idleness” 
Montaigne, “On Some Verses of Virgil” 
Journals, diaries, and blogs often possess 
an associative logic among the entries.
