Assignment 3 
The Essay of Blame 
Lioi/21W.735 
 
The essay of blame is the counterpart to the essay of praise. While the essay of praise 
rises out of love, enjoyment, or affection, the essay of blame rises out of indignation, 
frustration, or some other form of anger generated as a response to offense or injustice. 
For this reason, the essay of blame often addresses political, cultural, and ethical issues. 
In its most common contemporary form, the essay of blame is compounded of the 
narrative, expository, and argumentative modes: anecdotes related to the injustice/offense 
are recounted, the i/o is explained, and an attempt is made to persuade the reader to 
oppose the problem (Orwell, Twain, Swift, Oates).  Nonetheless, other hybrid logics are 
possible, as demonstrated by Walker’s “Am I Blue?”, Woolf’s “The Death of the Moth,” 
Sei Shonagon’s “Hateful Things,” and Hazlitt’s “On the Pleasure of Hating”. In the 
Anglophone tradition, the title of an essay of blame often begins with the word “against,” 
as in “Against Nature,” a convention taken over from Roman and Greek essayism. 
 

Please write an essay of blame which addresses a political, cultural, or ethical issue. 
Consider using one of the following strategies: 
 

1.  Straightforward blame. 
2.  A combination of praise and blame. 
3.  Ironic blame. 

 
Please consider using the Writing Center early and often for this essay, which is formally 
and substantively more challenging than what you have done thus far. 
 
You may also want to meet with me at least once before the final draft is due.
