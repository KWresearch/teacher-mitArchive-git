***** Course Description *****
As the course title suggests, this class is meant to acquaint you with the
literary and rhetorical tradition of the essay, a genre which has been
described by one scholar as "the meeting ground between art and philosophy,"
and by another as "the place where the self finds a pattern in the world, and
the world finds a pattern in the self". Though the essay is part of a tradition
of prose which stretches back to antiquity, it is also a thoroughly modern and
popular form of writing, found in print media and on the web.
