Problem Set #3 

1.  Calculate  the mean  free path  for momentum  loss  (equal  to  the  characteristic velocity divided 
by  the  collision  frequency)  for: 

(a)  An  electron  at  thermal  energy  in  a  tokamak  plasma  of  equal  electron  and  ion  tempera-
tures,  T  ' 4  K eV ,  and  density,  n ' 1014cm−3 . 
(b)  Calculate the electron mean free path for collisions with protons (momentum exchange), 
λc ,  and  show  that  this mean  free path  greatly  exceeds  the Debye  length,  λc  À λD . Now 
calculate the ratio, λc/λD , as a formula (not numbers), relate it to a fundamental plasma 
parameter,  and  show  therefor  why  it  is  always  large. 
(c)  A  thermal  ion  in  the  same  plasma. 
(d)  A  thermal  electron  in  a  semiconductor  processing  plasma  of  temperature,  T  '  5  eV , 
and  density,  n ' 5 × 1012cm−3 . 
2.  Consider the collisional relaxation of	 ∼ 3.5 M eV  alpha particles produced by fusion reactions 
in  a  50 : 50 mixture D − T  plasma.  Estimate  the  relaxation  time  (for  energy  loss)  of  the  α’s 
in  a  plasma  at  density,  n ∼ 1014cm−3 .  Consider  the  collisions  with  the  3  diﬀerent  species  in 
the  plasma.  Assume,  Te  = TD  = TT  = 10 K eV . 

(a)  Which  species  is most  eﬀective  at  thermalizing  (slowing  down)  the  alpha  particles? 
(b)  Which  plasma  particles  are  preferentially  heated  by  the  α’s? 
Hint:  Start  with  α’s  at  3.5 M eV  but  then  consider  the  diﬀerent  regimes  of  α  energy  as 
they  slow  down. 

3.  A toroidal hydrogen plasma with circular cross-section has uniform temperature, Te  = 1 K eV , 
across  its  minor  radius,  a  = 30  cm. The  ma jor  radius  is  R  =  120  cm.  Calculate  the 
toroidal  electric  ﬁeld,  Eφ ,  required to drive  a current  of  4 × 105  Amperes  (in  cgs  units, 
1.2 × 1015  S tatAmperes)  the  long  way  round  the  torus,  and  hence  the  required  one-turn 
toroidal E .M .F .  (called  the  “loop  voltage").  [You may  do  this  calculation  to  lowest  order  in 
a/R,  and  adopt  a  generic  value  of  the  Coulomb  logarithm,  ln Λ = 16. 
Calculate,  ignoring  relativity,  the  minimum  parallel  energy  at  which  an  electron  becomes  a 
runaway  if  the  density  of  this  plasma  is  1013cm−3 .  (You  may  use  electron-ion  collisions  for 
this  estimate).  Does  this  energy  justify  your  ignoring  relativistic  eﬀects? 

4.	 Derivation  of  Fluid  Equations  from  Moments  of  the  Boltzmann  Equation.  .  .
