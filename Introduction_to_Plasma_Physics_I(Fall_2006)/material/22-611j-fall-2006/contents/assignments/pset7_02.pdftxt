Problem Set #7 

1.  Calculate  the  potential  ﬁeld  due  to  a  stationary  test  charge  inserted  (at,  x  = 0, and  time, 
t  = 0)  in  a  collisionless  plasma  initially  in  thermal  equilibrium.  You  may  assume  that  the 
test  charge  is  suﬃciently  small  that  the  linear  response  of  the  plasma  is  accurate,  and  you 
may  also  neglect  any  ion motion. 
First  show  that  the  Fourier-Laplace  transform  of  the  induced  potential  is  given  by, 

φkω  =

ST  (k, ω) 
k2 (cid:18) (k, ω) 

+ 

S0 (k, ω)
k2 (cid:18) (k, ω) 

where,  ST  (k, ω),  is  the  test  charge  source, 

ST  (k, ω) = 

4πiqT
ω 

and,  S0 (k, ω),  is  the  initial  value  source.  Use  the  dielectric  response  function,  (cid:18) (k, ω), from 
lecture,  or  the  expression,

Now  invert  the  transforms  to  ﬁnd  the  asymptotic,  t → ∞,  response,  φe (x, t → ∞). Explain 
why  the  initial  value  term  doesn’t  contribute  and  why  the  asymptotic  limit  for,  φe, would  be 
appropriate  for most  applications. 
Show  that  the  same  result  obtains  if  the  electron  density  ﬂuctuation  is  calculated  from  the 
thermal  equilibrium  response,

Te 
This  is  the  so-called  Adiabatic  Response  that  we  use  previously  to  derive  the  Debye  cloud. 
Although  collisions  and  thermal  equilibrium  were  invoked  in  this  prior  derivation,  you  see 
now  that  the  same  shield  cloud  results  in  a  pure,  Vlasov,  collisionless  plasma. 
Describe  in  words  what  this  solution  represents  in  terms  of  physics.

with  the  orderings,  nb  ¿  np ,  ub  À  ve ,  ve  ∼  vb .  You  may  assume  high  frequency  modes  and 
neglect  ion  motion.  Make  a  plot  of  this  distribution  function  and  show  where  you  expect 
unstable  waves  to  occur.  What  are  the  approximate  ranges  in  frequency  and  wavenumber 
over  which  waves  are  unstable?  Calculate,  for  the  fastest  growing  mode,  the  frequency, 
wavenumber  and  growth  rate.  You  can  use  the  orderings  given  above  and  only  need  to 
express  your  answers  to  leading  order  in  any  small  parameters.

3.	 Electrical  Current  Driven  Instability :  Consider  a  quasi-neutral  electron-proton  plasma  in 
which  an  equilibrium  current  is  ﬂowing.  This may  be  described  by  a Maxwellian  ion  distrib-
ution  at  rest,

and  electrons  on  the  same  scale,  look  in  the  region,  vi  < ωr /k  ¿  ve , and  show  where  you 
expect  unstable  waves  might  occur.  Write  an  expression  for  the  damping/growth  factor, 
γ /ωr ,  including  both  electron  and  ion  contributions.  Show  that  the  condition,  Te  À  Ti , is 
generally  required  for  instability,  and  determine  the  growth  rate  in  this  limit.  What  range  of 
real  frequencies  and  wavenumbers  do  you  expect  to  ﬁnd?
