v) the flux crossing a planar surface in one direction. 

 
2. In class we worked out the potential associated with a sheet of charge immersed in a plasma with 
eT

electron temperature 
and ion temperature 
 and obtained the result

Poisson’s equation could be well represented by the first two terms in a Taylor series. The purpose of

position, i.e., where the electron sphere would coincide with that of the ions. Find the frequency at 
which the electron sphere oscillates. (Note: one particular form of a nearly spherical plasma occurs 
naturally and is known is known as “ball lightning”.) 
 
4. Consider the parameters of the plasmas listed in the table below, taken from notes for this subject 
prepared by Prof. A. Bers. Complete the table by calculating the Debye length  Dλ , the plasma

parameter 
and the plasma frequency 
. Which plasmas are strongly coupled? Which need a
