3)  A Z-pinch is a cylindrically symmetric plasma column with current in the z direction 
only.  Consider a static ideal MHD Z-pinch  equilibrium with 

where cl  is a constant. 

(a)Calculate Be(r) and p(r).  Express your answers in terms of I, the total current.  Sketch 

the fields and the currents. 
(b) (Extra credit) Since J(r) vanishes for large r the Z pinch is apparently confined by its 
own current.  Doesn't  this violate the virial theorem(a plasma can not be confined by  its 

own currents)?  Explain.
