Problem Set #2 

1.  Field  Line  Topology  Paradox 
Consider  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  of  a  permanent  “C”  magnet,  whose  ﬁeld  threads  an  Alu-
minum  torus  as  shown  in  the  drawing  below.  The  torus  is  then  cooled  to  1  oK  and 
becomes a superconductor.  The problem is to determine what happens to the magnetic 
ﬁeld  as  the  torus  is  pulled  away  a  large  distance  to  the  right. 

There are two arguments one can make that lead to very diﬀerent pictures for the mag-
netic  lines.  First,  following  from  the  property  that magnetic  ﬂux  cannot  pass  through 
a perfect conductor,  one might conclude  that  the  lines get  stretched  to  the  right  indef-
initely  and  arrive  at  the  picture  below.

Second,  one  could  observe  that  as  the  torus  is  pulled  away  a  large  distance  the  ﬁeld 
threading  it  will  be  determined  predominantly  by  the  current  that  has  been  induced 
in  the  torus.  Since  the ﬂux  through  the  torus must be held  constant  this  current must 
approach  a  constant at  large distances,  and will  generate a dipole ﬁeld.  Then  the ﬁeld 
between  the  poles  of  the  magnet  will  be  perturbed  only  slightly  and  we  arrive  at  the 
following  picture. 

Which picture is correct?  If you endorse case 1 you must explain how the large currents 
in  the  torus  required  to  modify  the  permanent  magnet  ﬁeld,  from  such  a,  distance 
are  produced.  If  you  endorse  case  2  you  must  explain  how  the  lines  that  initially 
threaded  inside  torus  succeeded  in  getting  outside  it  without  breaking,  forming  ends, 
and  violating 5 · B = 0.

2.	 Polarization  Drift 
Since the E × B drift is perpendicular to the electric ﬁeld, E⊥ , a particle sub ject to this 
drift cannot change its energy.  However,  if the electric ﬁeld changes slowly in time, the 
energy associated with the drift motion,  1
2 mvE , must change.  Show that an additional 
2
drift must be present  if  the work done by the electric ﬁeld on the particle  is  to account 
for  the  energy  change,  and  that  for  small  ∂ ln E /∂ t  the  drift  is  given  by,

3.	 Fermi  Acceleration  of  Cosmic  Rays 
A  cosmic  ray proton  is  trapped between  two moving mirrors with mirror  ratio, R = 5, 
and  initially  has  energy  1 K eV  and,  v⊥  = vk ,  at  the midplane.  The mirrors  are  sepa-
rated by a distance L and move toward  the midplane with a velocity vM  = 10 km/sec. 

(a)  Using  the  loss  cone  formula  and  the  invariance  of  the  magnetic  moment,  µ,  ﬁnd 
the  energy  to  which  the  proton  will  be  accelerated  before  it  escapes. 
(b)  How  long  will  it  take  to  reach  that  energy?

Notes:

i.  Treat  the mirrors  as  ﬂat  pistons  and  assume  the  time  spent  bouncing  is  neg-
ligible compared to the time spent traversing the stationary ﬁeld between the 
mirrors. 
ii.  You may  assume  that  the distance, L,  changes negligably during  the  acceler-
ation. 
iii.  Compute  the	 number  of  bounces  and  time  (to  within  a  factor  of  two)  to 
traverse  L  that many  times. 

4.	 Numbers  for  Drifts 
Evaluate  the  magnitude  of  the,  E × B ,  grad-B,  and  curvature  drifts  for  the  ions  in  a 
typical  tokamak  plasma.  Write  the  dimensionless  ratio  of  these  quantities  relative  to 
the  ion  thermal  velocity.  Estimate  quantities  from  the  outer midplane  of  the  tokamak 
taking  parameters  from  the MIT Alcator  C-mod  experiment: 
.66 m 
R  = 
a  = 
.21 m 
B  ∼  BT  = 4.5 T 
n  = 4 × 1014 cm −3 
T  = 2 K eV 
Er  = 1 K V /cm 
You may use the low beta assumption in computing magnetic ﬁeld gradients. Note that 
the  electric ﬁeld here  is  radial.  Apologia:  The units  are mixed  as  is  typical  in practise, 
so you will have to unravel the units.  .  . some helpful conversions are:  1S tatV olt (cgs) 
= 300  V olts  (si),  1  T esla  (si)  =  10, 000  Gauss  (cgs).  Recall  that  in  cgs  units  the 
electric  and magnetic  ﬁelds  have  the  same  dimensions,  so  that,  1S tatV olt/cm  = 1.
