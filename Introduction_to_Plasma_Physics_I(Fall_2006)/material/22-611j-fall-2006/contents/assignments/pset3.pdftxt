shown, the shaded sphere has infinite mass and is therefore stationary during the collision.  
 
a) Find the final velocity of the incident sphere, 
initial velocity Vo. 
 
b) Assume now that in the collision the incident sphere has mass m1 while the initially stationary 
sphere has mass m2. What will be the final velocity of the incident sphere? 
 
0vr is passing through a “sea” of spheres

Problem 2.  
  
The problem here is to calculate how a high energy beam of ions slows down by colliding with the

electrons and ions in a plasma.  Consider a mono-energetic beam of ions with mass

Here, 
beν and 
biν  are the  90 ° beam-electron and beam-ion momentum loss collision frequencies 
respectively.  When the beam has lost all of its directed velocity, all of its initial kinetic energy has 
been transferred to the plasma.  
  
The value of 
biν , (with all the correct coefficients) follows from our analysis in class and is given by

Here we have assumed that the thermal velocity of the plasma ions is much less than the beam 
velocity.  Thus, the relative velocity between beam ions and plasma ions is accurately approximated

A similar relationship exists for 
beν  except that in this case, because of the small electron mass, the 
electron thermal velocity is much greater than the beam velocity.  Therefore, the average relative 
velocity between electrons and beam ions is approximately equal to the electron thermal velocity:
