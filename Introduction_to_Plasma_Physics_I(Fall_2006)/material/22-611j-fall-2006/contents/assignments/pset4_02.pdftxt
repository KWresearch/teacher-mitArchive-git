1) Derive the plasma adiabatic equation of state given in class via the following path: 
(a) Take the energy moment of the kinetic equation and show that the result is:

Where V is the fluid velocity, T the temperature, n the density, P the pressure, m the 
mass, q the charge, and E the electric field. 
(b) Reduce the above to the standard hydrodynamic form of the equation advancing 
temperature in time.  The key is to take V(dot)(momentum equation) to obtain a separate 
equation for δV2 /δt which then can be subtracted from the above equation and 
manipulated, giving the adiabatic equation of state:

2) The derivation of the MHD equations form the ion and electron fluid equations were 
given in class. Review this derivation and answer the following question adapted from 
the Fall 2001 NE qualifying exam:

Maxwell’s equations, can be written:

(a)  Which of these terms are omitted in the ideal MHD description of a plasma? 
(b)  Discuss the circumstances that would justify omitting those terms for the plasma 
in a typical tokamak plasma; i.e. numerically show that these terms are small.

3) A Z-pinch is a cylindrically symmetric plasma column with current in the z direction 
only.  Consider a static ideal MHD Z-pinch equilibrium with

where c1 is a constant. 
(a)Calculate Bθ(r) and p(r).  Express your answers in terms of I, the total current.  Sketch 
the fields and the currents. 
(b) (Extra credit) Since J(r) vanishes for large r the Z pinch is apparently confined by its 
own current.  Doesn’t this violate the virial theorem(a plasma can not be confined by its 
own currents)?  Explain.
