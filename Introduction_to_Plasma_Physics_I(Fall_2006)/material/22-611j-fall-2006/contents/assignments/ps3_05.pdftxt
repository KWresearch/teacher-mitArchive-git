Problem 1. 
 
Consider a collision between an ion or electron and a neutral atom. Assume that the atom is massive 
enough so that its motion during the interaction is negligible. 
 
When the charged particle approaches the atom, its electric field  Er induces a dipole moment in the 
atom which we will take to have the form 
 

r
r α−=
p
E
 
where αis a constant. The dipole moment in turn creates a dipole electric field

where  rr is the radius vector from the center of our coordinate system, located at the atom.  
 
i) The incident charged particle has impact parameter b and initial velocity v0. Using the same 
coordinate system as used in our treatment of charged particle collisions, determine the appropriate 
expressions for conservation of angular momentum and energy for the incident particle. 
 
ii) Setup an integral expression for the deflection angle of the particle.  
 
iii) Evaluate the expression found in ii) in terms of an elliptic integral. Determine the deflection in the 
limit of weak interaction, i.e., large impact parameter, and compare with the corresponding result for 
the Coulomb interaction.
