Problem 1. 

Using your favorite plotting software (Matlab, IDL, etc.) prepare a graph accurately depicting regions 
of propa  ation and cutoff in the log n2 - lo  (w/oCi) plane for two sets of Alcator C-Mod parameters: a) 
Po 
2% 
= 5.5 T and b) n,  = 5x10  m"  , B = 5.5 T.  In both cases assume that the ions are 
ne=2x10  m-3, B 
deuterium.  In the plots, set the abscissa range to -2 < l o g ( ~ ~ / w ~ i )  < 4 and the ordinate range to -2 < log 
n 2 < 3 .  

Problem 2. 

A plane wave is incident on a plasma slab, as indicated schematically in the figure below. 

The plasma density is uniform  an the y-  and z-directions, but varies in the x-direction and is given by 

the gradient scale length, is long compared to the wavelength. i.e.,  k t  >> 1 , so that the local 
where!, 
dispersion relation can be used in solving this problem. There is a magnetic field in the z-direction, 
= iB, where Bo is constant. The parameters are such that 

Throughout this problem, consider only the electron response to the wave field. 
a) On the left graph below, indicate the region(s) of propagation up to  x / ! = 4 for the ordinary mode. 

b)  On the right graph below, indicate the region(s) of propagation up to x / ! = 4  for the extraordinary 
mode. 

c) What is the maximum depth of propagation of the extraordinary mode for frequencies less than the 
electron cyclotron frequency?
