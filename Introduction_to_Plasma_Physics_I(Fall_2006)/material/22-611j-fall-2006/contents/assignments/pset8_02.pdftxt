Prove  the  conservation  laws  for  the  collision  operator: 
R 
0 =R  d3vC (f , f ) 
0 =R  d3vmvC (f , f ) 
1 mv2C (f , f ) 
0 =  d3v 2
2.	 Two  Species  Col lisions :  Show  that  the  conservation  laws  also  hold  for  collision  between  two 
species,  but  that  the  sum  over  species  is  now  required: 
R 
0 =  d3vCαβ (fα , fβ ) 
R 
0 =  d3v [mαvCαβ (fα , fβ ) + mβ vCβα (fβ , fα )]

Note  that  particle’s  are  conserved  by  each  collision  operator, while momentum  and  energy  is 
only  conserved  as  a  species  sum.  Make  a  statement  of  the  physical meaning  of  the  two  sepa-
rate  conservation  laws  for  each  of  momentum  and  energy.  Recall  that  the  collision  operator 
between  species,  α,  and,  β , is given  by,
