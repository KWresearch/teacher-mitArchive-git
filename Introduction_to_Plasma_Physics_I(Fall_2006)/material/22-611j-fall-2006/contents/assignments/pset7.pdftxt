Problem 1. 
 
Prove that in a collision between an ion and electron in a uniform magnetic field, the displacements of 
the two guiding centers are equal. (This assertion is made on the bottom of page 6 of the lecture 15 
notes and the statement can be straightforwardly proved using the approach developed in pp 4-6.) 
 
 
Problem 2. 
 
The purpose of this problem is to estimate the thermal diffusivity of a plasma perpendicular to a 
confining magnetic field.  
 
As a first step we need to describe the dynamics of a two-body collision event. Although there is a 
magnetic field present, its effect during the collision will be ignored since we will make the reasonable 
assumption that the Larmor radius is much greater than the Debye length.

a) Consider the collision event indicated in the above figure. Define the post-collision angle that the 
1vr
2vr , the 
velocity vector of particle 1 makes with the x-axis to be θ. Determine expressions for 
and 
'
'
post collision velocities of the two particles (in the lab frame). 
 
b) Considering now the Larmor motion of the particles, show that the guiding centers pre- and post- 
collision are given by

For concreteness assume that the B-field is in the –z direction and the charges and cyclotron 
frequencies defined above are positive. Also assume that the displacements during the collision event 
are small compared to the Larmor radii.

where incE and 
refE are the complex amplitudes of the electric field of the incident and reflected wave. 
For what frequencies is the incident power totally reflected? Evaluate numerically for a density of 
1012/m3 , typical of the maximum density in the ionosphere.  
 
Note: For those not familiar with this type of problem, assume an incident, transmitted and reflected 
wave, and match the tangential components of E and H across the slab interface. Solve for the reflected 
electric field amplitude in terms of the amplitude of the incident wave. 

Problem 3 (Continued) 
 
When an EM wave is radiated vertically toward the ionosphere, it propagates through a region of 
increasing plasma density (and dielectric constant). If the frequency matches the local plasma 
frequency at some point, it will be reflected. This part of the problem develops the treatment of the 
propagation of such a wave. 
 
b) Consider a transverse EM wave propagating vertically through the ionosphere. Take the vertical 
direction to coincide with the z axis and assume that the wave is polarized in the x-direction so that
