A 10 turn coil is wound around a plasma column (an axi-symmetric screw pinch with 
and is connected to an ideal integrator. The output voltage from the integrator is given by 

) 

where 
is the voltage across the coil terminals. The
is the time constant of the integrator and 
plasma was initiated sometime in the past and the output voltage is steady at  Volts. The total plasma 
current is 1 MA and the external field is 1 T. 
a) Calculate the total plasma energy per meter stored in the plasma column, assuming the plasma is a)
diamagnetic and b) paramagnetic. Take  = 0.1 s and further assume that the perturbation in the axial
field due to the plasma is small compared to the external field. 
b) If the density is constant across the plasma cross-section and equal to 1020  m-3, and the cross-
sectional area of the column is 0.25 m2, what is the area-averaged plasma temperature in the two cases 
in part a)?
