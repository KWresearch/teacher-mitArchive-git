Problem 1. 
 
The purpose of this problem is to estimate the thermal diffusivity of a plasma perpendicular to a 
confining magnetic field.  
 
As a first step we need to describe the dynamics of a two-body collision event. Although there is a 
magnetic field present, its effect during the collision will be ignored since we will make the reasonable 
assumption that the Larmor radius is much greater than the Debye length.

a) Consider the collision event indicated in the above figure. Define the post-collision angle that the 
2vr , the 
1vr
velocity vector of particle 1 makes with the x-axis to be θ. Determine expressions for 
and 
'
'
post collision velocities of the two particles (in the lab frame). 
 
b) Considering now the Larmor motion of the particles, show that the guiding centers pre- and post- 
collision are given by

For concreteness assume that the B-field is in the –z direction and the charges and cyclotron 
frequencies defined above are positive. Also assume that the displacements during the collision event 
are small compared to the Larmor radii.

Note: For those not familiar with this type of problem, assume a transmitted and reflected wave, and 
match the tangential components of E and H across the slab interface. Solve for the reflected electric 
field amplitude. 
 
b) Repeat part a) for the case where the wave vector makes an angle θ with respect to the normal to the 
slab as indicated in the figure on the right. In the numerical calculation assume that the angle of 
incidence is 45°. Note that the direction of the electric field is normal to the “plane of incidence” 
defined by the wave vector and the normal to the slab.
