1 .  The  three-dimensional  Maxwellian velocity distribution  function is 
(v, .\/IT)'  exp($  j 
n 
f", (3 = 
2kT  
where n  is the particle density and  v,!  = - . Determine the following: 
m 

i)  the average of each velocity component, e.g., (v,) ; 
ii) the average speed  ( v )  ; 
iii) the rms speed  J v 2 )  ; 
iv) the average kinetic energy in any one direction,  e.g., 

v) the flux crossing a planar  surface in one direction. 

2. Consider the parameters  of  the plasmas  listed  in the table given on the last page,  taken from notes 
for this  subject prepared by A. Bers. Complete the table by calculating the Debye length  4 ,  the 
plasma parameter  A = nAL and the plasma  frequency  fp  . Which plasmas are strongly coupled? Wh ich  
need a quantum mechanical  treatment? 

3 .  In  class we worked out the potential  associated with a sheet of charge immersed in a plasma with 
electron temperature  T ,  and ion  temperature 
and obtained  the result 

where  o is  the charge density, x is  the coordinate perpendicular  to  the charge sheet and  /2, is the 

Debye length. A key assumption in  our analysis was  e lp l  - << 1  so  that  the exponentials  appearing in  
k c , ;  
Poisson's equation could be  well represented by the first two terms  in a Taylor series. The purpose of 
this problem  is  to remove this restriction for a plasma  in which  = T  = T .  

i) Use the quadrature method  described  in class to  solve Poisson's  equation (without approximations) 
do 
for  -and 
dx 

then integrate to get  x ( p )  in terms of   V  , the potential  of  the charge sheet. 

Problem  3 (Continued) 

ii) What  is  V in terms of  o ? 

eV 
Sketch  xs  vs. - . 
iii) Let  xs be the distance from the sheet where the potential has  fallen to  ~ e - ~ .  
kT 

How does it compare with  the result  of the calculation for the c a s e M  << 1 ? 
kTe,i 

4. A  long cylinder of  plasma with  circular  cross-section and radius  a consists of  cold 
(Te  =  = 0 )  electrons and singly charged  ions with uniform density,  ne = ni = n o .  The cylinder of  
electrons is perturbed a distance 
in a direction perpendicular to its axis. 

i )   Find  the frequency at which  the electron cylinder oscillates assuming that  the ions are immobile. 
(Hint: Assume 6 << a and that  the perturbation  produces a surface charge that creates a 2-D dipolar 
field.) 

ii) Repeat  i) assuming that the ion mass  is M.
