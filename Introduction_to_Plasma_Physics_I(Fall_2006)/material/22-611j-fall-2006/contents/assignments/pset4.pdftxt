A beam of ions with energy E  is passing through a plasma of density 
 The velocity of the 
=

i
e
beam 
0ν  is large compared to the thermal velocities of the electrons and ions, so the latters’ motion can 
be neglected.  
 
i) Calculate the effective frequency of transverse diffusion of the beam  ⊥ν defined as

Express your answer in terms of a numerical constant, the energy of the beam in eV, the plasma 
density, the Coulomb logarithm and the mass and charge of the beam and plasma ions relative to the 
mass and charge of a proton. (Ignore terms of order 
.) 
Λln/1
 
ii) Compare your answer with the result given in the NRL formulary, pp 31-32 (See link under 
Resources on Course Home Page.) 
 
Problem 2. 
 
In this problem, we will use the plasma fluid equations to describe electrostatic waves that can exist in 
a one-dimensional electron beam. The relevant equations are: 
 
Conservation of particles/mass/charge:  
 

Conservation of momentum:

Note that this term is the source of the magnetic field in Ampère’s law. Why can the magnetic field be 
ignored in analyzing the beam wave motion? 
 
Problem 3.  
 
 Perhaps 
A cold homogeneous plasma supports oscillations at the plasma frequency 
.pωω=
/2 λπ=k
.
surprisingly, the oscillation occurs at the same frequency regardless of the wavenumber 
However, when pressure is included in the equations describing a plasma oscillation, the situation 
changes and the frequency of oscillation depends on k. In this problem you are asked to find the 
k−ω relationship for a plasma in which pressure plays a role.
