rrV and integrating from r = 0 to r = a (where Vr is 
d) By multiplying the result obtained in part c) by 
assumed to vanish), show that the plasma will be unstable if 
  
 

for 0 < r < a. 
 
Interpreting the above condition in terms of particle drifts leads to an apparent paradox since this 
requires the net particle drift (grad B plus curvature) to be in the –z direction, which would be 
stabilizing according to the picture developed in class. The paradox can be resolved by calculating the 
energy involved in the perturbation. One can show that this is proportional to

It is interesting to note that both of these terms arise from field line curvature; thus arguments based 
only on “bad” curvature are incomplete and one must consider stabilizing as well as destabilizing 
effects of curvature to properly examine stability of MHD equilibria. (Nevertheless, a region of bad 
curvature is necessary for MHD instability.)
