A beam of ions with energy E  is passing through a plasma of density 
 The velocity of the

e
beam 
0ν  is large compared to the thermal velocities of the electrons and ions, so the latters’ motion can 
be neglected.

Express your answer in terms of a numerical constant, the energy of the beam in eV, the plasma 
density, the Coulomb logarithm and the mass and charge of the beam and plasma ions relative to the 
mass and charge of a proton. (Ignore terms of order 
.) 
Λln/1
 
ii) Compare your answer with the result given in the NRL formulary. 
 
Problem 2. 
 
In this problem, we will use the plasma fluid equations to describe electrostatic waves that can exist in 
a one-dimensional electron beam. The relevant equations are: 
 
Conservation of particles/mass/charge:  
 

Conservation of momentum:
