3.	 Maxwel lian  Distribution  from  Entropy  Maximization.  Show  that  the  Maxwellian  is  what 
results  from  achieving maximum  entropy  using  the  non-equilibrium  formula, 
Z 
S  = − 
Note  that  we  are  assuming  a  homogeneous  system,  so  that  you  only  need  determine  the 
velocity  dependence  of  the  distribution,  f .  You  need  to  perform  a  functional  variation  of, 
S ,  with  respect  to  variations  in  the  distribution,  f  →  f  + δf , (i.e.  δS  =  δf  · ∂S/∂f ),  while 
maintaining  the  constraints  of  constant  particle  number  and  constant  energy,

You  then  compute  the  distribution,  f ,  such  that,  δS  = 0,  for  all,  δf .  This  can  be  done  by 
the method  of  Lagrange multipliers,  using  the  variational  form, 

d3vf ln f 

=

N  = 

d3vf 

E  = 

G = S + αN + βE 

and  calculating  the  multipliers,  α, and,  β ,  from  the  constraints  once  the  form  of  the  distrib-
ution,  f , is known. 

4.	 Vlasov  Mush  Transformation :  Discreteness  can  be  eliminated  by  sub-dividing  particles  in-
deﬁnately  while  preserving  the  charge  and  mass.  This  sub-division  can  be  described  by  the 
tranformation, 

q 
q  → 
N 
m 
m  → 
N 
n  →  N n 
1 

where, N ,  is the number of subdivisions, and, q , m, and, n, are particle charge, mass and den-
sity.  Show that the Vlasov equation is  invariant under this subdivision, while the discreteness 
parameter, 

1 
nλ3 
D 

is  not.  Furthermore  show  that,

lim 
N→∞  nλ3 
D 
Thereby  proving  that  the  Vlasov  equation  becomes  exact  in  the  limit  of  zero  discreteness.

5.  Prove  the  Final  Value  Theorem  for  Laplace  Transforms.  Recall  our  convention  for  the  trans-
form  and  its  inverse, 
Z 
∞ 
dteiωt g (t) 
0  Z 
1 
2π  L 
where,  L,  denotes  the  Laplace  inversion  contour  residing  above  all  singularities  of,  gω . (In 
other  words,  gω , is analytic for,  Im ω > L).  The  Final  Value  Theorem  states, 

dωe−iωt gω

g (t) = 

gω  = 

lim  g (t) =  lim (−iωgω ) 
t→∞ 
ω→0 
This  theorem only applies  to  stable  systems,  of  course.  Elaborate on  the meaning of  “stable” 
as  applied  to  this  system,  and  indicate  any  changes  in  the  theorem  needed  to  account  for 
systems  that  oscillate  indeﬁnitely  without  decay.
