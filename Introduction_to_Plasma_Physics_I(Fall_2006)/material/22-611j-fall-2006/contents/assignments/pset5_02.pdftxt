Problem Set #5 

1.  Polarization  Drift  “Conductivity”: 
In  class  we  derived  the  dispersion  relations  for  the  Alfven  wave  from  ideal  MHD.  Show  that 
the  same wave results  from  a simple model  of  plasma  response  where  the  perpendicular 
current  results  from  the  ion  polarization  drift  (including  electrons  doesn’t  change  the  answer 
to  leading  order  in  the  mass  ratio).  To  be  more  mathematical,  show  that  the  conductivity 
resulting  from  the  ion  polarization  drift  response,  for  appropriately  oriented  magnetic  and 
electric  wave  perturbations,  is, 

ωρc2 
σ = −i 
I 
B 2 
0 
where,  I,  is  the  identity  tensor.  This  result  seems  to  imply  that  MHD  contains  polarization 
drift  eﬀects.  How  can  you  reconcile  this  with  the  ideal  MHD  Ohm’s  law  which  implies  that 
the  ﬂuid  velocity  is  equal  to  the,  E × B,  drift  (and  nothing  else!)? 
2.  Wave  Packets  and  Group  Velocity: 
Show  that  a  Gaussian  envelop  wave  packet, 
A(x) = Re £ 
exp(ik0x) exp(−x 2/2σ2 )¤
can  be  written  as  a  Gaussian  superpostion  of  plane  waves,

σ2 (k − k0 )2 
σ 
A(x) = Re  √ 
dk exp(ikx) exp(− 
)

2π  −∞ 
You  can  do  this  by  completing  the  square  in  the  exponent  to  yield  a  simple  integral  over  a 
Gaussian,  which,  for  ﬁxed,  x,  can  be  evaluated  using, 
√ 
Z  +∞

If  now  the  individual waves, ∼ exp(ikx)  evolve  in  time  according  to, ∼ exp(−iω(k)), one  can 
write  the  complete  space-time  wave  packet  at, 
Z

σ2 (k − k0 )2 
σ 
A(x, t) = Re  √ 
dk exp(ikx − iω(k)t) exp(−

Make  a drawing  of  the wavepacket,  assuming,  k0  À 1/σ .  For  a narrow wave packet,  i.e.  such 
that,  σd ln ω(k)/dk ¿ 1,  the  frequency  can  be  approximated  by, 
∂ω 
(k − k0 ) + . . . 
ω(k) ' ω(k0 ) + 
∂k |k=k0

= 

Use  this  approximation  for  the  frequency  to  show  that  that  wave  packet  envelope  moves 
without  distortion  at  the  group  velocity, 

vg  = 

∂ω 
∂k |k=k0 

Extra  Credit:  Show  that  higher  order  terms, 

∂ 2ω 
2
∼ 
(k − k0 )
∂k2 
|k=k0 
contribute  to  dispersion  or  spreading  of  the  wave  packet  and  that  therefor  if, 

∂ 2ω 
∂ k2 
|k=k0 
as  is  the  case  for  light  waves  in  vacuum,  for  example,  then  wave  packets  propagate  without 
dispersion.

3.  Ion  Acoustic Waves: 
Derive  the  dispersion  relation  for  low  frequency  waves  in  an  unmagnetized  plasma  using  a 
simple model  of  the  plasma  response  wherein: 

(a)  The  electrons  behave  adiabatically, 

eφe
nee  ' n 
Te 
(b)  The  ions  behave  like  free  particles  responding  to  the  electric  ﬁeld 
(c)  The  overall  response  is  quasi-neutral,  i.e. 
nee  ' nei 
Show  that  such  waves  obey  a  dispersion  relation, 
ω2  = k2 2 cIA 
p
where,  cIA  ≡  Te/mi ,  is  the  ion  acoustic  speed  (sometimes  called  ion  sound  speed).
