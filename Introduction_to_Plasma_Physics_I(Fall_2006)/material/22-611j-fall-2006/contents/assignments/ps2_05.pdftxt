Two circular coils are shown in cross section in the above figure. Each coil has radius a and carries a 
current I (in the same direction). The radius a is << the separation d. A particle with Larmor radius rL 
and energy W is mirror trapped on the axis of the coil system, in the region midway between the coils. 
The axial extent of the particle’s motion is << d.

i) Calculate the particle’s period of oscillation of its axial motion.  Assume that the dipole 
component of the field from each coil is sufficient to determine the field felt by the particle as it 
undergoes its oscillatory motion. Hint: The on-axis dipole component of the field from a

Problem 2. 
 
The earth’s dipole magnetic field is given by 
 

sin2
 
where Re is the radius of the earth, approximately 6400 km. Here θ is the latitude and r is the distance 
from the earth’s center. The actual field in the vicinity of the earth is more complicated due to

interaction with the interplanetary magnetic field and solar wind, but this complication will be ignored 
for the purpose of this problem.  
 

i) The magnetic field lines are found by solving the differential equation 

. Carry out the 

solution to this ODE to find the equation of the field lines in the form 
 
ii) Let BBe be the value of B on the equator (θ = 0) at some r. Determine B in terms of BeB  and  θ, 
where B is the magnitude of  Br  that one would measure as one followed a field line from the 
equator. 
 
iii) A particle is injected into the earth’s field at some radius R0 at the equator. The particle has

reflected. Assume 
refθ is small enough that small argument expansions to lowest non-zero order in 
θ can be used for all trigonometric terms. 
 
iv) Using the particle’s drift velocity at the equator as characteristic of the particle’s drift velocity 
as it undergoes oscillation in latitude, estimate the time required for the particle to circle the earth. 
Evaluate numerically for a proton with W0 = 1 Mev injected at r =2Re. Is rL small enough for our 
derivation of the
and curvature drifts to be valid?

Such field configurations occur both in laboratory as well as in terrestrial and astrophysical plasmas. 
 

i) Consider first a particle whose guiding center is located at x = 0, y = a/2 at t = 0. Describe its 
motion assuming rL << a. What constraint does this condition imply for the particle’s 
? ⊥W
 
ii) Consider now a particle whose position is located at x = 0, y = 0 with velocity vy = V, vx = 0, 
all at t=0. Derive the differential equations describing its motion. 
 
iii) By solving these equations, determine the maximum extent of the particle’s orbit in the y-
direction. Assume that the parameters are such that the particle does not reach the region of 
uniform field. What condition assures that this will be a valid assumption?
