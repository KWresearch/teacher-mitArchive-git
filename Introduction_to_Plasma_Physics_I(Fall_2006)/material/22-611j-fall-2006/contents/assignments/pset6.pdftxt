Problem 1. 
 
The analogy between Alfvén waves and waves on a stretched string is often made. In the latter case the 
Tk=

ρ
the string (mass per unit length.) 
 
a) Making the analogy between a circular tube of flux and the string, what would be the analogous ω-k 
relation for Alfvén waves? 
 
b) The obvious answer from part a) differs from the Alfvén speed by a factor of  2 . This difference is 
the result of ignoring the force on the flux tube due to the side pressure of the  Br field. Assume the flux

tube has a perturbation proportional to 
. Calculate the restoring force density acting on the 
side of the tube and show, by adding it to the tensile force, the correct Alfvén speed is found.

As expected, the resistivity leads to damping of the Alfvén wave, as you are asked to show in this

Interpreting the above condition in terms of particle drifts leads to an apparent paradox since this 
requires the net particle drift (grad B plus curvature) to be in the –z direction, which would be 
stabilizing according to the picture developed in class. The paradox can be resolved by calculating the 
energy involved in the perturbation. One can show that this is proportional to

It is interesting to note that both of these terms arise from field line curvature; thus arguments based 
only on “bad” curvature are incomplete and one must consider stabilizing as well as destabilizing 
effects of curvature to properly examine stability of MHD equilibria. (Nevertheless, a region of bad 
curvature is necessary for MHD instability.)
