Fluid  Description  of  Plasma


The  single  particle  approach  gets  to  be  horribly  complicated,  as  we  have  seen.

Basically we need a more statistical approach because we can’t follow each particle separately.

If  the  details  of  the  distribution  function  in  velocity  space  are  important  we  have  to  stay

with  the  Boltzmann  equation.  It  is  a  kind  of  particle  conservation  equation. 


4.1  Particle  Conservation  (In  3­d  Space) 

Figure  4.1:  Elementary  volume  for  particle  conservation 

Number  of  particles  in  box  ΔxΔyΔz  is  the  volume,  ΔV  = ΔxΔyΔz ,  times  the  density  n. 
Rate  of  change  of  number  is  is  equal  to  the  number  ﬂowing  across  the  boundary  per  unit 
time,  the  ﬂux.  (In  absence  of  sources.)

Take  particle  velocity  to  be  v(r)  [no  random  velocity,  only  ﬂow]  and  origin  at  the  center  of 
the  box  refer  to  ﬂux  density  as  nv = J.

The  expression:  ‘Fluid  Description’  refers  to  any  simpliﬁed  plasma  treatment  which  does 
not  keep  track  of  v­dependence  of  f  detail. 

1.  Fluid  Descriptions  are  essentially  3­d  (r). 

2.  Deal  with  quantities  averaged  over  velocity  space  (e.g.  density, mean  velocity,  ...). 

3.  Omit  some  important  physical  processes  (but  describe  others). 

4.  Provide  tractable  approaches  to many  problems. 

5.  Will  occupy most  of  the  rest  of my  lectures. 
Fluid Equations can be derived mathematically by taking moments1  of the Boltzmann Equa­

We  shall  adopt  a more  direct  ‘physical’  approach.

4.2  Fluid  Motion 

The motion  of  a ﬂuid  is described by  a vector  velocity ﬁeld v(r)  (which  is  the mean velocity 
of  all  the  individual  particles  which  make  up  the  ﬂuid  at  r).  Also  the  particle  density 
n(r)  is  required.  We  are  here  discussing  the  motion  of  ﬂuid  of  a  single  type  of  particle  of 
mass/charge, m/q  so  the  charge  and mass  density  are  qn  and mn  respectively. 
The  particle  conservation  equation  we  already  know.  It  is  also  sometimes  called  the  ‘Conti­
nuity  Equation’ 

∂ 
n + �.(nv) = 0 
∂ t 
It  is  also  possible  to  expand  the �.  to  get:

4.2.1  Lagrangian  &  Eulerian  Viewpoints 

There  are  essentially  2  views. 

1.  Lagrangian.  Sit  on  a  ﬂuid  element  and move  with  it  as  ﬂuid moves. 

Figure  4.2:  Lagrangean  Viewpoint 

2.  Eulerian.  Sit  at  a  ﬁxed  point  in  space  and  watch  ﬂuid  move  through  your  volume 
element:  “identity”  of  ﬂuid  in  volume  continually  changing 
∂  means  rate  of  change  at  ﬁxed  point  (Euler).

4.2.2  Momentum  (Conservation)  Equation 
Each of the particles  is acted on by the Lorentz force q [E + ui ∧ B] (ui  is  individual particle’s

velocity).

� 
Hence  total  force  on  the  ﬂuid  element  due  to  E­M  ﬁelds  is 

(q [E + ui  ∧ B]) = ΔN  q (E + v ∧ B) 
i 

(4.21) 

67 

� 
i u/ΔN .)

(Using mean:  v = 
E­M  Force  density  (per  unit  volume)  is:

FEM  = nq(E + v ∧ B). 
� 
The  total momentum  of  the  element  is 
mui  = m ΔN  v = ΔV  mnv 
i 

(4.22) 

(4.23) 

so Momentum  Density  is mnv.

If  no  other  forces  are  acting  then  clearly  the  equation  of  motion  requires  us  to  set  the  time

derivative  of  mnv  equal  to  FEM .  Because  we  want  to  retain  the  identity  of  the  particles

under  consideration  we  want D/Dt  i.e.  the  convective  derivative  (Lagrangian  picture).

In  general  there  are  additional  forces  acting.

(1)  Pressure 
(2)  Collisional  Friction. 

4.2.3  Pressure  Force 

In  a  gas  p(= nT )  is  the  force  per  unit  area  arising  from  thermal  motions.  The  surrounding 
ﬂuid  exerts  this  force  on  the  element: 

Figure  4.4:  Pressure  forces  on  opposite  faces  of  element. 

Net  force  in  x  direction  is

Fp  = 

(4.24) 

(4.25) 

(4.26) 

How  does  this  arise  in  our  picture  above? 
Answer:  Exchange  of momentum  by  particle  thermal motion  across  the  element  boundary. 
Although  in  Lagrangian  picture  we  move  with  the  element  (as  deﬁned  by  mean  velocity  v) 
individual  particles  also  have  thermal  velocity  so  that  the  additional  velocity  they  have  is 
wi  = ui  − v 

‘peculiar’  velocity 

(4.27) 

68 

Because  of  this,  some  cross  the  element  boundary  and  exchange  momentum  with  outside. 
(Even  though  there  is  no  net  change  of  number  of  particles  in  element.)  Rate  of  exchange 
of momentum  due  to  particles  with  peculiar  velocity w, d3w  across  a  surface  element  ds  is

� 
Integrate  over  distrib  function  to  obtain  the  total momentum  exchange  rate: 
ds. mwwf (w)d3 w 

(4.29) 

(4.28) 

� 
The  thing  in  the  integral  is  a  tensor.  Write 
p  =  mwwf (w)d3 w 

(Pressure  Tensor) 

Then momentum  exchange  rate  is 
p  .  ds 
� 
Actually,  if  f (w)  is  isotropic  (e.g.  Maxwellian)  then

pxy  =  m  wx  wy  f (w)d3 w = 0 
etc. 
x  f (w)d3 w ≡ nT (= pyy  = pzz  = ‘p’) 
and  pxx  =  mw 2 
So  then  the  exchange  rate  is  pds.  (Scalar  Pressure).

(4.34) 

and  so 
Total momentum  loss  rate  due  to  exchange  across  the  boundary  per  unit  volume  is 
(= −Fp ) 
�p 
(4.35) 
In  terms  of  the momentum  equation,  either we  put �p  on  the momentum  derivative  side  or

Fp  on  force  side.  The  result  is  the  same.

4.2.5  Eﬀect  of  Collisions 

First notice that like  particle collisions do not  change the total momentum (which is averaged

over  all  particles  of  that  species).

Collisions  between  unlike  particles  do  exchange  momentum  between  the  species.  Therefore

once we  realize  that  any  quasi­neutral  plasma  consists  of  at  least  two  diﬀerent  species  (elec­

trons  and  ions)  and  hence  two  diﬀerent  interpenetrating  ﬂuids  we  may  need  to  account  for

another momentum  loss  (gain)  term.

The  rate  of momentum  density  loss  by  species  1  colliding  with  species  2  is:

ν12n1m1 (v1  − v2 ) 

(4.49) 

� 
� 
Hence  we  can  immediately  generalize  the momentum  equation  to 
+ (v1 .�) v1  = n1q1  (E + v1  ∧ B) − �p1  − ν12n1m1  (v1  − v2 ) 
∂v1 
∂ t 

m1n1 

(4.50) 

With  similar  equation  for  species  2. 

4.3  The  Key  Question  for  Momentum  Equation: 

What  do  we  take  for  p?

Basically  p  =  nT  is  determined  by  energy  balance,  which  will  tell  how  T  varies.  We  could

write  an  energy  equation  in  the  same way  as momentum.  However,  this would  then  contain

a term for heat ﬂux, which would be unknown.  In general, the k th  moment equation contains

a  term  which  is  a  (k + 1)th  moment.

Continuity,  0th  equation  contains  v  determined  by

Momentum,  1st  equation  contains  p  determined  by 
2nd  equation  contains Q  determined  by  . . . 
Energy, 
In  order  to  get  a  sensible  result  we  have  to  truncate  this  hierarchy.  Do  this  by  some  sort  of 
assumption  about  the  heat  ﬂux.  This  will  lead  to  an 
Equation  of  State : 
pn−γ  = const. 

(4.51) 

The  value  of  γ  to  be  taken  depends  on  the  heat  ﬂux  assumption  and  on  the  isotropy  (or 
otherwise)  of  the  energy  distribution. 

Examples 

1.  Isothermal:  T  =  const.: 

γ  = 1. 

2.  Adiabatic/Isotropic:  3  degrees  of  freedom  γ  =  5 .3 
γ  = 3. 
3.  Adiabatic/1  degree  of  freedom 

71 

γ  = 2. 

4.  Adiabatic/2  degrees  of  freedom 
In  general,  n(�/2)δT  = −p(δV /V ) 
(Adiabatic  �  degrees)

So 

i.e. 

In  a  normal  gas,  which  ‘holds  together’  by  collisions,  energy  is  rapidly  shared  between  3 
space­degrees of freedom.  Plasmas are often rather collisionless so compression in 1 dimension 
often  stays  conﬁned  to  1­degree  of  freedom.  Sometimes  heat  transport  is  so  rapid  that  the 
isothermal  approach  is  valid.  It  depends  on  the  exact  situation;  so  let’s  leave  γ  undeﬁned 
for  now.

4.6 	 Reduction  of  Fluid  Approach  to  the  Single  Fluid 
Equations 

So  far  we  have  been  using  ﬂuid  equations  which  apply  to  electrons  and  ions  separately. 
These  are  called  ‘Two  Fluid’  equations  because  we  always  have  to  keep  track  of  both  ﬂuids 
separately. 
A  further  simpliﬁcation  is  possible  and  useful  sometimes  by  combining  the  electron  and  ion 
equations  together  to  obtain  equations  governing  the  plasma  viewed  as  a  ‘Single  Fluid’.

to reexpression in terms of the new variables.  But note that since me  << mi  the contribution 
from  electron  momentum  is  usually  much  less  than  that  from  ions.  So  we  ignore  it  in  this

Ohm’s  Law 
The  electric  ﬁeld  ‘seen’  by  a  moving  (conducting)  ﬂuid  is  E + V ∧ B = EV  electric  ﬁeld  in 
frame  in  which  ﬂuid  is  at  rest.  This  is  equal  to  ‘resistive’  electric  ﬁeld  η j: 
EV  = E + V ∧ B = η j 
(4.102) 
The  ρq E  term  is  generally  dropped  because  it  is  much  smaller  than  the  j ∧ B  term.  To  see 
this,  take  orders  of magnitude:

This is generally a very small number.  For example, even for a small cold plasma, say Te  = 1 
eV  (σ ≈ 2 × 103  mho/m),  L = 1  cm,  this  ratio  is  about  10−8 . 
Conclusion :  the  ρq E  force  is  much  smaller  than  the  j ∧ B  force  for  essentially  all  practical 
cases.  Ignore  it. 
Normally,  also,  one  uses MHD  only  for  low  frequency  phenomena,  so  the Maxwell  displace­
ment  current,  ∂E/c2∂ t  can  be  ignored. 
Also  we  shall  not  need  Poisson’s  equation  because  that  is  taken  care  of  by  quasi­neutrality.

The  MHD  equations  ﬁnd  their  ma jor  use  in  studying  macroscopic  magnetic  conﬁnement 
problems.  In  Fusion  we  want  somehow  to  conﬁne  the  plasma  pressure  away  from  the  walls 
of the chamber, using the magnetic ﬁeld.  In studying such problems MHD  is the ma jor tool. 
On  the  other  hand  if  we  focus  on  a  small  section  of  the  plasma  as  we  do  when  studying 
short­wavelength  waves,  other  techniques:  2­ﬂuid  or  kinetic  are  needed.  Also,  plasma  is

4.8.2  Magnetic  Surfaces 
0 = B. [j ∧ B − �p] = −B.�p 

*Pressure  is  constant  on  a  ﬁeld  line  (in MHD  situation). 
(Similarly,  0 = j.[j ∧ B − �p] = j.�p.) 

(4.141) 

Figure  4.10:  Contours  of  pressure. 
Consider  some  arbitrary  volume  in which �p = 0.  That  is,  some  plasma  of whatever  shape. 
Draw contours (surfaces in 3­d) on which p = const.  At any point on such an isoberic surface 
�p  is  perp  to  the  surface.  But B.�p = 0  implies  that B  is  also  perp  to �p. 

Figure  4.11:  B  is  perpendicular  to �p  and  so  lies  in  the  isobaric  surface. 

Hence 

B  lies  in  the  surface  p  =  const.

In  equilibrium  isobaric  surfaces  are  ‘magnetic  surfaces’.

[This  argument  does  not  work  if  p  =  const.  i.e.  �p  = 0.  Then  there  need  be  no  magnetic

surfaces.] 


84 

�
4.8.3 
‘Current  Surfaces’ 
Since  j.�p = 0  in  equilibrium  the  same  argument  applies  to  current  density.  That  is 

j  lies  in  the  surface  p  =  const.

Isobaric  Surfaces  are  ‘Current  Surfaces’.

Moreover  it  is  clear  that

‘Magnetic  Surfaces’  are  ‘Current  Surfaces’.

(since  both  coincide  with  isobaric  surfaces.) 

[It  is  important  to  note  that  the  existence  of  magnetic  surfaces  is  guaranteed  only  in  the

MHD  approximation  when  �p  = 0  >  Taking  account  of  corrections  to  MHD  we  may  not

have magnetic  surfaces  even  if �p = 0.] 

4.8.4  Low  β  equilibria:  Force­Free  Plasmas 

In many  cases  the  ratio of kinetic  to magnetic pressure  is  small, β  << 1 and we  can approx­
imately  ignore  �p.  Such  an  equilibrium  is  called  ‘force  free’. 
j ∧ B = 0 

(4.142) 

implies  j  and B  are  parallel. 
i.e. 

j = µ(r)B 

Current  ﬂows  along  ﬁeld  lines  not  across.  Take  divergence:

0 = 
.j = 
= (B.�) µ.	

(4.143) 

(4.144) 
(4.145) 

The  ratio  j /B  = µ  is  constant  along  ﬁeld  lines.

µ  is  constant  on  a magnetic  surface.  If  there  are  no  surfaces,  µ  is  constant  everywhere.

Cannot  be  balanced  by Bv  because no  jφ .  No  equilibrium  for a  toroidally  symmetric  θ­pinch.

Underlying  Single  Particle  reason:

Toroidal  θ­pinch  has  Bφ  only.  As  we  have  seen  before,  curvature  drifts  are  uncompensated

in  such  a  conﬁguration  and  lead  to  rapid  outward  motion.

Figure 4.14:  Charge­separation giving outward drift is equivalent to the lack of MHD toroidal 
force  balance. 

We  know how  to  solve  this:  Rotational Transform:  get  some Bθ .  Easiest way:  add  jφ .  From 
MHD  viewpoint  this  allows  you  to  push  the  plasma  back  by  jφ  ∧ Bv  force.  Essentially,  this 
is  Tokamak. 

4.10  Plasma  Dynamics  (MHD) 

When we want  to  analyze  non ­equilibrium  situations we must  retain  the momentum  terms. 
This  will  give  a  dynamic  problem.  Before  doing  this,  though,  let  us  analyse  some  purely 
Kinematic  Eﬀects.

Flux  through  any  surface moving  with  ﬂuid  is  conserved. 

4.12  Field  Line  Motion 

Think of a ﬁeld line as the intersection of two surfaces both tangential to the ﬁeld everywhere: 

Figure  4.16:  Field  line  deﬁned  by  intersection  of  two  ﬂux  surfaces  tangential  to  ﬁeld. 

Let  surfaces move  with  ﬂuid. 
Since  all  parts  of  surfaces  had  zero  ﬂux  crossing  at  start,  they  also  have  zero  after,  (by  ﬂux

conserv.).

Surfaces  are  tangent  after motion


88 

⇒ 
Their  intersection  deﬁnes  a  ﬁeld  line  after. 
We  think  of  the  new  ﬁeld  line  as  the  same  line  as  the  old  one  (only moved). 
Thus: 
1.  Number  of  ﬁeld  lines  (≡  ﬂux)  through  any  surface  is  constant.  (Flux  Cons.) 

2.  A  line  of  ﬂuid  that  starts  as  a  ﬁeld  line  remains  one. 

4.13  MHD  Stability 

The  fact  that  one  can  ﬁnd  an  MHD  equilibrium  (e.g.  z­pinch)  does  not  guarantee  a  useful 
conﬁnement  scheme  because  the  equil.  might  be  unstable.  Ball  on  hill  analogies: 

Figure  4.17:  Potential  energy  curves 

An  equilibrium  is  unstable  if  the  curvature  of  the  ‘Potential  energy  surface’  is  downward 
away  from  equil.  That  is  if  dx2 {Wpot} < 0.

d2 
In MHD  the  potential  energy  is Magnetic + Kinetic  Pressure  (usually mostly magnetic).

If  we  can  ﬁnd  any  type  of  perturbation  which  lowers  the  potential  energy  then  the  equil  is

unstable.  It  will  not  remain  but  will  rapidly  be  lost.

Example  Z­pinch

We  know  that  there  is  an  equilibrium:  Is  it  stable?

Consider  a  perturbation  thus:


Figure  4.18:  ’Sausage’  instability


Simplify  the  picture  by  taking  the  current  all  to  ﬂow  in  a  skin.  We  know  that  the  pressure 
B 2 
is  supported  by  the  combination  of  B 2/2µo  pressure  and  µo r  tension  forces.

Preferred  Perturbations  are  ‘Flutes’  as  per  Greek  columns  →  ‘Flute  Instability.’  [Better 
name:  ‘Interchange  Instability’,  arises  from  idea  that  plasma  and  vacuum  change  places.]

Why  does  water  fall  out  of  an  inverted  glass?  Air  pressure  could  sustain  it  but  does  not

because  of  Rayleigh­Taylor  instability.

Similar  for  supporting  a  plasma  by mag  ﬁeld.

≡  Bad  Curvature  (Towards  plasma) ⇒  Instability. 

Generally  it  is  diﬃcult  to  get  the  curvature  to  be  good  everywhere.  Often  it  is  suﬃcient

to  make  it  good  on  average  on  a  ﬁeld  line.  This  is  referred  to  as  ‘Average  Minimum  B’.

Tokamak  has  this.

General idea is that if ﬁeld line is only in bad curvature over part of its length then to perturb

in  that  region  and  not  in  the  good  region  requires  ﬁeld  line  bending:


Figure  4.27:  Parallel  localization  of  perturbation  requires  bending. 

But  bending  is  not  preferred.  So  this may  stabilize.

Possible  way  to  stabilize  conﬁguration  with  bad  curvature:  Shear

Shear  of  Field  Lines


Figure  4.28:  Depiction  of  ﬁeld  shear. 

Direction  of B  changes.  A  perturbation  along B  at  z3  is  not  along B  at  z2  or  z1  so  it would 

have  to  bend  ﬁeld  there →  Stabilizing  eﬀect.

General  Principle:  Field  line  bending  is  stabilizing.

Example:  Stabilized  z­pinch

Perturbations  (e.g.  sausage  or  kink)  bend  Bz  so  the  tension  in  Bz  acts  as  a  restoring  force

to  prevent  instability.  If  wave  length  very  long  bending  is  less.  ⇒  Least  stable  tends  to  be

longest  wave  length. 

Example:  ‘Cylindrical  Tokamak’ 

94 

Tokamak  is  in some ways  like a periodic cylindrical stabilized pinch.  Longest allowable wave 
length =  1  turn  round  torus  the  long  way,  i.e. 

kR = 1  : 
λ = 2πR. 
(4.159) 
Express  this  in  terms  of  a  toroidal  mode  number,  n  (s.t.  perturbation  ∝  exp i(nφ + mθ): 
φ =  z  n = kR.
R 
Most  unstable mode  tends  to  be  n = 1.

[Careful!  Tokamak  has  important  toroidal  eﬀects  and  some  modes  can  be  localized  in  the

bad  curvature  region  (n = 1). 


Figure  4.29:  Ballooning modes  are  localized  in  the  outboard,  bad  curvature  region.
