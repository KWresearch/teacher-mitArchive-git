MID TERM EXAM


1.  Short  Answer  ( 21 points - 3 each ) 

(a)  Write  the  formula  for  the  electron  plasma  frequency. 
(b)  Write  the  formula  for  the  ion  cyclotron  frequency. 
(c)  Write  the  formula  for  the  Debye  length. 
(d)	 True  or  False.  Debye  shielding  makes  plasmas  quasi-neutral  on  scale  lengths  much  less 
than  the  Debye  length. 
(e)	 True  or  False.  Electron  plasma  oscillations  result  in  electric  ﬁelds,  and  non-neutrality, 
on  scales much  less  than  the  Debye  length. 
(f )  True  or  False.  The  parameter,  Λ = nλ3 
De ,  is  a  large  number  in  a  well  deﬁned  plasma. 
(g)  Write  down  the  force  balance  equation  for MHD  equilibrium.

(a)  ( 6 points  )  Make  a  plot  of  the  dispersion  relation,  ω vs. k ,  for  positive  frequencies. 
(b)  ( 4 points  )  Write  down  the  wave  energy  for  these modes. 
(c)	 ( 6 points  ) Calculate the cutoﬀ  frequency, and describe what happens to waves driven 
at  frequencies  below  the  cutoﬀ  frequency.

3.	 ( 16 points)  Write  the  formula  for  the  total  Coulomb  cross  section  of  charged  particle, 
1,  colliding  with  charged  particle,  2,  after  the  cutoﬀs  at  large  and  small  impact  parameter 
have  been  applied.  Estimate  the  momentum  collision  frequency  for  electron-ion  collisions  in 
a plasma with temperature,  Te .  (if  you  don’t  know  the  Coulomb  cross  section,  just  assume 
some  value for the purposes of  doing the rest of  this problem)  Use  this  result  to  write  down 
the  steady  state  momentum  equation  for  electrons  to  determine  their  drift  velocity  in  the 
presence  of  an  applied  electric  ﬁeld.  Derive  an  expression  for  the  electrical  conductivity  in 
this  plasma.

4.	 ( 16 points)  Consider  a  plasma  inside  a  toroidal  vessel  ﬁlled  with  a  toroidal  magnetic  ﬁeld 
as  indicated  in  the  ﬁgure  below. 

Figure  for  #4:  Toroidal  geometry  showing  vertical  current  for magnetic  ﬁeld  generation  and 
various  unit  vector  conventions 

The  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  pure  toroidal  (pointing  out  of  the  plane  of  the  paper).  Analyze  this 
system  using  guiding  center  orbits.  Show  that  the  sequence  of  charge  separation,  followed 
by  an  electric  ﬁeld  gives  a  resulting  ﬂow  of  the entire plasma that implies  a  complete  lack  of 
any  kind  of  conﬁnement.  Be  sure  to  indicate  all  the  drifts  involved,  their  magnitudes  and 
the  resulting directions  for both  electron and  ion ﬂows.  EXTRA  CREDIT:  if  you  ﬁnish  early 
you  might  want  to  actual ly  compute  the  ﬂow  in  quantitative  terms,  including  any  possible 
POLARIZATION  of  the  plasma. 

5.  ( 15 points)  A  theta  pinch  plasma  has  θ  directed  currents  that  produce  an  axial  magnetic 
ﬁeld  with  the  radial  proﬁle,

Compute  the  radial  pressure  proﬁle  sub ject  to  the  boundary  condition,  p (r = a) → 0. How 
does  the  result  change  if  the  edge  boundary  condition  becomes,  p (r = a) = pe?

6.	 ( 16 points)  Consider  a  plasma  with  the  ions  (protons)  drifting  in  the  z -direction  with 
respect  to  the  electrons  at  speed,  V0 .  Show  that  the  dispersion  relation  for  longitudinal 
waves,  assuming  a  cold-two  ﬂuid model,  is,

Hint:  Try  to  make  a  simple  argument  for  this  dispersion  without  going  through  a  lengthy 
algebraic  calculation  of  the  linearized  response. 
Plot  the  dispersion  relation  for  the  ion  modes  assuming  the  electron  response  was  frozen 
(ωpe  → 0), and calculate the wave energy of these modes.  Now allow the electrons  to respond 
and  show  that  the  system will  go  unstable.  Hint  #2:  Make  a  simple  argument  for  instability 
ﬁrst  and  go  into  more  detail  with  calculations  and  graphs  if  time  permits.  EXTRA  CREDIT 
if  you  can  actual ly  calculate  the  growth  rate  by  taking  advantage  of,  me/mi  ¿ 1.
