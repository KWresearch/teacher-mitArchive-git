The figure below illustrates a collision between two hard spheres of the same radius R. In the case  
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
shown, the shaded sphere has infinite mass and is therefore stationary during the collision. The final 
velocity of the moving sphere is then given by

Problem 3. (30%) 
 
.pωω=
 Perhaps 
A cold homogeneous plasma supports oscillations at the plasma frequency 
surprisingly, the oscillation occurs at the same frequency regardless of the wavenumber 
/2 λπ=k
.
However, when pressure is included in the equations describing a plasma oscillation, the situation 
changes and the frequency of oscillation depends on k. In this problem you are asked to find the 
k−ω relationship for a plasma in which pressure plays a role.
