FINAL EXAM


1.  Short  Answer  (18  points) 

(a)	 Write  the  formulas  for  the  electron  plasma  frequency  and  the  ion  plasma  frequency  (be 
sure  to  include any dependence on  ionic charge, Zi ).  You may  use  the  expression  for  the 
square  if  so  noted. 
(b)  Write  the  formula  for  the  ion  cyclotron  frequency. 
(c)  Write  the  formulas  for  the  electron Debye  length  and  the  ion  Debye  length. 
(d)  True  or  False.  The  Vlasov  equation  describes  an  incompressible  ﬂow  in  phase  space. 
(e)	 True  or  False.  The  Vlasov  equation  describes  the  conservation  of  particles  in  self  con-
sistent  phase  space  ﬂow. 
(f )	 Tr
ue  or  False.  The Vlasov equation describes  a  ﬂuid  whose  ﬂuid  dynamic  ﬂow,  V  = 
R
1  d3vvf ,  is  incompressible,  ∇ · V = 0. 
n 
R 
(g)  True  or  False.  The  Vlasov  equation  conserves  entropy,  S  = −  d3vf ln f . 
(h)  True  or  False.  The Vlasov equation is reversible. 
(i)	 True  or  False.  The  Vlasov  equation  relaxes  a  (spatially  homogeneous)  distribution  to 
the Maxwellian  velocity  dependence  for  long  times,  t → ∞. 
2.	 Wave Energy  and Dissipation  (10  points):  The dielectric response function,  (cid:18) (k , ω), for 
a  given  problem  is  an  analytic  function  of  frequency,  ω .  Show  how  to  calculate  the  real  and 
imaginary parts  of  the  frequency, ω = ωr + iγ ,  assuming  that  the growth/damping  rate,  γ , is 
small  compared  to  the  real  frequency,  ωr ,  using  only  the  know ledge  of  the  dielectric  function, 
(cid:18) (k , ωr ),  for  real  frequencies. Give  a  physical  interpretation  of  your  result  in  terms  of  wave 
energy  and  dissipation.  Evaluate  the  (weak)  dissipation  for  the  dielectric  given  in  equation 
(1)  below. 

3.	 Electron Beam  Instabilities  (32  points):  Consider an electron  ion plasma created by  in-
jecting 2 electron beams at energies of Eb1  = 10 K eV  and Eb2  = 100 K eV  into a Te  ' 1 K eV 
plasma  (you  may  consider  the  ions  to  be  cold  and  at  rest  dynamically).  Assume  that  each 
beam  has  a  “temperature"  spread  in  energy  about  its  mean  value  of,  Tb  ' 1  K eV , and  that 
both  beams  have  similiar  densities  that  are  small  compared  to  the  background  plasma  elec-
tron  density.  The  distribution  is  shown  schematically  in  the  drawing  with  labels  attached  to 
various  features  of  the  distribution  function.

Evaluate  the  labels,  ve ,  vb ,  Ub1 ,  Ub2  shown  on  the  drawing  and  indicate  which  quantities,  if 
any,  are  equal.  You  may  take,  vm1  =  Ub1  − αvb ,  and,  vm2  =  Ub2  − αvb ,  where  the  quantity, 
α,  can  be  treated  as  an  order  unity  constant  for  the  calculations  below  (and  if  you  have  time 
after  the  rest  of  exam  is  done,  you  can  evaluate,  α,  to  get  a  perfect  score  on  this  portion  of 
exam!).  You may  assume  positive  wavenumber,  k ,  throughout. 
Indicate  any  phase  velocity  range  (or  ranges)  where  unstable  waves  exist.  Write  down  any 
inequalities  that  characterize  these  modes  (i.e.  relations  such  as,  ω/k  À  vb ,  although  this 
particular  relation  may  not  be  relevant).  Calculate  the  (dimensionless)  wave  energy  and 
growth  rate  of  the  most  unstable  mode  in  each  band  (you  may  assume  weak  dissipation). 
Leading  order  calculations  are  acceptable  in  al l  cases.  Recall  that  the  dielectric  response 
function  is  given  by,
