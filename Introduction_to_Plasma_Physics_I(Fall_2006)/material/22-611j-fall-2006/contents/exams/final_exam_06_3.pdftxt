NOTES:  There are 8 pages to the exam. Make sure that your copy is complete. Each problem is 
worth 25%, although the problems differ somewhat in complexity. It is a good idea to look 
through all problems before deciding in which order to attack them! 
 
Problem 1. 
 
An axisymmetric 
=∂∂ ϕ toroidal confinement system is depicted below. In this problem you will

be asked to describe the motion of a particle injected into this configuration with various magnetic 
fields and initial conditions. Throughout the problem the poloidal coordinates, i.e., the coordinates in a 
plane ϕ = constant, of the center of the particle's Larmor motion are denoted by

Problem 2. 
 
In this problem you will be asked to estimate the thermal diffusivity of a plasma based on formulas for 
characteristic collision frequencies, velocities and lengths presented in the table below. Then, given the 
thermal conductivity, you will be asked to calculate the temperature distribution for a plasma heated by 
Ohmic (I2R) heating.

The figure below shows the cross-section of a slab of plasma of width 
. The slab is infinite in extent 
in the x and z directions. The plasma density is n, there is a magnetic field B in the z-direction, and the 
plasma is heated by a current density J parallel to B .The ions and electrons can be assumed to be in 
equilibrium with temperature T. The density, field and current density are all spatially homogenous in 
the plasma.

 Problem 3. 
 
A high frequency electromagnetic wave is launched along the midplane of an Alcator C-Mod plasma, 
as sketched in Figure 3a on the page 7. The field along the midplane (in Tesla) is given by

The wave frequency is f = 210 GHz (2.1x1011 Hz) and throughout this problem it can be assumed 
that the transverse dimensions of the EM beam are small enough that it can be considered to 
propagate radially along the mid-plane of the plasma as a plane wave. Note ion motion is 
completely negligible at this frequency. 
 
The square of the index of refraction of the wave as a function of distance along the mid-plane radius 
is plotted in Figure 3b.  As can be seen, at r = 20 cm, the index of refraction is 1, corresponding to free 
space, while at r = 12.5 cm the index of refraction is 0 and at r = 7.25 cm it is

a) Determine the central plasma density, 
 
b) Describe the plasma polarization at r = 12.5 cm, specifying whether it is linear, circular or elliptical, 
and if circular or elliptical, what plane  Er  is in and its direction of rotation. 
 
c) A model equation that can be used to describe the propagation of the wave is
