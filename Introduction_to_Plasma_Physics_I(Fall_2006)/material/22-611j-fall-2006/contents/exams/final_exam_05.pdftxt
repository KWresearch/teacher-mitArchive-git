NOTES:  There are 8 pages to the exam, plus one formula sheet. Make sure that your copy is complete. 
 
Each problem is worth 20%, although the problems differ somewhat in complexity. It is a good idea to 
look through all problems before deciding in which order to attack them!

compressional Alfvén waves in a homogenous plasma immersed in a uniform magnetic field. For
