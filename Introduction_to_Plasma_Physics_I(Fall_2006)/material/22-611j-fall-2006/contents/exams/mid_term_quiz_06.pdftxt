The figure below illustrates a collision between two particles. In the case shown, the shaded particle

has infinite mass and is therefore stationary during the collision. The moving particle has mass m1, speed 
v0 and the impact parameter for the collision is b. 
 
The force between the two particles is k/r3 where k is a constant and r is the distance of separation. The 
force is repulsive and acts along a line connecting the particles. 
 
a) Determine the distance of closest approach, rmin, i.e., the minimum distance between the particles 
during the collision event. 
 
b) Calculate the angular deflection ψ of the incident particle and the impact parameter, b90, for a 90º 
collision. One of the integrals on the next page should be useful to you in answering this part. 
 
Assume now that the particle at the origin has finite mass m2 and is stationary before the collision. 
 
c) Calculate, in terms of ψ, the loss in x-directed momentum suffered by particle 1 as a result of the 
collision.

d) Consider now a beam of particles with mass m1 and velocity 
 injected into a “sea” of initially
