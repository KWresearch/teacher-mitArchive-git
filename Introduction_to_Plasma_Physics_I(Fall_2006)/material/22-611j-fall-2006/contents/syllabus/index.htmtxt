***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Description *****
This course introduces plasma phenomena relevant to energy generation by
controlled thermonuclear fusion and to astrophysics. It will cover basic plasma
properties and collective behavior, Coulomb collisions and transport processes,
motion of charged particles in magnetic fields, plasma confinement schemes, MHD
models, simple equilibrium and stability analysis, two-fluid hydrodynamic
plasma models, and wave propagation in a magnetic field.
The course also introduces kinetic theory, the Vlasov plasma model, the
relation between kinetic and fluid models, electron plasma waves and Landau
damping.
***** Course Prerequisites *****
In order to register for 22.611J, 8.613J and 6.651J, you should have previously
completed 6.014 or 8.07 and 18.04 or 18.075, with a grade of C or higher.
Exceptions to this policy will require the permission of Prof. Parker, and will
be granted on a case-by-case basis.
***** Textbook *****
There is no required text for this course. There is, however, a list of
recommended texts in the readings section.
***** Problem Sets *****
The weekly problem sets are an essential part of the course. Working through
these problems is crucial to understanding the material. Problem sets will
generally be assigned one week before they are due.
***** Exams *****
There will be one in-class (90 minute) mid-term quiz and a (3 hour) final exam.
If you did well on the problem sets and exams, you should do well on the final
exam.
***** Grading *****
The final grade for the course will be based on the following:
    Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES    PERCENTAGES
Homework      25%
Mid-term quiz 25%
Final exam    50%
