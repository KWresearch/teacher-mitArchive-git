2.4.  “Culture”  and  labor  market  outcomes


Part  of  a  larger  literature  on  the  role  of  culture  in  economic  outcomes.  Labor 
market  may  be  a  good  observation  ground. 

“Culture”  may: 
•	 aﬀect  economic  outcomes  (here,  say,  unemployment  or  employment 
rates)  directly. 

• 

aﬀect  outcomes  indirectly,  through  institutions. 
by  shaping  them.

by  determining  how  well/badly  given  institutions  work. 


Important  for  the  design  of  institutions.  One  set  may  not  ﬁt  all.  Importing 
institutions  may  not  work.

No  time  for  a  thorough  treatment.  Just  a  number  of  interesting  ﬁgures  and 
questions.  Look  at  three  papers: 
• 

Blanchard-Philippon.  Trust. 
Strong correlation between quality of labor relations and unemployment. 
Even  given  institutions. 
Causality?  Potential  mechanisms.  Introducing  asymmetric  information 
in  DMP  model. 

• 

• 

Algan-Cahuc.  Civic  attitudes 
Strong correlation between public  spiritedness and  relative use of unem­

ployment  insurance  versus  employment  protection.

Causality?  Potential  mechanisms.  Moral  hazard  in  search.


Algan-Cahuc.  Family  values

Strong relation between employment rates of young and old, and indexes

of  family  values.

Causality?  Potential  mechanisms.

Potential  mechanisms? 

Diﬀerent models of the economy by unions and business.  (ﬁxed rents, elasticity 
of  the  labor  demand  curve).  Probably  relevant,  but  hard  to  formalize. 

Asymmetric  information.  Productivity  known  to  the  ﬁrm,  not  to  the  worker. 
The  BP  formalization: 

• 
DMP  economy.  Bargaining  between  worker  and  ﬁrm: 
•  Productivity  either  low,  y l  or  high  yh . 
• 
If  ﬁrm  announces  y l ,  worker  strikes  with  probability  s.
If  strike,  match  ends  with  probability  γ .  With  probability  1 − γ ,  worker 
• 
makes  a  take-it  or  leave-it  counteroﬀer.

•

• 

Probability  s  determined  so  ﬁrm  has  an  incentive  to  tell  the  truth.  s  an
increasing  function  of  (yh  − y l ). 

Alternative:  Repeated game (as productivity shocks with probability λ.)
Cooperative  equilibrium,  with  no  strike.  “Trust”


Endogenous  constraints  on  trust.  Cooperative  equilibrium  may  not  be

sustainable.  Incentives  to  cheat  too  strong. 


Even  if  cooperative  equilibrium  is  sustainable,  workers  and  ﬁrms  may

still  not  cooperate.

The  model  delivers: 
• 

Trust partly endogenous, partly exogenous (so potentially history depen­
dent) 
•	 Lower  trust,  lower  productivity,  so  higher  unemployment  duration. 
Higher  ﬂows  because  of  ineﬃcient  separations  (λsγ ). 

• 

If endogenous choice of technology, choice of less uncertain technologies. 
Potentially  lower  growth. 
•	 If  endogenous  ownership,  ownership  structures  that  reduce  conﬂict. 
(Philippon).  Family  ﬁrms?

2.  Civic  spiritedness  and  institutions 

• 

In  Europe  today,  a  very  popular model  among  politicians:  “Flexicurity” 
from  Denmark.  Generous  UI/limited  EP.  Low  unemployment. 
•	 European  countries  on  a  UI/EP  frontier.  Denmark  at  one  end,  Italy, 
Portugal,  Greece,  at  the  other.  Figure  1  from  Algan-Cahuc. 

• 

• 

Can  countries  really  choose?  Can  Italy  adopt  Danish  institutions?  Will 
they  work  as  in  Denmark?


Tentative  answer  from  Cahuc  Algan:  No. 

Institutions  reﬂect  choices. 
Choices  are  partially  determined  by  culture,  in  this  case  “civic  spirited­
ness”

The  evidence. 
• 

Measures  of  civic  spirit:  Answer  to: 
“Do you think  it can always be justiﬁed, never be justiﬁed, or something 
in  between,  to  claim  government/state  beneﬁts  to  which  you  have  no 
rights?”.  1:  never.  10:  always. 
in  two  surveys  (WVS,  and  ISSP) 
•	 Large  diﬀerences  across  countries,  stable  over  time.  Denmark:  8.5, 
Greece:  2.5.  Figures  3,  4

• 

Exogeneity?  Indirect  evidence  from  country  of  origin  (for  US)  .


Eﬀect  on  institutions.  Panel  data  country/period. 
More  civic  spirit  leads  to  higher  UI,  lower  EP.  (Survives  country  ﬁxed 
eﬀects.  Good  or  bad  news?)

Standard  DMP,  with  productivity  shocks,  and  endogenous  search.


Search  intensity  not  observable,  so  moral  hazard  in  search 

A  model  (Algan-Cahuc) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 

A  utility  cost  (guilt  feeling)  from  receiving  beneﬁts  if  not  searching. 

Government  maximizes  expected  utility. 

The higher the guilt feeling,  the smaller the moral hazard problem, thus: 
The  higher  UI  (the  degree  of  insurance),  the  lower  EP  (the  smaller  the 
need  to  distort  the  destruction  margin),  the  higher  utility.

3.  Family  values  and  employment  rates 

The  evolution  of  employment  rates.  Basic  facts.  1970-2003 
• 

Up  for  women,  more  so  in  countries  where  they  were  low  to  start.  In­
complete  convergence.


• 

Decrease  in  the  employment  rates  of  the  young,  and  of  the  old.


Correlation  with  measures  of  family  values?  Three  measures  from  answers  to 
WVS  questions: 
• 
• 
• 

“When  jobs  are  scarce,  men  have  more  rights  to  a  job  than  women.” 

“When  jobs  are  scarce,  older  people  should  be  forced  to  retire  early” 

“Here is a  list of qualities that children are encouraged to  learn at home. 
Which  if  any  do  you  consider  to  be  really  important:  Independence?

Exogeneity?  Family  values  in  US  by  country  of  origin. 

The  model: 
• 
• 
• 

Countries  diﬀer  in  the  valuation  of  family  activities 

Decrease  in  price  of  durables  used  in  household  production 

Decrease  in  time  devoted  to  home  production  (ambiguous).  Increase  in 
market  work  by  women. 


• 

Increase in family activities.  Stronger increase the stronger the valuation.

Decrease  in  employment  rates  of  young  and  old.  (?) 

Explain a  large  set of  time-series/cross country  facts.  But not  totally convinc­
ingly.  Alternative  explanations  (for  example,  Fogli  2004).
