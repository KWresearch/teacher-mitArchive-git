What  if  there  are  more  shocks  than  variables  in  the  VAR? 

What  if  there  are  only  a  few  underlying  shocks,  explaining most  of  ﬂuc­
tuations? 

In  fact,  the  same  question...  Can  think  of  most  macroeconomic  vari­
ables  as  being  driven  by  a  few  common  shocks,  plus  partly  idiosyncratic 
shocks/measurement  error: 
Think of n  variables depending on  q < n  common  shocks,  and n  idiosyncratic 
shocks.  Then,  we  have  both: 
• 
• 

More  shocks  (q + n)  than  variables,  so  standard  small  VAR  wrong.


Less  “important”  shocks  (q < n)  than  variables.

Using  Stock-Watson  2005  notation. 

n  variables  Xit , i = 1, .., n. (n  may  be  large) 
q  underlying  factors  (common  shocks)  f1t , ..., fqt , ft  ≡ [f1t  ...  fqt ]�
Each  variable  depends  on  a  distributed  lag  of  each  factor,  and  an  idio­
syncratic  component: 

Xit  = λ˜
i1 (L)  ...  λ˜
i (L) = [λ˜
iq (L)]  is  a  vector  of  lag  polynomials. 

i (L)ft  + uit 

where  λ˜

Idiosyncratic  components  are  serially  correlated,  but  mutually  uncorre­
lated: 

uit  = δi (L)uit−1  + vit 
where  innovations  are  mutually  and  serially  uncorrelated,  E vit vj τ  = 
0,  for  all  t, τ , i, j, i = j 
� 
Last  assumption  unpalatable  (Xit :  consumption  of  non-durables,  Xj t : 
consumption  of  services).  Can  be  somewhat  relaxed  (and  relaxation  ok 
if  n  is  indeed  very  large). 

Factors  follow  a  multivariate  autoregressive  process: 

ft  = Γ(L)ft−1  + ηt 

where  innovations  can  be  mutually  correlated,  but  are  serially  uncorre­
lated  and  uncorrelated  with  idiosyncratic  components  at  all  leads  and 
lags;  E ηtuiτ  = 0  for  all  i, t, τ

Example  1.  The  simplest  common  factor  model 

Xit  = λ˜
where  ft  is  a  single  factor;  no  lags. 

i ft  + vit 

Can  see  how,  if  n  is  large,  easy  to  recover  to  recover  the  single  factor  (Choice 
of  variables,  of  units:  not  neutral) 

Example  2.  A  simple  dynamic  single  common  factor  model 

i1 ft  + λ˜
Xit  = λ˜
i2 ft−1  + vit 
For example,  diﬀerent  components of  consumption or  investment  respond dif­
ferently  to  technological  shocks.

Example  3.  A  simple  structural  factor  model 

i1 (L)f1t  + λ˜
Xit  = λ˜
i2 (L)f2t  + vit 
where,  for  example,  the  ﬁrst  factor  is  a  technological  shock,  and  the  second 
factor  is  a  “demand  ”  shock. 

Assume that the ﬁrst variable in the VAR is the rate of change of GDP and that 
the “demand” shock has no eﬀect on output  in the  long run.  This assumption 
implies 

λ˜

Estimating  the  dynamic  factor  model


Rewrite  the  equation  for Xit  so  as  to  have  white  noise  errors.  From:

Xit  = λ˜

i (L)ft  + uit 

and 

Get: 

uit  = δi (L)uit−1  + vit 

Xit  = λi (L)ft  + δi (L)Xit−1  + vit 

where  λi (L) ≡ (1 − δi (L)L)λ˜

i (L).

Rewrite 

in  matrix  form: 

Xit  = λi (L)ft  + δi (L)Xit−1  + vit 

Xt  = λ(L)ft  + D(L)Xt−1  + vt 

where  Xt  ≡  [X1t  ...  Xnt ]� , λ(L)  ≡  [λ1 (L)�  ...  λn (L)� ],  D(L)  is  a  diagonal 
matrix,  and 

ft  = Γ(L)ft−1  + ηt 

Note  that  λ(L)  and  ft  are  not  separately  identiﬁed: 
λ(L)ft  = (λ(L)  H −1 )(H ft ) 

so  need  some  normalization.

Deﬁne  Ft  ≡ [ft
� f �
t−1 

�
−p+1 ],  so  we  can  rewrite  the  DFM  as: 
...  ft

Xt  = ΛFt  + D(L)Xt−1  + vt 

(1)


(2)

Ft  = Φ(L)Ft−1  + Gηt 
The  dimension  of  Ft  is  (at  most)  r  =  qp.  The  r  elements  of  Ft  are  called

“static factors”.  The underlying q  elements of ft  are called “dynamic factors”. 

We  ultimately  want  to  recover  the  dynamic  factors,  and  the  eﬀects  of  their

innovations,  the  η ’s  on  the  Xi .


Can  be  estimated  using  a  Kalman  ﬁlter  (Hamilton,  Chapter  13):


First  equation  is  the  “observation  equation”,  second  equation  is  “state  equa­

tion”.  But  hard  to  do  for  large  n.

So  other  approach:  Principal  components.

An  approach  to  estimation  (for  more,  see  Stock-Watson  2-4). 
•	
≡
First  step:  Assume  some  D0 (L)  in  equation  (1)  and  construct  X˜t
Xt  − D0 (L)Xt−1 . 
˜
Derive  Ft  as  the  ﬁrst  r  principal  components  of Xt . 
(How  to  choose  r?) 

• 

Regress  Xit  on  estimated  Ft  and  lagged  Xit .  Get  D1 (L).  Iterate  until 
convergence.  This  gives  us  estimates  for  the  r  static  factors  Ft . 
•	 Second  step:  Regress  (estimated)  Ft  on  Ft−1  and  choose  the  ﬁrst  q 
principal  components  of  the  residuals.  This  gives  us  the  innovations  to 
the  dynamic  factors.  (How  to  choose  q?) 
(If  we  had  Ft  exactly,  the  covariance  matrix  should  be  singular.)

Back  to  the  second  example. 

Xit  = λi1 ft  + λi2 ft−1  + vit 
Assume  that  ft  is  white  noise: 

ft  = ηt ,  E ηt  = 0, V (ηt ) = 1 

So: 

Xit  = λi1 ηt  + λi2 ηt−1  + vit 
and  deﬁning  Ft  ≡ [ηt  ηt−1 ]� 
Xit  = [λi1  λi2 ]  Ft  + vit 

This  is  a  one  dynamic  factor,  two  static  factors,  DFM.  Can  we  recover  the 
two  static  factors,  and  the  one  dynamic  factor?

• 

Step  1:  Start  with  D0 (L) = 0,  do  principal  components,  and  iterate. 
Get  D(L) = 0  and  two  static  factors,  g1t ,  g2t .  Both  are  white  noise, 
mutually  uncorrelated.  Relation  to  the  two  static  factors,  f1t  and  f2t 
(  ηt  and  ηt−1 )? 
Let  Gt  ≡ [g1t  g2t ]� .  Then, 

Gt  = H Ft 

for  H  is  an  orthogonal  matrix,  so  V (F ) = V (G) = I .  In  this  2x2  case, 
H  is  determined  up  to  a  scalar  θ .  The  relation  between  the  true  shocks 
and  the  estimated  factors  can  be  expressed  as: 

ηt  = h11  g1t  + h21  g2t 
ηt−1  = h12  g1t  + h22  g2t

•  Step  2.  Regress  g1t , g2t  on  g1t−1 ,  g2t−1 . 

Recall  that  there  is a  linear combination of g1t  and g2t  which  is equal  to 
ηt−1 ,  and  a  linear  combination  of  g1t−1  and  g2t−1  which  is  also  equal 
to  ηt−1 .  So  the  rank  of  the matrix  of  residuals  will  be  one,  the  number 
of  dynamic  factors. 
Doing  principal  components  on  the  error  term  (the  term  in  brackets) 
recovers  ηt ,  the  single  dynamic  factor. 

In  this  case,  identiﬁcation  is  easy.  But  in  general,  need  further  assump­
tions  to  go  back  from  dynamic  factors  to  underlying  shocks.  (Same  as 
from  VAR  to  structural  VAR)

Identiﬁcation 
• 

Write  the  factor  model  in  inﬁnite MA  form.  From  above, 
Xt  = (I − D(L)L)−1  λ(L)(1 − Γ(L)L)−1 ηt  + (I − D(L)L)−1 vt 

Each Xi  depends  on  both  innovations  to  the  dynamic  factors,  and  cur­

rent  and  past  own  idiosyncratic  shocks.

Deﬁnining  matrix  lag  polynomials  C  and  J  appropriately:


Xt  = C0  ηt  + C (L)  ηt−1  + J0  vt  + J (L)  vt−1 

• 

Using  the  same notation  as  in  topic 1-2,  assume  the  true model  is given 
by: 

Xt  = A0  et  + A(L)  et−1  + K0  wt  + K (L)  wt−1 
where  the et  and wt  are  the underlying structural common and  idiosyn­
cratic  shocks.  Without  loss  of  generality,  assume  Σe  = I .

Comparison  of  the  factor  and  the  true  model  imply: 

C0 ηt  = A0 et 

Let  Ση  be  the  covariance  matrix  of  the  innovations  to  the  common 
factors.  Then  A0  must  satisfy: 

V (A0  et ) = A0A�

0  = V (C0  ηt ) = C0  Ση  C0

structural.  Some  leads 

• 

First  factor  reﬂects  the  (important)  fact  that  most  quantities  (invest­
ment,  consumption),  move  together.  Proof  that  there  is  a  common 
factor?  Not  necessarily.  Strong  interactions  between  components.  For 
example,  simple  I S  model,  with  two  shocks: 

y = c + x, 

c =  .4y + �c ,

x = .4y + �x , σc  = σx  = 1 

Then  ﬁrst  factor  will  be  output:  y  =  5(�c  + �x )  And  a  regression  of  c 
on  y  (with  OLS  bias)  gives: 
c = .5y + η ,  η = (�c  − �x ) 

Then,  proportion  of  variance  of  consumption  explained  by  output 
(V (.5y)/V (c) = 75%)  Need  some  metric  to  assess  SW  results.

Fact  that  ﬁrst  factor  does  not  explain  prices? 
Supply/demand 

y = −ap + �d , y = bp + �s 

So: 

p = (a + b)−1 (�d  − �s ), y = (a + b)−1 (b�d  + a�s ) 

Suppose ﬁrst  factor  explains quantities.  Correlation with  second  factor? 

E (py) = (a + b)−2 (−aσs 
2  + bσd
2 ) 
So:  Similar  variances  and  parameters?  or  large  variance  of  supply 
shocks,  and  small  a,  or  ?

Application  2.  Bernanke-Boivin-Eliasz  2005.  Monetary  policy  shocks. 

Slightly  diﬀerent  in  structure  and  intent:  Identify  the  eﬀects  of  one  shock,  to

monetary  policy, when  Fed  looks  at  a  lot more  than  just  output  and  inﬂation.


(One) motivation:  The “price puzzle”.  CPI appears  to  increase  in  response  to 
an  “exogenous”  increase  in  the  FF  rate. 

Potential explanation.  Fed sees an increase in the price of materials, and reacts 
in  advance.  Just  looking  at  output  and  inﬂation,  we  do  not  see  what  the  Fed 
reacted  to. 

Way  out?  DFM

Could  instead  have  some  of  the  variables  (πt , yt )  for  example,  be  observable

factors.

Also observe m  (a  large number of other) macroeconomic variables Xt , which

satisfy: 


Xt  = ΛF  Ft  + ΛR  Rt  + et 
Relation  to  DFM  earlier:  Some  factors  observable.  Only  static  factors  (no

direct  eﬀect  of  lagged  R  on  X  except  through  eﬀect  through  other  factors.)

Estimation/Identiﬁcation 
• 

2-step.
Do  principal  components  on  (4).  Treating  all  factors  as  unobservable 
(?).  Gives  the  right  space,  not  the  individual  factors. 
•	 Decompose  space  between  Ft  and  Rt .  Run  equation  (3)  with  identi­
ﬁcation  restriction.  Factors  not  aﬀected  contemporaneously  by  money 
shocks.  Recursive  ordering,  with  R  last. 

• 

Maximum  likelihood of (4) and (3)?  Hard  if m  is very  large.  Likelihood­
based  Gibbs  sampling.  (Victor  will  explain).

Dynamic  factor  models.  How  many  shocks?  Tentative  conclusions 
• 

Clearly  the  right  approach  in  many  contexts. 
People/the  Fed  look  at  many  variables.

Less big shocks than variables, more shocks than any number of variables

we  can  include.


• 

• 
• 

In  terms  of  results.  Verdict  out  yet.  A  few  common  shocks?  Common

shocks,  quantities,  prices,  and  asset  prices.


In  general,  the  usual:  Need  for  identiﬁcation.


Non-linear  true  models  and  factors.  For  example,  one  shock,  quadratic 
model:  Two  factors:  mean  and  variance.
