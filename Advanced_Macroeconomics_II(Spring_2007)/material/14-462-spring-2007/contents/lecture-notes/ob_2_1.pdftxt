1.1.  Basic  (non  cyclical)  facts


Large  job  creation/destruction.  Net  ﬂows  relative  to  gross. 

Goals:  Understand  determination  of  wage  and  employment  in  labor  market.

And  incorporate  in  macroeconomic  model. 

Facts  (much  progress  due  to  new  large  panel  data  sets  on  ﬁrms  and workers): 

• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Heterogeneity  across  countries:  US  versus  Europe.  Within  Europe.

•	 Large  continental  European  countries.  Unemployment  then  low,  now 
high 

Heterogeneity  across  age  groups,  skills. 

Even  larger  ﬂows  of  workers. 

Unemployment.  Flows/duration.

From  DH  (LRD,  plant  based):  Job  creation/destruction  rates  in manu­
facturing  around  5-6%  per  quarter 

From Faberman,  building on LRD up  to 1990, BED  since 1990.  (Figure 
3)  Job  creation/destruction  rates  in  manufacturing  around  4-7%  per 
quarter.  Note  surprising  decline  since  early  1960s,  and  more  so  late 
1990s. 

From  Faberman  (Davis,  Figure  2).  JC/JD  rates  around  7-8%  per  quar­
ter.  (Note  the  decline  since  1999.  Why?  Debate  on  micro-volatility)

2.  Workers  ﬂows. 

Worker  ﬂows  exceed  job  ﬂows:  workers  and  ﬁrms  look  for  better  matches  for 
existing  jobs. 
•	 Total  hires  and  separations  for  continuing  establishments.  (JOLTS), 
since  2001.  Figure  4,  from  Davis 
Hires/separations  around  3%  per month.  Note  how  close  the  two  gross 
ﬂows  are. 
Quits  >  layoﬀs  around  1.8%,  layoﬀs  around  1.5% 

• 

Worker  ﬂows  from  CPS.  Figure  1,  from  Fallick/Fleischman,  1996-2003. 
Note:

(U+E+N)  ﬂow  to  E:  6.2%  per month:  reconciling  with  hires  numbers?

N  to  E  >  U  to  E.  Non-participation?  (pool  of  workers  not  searching,

but  “willing  to  take  a  job”:  about  6%  of  LF)

E to E > U to E. On the  job search?  Relevant pool of workers searching

for  jobs?

cforce3.  Looking  more  closely  at  unemployment.  Flows/duration 
• 

Deﬁnition  of  unemployment.  Survey-based  (not  registrations  at  the  un­
employment  oﬃce.  Sometimes  (in  some  countries)  quite  diﬀerent. 

• 
• 
• 

• 

• 

Inﬂows  and  outﬂows  from  CPS.  1976-2005  (Davis,  Figure  5).  Note: 

Large  gross  ﬂows/small  net  ﬂows.  Gross:  2-3%  per  month 

Implied  duration.  In  SS,  u  rate=  duration*ﬂows.  Today:  4.5%  =  2.5
months  times  1.8%.  Low  duration,  large  ﬂows. 


Decrease  in  ﬂows  over  time,  since  early  1980s.  (Aging,  decreasing  job

ﬂows)


A  peek  at  cyclical  behavior.  Both  inﬂows  and  outﬂows  up  in  recessions.

But  exit  rate  (outﬂows/unemployment)  goes  down.

4.  Heterogeneity 

• 

• 

By age.  Larger ﬂows  for the young.  (Table 3, Fallick-Fleischman.  Flows 
versus  stocks,  for  diﬀerent  age  groups)

Also,  higher  unemployment  rates:  2006:4.  10.5%  for  16-24,  3.5%  for

25-54,  3%  for  55+.


By  race:  2006:4.  3.9%  for  whites,  8.5%  for  blacks.


•	 By  education  level  (interacting  with  race).  u  rates  for  less  than  high 
school  education:  7%  for whites,  15%  for  blacks.  with  bachelor  degree: 
2%  for  whites,  3.5%  for  blacks.

5.  Low  frequency  movements  and  heterogeneity  across  countries 
• 

At  high  frequency:  business  cycle movements.  A  diﬀerent  beast.  Focus 
on  “the  natural  rate”  (rate  consistent  with  constant  inﬂation;  equiva­
lently  rate  without  nominal  rigidities). 

• 

The  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate  in Europe.  (EU15.)  Lower  than 
the  US  in  the  1960s. 
•	 The  heterogeneity  across  European  countries.  Many  have  low  rates. 
The  large  continental  4  have  high  rates. 

• 

Measurement  error,  or  hidden  in  non-participation,  disability?  Some­
times  relevant,  but  does  not  change  the  overall  picture.  Example  of 
Spain.

Proximate  causes  behind  heterogeneity 
• 

Job  ﬂows.  Surprisingly  similar. 
Comparing  across  countries.  Bartelsman  Figure  1.  (Diﬃcult:  diﬀerent 
methodologies,  data  sets).  Still:  no  obvious  diﬀerence. 

A more  detailed  comparison.  The US  versus Portugal.  Nearly  compara­
ble  data  sets. 

• 

Unemployment  duration: 
Over  time:  France.  Unemployment  rate  from  2  to  10%.  Duration  from 
5  months  to  15  months.  (so  some  increase  in  ﬂow  rates  as  well) 

Across countries.  (OECD Employment Outlook 2006).  Longer duration 
than  US,  even  in  countries  with  similar  u  rates.

Other  margins,  other  diﬀerences  across  countries. 
• 

Hours worked.  Larger decline in Europe.  A debate:  Preferences?  Taxes? 
Union  policies  and  work  sharing.


• 

• 

Participation  rates.  Often  up  in  Europe,  reﬂecting  increased  participa­

tion  of  women.


Labor  share.  (Blanchard,  Caballero-Hammour).  Large  increase  in  con­
