2-6.  Productivity  growth,  output,  and

unemployment 


Some  quick  thoughts  at  the  end  of  the  course.  Looked  at  the  issues  through 
two  very  diﬀerent  approaches. 
• 

SVARs.  Shocks  and  propagation  mechanisms.  Just  interpreted  models. 
Minimum  theory.


• 

DMP  models.  Tightly  speciﬁed  models.  Productivity,  wage  bargaining,

proﬁts,  job  creation,  unemployment.

The  facts  as  I  see  them. 

• 

• 
• 

Productivity  shocks  build  slowly  over  time.  Eﬀect  on  output  is  limited 
at  the  start.  (Slow  diﬀusion  of  technology,  or  slow  anticipation  eﬀects 
on  demand  and  output?) 

Actual  unemployment  may  increase  at  the  start. 

Natural  rate  of  unemployment  appear  to  decrease  at  the  start.  At  a 
given  rate  of  inﬂation,  able  to  maintain  lower  unemployment.  (US  in 
the  1990s). 
At  this  stage,  anecdotal.  This  needs  to  be  done  right.

The  main  questions  as  I  see  them. 

• 

The nature of productivity growth.  Productivity growth versus  realloca­
tion. 
•	 How  does  productivity  growth  get  into  real  wages?  Neo-classical: 
Wealth  eﬀect  on  reservation  wage.  Relevant  for  the  unemployed?  Role 
of  unemployment  beneﬁts,  of  assets. 
The  Graal:  the  aggregate  wage  setting  equation:  slope,  and  shifts  (in 
particular  income  eﬀect)
