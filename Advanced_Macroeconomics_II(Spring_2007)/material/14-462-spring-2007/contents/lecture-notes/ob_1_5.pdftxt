1.5.  The  Great  Moderation


Lower  marginal  cost,  higher  markup  on  many  goods. 

Many  structural  changes  potentially  important  for  ﬂuctuations: 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Many  more. 

Globalization  and  wage  bargaining. 

Financial  market  development,  investment,  and  consumption 

So  unlikely  to  have  an  unchanging  underlying  process,  when  looking  at  data 
from,  say,  1970  to  2006. 

One  striking  fact.  Decrease  in  the  volatility  of  output.

Smaller  shocks  or  changes  in  the  propagation  mechanism? 

Monetary  policy  seems  to  be  much  better  since  the  early/mid  1980s?  How

much  credit  should  it  get?  First  pass:  Shocks  versus  propagation mechanism.


•

• 

Rolling AR  on GDP  growth  (20 quarters).  A  surprisingly  stable process. 
BS  Figure  2,  assuming  AR(1):  Clear  conclusion:  Smaller  shocks.


More  sophisticated:  Ahmed  et  al.  Multivariate  VARs.  Tables  6  and  7.

Monthly,  or  quarterly,  4  or  5  variables.  with  either  IP  (monthly),  or 
GDP. 
GDP:  roughly  2/3  variance.  Inﬂation:  roughly  4/5  prop  mechanism 

So  “good  luck”  rather  than  “better  policy”?  Not  so  fast.

Shocks  or  policy?  A  closer  look 

Even  if we  correctly  identify  the model,  policy  can  aﬀect  the  variance  of mea­
sured  structural  shocks.  A  simple  NK  example.  (More  elaborate/realistic 
model  in  Benati-Surico  2006).  Structural  model: 
yt  = E [yt+1 |Ωt ] − aRt−1  + xt 
xt  = ρ xt−1  + �t 
Rt  = bxt  + �Rt 

•

• 

First  equation:  Aggregate demand  (consumption), with R  the  real  rate, 
assumed  directly  under  the  control  of  the  central  bank.  R  is  assumed 
to  work  with  a  one-period  lag  to  make  the  point  below  stronger. 

Second  equation:  xt  is  a  demand  shock,  with  innovation  xt

Third equation; A simpliﬁed Taylor rule, with an interest rate white noise 
shock  �Rt

Implication:  An increase in b will reduce the variance of et :  Under a more active 
policy,  a  given  shock  to  aggregate  demand  will  have  less  eﬀect  on  expected 
output  (“Good  policy”  looks  like  “good  luck”.)  Consider  two  extreme  cases:

ρ 
1 − ρ 

b = 0:

yt  =

1 
1 − ρ

�t  +

• 

• 

b = ρ/a:

yt  = �t


Can changes  in b have an eﬀect mostly on the variance of et  rather than

on  the  propagation  mechanism?  Yes,  for  ρ  close  to  1,  and  b  not  too 
large.  Close  to 
1 − ab (1 + ρ + ρ2  + ...)
1 − ρ

Another  take.  Looking  at  the  eﬀects  of  the  price  of  oil

Do  given  observable  shocks  have  the  same  eﬀects  as  they  used  to?

Average  over  23  countries. 

Counfounding  various  shocks?  Decrease  in  productivity  growth,  labor  unrest?

Using  a  structural  VAR  approach. 
• 

VAR  in  oil  price,  GDP  deﬂator,  CPI,  nominal  wage,  and  output  (logs), 
over  1970-1984,  and  1986-2006,  quarterly.


• 

Assuming  that  the  price  of  oil  is  unaﬀected  by  other  shocks  within  the

quarter.  (So oil price on  lagged variables only, other variables on current 
oil  price  and  lagged  variables) 
•	 Impulse  responses:  Very  diﬀerent.  “First  round  eﬀects”.  “Second 
round”  eﬀects  in  the  ﬁrst  subsample,  not  in  the  second.  Similar  for 
other  G7. 

• 

Points  to  changes  in  propagation  mechanism.  Monetary  policy  and  an­
choring  of  expectations?  Wage  setting  and  real  wage  rigidity?

Tech and non-tech shocks, propagation mechanisms, and the great moderation


Simple  exercise  (conceptually): 

Take description of ﬂuctuations as coming from technological and other shocks

(a  la  Gali).  How  have  the  variance  of  innovations  and  the  propagation mech­

anisms  changed  over  time?

Gali-Gambetti:  Time-varying  version  of  Gali: 

• 

All  VAR  coeﬃcients  and  the  standard  deviation  of  the  residuals,  follow 
random  walks. 

• 

Innovations  to  coeﬃcients  and  to  standard  deviations  can  be  cross  cor­
related,  but  are  uncorrelated  with  shocks  at  all  leads  and  lags. 
•	 Identiﬁcation:  Only  the  technology  shock  aﬀects  labor  productivity  in 
the  long  run.

Three  main  conclusions 
• 

Large  decline  in  the  contribution  of  the  non-technology  shock  to  GDP. 
Fully  accounts  from  the  decline  in  overall  volatility 

• 

• 

Much  smaller  non-technology  shocks.  Average  initial  response:  1.0  pre­
1984,  0.5  post-84.  But  similar  hump  shaped  response  (propagation 
mechanism). 

Roughly  similar  technology  shocks,  and  similar  impulse  responses.  Av­
erage  initial  response:  0.4  pre-1984,  0.5  post-1984.  Average  long-run 
response:  0.8  in  both  cases. 

So  a  decrease  in  the  size  of  non-technological  shocks,  without  much  change 
in  propagation  mechanisms.  Back  to  why?  Policy,  or  luck?

Technology Shocks: Output ResponseOther  avenues 
•	 Increased  diversiﬁcation,  higher  micro-uncertainty  and  lower  macro-
uncertainty.  (Philippon-Cummins/Davis  et  al) 
Facts:  Increase  in  micro-uncertainty,  as  measured  by  variance  of  sales 
in  Compustat.  But  not  obviously  true  in  larger  universe  of  ﬁrms. 

• 

Decrease  in  liquidity/credit  constraints.  More  could  be  done  here,  on 
consumption,  and  on  investment  and  credit  constraints. 

• 

More  countercyclical  behavior  of  inventories.  Yes,  but  a  small  part  of 
the  story. 
•	 Composition:  more  services,  less  manufacturing:  No,  at  least  in  ac­
counting  sense. 

• 

Demographics.  (Jaimovich  and Siu).  Young have more  cyclical  employ­
ment  behavior.  Share  of  young  (15-29)  in  LF  has  decreased  (in  the US, 
from  a  maximum  of  38%  in  1980  to  27%  in  1999.
