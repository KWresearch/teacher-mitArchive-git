Job  destruction,  and  employment  protection.  I


•	 So  far,  only  creation  decision.  Clearly  both  creation  and  destruction 
margins.  So  endogenize  job  destruction. 

• 

Can  then  look  at  implications  of  employment  protection:  from  legally 
imposed  severance  payments  to  administrative  costs. 
Natural  environment  to  look  insider/outsider  models,  and  implications 
of  dual  employment  protection  systems. 
•	 Implications  for  unemployment,  reallocation,  growth.  Implications  for 
Europe.

Basic  model 

Start  with  the  same  model  as  before.  But  relax  the  assumption  of  constant 
productivity: 
• 

Matches  start  with  pty  y¯.  Then,  with  Poisson  parameter,  new  draw 
from  cdf  G(y),  on  [0  1]  for  notational  simplicity. 
•	 Firm/worker  can  separate.  The  worker  becomes  unemployed  and 
searches  for  another  job.  The  ﬁrm  can  post  a  new  vacancy,  and  search 
for  another  worker,  with  match  starting  at  y¯. 

• 

Could/should  distinguish  between  shocks  to matches  (machine  remains 
productive)  or  shocks  to  jobs  (machine  becomes  unproductive).  Does 
not  matter  if  capital  is  rented.

•	 No  aggregate  uncertainty,  so  constant  aggregates.  So,  rule  y∗ :  If  y < 
y∗ ,  separate.  If  y ≥ y∗ ,  continue. 

• 

For  the  moment,  no  cost  of  separation,  no  severance  payments.  Easier 
on  notation,  and  easier  to  introduce  later.  (For  simplicity,  stay  close  to 
Pissarides,  with  some  variations) 

Dynamics  of  unemployment 

Follow  same  approach  as  before: 
• 
• 
• 
• 

Value  functions  and  wage  bargaining. 

Job  creation  and  job  destruction. 

Characterization  of  the  equilibrium.

Dynamics  of  unemployment 
• 
• 
• 

Job  creation:  h = m(u, v) = θq(θ)u 
Job  destruction:  λG(y∗ )(1 − u)

Unemployment  dynamics  are  given  by: 

(h = u(h/v)(v/u) = uq(θ)θ)

u˙ = λG(y∗ )(1 − u) − θq(θ)u

Equilibrium unemployment.  Depends on y∗  and θ  (ﬂows, and duration):

λG(y∗ ) 
λG(y∗ ) + θq(θ) 
Eﬀects  of  EP:  presumably  lower  y∗ ,  so  lower  destruction.  and  lower  θ ,
longer  unemployment  duration.

Wage  determination 

Guess  that wages  take  form w(y).  Equations  for  the diﬀerent  value  functions. 
Need  to  index  E  and  J  by  y .  Ignore  the  time  derivative 
rV  = −c + q(θ)(J ( ¯y) − V )

�  1 
rJ (y) = (y − w(y)) + λ[G(y∗ )V  +

rU  = b + θq(θ)(E ( ¯y) − U )

Continuous  Nash  bargaining.  We  saw  the  eﬀect  of  β  before.  So,  for 
simplicity,  put  β  = 1/2,  so:

(J (y) − V ) = (E (y) − U )


Free  entry  condition  (same  discussion  as  in  previous  model,  not  an  at­
tractive  assumption  in  SR). 

V  = 0 

Solving  for  the  wage: 
• 

From  free  entry  condition: 

V  = 0 

⇒


J ( ¯y) = c/q(θ)

• 

From  equation  for  U  and  Nash  bargaining  equation: 
rU  = b + θq(θ)(E ( ¯y) − U ) = b + θq(θ)(J ( ¯y) − 0) = b + cθ

Interpretation. 
•  Compare  y∗  to  rU  = b + cθ .  Explanation.  Option  value. 
• 
Note  that  J (y∗ ) = 0  and  Nash  bargaining  implies  E (y∗ ) − U  = 0  (and
S (y∗ ) = 0). 
While the ﬁrm is taking the decision, the worker agrees with the decision, 

as  the  surplus  from  match  is  zero. 

Quits  versus  layoﬀs  in  this  context.  Makes  sense?

The  eﬀects  of  an  increase  in  unemployment  beneﬁts  b: 
• 
Shifts  the  job  destruction  locus  right:  θ  decreases.  y∗  increases.
• 

Higher  duration  of  unemployment,  higher  ﬂows  in  and  out  of  employ­
ment.  Higher  unemployment. 
•	 Beneﬁts  have  two  eﬀects:  (1)  through  the  reservation  wage,  and  thus 
the  cost  of  labor  (2)  through  search  intensity.  The  model  has  only  the 
ﬁrst  channel.  The  second  may  be  as  important  or  more  important. 

• 
Can  extend  matching  function  to m(su, v),  where  s  is  search  intensity. 
•	 Welfare?  Can  measure  the  eﬀect  on  E ,  U ,  and  E − U .  (An  increase 
in  b  decreases  E − U  (E − U  =  J  =  c/q(θ)).  Eﬀect  on  U  =  b + cθ  ? 
)  But  not  well  equipped  to  discuss  welfare:  Taxes  to  ﬁnance  beneﬁts? 
Linear  preferences.

Downward  sloping?  Not  necessarily  (why?),  but  likely.


Eﬀect  of  higher  beneﬁts.  Clockwise  rotation  of  the  ray  from  the  origin. 

Higher ﬂows at any level of employment, so outwards shift of the second

locus.

Higher  unemployment,  higher  duration,  lower  vacancies.
