1.1.  VARs,  Wold  representations  and  their  limits


A  brief  review  of  VARs.

Assume  a  true  model,  in MA  form:

X	 =  A0  e + A1  e(−1) + A2  e(−2) + ...; 
= (A0  + A1  L + A2  L2  + ...)  e 
=  A(L)  e 

E (ee� ) = I 

The  “e’s”  are  the  shocks,  A(L)  the  propagation  mechanism. 

Estimate  a  VAR,  rewritten  in MA  form: 
X	 =  u + C1  u(−1) + C2  u(−2) + ...; 
= (I + C1  L + C2  L2  + ...)  u 
=  C (L)  u 

E (uu� ) = Ω

Relation  of  true  shocks  to  VAR  residuals?

Identiﬁcation  of  A0 ?  A0  A�
0  = Ω:  not  enough.

In  2x2  case,  3  moments  in  Ω,  4  parameters  in  A0 .  need  for  one  more: 
Zeros,  or  short-run,  or  long-run  restrictions. 


Once  have  A0 ,  construct


A(L) = C (L)  A0 

Once  have  A(L),  can  derive  impulse  responses,  and  variance  decompo­
sitions.

Underlying  true  model  is  non-linear. 

Underlying  true  model  is  linear  but MA  is  non-fundamental. 

Underlying  true  model  is  linear  but  corresponding  VAR  has  very  long

Underlying true model  is  linear but more shocks  than  included variables.

1.  The  true  model  is  non-linear 

Not  all  is  lost:  The Wold  decomposition  theorem. 

Recall  deﬁnition  of  covariance  stationarity:  Let  Xt  be  a  random  variable  or  a 
vector  of  random  variables.  Then, Xt  is  covariance  stationary  iﬀ: 
EXt  = µ  for  all  t;  E (Xt  − µ)(Xt−k  − µ) = gk  for  all  t 

If  Yt  is  covariance  stationary,  then  it  can  be  represented  by  a  Wold  decom­
position  (an  inﬁnite MA  representation): 

Yt  = B (L)�t  + k(t) 

where  E �  = 0,  E �2  =  σ2  and  k(t)  is  a  deterministic  component  (Think 
mean). 

Limits:  covariance  stationarity?  Studying  the  Great  Depression,  hyperinﬂa­ 

tions.

Relation  of  this  representation  to  true  underlying  process  and  shocks?  Some

examples.

Example  1.  Markov  process 

Assume  true process  is given by 2-state Markov  (0,  1) process, with  transition 
probabilities: 
P (St  = 1|St−1  = 1) = p,  P (St  = 0|St−1  = 0) = q 
Check  that  this  process  has  the  following  AR(1)  representation: 
St  = (1 − q) + (p + q − 1)St−1  + �t 
where,  conditional  on  St−1  = 1, 
�t  = (1 − p)  with  probability  p,  = −p  with  probability  1 − p 
and  conditional  on  St−1  = 0, 
�t  = −(1 − q)  with  probability  q ,  = q  with  probability  1 − q 

We  can  estimate  this  process  and  get  “shocks”.  But  this  gives  us  a  poor 
understanding  of  the  underlying  process.

Example  2.  Caplin  and  Spulber 
Consider  price  setter,  with  desired  price  p∗ =  mt ,  actual  price  pit ,  non  de-
it 
creasing  process  for  money,  and  one-sided  Ss  rule: 
• 
If  pi  > p∗
i  + s  (s < 0),  no  adjustment 
•  If  pi  < p∗
i  + s,  then  adjust  to  p∗
i  + S 
Then,  using  the  ergodic  distribution: 

E [Δpi ] = Δm

E [Δpi |Δm, Δmi (−1), ...] = Δm

So,  non  linear  underlying  process  (with  “stickiness”),  but  no  lags  in  the  re­
gression  of  Δpi  on  Δm.  (For  much  more,  see  Caballero  Engel  2006,  and 
2004) 

Not  the  (second  equation)  of  the  Wold  representation  however.  What  about

E [Δpi |Δm, Δmi (−1), ..., Δpi (−1), Δpi (−2), ...  ?

2.  The  true  process  is  non  fundamental 

Example  1  (from  BQ  1993).  Estimate  process  for  xt  and  ﬁnd  it  to  be  white 
noise: 

xt  = ut 
Is  the  true  process  white  noise?  Are  ut ’s  the  true  shocks? 
•


Not  necessarily.  True  process  could  be: 
1 − λL

1 − λ−1L 

equivalently 

xt  = 

|
| 
et ,  λ > 1
� 
xt  = et  + (1 − λ2 ) 
λ−i et−i 
i≥1 

Note:  E (xt  xt−i ) = 0.  Exotic?

More  examples 

1.  Hump  shaped  response  of  x  to  a  shock  (not  all  hump  shapes  are  non 
fundamental...)  : 

True  process: 

xt  = et  + θet−1 ,  θ > 1 

Wold  representation: 

xt  = ut  + θ−1 ut−1 
where V (u) = θ2V (e) Again, very diﬀerent impulse responses.  Problem arises 
because  true  process  “non  fundamental” 

Process  “fundamental”  if  all  roots  of  the  MA  polynomial  are  on  or  outside 
circle.  “Invertible”  if  all  roots  are  strictly  outside  circle. 

2.  Consumption  example  from  Villaverde  et  al  (a  bit  contrived.  A  more 
realistic,  but  more  complex  one,  in  BQ  1993)

Optimizing  linear-quadratic  consumers,  with  β  = R−1  < 1. 
Labor  income  is  white  noise: 

yt  = et 
Consumption is given by a random walk, with shock equal to the annuity value 
of  the  change  in  the  PDV  of  labor  income: 
ct  = ct−1  + (1 − R−1 )et 
Suppose we only observe st  ≡ yt − ct , i.e.  saving out of labor income (diﬀerent 
from  saving).  Then: 
st  − st−1  = R−1 et  − et−1 
So  non  fundamental.  Estimate: 
st  − st−1  = ut  − R−1 ut−1 
True  process:  dEP DV (s)/de = 0 
Representation:  dEP DV (s)/du = 1 − R−1  > 0

3.  Long  lags  in  the  VAR 

Chari-Kehoe-McGrattan  attack  on  VAR:  Mostly  oﬀ  the  mark:  If  stationarity 
assumptions  about  variables,  or  identiﬁcation  restrictions  used  to  get  A0  are 
wrong,  then  implications  are  false.  But  one  potentially  correct  and  relevant 
point: 

For  a  class  of  models,  VAR  representation  may  require  very  long  lags. 
Example:  Simpliﬁed  RBC: 

yt  = kt  + et ;  kt  = ρ kt−1  + α et 
where  et  is  a  productivity  shock,  assumed  white  noise,  α  is  small,  and  ρ  is 
close  to  one. 
Interpretation:  Productivity  shock  with  large  contemporaneous  eﬀect,  then 
smaller,  but  long  lasting  eﬀect  through  capital. 

If  we  observe  both  output  and  capital,  no  problem.

Suppose  we  only  observe  output.  Then: 

1 − ρL

)  yt  = et 
( 
1 + α − ρL 
α  � 
ρ 
i 
( 
) 
1 + α 
1 + α 
i≥1 

yt  = 

or 

yt−i  + et

If α  is  small,  and ρ close  to one,  long  lags.  If not careful, will drop  them when 
estimating  VAR.

Will  be  more  of  an  issue  if  identifying  structural  VAR  from  long-run 
restrictions.


How  much  of  an  issue?  Depends  on  class  of  models.  More  relevant  in

standard  RBC  models  than  in  NK  models. 


A  natural  solution:  Include  capital  (slow  moving  state  variable).
