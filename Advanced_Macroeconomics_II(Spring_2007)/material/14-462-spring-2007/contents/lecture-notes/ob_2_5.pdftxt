2.  Productivity  shocks  and  unemployment  in  DMP 

Based  on  Shimer  (2005) 

• 

• 

• 

Standard  DMP,  exogenous  separation,  extended  to  allow  for  aggregate 
shocks.


Two types of aggregate shocks.  Shocks to y  and shocks to s, but  I shall 

ignore  the  shocks  to  s  here.

Go  back  to  the  basic  equation  characterizing  equilibrium  θ(≡ v/u)  (re­

call  q(θ) ≡ h/v):


c
(r + s) 
q(
θ) 

= (1 − β )(y − b) − β θc − c

� (

• 

• 

• 

Here  the  equation  takes  the  slightly  modiﬁed  form: 
= (1 − β )(y − b) − β θc − cλ(E q(θ � ) − q(θ)) 

c
(r + s) 
q(θ) 

where  λ  is  the  Poisson  arrival  rate  of  aggregate  shocks. 

Use  this  equation  to  look  at  θ  and  by  implication,  unemployment,  in 
response  to  shocks. 

First  ignore  the  last  term.  Deﬁne  �  as  the  elasticity  of  θ  to  y − b.  It  is

given  by: 

� = 

r + s + β θq(θ) 
(r + s)(θq � (θ)/q(θ) + β θq(θ)

• 

If  h = m = uα v1−α ,  then 

� = 

r + s + β (h/u) 
(r + s)(1 − α) + β (h/u) 

• 

• 

Now  put  values,  with  time  unit  a  month.  r  ≈  0.0, s  ≈  0.0  relative  to 
(h/u) = .4.  So  � ≈ 1.0. 
Take  a  productivity  shock  of  1%.  If  b  =  .4y ,  leads  to  an  increase  in 
y − b  of  (1/.6)%,  and  so  an  increase  in  v/u  of  (1/.6)%.  In  the  data, 
σv/u  = 38% 

So  very  small  movements  in  u  and  v .

Behind  the  scene:  the  adjustment  of  the  wage: 

w = (1 − β )b + β (y + cθ) 

To  ﬁt  the  steady  state  facts  (for  β  =  .7)  c =  .2.  So  an  increase  in  y  of
1%  leads  to  an  increase  of  .7  (1%  +  .2  1%)  =  0.9%.


Turning  to  full  dynamics.  Assume  AR(1)  process  for  productivity,  with

ρ =  .996,  and  σ = 0.0165.  (in  continuous  time,  but  irrelevant  here)

Implications 
• 
• 

Looks  like  a  rich  dynamic  equation.  And  it  is.  But: 

With  respect  to  productivity  shocks: 
Constant  employment,  hiring  rate.

Consumption  moves  one  for  one  with  productivity.

(Check  that Ct/At , Nt , xt  = ct  is a  solution with  respect  to movements

in  At ). 

• 

Invariance  of  employment  to  productivity  shocks:  Income/substitution
eﬀects,  and  no  capital  accumulation.

Model  inherits  RBC  implications  (take B = 0),  now  for  unemployment. 

If  capital  accumulation,  then  some  action,  but  close  to  RBC.

Interpretation.


Static relation π , x given current and expected productivity?  Reﬂects the same

dependence  on  the  expected  future.

Implication:  credibility determines position on  trade-oﬀ, not position of  trade-

oﬀ.

Or 

Back  to  the  inﬂation-unemployment  relation 
πt  = αgMλ xÞt  − Ψγ at 
Assume log productivity follows a stationary AR(1), with parameter ρa .  Then: 
πt  = −κ(1 − (1 − δ)(1 − x))  uÞt  − κ(1 − δ)(1 − x) Δut  − Ψγ at 
Note 
• 

Level and rate of change of unemployment rate.  Relative weights depend 
on  x.  More  sclerotic  market:  more  weight  on  Δu.


• 

If γ > 0, no “divine coincidence”  in  the presence of productivity  shocks.

Cannot  stabilize  both  unemployment  and  inﬂation.  (Recall  constrained 
eﬃcient  unemployment  is  constant).

Ad-hoc  monetary  policies: 

Assume  a  follows  an  AR(1)  with  ρ = .9  (quarterly) 
Two  labor  markets;  “Fluid”:  US:  x  =  .7  (quarterly),  u  =  .05.  “Sclerotic”: 
Europe  x =  .25  (quarterly),  u = 0.10. 

• 

Unemployment stabilization (constrained eﬃcient unemployment is con­
stant.)  Higher inﬂation in response to negative productivity shock.  0.8% 
for  1%. 
•	 Inﬂation  stabilization.  (Unemployment  equal  to  natural  rate,  subopti­
mal).  (Very)  large  increase  in  unemployment  in  response  to  negative 
shock. 
Larger  in  Europe  than  in  the  US:  9%  versus  6%:  x more  closely  related 
to Δn,  and  thus  Δu.

Conclusions/Extensions: 

Can  the  NK+DMP  model  explain  ﬂuctuations? 
• 

Model  gives  us  a  tool  to  think  about: 
relation  between  productivity  shocks,  unemployment,  and  inﬂation. 
the  role  of  monetary  policy  in  the  transmission  of  shocks. 

• 

• 

Practical  implications. 
Labor  market  diﬀerences  matter  for  inﬂation-unemployment  relation. 
No  divine  coincidence.  Flexible  inﬂation  targeting. 

Obvious  research  agenda  items. 
Nature,  extent,  origins  of  real  wage  rigidities.  Internal  organization  of 
ﬁrms? 
Back  to  the  Shimer  puzzle,  with  inﬂation/real  wages/unemployment, 
and  productivity  and  non  productivity  shocks.
