True  model: 

X  = (A0  + A1  L + A2  L2  + ...)  e = A(L)e; 

E (ee� ) = I 

Estimated  model: 

X  = (u + C1  L + C2  L2  + ...)  u = C (L)u;

Identiﬁcation  1.  Choleski  orderings  and  decomposition 
There  exists  a  unique  lower  triangular  matrix  S  such  that  SS �  = Ω.  Can  use

it.  One  for  each  ordering  of  the  variables  in  u.

Does  it  make  sense?  Sometimes:

If  price  set  in  advance  by  price-setters: 


p = a11  es  ;  q = a21  es  + a22  ed

This  corresponds  to  a  Choleski  ordering,  with  p  ﬁrst  (a12  = 0)

Identiﬁcation  2.  Short-run  restrictions 

Zero  restrictions  or  parameters  set  from  other  information,  for  A0 .  Example 
from  Blanchard-Watson,  1987: 

Four  variables  Y , P , G, M .  VAR  residuals  y , p, g , m.  Four  underlying  shocks 
es , ed , eg , em .  Four  postulated  relations:  AS,  AD,  ﬁscal  and  monetary  rules: 

AS 
AD 

y  =  b1  p + σs  e s 
y  =  b2  m − b3  p + b4  g + σd  e d 
g  =  c1  y + c2  p + σg  eg 
m  =  c3  y + c4  p + σm  e m 

Get  c1 , c2  from  tax  and  spending  rules  (no  discretionary  ﬁscal  policy  within 
the quarter).  Leaves 10 parameters (6 parameters, and 4 standard deviations). 
10  moments  in  Ω. 
Non  linear  system.  Alternative,  and  more  intuitive:  IV  approach:  eg  as  an  IV 
for  p  in  AS,  es  and  eg  as  IV  in  money  rule,  em , eg , es  as  IV  in  AD.

Identiﬁcation  3.  Inequality  restrictions 

Back  to  supply-demand  system.  May  be  reasonable  to  assume  a  range  of

price-elasticity  for  supply.

For  a  given  price-elasticity,  and  uncorrelated  supply  and  demand  shocks,  can

estimate  demand.  And  draw  impulse  responses.


Uhlig’s  2004  application  to  monetary  policy  shocks.


Useful detour:  Note  that any A0  must be an orthogonal  transformation of  the

Choleski  matrix  S .  Assume  A0  = SQ  for  arbitrary  matrix  Q.  Then:

⇔ 
QQ�  = I
A0A�
0  = SQQ�S �  = Ω 
An orthogonal matrix has orthogonal rows (and columns) and row and column 
lengths  equal  to  one.

In  2x2  case,  an  orthogonal  matrix  can  be  parameterized  by  one  parameter:

or 

cos(θ)  − sin(θ) 
sin(θ) 
cos(θ) 

Q = 

cos(θ) 
sin(θ) 
sin(θ)  − cos(θ) 

Uhlig:  All  values of  θ  such  that  the  impulse  response  function  associated with 
a  given  A0  = S Q(θ)  and  A(L) = C (L)  A0  satisfy  some  condition. 

Variables:  Real GDP, GDP deﬂator, commodity price index, total reserves,non­
borrowed  reserves,  federal  funds  rate,  monthly  1965-1996.  (How  is  real  GDP 
constructed?) 

Condition:  Responses  to  a  (negative)  monetary  policy  shock:  non-borrowed 
reserves  and  price  level  non  positive;  federal  funds  rate,  non  negative,  up  to 
K  = 5.

Identiﬁcation  4.  Long-run  restrictions 
Suppose we believe  that  some  shocks have  long  run  eﬀects on  some  variables,

and  some  do  not.  Can  we  use  this  information  for  identiﬁcation?  The  answer

is  yes.

� 
� 
� 
� 
� � 
Example.  BQ  1989.

Suppose  true  model  is  given  by:


Δy 
a11 (L)  a12 (L) 
e1 
a21 (L)  a22 (L) 
e2 
x
where  Δy  is  the  rate  of  change  of  output,  and  x  is  another  variable,  both 
� 
� 
� 
� 
� � 
stationary,  and  e1  and  e2  are  true  shocks,  say  technology  and  other  shock. 
The MA  representation  of  the  VAR  is  given  by: 

= 

u1 
u2 

Δy 
x

= 

c11 (L)  c12 (L) 
c21 (L)  c22 (L) 

Assume that, while the technological shock has long run eﬀects on output, the

other  shock  does  not.  This  gives  us  our  additional  identiﬁcation  assumption:

The  restriction  on  the  true  model  is: 

[A(1)]12  = 0 

As  A(L) = C (L)  A0 ,  Ω = S S � ,  and  A0  = SQ,  these  imply: 

[C (1)A0 ]12  = [C (1)SQ]12  = 0 

From  estimation, we  have  estimates  of C (1)  and  S ,  so  all we  have  to  do  is  to 
solve  for  Q,  equivalently  for  the  free  parameter  θ. 

Then,  same  steps  as  before. 

How  to  choose  the  second  variable  (or  the  set of other  variables  than  technol­
ogy)?  Has  to  be  aﬀected  by  both  shocks,  be  stationary.  BQ:  U  rate.  But,  if 
only  two  shocks,  any  other  variable  should  give  same  results...

Extension  1.  More  variables. 
Why?  If  more  than  one  non-technology  shock.  Can  still  identify  the 
technology  shock,  if  the  only  one  to  have  permanent  eﬀects  on  produc­
tivity.  No  need  to  identify  each  of  the  others. 
Add  real  balances,  real  interest  rates,  and  inﬂation.  Similar  results. 


Extension  2.  Other  countries. 
Very  useful,  for  two  reasons.  Darwinian  eﬀects  at  work  on  US  data. 
Possibly  diﬀerent  shocks  (think  Chile,  or  Norway).  Here,  just  major 
OECD countries.  (Δy/n,  Δn for all countries except France (detrended 
n) 
Good  news:  Consistency:  In  all  countries,  technology  shocks  lead  to  an 
increase  in  output,  an  initial  decrease  in  hours. 
Potentially  less  good  news:  Tech  shocks:  No  build-up  of  output  over 
time.  LR  eﬀects  of  non-tech  shocks  on  employment.

• 

Structural VARs best used when class of models in mind.  Does the class 
ﬁt,  and  what  does  this  suggest  about  the  parameters?  (Nice  example 
away  from macro:  Job market  paper  by  Kline  on  eﬀects  of  oil  prices  on 
labor  market  in  Texas) 
If  too  broad  (few  constraints  on  A0 ),  hard  to  interpret  the  data  in  a 
useful  way  (Choleski  decompositions  in  the  1980s). 
If  too  narrow,  then  better  to  use  a  more  structural  approach.  Then, 
compare  it  to  a  VAR  or  structural  VAR. 

• 

An  emerging  picture: 
Tech  shocks  at  medium/low  frequency.  Increase  output  over  time.  Ap­
pear  to  decrease  employment  initially. 
Non-tech  shocks  at  higher  frequency.  Increase  output  and  employment 
for  some  time. 
Some  uncertainty  as  to  relative  importance.
