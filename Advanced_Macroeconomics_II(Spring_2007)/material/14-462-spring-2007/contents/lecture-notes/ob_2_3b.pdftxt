2.  Introducing  employment  protection  in  the  DMP  model 

• 

Same  assumptions  as  before.  y  from  cdf  G(y),  and  Poisson  parameter 
λ. 
•	 Two  types  of  state-imposed  costs.  Severance  payments,  T .  Pure  ﬁring 
costs,  F  (administrative/legal  steps,  waste). 

• 

• 

Assume  labor  contracts  now  include  the  wage  w(y)  and—clear  why
later—, potential payment of workers to ﬁrms contingent on separation, 
X .


Eﬀects  of  T  and  F  on  wages  and  the  threshold.  thus  on  job  creation,

destruction,  and  unemployment?

3.  Wage  bargaining 

If  ﬁrm  and  worker  do  not  agree,  does  the  ﬁrm  have  to  pay  the  severance 
payments,  and  the  ﬁring  costs? 
•	 If  not:  Can  think  of  ex-ante  wage  setting,  with  commitment  by  the 
worker  not  to  renegotiate. 

• 
• 

If  yes:  Then  can  think  of  ex-post  wage  setting. 

Maybe,  ex-ante  ﬁrst  time  around,  then  ex-post  when  renegotiate  after 
a  shock.  (Pissarides  version). 

If  ex-ante,  with  symmetric  Nash: 
(J (y) − V ) = (E (y) − U )


If  ex-post: 

J (y) − (V  − T  − F ) = E (y) − (U  + T )

Deriving  the  wage  under  ex-ante  bargaining 

As  before:

J ( ¯y) = c/q(θ)

Use  (J (y) − E (y)) = (V  − U ) = −U  to  get: 
(r + λ)(−U ) = (y − 2w(y))+ λG(y∗ )(−U −F − 2T + 2X )+ λ(1−G(y∗ ))(−U )

Many  ways  of  achieving  it:  diﬀerent  combinations  of  w(y)  and  X . 
• 
If  X  = 0,  wage  lower  by  −λG(y∗ )(T  + F /2).
• 
Or  if  X  =  T  + F /2,  pay  the  same  wage  as  before:  w(y)  =  (1/2)(y +
b + cθ).  In  case  of  separations,  workers  pay  back  severance  and  half  of 
ﬁring  costs. 
•	 Payment  upfront?  “Bonding”.  Realistic?  Realistic  approximations: 
Steep  wage  contracts.

4.  Job  creation  with  ex-ante  wage  bargaining. 

Assume (for convenience, as the division between w(y) and X  does not matter 
for  job  creation),  w(y) = (1/2)(y + b + cθ),  and  X  = T  + F /2. 

J ( ¯y) = c/q(θ)

(r + λ)(J ( ¯y) − J (y∗ )) =  ( ¯y − y∗ )

This  implies 

Interpretation  (remember  β  = 1/2).  Sharp  distinction  between  transfers 
(legally  imposed  severance  payments)  and  other  costs.

What  if  the  ﬁrm  takes  the  decision  unilaterally?  If  it  does,  then  y∗  is

J (y∗ ) = −F  − T  + X

From  Nash  bargaining,  E (y∗ ) − U  = J (y∗ ),  so


S (y∗ ) = −2F  − 2T  + 2X + F

For  S (y∗ ) = 0,  it  must  be  that  X  = T  + F /2


Do  we  observe  such  transfers?  What  if  not?

if  breakdown,  ﬁrm  has  to  pay  T  +  F ,  workers  receive  F ,  so,  under  Nash

The  1990  reform: 
• 

In  case  of  layoﬀs,  can  take  employers  to  court,  and  argue  dismissal  is 
unfair.  If  unfair,  payments  range  between  5  and  14  months. 

• 

Until 1990, ﬁrms under 15 workers exempt  for  these  rules.  In 1990, now

where  i  is worker,  j  is  ﬁrm,  t  is  time, mij t  is  a  dummy,  1  if move  (separation, 
or  accession),  Dt , Dk , Dr  are  time,  sectoral,  and  regional  dummies.  D  is  1  if 
worker  employed  in  small  ﬁrm,  0  otherwise.  P ostt  is  1  post-1990. 
For  ﬁrms:  volatility  of  employment. 
�ΔLj t � = Dt  + Dk  + Dr  + Zj tβ + δ1D + δ2 (D ∗ P ostt ) + �ij t 
And  probability  of  entry  and  exit: 
ej t  = Dt  + Dk  + Dr  + Wj tβ + δ1D + δ2 (D ∗ P ostt ) + �ij t 
where  ej t  is  a  dummy  equal  to  1,  if  entry—or  if  exit.

Two  issues.  I.  Political  economy  of  employment  protection.  Notes 
• 

Protect  insiders  at  the  expense  of  new  entrants.  Median  voter  is  the 
insider,  by  a  large  margin.


• 

• 

Introduction  of  ﬁxed-term  contracts  at  the margin.  Example  of  France.

Can  be  perverse  (Blanchard-Landier): 

Larger  protection  for  insiders,  so  higher  wages.

Higher  threshold  productivity  to  keep  outsiders,  so  more  turnover,  less

training.


Emergence  of  a  dual market.  For  the  young,  sequence  of  bad  (no  train­

ing)  jobs  and  unemployment,  for  the  old,  good  (permanent  contract) 
jobs.

Is  reform  politically  feasible?  (Saint-Paul,  in  particular  NBER  Macroeco­
nomics,  1993) 
• 

Median  voter:  insider.  So  introduce  ﬁxed-term  contracts  for  new  work­
ers.  Both  types  of  workers  may  be  for  it:  Insiders  still  protected.  If 
become  unemployed,  easier  to  get  a  job.

• 

Time  consistency  problem.  Proportion  of  workers  with  permanent  con­
tracts  decreases  over  time.  At  some  t∗ ,  median  voter  becomes  a  ﬁxed-
term  contract  worker. 
May  vote  to  eliminate  permanent  contracts 
Anticipation  of  this  change  leads  permanent  contract workers  to  be  less 
willing  to  accept  reform  at  t = 0. 
Can reform be implemented?  If t∗  high enough.  If reform is slow enough. 
If  conversion  clauses  are  tough  enough.  (Not  the  end.  Renegotiation  at 
t < t∗ ?)

Complications.  Moral hazard in search, so limits on unemployment insur­
ance.  Then,  justiﬁed  to  distort  separation  decision.  Higher  employment 
protection.  Layoﬀ  tax. 

Complications.  Ex-post  wage  setting.  Firm  may  not  be  able  to  get  a 
lower  wage  in  exchange  for  insurance.  Then,  lower  layoﬀ  tax.

Wage  setting  with  ex-post  wage  bargaining 
Assume  X  = 0  (cannot  commit  to  payments  from  workers  in  case  of  lay­
oﬀ ).  Then  same  steps.  Start  with  equation  for  J (y) − E (y),  and  use  Nash 
bargaining  relation  to  get: 
(r + λ)(V  − U  − F  − 2T ) =  y − 2w(y) + λ[G(y∗ )(V  − U  − F  − 2T )] 
+(1 − G(y∗ ))(V  − U  − F  − 2T ) 

Derive  the  equation  for  rU  and  replace: 
−b − cθ − θq(θ)(2T  + F ) = (y − 2w(y))

In  Pissarides  (Chapter  9),  given  the  two-wage  structure,  rU  is  still  given  by


rU  = b + cθ 


.

This  simpliﬁes  things  a  lot,  for  the  wage  equation,  for  job  destruction,  and

eliminates  some  ambiguities  (which  may  however  be  relevant:  Higher  wages, 

higher  threshold,  higher  destruction).

Two eﬀects of F :  directly, through rF , decreases separations.  indirectly, 
through  the  increase  in  rU ,  which  increases  increases  separations. 

Under  eﬃcient  separations,  the  eﬀect  of  T  is  only  to  increase  rU  and
thus  to  increase  separations. 

What  if  the ﬁrm  chooses unilaterally  to  layoﬀ  the worker?  It will  choose y∗  so 
J (y∗ ) = −F  − T 

This  implies: 
S (y∗ ) = J (y∗ ) + F  + E (y∗ ) − U  = 2(J (y∗ ) + F  + T ) = 0 

So  the  separation  decision  can  be  left  to  the  ﬁrm;  the  ﬁrm  will  layoﬀ  the 
worker  when  the  surplus  from  the  match  is  equal  to  zero.
