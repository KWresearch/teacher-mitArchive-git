A  framework  to  think  about  unemployment


From  the  facts: 
• 
Large  job  creation/destruction.  Flows  of  workers 
•	 Decentralized  market.  At  any  point  of  time,  workers  looking  for  jobs, 
jobs  looking  for  workers. 

• 

Bargaining  power.  Depends  on  technology,  state  of  the  market.


So:  Matching/bargaining/ﬂow models.  Built on search and bargaining theory. 
Mortensen.  Pissarides.  Diamond.  So  DMP. What  they  leave  out: 
• 
• 
• 

Internal  wage  structure.  Firms  as  sets  of  jobs  and  workers. 

Collective  bargaining 

Many  interesting  questions  at  these  two  connections.

1.  The  matching  function 
• 

Treating  the  matching  process  as  a  black  box.  The  matching  function 
(parallel to production function):  u unemployment, v  vacancies, h hires. 

h	 = m(u, v)  mu  > 0, mv  > 0, mvu  > 0 
•	 Constant  returns?  Could  think  of  congestion,  or  increasing  returns. 
Evidence  suggests  roughly  CRS.  So  can  write: 
u 
h  = m( 
v ), 
h  = m(1, 
, 1) 
v 
v 
u 
u 

h/u:  exit  rate  from  unemployment.  (in  steady  state,  inverse  of  average 
duration  of  unemployment).  same  for  vacancies. 
Convenient  to  deﬁne  θ ≡ v/u,  and  the  function  q :

• 

h  = q(θ),  q �  < 0  so 
v 

h  = 
u 

h  v  = θq(θ) 
v  u

•	 θ  index  of  labor  market  tightness.  The  tighter  the  market,  the  lower

Matching  function  and  the  data.  Measurement  issues: 
Equivalent  of  u:  From  previous  lecture,  many  searchers  in  employment 
and  not  in  labor  force.  Distinguishing  between  short  and  long-term 
unemployed  because  of  diﬀerent  search  intensity? 
Equivalent  of  v .  For  the US,  help wanted  index, with many  problems  at 
medium/low  frequencies.  Since  2001,  index  from  JOLTS  (BLS,  estab­
lishment  survey).

2.  First  pass  at  comparative  statics  and  dynamics 

Dynamics  of  unemployment.  Normalize  labor  force  to  1,  so: 
u˙ = s(1 − u) − m(u, v)

•	 s  constant  separation  rate.  Counterfactual,  will  relax  and  endogenize 
later. 

• 

All  movements  between  employment  and  unemployment.  Counterfac­
tual  also. 

Dynamics  of  vacancies?  Assume: 

v 
, x), fv/u  < 0, fx  > 0 
v˙ = f ( 
u 

where  x  shifts  underlying  labor  demand  (proﬁtability).

Behind  the  equation:  The  tighter  the  labor  market,  the  higher  the  wage,  the

lower  proﬁt,  and  the  lower  the  rate  of  job  creation.  Later  on:  Look  at  wage

setting,  and  job  creation.

In  u, v  space  (Beveridge  curve  space): 
⇒ 
s(1 − u) = m(u, v)
Downward  sloping.  Higher  unemployment  increases  hires  and  decreases  sep­
arations.  To  maintain  equilibrium,  vacancies  must  decrease. 
(Another  way:  To  maintain  a  given  ﬂow  of  hires,  need  either  high  u.  low  v, 
or  low  u  and  high  v.) 

u˙ = 0

Ray  from  the  origin.  There  is  a  unique  ratio  of  vacancies  to  unemployment 
such  that  the  proﬁt  of  ﬁrms  is  consistent  with  zero  vacancy  creation.

⇒ 

Equilibrium  is  stable.  Counterclockwise  movements.

3.  Wage  determination 

Let U , E  be  the  values  associated with  being  currently  unemployed,  currently 
employed.  These  follow: 

h )(E − U ) + U˙

rU  = b + ( 
u 
rE  = w + s(U  − E ) + E˙

Note  in  particular: 
• 

Workers  have  linear  preferences.  Incorporate more  standard  preferences 
later. 

• 

b:	 wage  equivalent  of  being  unemployed,  including  unemployment  ben­
eﬁts,  leisure. 
•	 Could  distinguish  between  wi  and  w  (Ei  and  E ).  No  need  to,  as  we 
look  at  symmetric  equilibrium.

Firm  owners  have  linear  preferences 

c  is  the  ﬂow  cost  of  posting  a  vacancy.  Likely  to  be  small.  Return  to 
this  when  discussing  free  entry  condition  later.


Separations  come  from  matches,  not  jobs,  becoming  unproductive.  If, 

instead,  it  were  jobs,  then  the  last  two  equations  would  become:

rV  = c − sV  + (

rJ  = y − w − sJ + J˙

The  wage  band 

Wage  that  makes  workers  indiﬀerent  to  working  or  not: 
⇒


E  = U

w = b


Wage  that  makes  ﬁrms  indiﬀerent  to  hiring  or  not: 
⇒


J  = V

w = y


So,  within  this  wage  band,  both  sides  will  be  willing  to  produce. 

Wage  could  stay  constant  within  the  band.  Reasonable  to  think  that  bar­
gaining  will  determine  the  outcome.  Convenient  (but  not  more  than  that) 
assumption:  Nash  bargaining. 
S  ≡ (J − V  + E − U ) 

J − V  = (1 − β )S,  (E − U ) = βS

Various ways of characterizing the wage (with additional assumptions on entry, 
can  be  made  simpler.  More  below).  Using  the  equations  above:

Some  alternative  approaches  to  wage  setting 

• 

Posted wages.  Directed  search.  Trade-oﬀ between wage and probability 
of  getting  a  job.

Very  diﬀerent  eﬃciency  properties.  No  bargaining  after  meeting.

Why  do  we  see  some  ﬁrms  post  wages,  and  others  not?  (Look  at

announcements  in  newspapers.

•	 Eﬃciency  wages.  E − U  ≥  B .  Role  of  h/u.  Often  easier.  (Shapiro-
Stiglitz)

4.  Job  creation  and  equilibrium


• 

Can  think  of  the  cost  of  creating  a  vacancy  as  the  cost  of  creating  a 
job.  Buying  a  machine,  cost  of  which  is  then  sunk.  So  V  = pK 
Then,  cost  of  adjustment  from  installation  costs,  or  production  of  new 
machines. 
•	 Tradition  in  this  class  of  models:  Capital  is  rented,  and  needs  to  be 
installed  only when worker  is  recruited.  In which  case  y  is  output  net  of 
user  cost.  Then  V  = 0,  and  only  cost  is  ﬂow  cost  of  posting,  c. 

• 

• 

Second  route  much  less  convincing  (size  of  c? ) 
Avoids  important  hold  up  issues.  (Caballero  book). 

Implausible  short  run  dynamics  (v  can  adjust  freely).


Shall—reluctantly—follow  tradition  here,  for  ease  of  comparison.

Eliminating S˙ between the two equations gives the wage as a function of  labor 
market  tightness  (note  time  derivatives  are  gone) 
w = (1 − β )b + β y + β θc


Note  the  simplicity  of  the  relation.  The  tighter  the  market,  the  higher  the 
wage.  (note  also  that  the  eﬀect  of  tightness  is  additive,  not  through  the 
relative  weights  on  b  and  y 

Next  step  is  to  determine  labor  market  tightness.  From  V  = 0,  and  the 
equation  of  J : 
(r + s)J  = y − w + J˙

Using  J  = c/q(θ)  (which  implies  J˙ = −cq � (θ)/(q(θ)2 θ˙)):

Finally,  unemployment  is  given  by:

vacancies)  adjusts  over  time  to:

Use  the  maximum  principle  to  solve.  The  Hamiltonian  is  given  by: 
Ht  = (1 − ut )y + ut b − cθtut  + µt (s(1 − ut ) − ut θt q(θt )) 

So: 

Hθ  = 0 

⇒ 

c = −µt (θt q � (θt ) + q(θt ))

µ˙t  = (r + s − θ2 q � (θt ))µt  + (y − b)
⇒ 
µ˙ − rµ = −Hu

The  two  equations  give  a  diﬀerential  equation  for  µ, which  is  unstable.  Thus, 
the  solution  is  given  by  µ˙ = 0,  which  implies;

The  two  are  the  same  iﬀ β  = −θq � (θ)/q(θ).  Known  as  the Mortensen/Hosios 
condition. 
• 

Interpretation.  Share  going  to  labor  has  to  be  equal  to  its  contribution 
to  matching,  measured  by  the  elasticity  of  h/v  with  respect  to  u/v 
In the Cobb Douglas case , h = muα v1−α .  Then the condition is β  = α.

• 
• 

No particular reason for this condition to be satisﬁed.  α around 0.5, most 
estimates of β  around or below 0.2.  So too low a level of unemployment.

Hartz reform dummies, alone and  interacted with group dummy,  reﬂect­
ing  role  of  employment  agency  for  that  group.  The  less  involved,  the 
smaller  the  predicted  eﬀect  of  the  reforms.

Results. 

Tables  1  and  5. 
• 

Matching  function  itself.  A  bit  strange. 
Zero  coeﬃcient  on  V .  (Plausible?  Measurement  of  vacancies?) 
Negative  coeﬃcient  on  u?  Coeﬃcient  on  U  in  the  second  sample? 

• 

Interaction eﬀects look plausible.  Bigger eﬀect on group 1 than on group 
2  and  so  on. 

Not  a  triumph:  serious  data  issues.  But  an  indication  of  how  we  can  get  at 
some  of  the  parameters  of  the  basic  model.

6.  Tentative  conclusions 
•	 A  very  useful  framework.  Flows.  Matching.  Bargaining.  Cre­
ation/detruction. 

• 

• 

• 

Diagnostic  tools:  Matching  function,  Beveridge  curve,  wage  curve?

Problem:  Wages  largely  a-cyclical.  Nominal  rigidities.  So  Phillips  curve 
as  tool.  But  speciﬁc  form? 

The  set  of  factors  aﬀecting  unemployment. 
Some factors aﬀect the Beveridge curve, some aﬀect the matching func­
tion,  some  aﬀect  the  wage  curve. 
Unemployment beneﬁts.  Through search, aﬀect matching and Beveridge 
curve.  Through  reservation  wage,  aﬀect  wage. 

Can  relate  to  and  use  parameters  from  micro  studies  (with  care).

• 

Endogenous  destruction.  Link  to  reallocation.  Cycles  and  reallocation. 
Growth  and  reallocation.

Asymmetric  information  and  bargaining. 


Concave  preferences,  risk  aversion.  Saving,  unemployment  insurance. 

Nominal  rigidities.  Pressure  on wages,  or  pressure  on  inﬂation.  Integra­
tion  in  standard  BC  models.
