They  consider  two  identiﬁcation  schemes: 
•	 SR  restriction:  The  second  shock  has  no  contemporaneous  eﬀect  on 
TFP:  a012  = 0. 
•	 LR  restriction:  The  second  shock  has  no  long  run  eﬀect  on  TFP: 
a12 (1)  =  0.  (Equivalently:  all  long-run  movements  in  TFP  are  due 
to  the  ﬁrst  shock).

Main  result:  The  impulse  responses  of  the  second  shock  under  SR  or  the  ﬁrst 
shock  under  LR  are  very  similar  (Figures  2  and  3,  and  8) 
• 

The  shock  with  long  run  eﬀects  on  TFP  has  little  initial  eﬀect  on  TFP, 
but  a  large  initial  eﬀect  on  stock  prices 

• 

The shock with no short run eﬀects on TFP has the same dynamic eﬀect 
on  TFP,  and  a  large  eﬀect  on  stock  prices. 
•	 When  tracing  the  eﬀects  on  other  variables,  initial  positive  eﬀect  on 
output  (0.2%,  building  over  time  to  1%  after  2  years.  id  for  for  C,  and 
I.  Little  initial  impact  on  hours. 

Relation  to  BQ  and  Gali  papers.  In  fact,  quite  similar:

Beaudry-Portier  interpretation: 
•	 Anticipations  of  technological  shocks,  increasing  demand.  (Alterna­
tively,  anticipated,  but  slowly  diﬀusing  technology  improvements). 
•	 Technological  shocks  or  waves?  A  time  series  issue.  Slowly  changing 
underlying  growth  rate  of  TFP:  well  captured  by  VARs?

Next  questions.  taken  up  by  Guido


• 

• 

• 

Can  we  construct  a  model  which  delivers?  Is  there  a  need  for  nominal 
rigidities?  (Rebello-Jaimovich  versus  NK  models)


What  are  the  non-technological  shocks?  “Sentiment,  demand”?


Anticipations  of  technological  improvements  not  realized  ex-post? 
(Lorenzoni) 

Or,  just  exogenous  shifts  in  pessimism  or  optimism?  Can  we  tell? 
(Cochrane,  Barsky-Sims) 

Implications  for  optimal  policy.  (Lorenzoni)
