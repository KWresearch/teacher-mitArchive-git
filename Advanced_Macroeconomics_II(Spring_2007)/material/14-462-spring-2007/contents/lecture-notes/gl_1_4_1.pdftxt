•	 old  idea:  expectations  drive  business  cycle 

•	 uncertainty  about  the  economy’s  fundamentals,  which  will  determine  the 
long  run  equilibrium 

•	 partial  equilibrium  ideas 

•	 consumption:  from  permanent  income  hypothesis  future  income  expecta-
tions matter  for  consumption  decisions 

investment:  high  expected  returns

•  basic  fundamental  for  long-run  growth:  TFP 

•  can  expectations  about  long-run  TFP  drive  cycle? 

•  how  to measure  expectations? 

•  Beaudry-Portier  (2005):  use  the  stock-market

Main  conclusions: 

•  both  identiﬁcations  give  similar  shocks 

•  response  of  C  and  Y  builds  up,  then  permanent 

•  response  of  H  has  hump  then  dies  out  slowly

at  = ρat−1 + (cid:18)t−T 

•	 What  happens  at  the  time  of  the  announcement? 

•	 Consumption  increases,  investment  and  hours  fall! 

•	 Danthine,  Donaldson  and  Johnsen  (1997),  Beaudry  and  Portier  (2005): 
nothing  that  looks  like  business  cycles.

•	 If  At  unchanged  cannot  have  It  ↑,Ct  ↑. 

•	 Changing  intertemporal elasticity and elasticity of  labor  supply can change 
response  of Ct  and  It,  but  cannot  give  right  combination. 

•	 Adjustment  costs  in Kt  can  give  It  ↑  but  then  Ct  ↓.
