Problem  3 
Consider  an  economy  populated  by  a  continuum  of  households  [0> 1] located  on 
dierent  islands. 
Each household has an endowment {¯ = 1 of gold.  Each household is made of 
a  consumer  and  a  producer.  At  the  beginning  of  the  day  the  producer  sets  the 
price  sl .  Then  the  consumer  l  travels  to  an  island  m ,  randomly  assigned.  Then 
the preference shock l  is  realized.  The consumer observes l  and buys  fl  units 
of  the good  produced in island  m .  At  the  same  time  the  producer  is  selling  |l

to  some  other  consumer.  Then  the  consumer  returns  home  and  consumes  the 
gold: 
 
sm fl  + sl|l .
{l  = ¯{
The  central  imperfection  is  that  agents  do  not  observe  |l  (sales) at the  time  of 
making  the  purchases  fl . 
Preferences  are  as  follows 

H [x (fl > l ) + z ({l )



where  fl  is  consumption,  {l

and  y (ql ) is  a  convex  function. 
The  production  function  in  each  island  is  linear  and  given  by: 

|l  = ql . 
For  simplicity,  let  fl ,{l  and  ql  vary  in  (4> +4),  and  disregard  all  non-
negativity  constraints. 
The  preference  shocks  are  generated  by: 

l  =  + l

where    and  l  are  independent  gaussian  random  variables with mean  zero  and 
variances

Consider  a  symmetric  equilibrium  where  sl  =  s.  For  the  purpose  of  this 
exercise  we  will  ﬁx  s  (i.e.  disregard  the  optimality  condition  for  prices  at  the 
beginning  of  the  period). 

(i)  Write  down  the  consumer  ﬁrst  order  condition  and  derive  the  optimal 
choice  of  fl  as  a  function  of  l  and  Hl  [|l ]. 
(ii) Show that s determines the degree of strategic complementarity in spend­
ing.  Comment. 
(iii)  Find  the  equilibrium  output  |  in  the  case  of  perfect  information. 
(iv)  Go  back  to  the  case  where  agents  only  observe  l .  Find  a  linear  equi­
librium  of  the  type
