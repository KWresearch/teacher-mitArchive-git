Problem  1 
Consider  the  model  in  Lorenzoni  and  Walentin,  that  we  have  seen  in  class  (see  slides  for 
notation).  Consider  a  simpliﬁed  version  where    = 0  and   H 
=  F 
=    and    = 0  (no 
adjustment  costs).  The  production  function  is Cobb-Douglas. 
Consider  the  case where  there  is  no  aggregate  shocks:  D = 1.  Suppose  the  initial  condition 
for  the  economy  is  that  the  entrepreneurs have  initial  capital N0  and zero  liabilities E0  = 0. 
We will  study  the  transitional dynamics  of  this  economy.  We will use  the  same  approach  as 
in the paper deﬁning a recursive equilibrium,  let’s  try  the  simple  state  space [ = N (this  is 
almost  right,  except  at  date  0,  you  can  ﬁx  this  problem as  you prefer). 

1.  Deﬁne the entrepreneurs problem in recursive term and derive the optimality conditions 
and  envelope  condition.

2.  Let N W  be  such  that   
= 1.  Let  us  conjecture  that K (N ) (the  law

of  motion  for  aggregate  capital)  is  a  non-decreasing  function  and  that N is  such  that 
ˆ =  N W . Argue  that  ! (N )  is  a  non-increasing  function,  with  ! (N ) = 1  for

3.  Show  that  in  equilibrium  the  economy  converges  in  ﬁnite  time  to N W . 
4.  Suppose   A 0 (there  is  a  positive  probability  of  death),  show  that  the  conclusion  in 
(3)  survives.

5.  Suppose   A 0 AND  the  entrepreneurs’  debt  is  not  allowed  to  be  contingent  on  death 
(eO  = e in  the  notation  of  the  paper).  Show  that  the  model  can  have  a  steady  state 
with N ? N W .

Problem  2 
Consider  the  same  model  as  in  Problem  1.  Now  we  allow  for  a  binary,  i.i.d.  productivity 
shock.  Each period with probability k  the productivity  is Dk  and with probability  is Do . 
o
The  initial  condition  is  still N0  and  zero  liabilities. 

1.  Deﬁne a  recursive equilibrium with  the appropriate  state  space  (I  suggest you  still use 
only N  and  v,  instead  of N> E  and  v,  and ﬁx  the  ﬁrst  period  at  the  end). 

2.  Deﬁne  the  entrepreneur’s  problem  and  derive  the  ﬁrst  order  conditions.

3.  Construct a recursive equilibrium where ! (N> k) and ! (N> o) are both decreasing func­
ˆ v > v = o> k. 
ˆ v > v  = 1  for  two  cutos N
tions  and where  ! N

4.  Show that  in equilibrium there  is a region (N1 > N2 )  such that the optimal contract has 
0 (v 
0 ) (n > [ ) ? U (K ([ ))

and

! ([ ) = ! (K ([> v

if [  = (N> v),  v = o>  and  v
5.  Characterize  the  economy’s  dynamics,  showing  that  (in  some  sense)  volatility  falls  as 
the  economy  grows.
