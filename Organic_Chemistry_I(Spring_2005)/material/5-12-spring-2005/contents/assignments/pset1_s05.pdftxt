Problem Set #1 
Due:  February 10, 4:00 pm 

1.  Assign  formal  charges  to  each  atom  below  (a  formal charge of  zero  is  assumed  if 
no  charge  is  indicated).  Cross  out  the  configurations  that  are  not  reasonable,  and 
provide  an  explanation  (large  charge  - greater  than  + /- 1,  incomplete  octet,  octet 
exceeded).
