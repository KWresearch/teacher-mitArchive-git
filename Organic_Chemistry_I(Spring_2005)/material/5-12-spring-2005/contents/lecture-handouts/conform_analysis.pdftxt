Conformational Analysis:  The Fundamentals


conformational analysis: study of  the energetics of different conformations 

conformations: structures related by bond rotations; usually  interconvertible at RT 

conformer: conformation at potential energy minima

Barrier to Rotation:  torsional energy; energy required to  twist a bond into a specific conformation; 
Barrier to Rotation = Erel (highest energy conformer) – Erel (lowest energy conformer)

The Me/Me-eclipsing interaction  is said  to be worth 
various values in other sources.  A Me/Me-eclipsing 
interaction is significantly higher than an H H- or 
/
H/
Me-eclipsing  interact ion because the hydrogens 
on  the two methyl groups can actually bump  into 
each other (steric strain).
