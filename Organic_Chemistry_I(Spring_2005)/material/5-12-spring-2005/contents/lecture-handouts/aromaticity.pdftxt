Each sp2  hybridized C in the 
ring has an unhybridized p 
orbital perpendicular to the ring 
which overlaps around the ring

Criteria for Aromaticity�

1.  Cyclic
2.  Unhybridized p orbital in continuous cyclic system�
3.  Able to adopt a planar geometry 
4.  Fulfills Huckel’s Rule and includes (4n + 2) electrons�
      n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4……..  (the 2, 6, 10, 14….electrons)�

•Initially, all cyclic conjugated
hydrocarbons were proposed to be 
aromatic 

•However, cyclobutadiene is so reactive 
that it dimerizes before it can be isolated 

•Cyclooctatetraene adds Br2 readily. 

•Look at Molecular Orbitals 
(MOs) to explain aromaticity in benzene-
like molecules 

mix of single 
and double 
bonds 
non-planar 
geometry 

Constructing Molecular Orbitals�
•  molecular orbitals are the sideways overlap of porbitals 
p

•porbitals have 2 lobes.  Plus (+) and minus (-) indicate the opposite 
phases of the wave function, not electrical charge 

•When lobes overlap constructively, (+ and +, or - and -) a bonding 
MO is formed 

•When + and - lobes overlap,  waves cancel out and a node forms; 
antibonding MO

MO Rules for Benzene�
•Six overlapping p orbitals must form six molecular orbitals 

•Three will be bonding, three antibonding 

•Lowest energy MO will have all bonding interactions, no nodes 

•As energy of MO increases, the number of nodes increases 

•System symmetric so 2 pairs of degenerate orbitals

Energy Diagram for Benzene�
6 atomic orbitals - 6 molecular orbitals 
System symmetric so 2 pairs of degenerate orbitals 

The six electrons fill three bonding pi orbitals. 
All bonding orbitals are filled (“closed shell”), an extremely stable 
arrangement (AROMATIC STABILIZATION). 

Energy Diagram for Cyclobutadiene�

Following Hund’s rule, 
two electrons are in 
separate orbitals because 
they are at same energy. 

Most stable if filled with 
an electron pair (as with 
benzene) 

If cyclobutadiene adopted a coplanar 
geometry - two of the molecular orbitals 
would each have a single unpaired electron -
very unstable.  Applies to any (4 n) system 
Cyclobutadiene is ANTIAROMATIC

The Acidity of the Pyridinium Ion�
•� Heterocyclic aromatic compound. 
•� Nonbonding pair of electrons in sp2  orbital, so weak base, 
pKb = 8.8. 

The Acidity of Protonated Pyrrole�
Also aromatic, but lone pair of electrons is delocalized: 
much weaker base.
