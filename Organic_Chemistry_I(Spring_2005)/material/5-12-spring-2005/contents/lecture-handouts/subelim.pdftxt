Substitution Reactions (SN2 versus SN1)

SN2 
Concerted 

SN1 
Two Steps 
(Look for carbocation rearrangements.) 

Mechanism: 

Rate Equation: 

Rate = kr[R–X][Nuc] 

Rate = kr[R–X] 

Stereochemistry: 

Substrate: 

Stereospecific 
(inversion) 

Sterics: 
(methyl > 1° > 2°)
No SN2 with 3°! 
Accesible to Nu: 
(benzylic > allylic > 1°) 

Nucleophile: 

Strong/Moderate Required 
strong:  RS–, I–, R2N–, R2NH, RO–, CN– 
moderate:  RSH, Br–, RCO2 
–

Loss of Stereochemistry 

Cation Stability 
(benzylic > allylic > 3° > 2°>>1°) 
No 1° or methyl R+ without 
extra resonance stabilization! 

Not Important 

Leaving Group: 

Moderately Important 
(–OTf >> –OTs @ –OMs >> 
–I > –Br > –Cl) 

Very Important 
(–OTf >> –OTs @ –OMs >> 
–I > –Br > –Cl) 

Solvent: 

Polar Aprotic 

Polar Protic 

Elimination Reactions:  E2 versus E1

E2 
Concerted 

E1 
Two Steps 
(Look for carbocation rearrangements.) 

Mechanism: 

Rate Equation: 

Rate = kr[R–X][Base] 

Stereospecific 
(antiperiplanar TS) 

Alkene Stability 
(3° > 2° > 1°) 

Strong Base Required 
(RO–, R2N–) 

Moderately Important 
(same trend as SN1) 

Rate = kr[R–X] 

Not Stereospecific 

Cation Stability 
(benzylic > allylic > 3° > 2°>>1°) 

Not Important:  Usually Weak 
(ROH, R2NH) 

Very Important 
(same trend as SN1) 

Stereochemistry: 

Substrate: 

Base: 

Leaving Group: 

Solvent: 

Product Ratio: 

Wide Range of Solvents 
Polar Protic 
Zaitsev Rule:  The most highly substituted alkene usually predominates. 
Hofmann Product:  Use of a sterically hindered base will result in formation of 
the least substituted alkene (Hofmann product).

mostly SN1* 

*	 Under conditions that favor a unimolecular reaction (weak nuc/base and polar protic solvent), 
mixtures of SN1 and E1 are usually obtained.
