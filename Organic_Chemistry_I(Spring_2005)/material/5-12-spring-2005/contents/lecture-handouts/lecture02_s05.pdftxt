Rules for Resonance Structures
Rules for Resonance Structures

•	 Resonance forms are imaginary 

•	 They differ only in the placement of pi or nonbonding electrons, atom 
placement is the same 
(Electron movement takes place in the pi system, not sigma system) 

•	 Must be valid Lewis structures and obey the rules of valency 

•	 Difference resonance forms don’t have to be energetically equivalent 
(Lower energy resonance structures contribute most to overall structure 
of molecule) 

•	 The resonance hybrid (weighted average) is more stable than any 
individual resonance form 

•	 Use a double-headed arrow between structures and brackets around 
them, keep track of lone pairs and formal charges

Criteria:  atoms in same column and have same # of electron pair domains

For Negative Charges: 

The larger the atom, the greater the stability 

Surplus of electrons, electrons repel each other 
larger atoms allow this charge to spread out (lowering the charge density)

Learn pKa values on general pKa handout (understand relative values) 
Understand pKa values on specific pKa handout (for your reference) 

By knowing a few specific values, you can compare the structure of the
