Carbocation  Intermediate Summary
Intermediate Summary
Carbocation
Stability - the more substituents on the carbocation, the more stable the carbocation, and the 
faster it can form (Hammond Postulate) 

Regiospecificity - a reaction will take the path of the more stable carbocation intermediate 

Markovnikov’s Rule - when adding an electrophile to an alkene, H forms a sigma bond to the carbon with 
more H ’s, and the functional group forms a sigma bond to the carbon with more alkyl substitutents 

Rearrangements 

- if a carbocation can become more stable by rearranging, it will! 

- look for possible hydride shifts, methyl shifts, and ring expansions 

Stereochemistry 

-syn and anti addition observed* 

-during the 1st step of the reaction, the electrophile can add to either face (top or bottom) of the 
alkene 

-during the 2nd step of the reaction, the nucleophile can add to either the top or bottom lobe of 
the empty p orbital of the carbocation 

*Syn  - the two ends of the double bond react from the same side 

Anti  - the two ends of the double bond react from opposite sides
