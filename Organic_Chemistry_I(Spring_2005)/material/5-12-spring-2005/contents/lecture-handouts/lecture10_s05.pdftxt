Calculating the Degrees of Unsaturation from a Molecular Formula


Alkane:  CnH2n+2

Alkene:  CnH2n  (fewer hydrogen atoms)


Degrees of unsaturation = number of rings and/or multiple bonds


1 degree of unsaturation = 1 ring or 1 double bond 

2 degrees of unsaturation = 2 double bonds, 2 rings, 1 ring + 1 double bond, or 1 triple bond 

Example:  C6H10  (fully saturated would be C6H14)

14 H - 10 H = 4 hydrogen atoms = 2 H2  (pairs of hydrogen atoms) = 2 degrees of unsaturation


If molecular formula contains: 

1)	 Halogen (F, Cl, Br, I) - add number of halogens to number of hydrogen atoms 
C4H6Br2  is equivalent to C4H8, degrees of unsaturation = 1 
2)	 Oxygen - ignore it! 

C5H8O is equivalent to C5H8, degrees of unsaturation = 2 
3)	 Nitrogen - subtract number of nitrogen atoms from number of hydrogen atoms 

C5H9N is equivalent to C5H8, degrees of unsaturation = 2 

Naming Alkenes 
Suffix is -ene instead of -ane 

Straight-Chain Alkenes 

1. 

2.	

Find parent (longest chain containing a double bond) 

Number the chain 

Start at the end nearest the double bond 

If double bonds are equidistant from both ends, start at the end with the nearest branch point 

(Want the double bond carbons to have the lowest number possible) 

3.  Write the full name.  Place the number corresponding to the double bond before the parent name. 

4. 

Use -diene, -triene, etc. if more than one double bond is present 

Cycloalkenes - Number so that the double bond is between C1 and C2 and that the 1st substituent has the 
lowest number possible.

Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules for Assigning Priority 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Look at atoms directly attached to the double bond.  Higher atomic 
number = higher priority 

If no difference exists at the first attached atom, keep going down the 
line until the first difference is reached. 

Multiple bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of single-
bonded atoms
