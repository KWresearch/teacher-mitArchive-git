Instead of ADDITION 

For bromination E+ = Br-Br + FeBr3

Summary of Directing Effects


Four categories:
I. Strongly activating, ortho/para directing (eg. -OMe)

II. Weakly activating, ortho/para directing (eg. -CH3)
III. Weakly deactivating, ortho/para directing (eg. -Cl,)

IV. Deactivating, meta directing (eg. -NO2) 

I. Strongly activating, ortho/para directing (LP electrons)

(eg. -OMe, Inductive and Resonance effects) 
NH2 
OMe 

Aniline 

Anisole 

I. Strongly activating, ortho/para directing
(eg. -OMe, Consider inductive and resonance effects)


II. Weakly activating, ortho/para directing 

(eg. -CH3 Consider inductive effects) 

Stability of Intermediate defines outcome 


 Intermediate is 
more stable if 
nitration occurs 
at the ortho 
or paraposition. 

Carbocation 
stability! 

II. Weakly activating, ortho/para directing (eg. -CH3 inductive)


III. Weakly deactivating, ortho/para directing

(eg. -Cl, Inductive/Resonance)
