A.  Chemical Reactions 

What: 	 Changes in electron configuration 

Bonds broken/bonds formed 

Why:	 Attain a stable state 

High energy structures spontaneously react 

Lower energy structures need external energy to react 

How: 	 Collisions (between atoms, molecules, ions) 

For a collision to result in a reaction, the molecule must have: 

1)  sufficient kinetic energy 

2)  proper orientation

B.  Classification of Reactions 
2.  Mechanism 
• 
overall description of how a reaction occurs (changes in elec. configuration) 
•  which bonds are broken and formed 

a.  Free Radical 

Movement of one electron, usually proceeds by chain reaction 

b.  Polar 

Movement of electron pairs from areas of high electron density (nucleophile) to 
areas of low electron density (electrophile) 

c.  Pericyclic 

Movement of electrons in a cyclic fashion 

d.  Metal-mediated and Metal-catalyzed (need transition metal) 

(If the transition metal complexes act only as Lewis acids or 1 electron transfer 
agents, the reactions are better classified as polar, pericyclic or radical)

Ways to Form and Break Covalent Bonds: 

1.  Symmetrical - 1 electron goes to each atom in bond 

Homolytic cleavage: 

A

A 

+  B 

Homogenic formation:  A 

+ 

B 

A  B 

Use fishhook arrows! 

2.	 Unsymmetrical - Both electrons go to one of the atoms in the bond 

Heterolytic cleavage:

Nucleophiles and Electrophiles 
Involved in polar reaction bond formation 

donate 
Nucleophiles ______ electrons. 

Identifying nucleophiles 
•Lone pairs 
•(-) charges 
•� bonds 

Nucleophilic atom either starts neutral and becomes positive, 
or starts negative and becomes neutral 

Electrophiles  accept electrons. 
           

Identifying electrophiles 
•Empty orbitals (incomplete octet) 
•(+) charges 
•� bonds (polarized) 

Electrophilic atom either starts neutral and becomes negative, 
or starts positive and becomes neutral

Still Having Trouble Identifying Nu: and E+? 

1.  Look for regions of electron density and electron deficiency 

2.  Draw in all lone pairs 

3.  Draw as many resonance structures as you can 

(often, the 2nd best resonance structure shows the electrophilic and 
nucleophilic sites in a molecule) 

The terms “nucleophile” and “electrophile” can mean the entire 
molecule or specific atoms and functional groups. 

Don’t let the dual meaning confuse you! 

A Few Notes About Electron Pushing 

•	

•	 A curved arrow shows the “movement” of an electron pair 
source
The tail of the arrow shows the ______ of the electron 
pair, which is a ____ orbital.  This will be a: 
filled
• lone pair 
• p-bond 
• s-bond 
destination (sink)
The head of the arrow indicates the ______________ of the 
electron pair which will be: 
• An electronegative atom able to support negative charge 
empty
• An ______ orbital when a new bond is formed 
•	 Overall charge is conserved.  Check that your products obey 
this rule.

Electron Pushing to Uncharged C, H, N, or O


If you make a new bond by pushing an arrow to 
an uncharged C, H, N, or O,  you must also 
break one of the existing bonds in the same step.
