Learning Organic Chemistry 

Memorizing the structure, properties, and reactivities of 
each molecule will severely limit your abilities 

Organic chemistry is rational and systematic 

Goal: 

Learn tools to dissect and analyze organic 
chemistry that is unfamiliar 

Pay attention to detail!

Study Tips 

1.  Read the suggested readings before coming to class and record the main 
ideas. 

2.  After each lecture, summarize the major ideas and concepts in your notes 
within 24 hours of class. 

3.  Annotate these summaries from your study of the textbook 

4.  Work the problems independently 

5.  Master the material from each lecture before going to the next one. 

6.  Spend a few minutes each day on review to prevent becoming overwhelmed 
on the night before an exam.

How:  Structure and Reactivity 

Structure - what atoms are present & how they are bonded together 

Reactivity - potential of structure to undergo chemical change 

If likely - reactive (unstable)

If unlikely - unreactive (stable)


Structure 

Potential Energy 

Reactivity 

Potential Energy: 
- function of position or configuration of components 
- if low, compound more stable, change less likely 
- if high, compound less stable, change more likely

Electron Configuration and Valence Electrons 

Electron redistribution (change in configuration) 

is the origin of chemical change 

WHY?  Attain lower ENERGY 

(achieved when outer shell is filled - 8 electrons) 

Process of chemical bonding: 
adding or taking away outer shell electrons to gain a closed shell configuration

How do atoms maintain 8 electrons as well as participate in chemical bonding?

Bonding Possibilities of Main Organic Atoms 

Each atom has a limited number of possibilities to satisfy octet: 

1.  Nonbonding (electron pair localized on one atom) 

2.  Bonding (electron pair shared between two atoms) 

a.  Single bond (1 shared pair) 

b.  Double bond (2 shared pairs) 

c.  Triple bond (3 shared pairs)

Rules of Drawing Line-Angle Formulas 

•  Bonds are represented by lines 
•  Assume carbon atoms at the ends of lines and where they meet 
•  Assume enough C-H bonds to give each carbon atom four bonds (octet) 
•  Carbon and hydrogen atoms are only drawn at termini for aesthetics 
•  Draw heteroatoms and attached hydrogen atoms (N, O, P, Cl, Br, F, I, etc.)

Functional Groups 
The atoms of organic molecules exist in common combinations 

Each combination: 
ÿ  unique chemical properties and reactivity 
ÿ  behaves similarly in every organic molecule 

10 million organic compounds exist!
10 million organic compounds exist!
Predict how any one of those compounds reacts by analyzing its 
““ functional groups
functional groups ””

Functional Group - group of atoms 
with characteristic chemical behavior 
no matter what molecule it’s in 

Chemistry of every organic molecule, regardless of size or complexity, 
governed by functional groups

Electrons are DELOCALIZED 

•  A molecule can’t always be accurately represented by one Lewis structure 
•	 These molecules are weighted average, or hybrids, of two or more Lewis structures 
(electrons do not move to either one of the oxygen atoms or the other)

Why is Resonance So Very Important? 
>95% of the reactions in 5.12 occur because of the attraction of one molecule 
containing a region of high electron density to a second molecule containing 
a region of low electron density 

+ 

To predict how and when two molecules will react, need to be able to 
predict the regions of low and high electron density
