Alkyne

1.  Follow alkene rules, but use -yne as suffix. 
If more than one triple bond is present, use -diyne, -triyne, tetrayne . . . 
2. 
If both double and triple bonds are present, 
3. 
-
use -enyne as suffix 
Number from side with nearest multiple bond (either double or triple) 
-
If a double and triple bond is equidistant, make the double bond the 
-
lower number
