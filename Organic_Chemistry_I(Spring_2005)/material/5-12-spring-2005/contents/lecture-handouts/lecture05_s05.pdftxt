Naming Cycloalkanes
Cycloalkanes
Naming

1.	 Find parent (ring or chain, depending on which is larger). 

2.	 Label point of attachment of alkyl, halo, etc. as C1. 

3.	 Continue numbering so that the second substitutent is the lowest 
possible number. 

4.	

If 2 or more groups could potentially get the same number, use 
alphabetical order as a tie-breaker.

If 2 substituents are on cyclohexane the lowest energy conformation: 
a)  Has both substituents equatorial (if possible)

b)  The group with the largest A value equatorial

c)  t-Bu is NEVER axial!

•	 Energetic barrier = 10 kcal/mol; occurs rapidly at room 
temperature.
