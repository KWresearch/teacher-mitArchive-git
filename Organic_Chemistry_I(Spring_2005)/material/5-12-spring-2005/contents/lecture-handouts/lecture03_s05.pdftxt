E5.  Naming Branched  Alkanes
Alkanes
E5.  Naming Branched
1.  Circle the longest carbon chain (watch for turning corners!) 

If 2 different chains of equal length are present, choose the one with the greater 
number of branch points 

2.  Number the atoms in the main chain, beginning at the end nearest to a branch 

If the first branch point occurs at the same carbon number on both ends, begin at 
the end that has the second nearest branch point 

3. 

Identify and number the substituents 

4.  Write the name as a single word 
a. 	 Combine identical substituents, using the prefixes di-, tri-, tetra-, etc. 

Ex.  2-methyl & 5-methyl = 2,5-dimethyl 

b. 	 Put the substitutents in alphabetical order


di-, tri-, tetra-, sec-, tert- ignored when alphabetizing


iso, neo are included when alphabetizing


c.  Use a hyphen between words and numbers and to separate prefixes 

d.  Use a comma between numbers

F2a.  Conformational Energy of Ethane
F2a.  Conformational Energy of Ethane

The energy changes continuously as a function of the torsion angle.  We 
potential energy diagram 
represent this on a plot called the _____________________.

The length of time that a molecule resides in one conformational 
barrier height (DG≠) 
minimum is determined by the ________________.

Figure removed due to copyright reasons. 

Barrier to rotation = Ehighest - E  lowest = 2.9 kcal/mol 

Why is Staggered Form Lower in Energy?
Why is Staggered Form Lower in Energy?

One explanation for the lower energy of staggered ethane is that the staggered conformer is 
stabilized by hyperconjugation (stabilizing overlap between sCH and s*CH  orbitals that does 
not occur in the eclipsed conformer).

A second explanation for the lower energy of the staggered ethane conformer is that electron-
electron repulsion between the C-H bonds is occurring in the eclipsed conformer (same
principles as VSEPR theory), which destabilizes it.

F2c.  Conformational
For ethane, each conformational minimum has an identical structure, and 
thus, the same energy (all the stable conformers are equally populated).

Conformational Analysis Summary
Conformational Analysis Summary
Torsional energy - higher energy associated with eclipsed conformation 
Torsional strain - resistance to rotating to an eclipsed conformation 
(eclipsed ethane is torsionally strained by 3 kcal/mol) 

Steric strain - repulsive interaction that occurs when atoms are forced 
closer together than their atomic radii allow 

Gauche  - spatial relationship with a 60o torsion (dihedral) angle 

Anti - spatial relationship with a 180o torsion angle 

Interactions 
H-H eclipsing (torsional strain) 
H-Me eclipsing (mostly torsional strain) 
Me-Me eclipsing (steric and torsional strain)
