Reaction 

Remember

 pKa of alkyl group is ~50 (very high) so deprotonated alkyl group is VERY basic 

H3C CH2  NaBr 

H2 
H3C  C  Li 

very basic carbons 

will react w/ acidic proton like 

H2O   (pKa 15.7) 

HC  CH 

(pKa 25) 

Not mentioned in class:


Chapter 10.10  Be familiar with terminology, oxidation, and reduction.


In inorganic/general chemistry:


M2+  oxidation 
 (M=metal)  M0 
M2+  M0 
reduction  
Organic chemistry:

 reduction: gain in electron density by carbon
 oxidation: loss of electron density by carbon 

In practice: 
oxidation  C O   C N   C X  bonds will form 
C H  break 
reduction  C H  will form 

C O   C N   C X  bonds will break 

A very common example: 

H2C CH2 

Pd/C 
N2 

H3C CH3
