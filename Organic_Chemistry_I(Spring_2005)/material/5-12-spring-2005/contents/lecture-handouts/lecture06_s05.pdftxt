Prelog RulesRules
Prioritize Using

1.	 Look at atoms directly attached to chirality center 

a)  higher atomic number = higher priority 

b)  heavier isotopes = higher priority 

2.	

If no difference at first attached atom, move along the chain until 
the first point of difference. 

3.	 Multiple-bonded atoms are equivalent to the same number of 
single-bonded atoms.

Chirality Center Configuration

Assigning  Chirality
Center Configuration
Assigning

The configuration of chirality centers can 
be assigned using “R,S” descriptors. 

1.  Prioritize substituents with # ’s 1-4 following Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules

2.  Orient molecule so substituent of lowest priority (4) is directed back 

3.	 Starting from highest priority

Fisher Projection 
Vertical lines go into the paper 
Horizontal lines come out of the paper 

Dos and Don ’ts of Fisher Projections 
1.  Do place atom with the IUPAC numbering of 1 at the top 
2.  Don ’t rotate 90 degrees, changes molecule into enantiomer 
3.  Do rotate 180 degrees to see different perspective 
4.  Do hold one atom constant and then rotate the other three 
clockwise or counterclockwise to put lowest priority on 
horizontal axis, or in back 

Advantages of Fisher Projections 
1.  Simplifies drawing of molecules with multiple 
stereogenic centers (see D-glucose) 
2.  Easy to test if molecule is meso 
3.  Easy to determine R/S 
4.  Easy to test for enantiomerism

Important Definitions
Important Definitions

stereocenter (stereogenic atom):  any atom at which the interchange of two groups results in 
a stereoisomer; usually either a  chiral carbon atom or a double-bonded carbon in a cis/trans 
alkene 

chirality center:  atom holding a set of  ligands  in a spatial arrangement that is not 
superimposable on its mirror image; one type of stereocenter 

chiral atom  (asymmetric atom):  atom that is bonded to four different groups; a  chiral carbon 
atom is the most common example of a  chirality center 

internal mirror plane :  plane that divides molecule in such a way that two halves are identical 

chiral (optically active):  possessing a non-identical mirror image (an enantiomer) 

achiral:  superimposable on its mirror image 

enantiomers:  stereoisomers  that are non-identical mirror images (same physical properties) 

diastereomers:  stereoisomers  that are not enantiomers (different physical properties) 

meso compound:  achiral molecule that has  chirality centers 

Using the Lingo
Using the Lingo

an atom: 
•  that gives rise to  stereoisomers when its substituents are interchanged is a stereocenter 
•  holding a set of ligands in an arrangement that is not superimposable on its mirror image is a chirality 
center (one type of stereocenter) 
•  with four different substituents attached is a chiral atom (one type of chirality center) 
•  that is chiral uses the R/S descriptors to assign absolute configuration 

a molecule: 
•  must be either achiral  (optically inactive) or chiral  (optically active) 
•  that is achiral but contains chirality centers is called a meso compound 
•  that is optically active can be  labelled (+/–) or (d/l) 

related molecules: 
•  enantiomers (non-identical mirror images) 
•  diastereomers (any  stereoisomers that are not enantiomers) 

samples of molecules:

•  optically pure (only one  enantiomer present in sample)

•  racemate  or racemic mixture (mixture containing equal amounts of each enantiomer), not optically active 
•  mixtures in between optically pure and  racemic are described by their optical purity (only 1 enantiomer 
present) or enantiomeric excess (1 enantiomer is in excess) 

Note:  Do not to confuse experimentally derived labels (+/– or d/l) with structurally derived labels (R/S).  They 
are not related!
