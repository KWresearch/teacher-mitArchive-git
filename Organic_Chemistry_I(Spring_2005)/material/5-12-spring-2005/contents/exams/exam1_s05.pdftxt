Make sure your exam has 9 numbered pages plus a periodic table. 

Write your initials on each page. 

Look over the entire exam before you begin to familiarize yourself with its

length.  Do what you know first, then attempt the harder problems.


Read the instructions carefully and budget your time. 

Show all of your work.  Partial credit receives points!

(4  pts)  One  of  the  steps  in  fat  biosynthesis  is  the  hydration  of  crotonate  to  yield  3-
hydroxybutyrate.  The  reaction  occurs  by  addition  of  -OH  to  the  si  face  at  C3,  followed  by 
protonation  at  C2,  also  from  the  si  face.  a)  Label the  top  face  of  each  alkene  carbon  atom 
as re or si.  b) Show  the  stereochemistry of the product and c) label C3 as R or S.
