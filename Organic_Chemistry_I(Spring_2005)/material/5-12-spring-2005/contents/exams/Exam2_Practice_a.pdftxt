Organic Chemistry


PRACTICE EXAM IIa 


•  Books, notes, and calculators will not be allowed in the exam room. 

•  Molecular model kits will be allowed during the exam. 

•  You will be given a periodic table. 

•  The exam will focus on Chapters 5-8 in McMurry as well as all topics 
covered in lecture and any previous material. 

•This practice exam is longer than the real exam. 

•  HAVE FUN!

(d)	

An endergonic, two-step reaction with the first step being the rate-determining step. 
A reaction with three transition states and DG > 0. 

A three-step reaction where K > 1, and the third step is faster than the first step,

which is faster than the second step.


A one-step reaction where the conversion to reactants is faster than conversion to 
products.  Is DG positive or negative?
