***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
***** Course Objectives *****
Individuals who successfully complete this course will be able to:
   1. Define and employ the vocabulary of organic chemistry.
   2. Draw correct structural representations of organic molecules.
   3. Write reasonable transformations and mechanisms for alkanes, alkenes,
      alkynes, alkyl halides, alcohols, aromatic compounds and carbonyl
      compounds.
   4. Employ stereochemical considerations when analyzing mechanisms and
      transformations.
***** Molecular Models *****
Several units in 5.12 will emphasize 3-dimensional aspects of organic
molecules. To help you visualize stereochemical concepts, we recommend that you
purchase the Darling "Molecular Visions" Molecular Model Kit. You will be
permitted to bring the model sets to the hour exams and the final.
***** Recitations *****
Recitations will begin the second week of classes and meet twice per week. You
must attend your officially assigned section and turn in your problem sets to
your officially assigned TA. Only your officially assigned TA will grade your
problem sets and provide feedback with respect to your final grade, which is
extremely important for borderline students.
***** Exams *****
Four one-hour exams, each worth 100 points, will take place on Wednesdays
throughout the term. The final exam is a three-hour, cumulative exam that is
worth 200 points. Help sessions will be held by the TAs prior to each exam.
Exams will be graded immediately after they are completed and returned in your
Thursday recitation section or in class on Friday. If you require extra time
for written exams because of a disability, please secure a note as soon as
possible. No make-up exams will be given for missed hour exams, and all exams
must be taken in the assigned location. For an excused absence (as evidenced by
a note from the Medical Department, Counseling Services, or another acceptable
source) you may be either be required to take a conflict exam, or your score on
the missed exam may be assigned as the average of your scores on the other
three exams. Any other extenuating circumstances will be dealt with in a manner
according to MIT policy. Please notify a TA immediately if you are currently or
will be experiencing such a situation.
***** Regrade Policy *****
   1. Do not make any marks on the exam.
   2. On a separate, hand-signed cover sheet stapled to the exam, list your
      phone number and email address, state the problems that were misgraded,
      and affirm that no changes to the exam were made after grading.
   3. Submit the regrade to your assigned TA by the following Tuesday.
   4. Arithmetic errors in adding up points will be corrected immediately. Any
      other regrade request will cause the entire exam to be regraded;
      therefore, your overall score may increase or decrease.
Oral or late requests for regrading will not be accepted. Exams may
beÂ photocopied to protect against alterations and fraudulent regrading
requests.
***** Problem Sets *****
Eight problem sets will be required throughout the semester. No late work will
be accepted. Written problem set keys will be posted on the 5.12Â website
immediately after the due date. The problem sets are mandatory. They will be
graded by your assigned TA on a â+, â, â- basis and returned in your M/
T recitation section. The assignments are intended to guide your studying
toward important concepts in 5.12 and to help you prepare for exams. Thus, you
will benefit the most from working independently. In fact, you should aim to
work alone on the problem sets for at least four hours. If you feel that a
discussion with your colleagues would be helpful at the end of that time, you
should use a white board, chalkboard, or scrap paper and write up the answers
independently after the discussion.
***** Final Grades *****
The hour exam with the lowest score will be dropped. The remaining three one-
hour exams will count towards 65% of your final grade and the final exam will
count towards 35% of your final grade. Recitation attendance and problem set
performance will be used to determine the grades for the broad group of
students that teeter on the A/B, B/C, or C/D border.
    Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES     PERCENTAGES
Hour Exams (3) 65%
Final Exam     35%
***** Study Tips *****
Because over 10 million organic compounds exist, memorizing the structure,
properties, and reactivity of all of them would be almost impossible. Luckily,
a few fundamental ideas underlie all organic reactions. By understanding these
themes and trends (not by memorizing them!), you should be able to rationalize
unfamiliar reactions and mechanisms through analogy.
Understanding organic chemistry requires a regular program of active studying.
No substitution exists for using a pencil and paper to draw and redraw
structures, write reactions, and explore stereochemistry. Attend all the
lectures and recitation sessions. Read the suggested reading material before
each lecture and write down the main points. After each lecture, summarize the
major ideas and concepts in your notes within 24 hours of the class. Supplement
these notes with material learned by reading the textbook. When you think you
understand the material, do the suggested problems. If you cannot complete the
problems without referencing your notes or the textbook, put them down and
study the concepts again. Master the material from the previous lecture before
going to the next one. Finally, spend a few minutes each day in review. If you
fail to do this, you may find your review before an exam a major learning
experience and could become overwhelmed by what seems like an unreasonable
amount of material. You cannot cram for an organic exam!
