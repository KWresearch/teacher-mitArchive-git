***** Administrative Details *****
**** Grading ****
This is a pass/fail course â attend the classes, do the homework. Attendance
is important; email us in advance if you have to miss a class.
**** Optional Assignment(s) ****
There is an optional assignment that you can work on when you have free time,
e.g. if you finish the class lab period early. This assignment is completely
optional â it was designed to give you a better intuition for programming and
to help in later course 6 studies.
**** Textbook ****
This class uses readings from the online textbook How to Think Like a Computer
Scientist â it's always nice to have two perspectives on concepts. You can
find this textbook here.
***** Python Installation *****
You can get the latest version here.
    * Linux and Mac OS X users: You should already have Python installed â to
      test this, run the command Python in console mode. Note that the first
      line tells you the version number; you may want to upgrade your
      installation if you have a version earlier than 2.3.
    * Windows users: Grab the Windows installer from the Downloads section.
      After installation, you can run the IDLE (Python GUI) command from the
      Start menu.
