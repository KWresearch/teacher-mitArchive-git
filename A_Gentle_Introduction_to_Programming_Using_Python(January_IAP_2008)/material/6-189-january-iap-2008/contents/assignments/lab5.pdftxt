Lab 5: Working with Lists 
 
 

Problem 1 - Sorting a List 
 
Write a program that asks the user to enter 10 (positive) numbers. The program should then 
print the numbers in sorted order, from biggest to smallest. 
 
To do this, first write a function that takes a list and finds the largest element. It then 1) deletes 
that element from the list and 2) returns that element. 
 
Hint: You will need to store two variables in this function: the biggest number you've seen so far 
(remember to initially set this to 0), and its position. Then iterate over the list, and for each 
element, check if it's bigger than the biggest number you've seen so far. If it is, change both 
variables (remember to change BOTH)! 
 
So in your main program, you'll have to keep calling this function (in a loop) until the list is empty 
and keep printing the number that is returned. 
 
 
Problem 2 – Report card with GPA 
 
Write a program where the user can enter each of his grades, after which the program prints out 
a report card with GPA. Remember to ask the user how many classes he took. Example output 
is below. 
 
How many classes did you take? 4 
 
 
 
What was the name of this class? English 
What was your grade? 94 
 
 
 
... 
 
REPORT CARD: 
 
 
 
English - 94 
 
Math – 96 
 
Science – 91 
Social Studies - 88 
 
 
 
Overall GPA – 92.25 
 
Hints: You’ll want to use a for loop, and you’ll probably want to keep two lists, one for names 
and one for grades. Remember, add to lists with append.
