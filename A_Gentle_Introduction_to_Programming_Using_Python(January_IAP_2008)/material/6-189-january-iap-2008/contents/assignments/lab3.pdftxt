Lab 3: Control Flow with If-Else-Elif 
 
 

Problem 1 - Checking for complex roots 
 
Yesterday, you wrote a function to print the roots of a quadratic equation. Improve that 
function by checking if the roots would be complex and printing a message saying so if 
they are. 
 
Hint: The roots are complex if the discriminant is negative. 
 
 
Problem 2 - Cafe menu 
 
Write a program that first displays a simple cafe menu (see example below), asks the 
user to enter the number of a choice, and either prints the appropriate action OR prints 
an error message that their choice was not valid. 
 
Example output: 
 
1. Soup and salad 
 
 
2. Pasta with meat sauce 
3. Chef's special 
 
 
 
Which number would you like to order? 2 
 
One Pasta with meat sauce coming right up! 
 
Another example output: 
 
1. Soup and salad 
 
 
2. Pasta with meat sauce 
 
3. Chef's special 
 
Which number would you like to order? 5 
 
 
Sorry, that is not a valid choice.
