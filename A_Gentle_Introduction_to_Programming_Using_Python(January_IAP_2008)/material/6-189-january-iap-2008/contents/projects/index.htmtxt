***** Project 1 â Hangman *****
Project 1 (PDF) was the game of Hangman. The handout guides you through the
process. This process is called incremental programming. It allows you to
tackle complex problems, like writing a game of Hangman, by tackling small sub-
tasks first. In this case, we can tackle the problems of figuring out whether
the user has guessed the word, or creating a string of the word with the
letters guessed so far. With the sub-tasks taken care of, it's easier to take
on the bigger task.
Optional project files: word list (TXT) contains many words; hangman_lib.py
(PY) contains helper functions to get a random word and to print a Hangman
image; hangman.py (PY) contains example usage of hangman_lib.
Example solution: hangman_soln.py (PY) (needs to be in same directory as above
files)
***** Project 2 â Guitar Hero Clone *****
Project 2 was a clone of the game of Guitar Hero. This is a decently complex
game, and trying to do it all at once is not practical. Instead, we learn the
importance of modularity and teamwork by breaking up the functional parts of
the game (input, graphics, sound and logic) and completing these parts in
teams. This approach even allowed us to have a working, playable prototype at
the end of class, despite being incomplete.
Note: this project could not be included in MIT OpenCourseWare due to copyright
restrictions.
***** Sample Program 1 â Tic-Tac-Toe *****
Many of you asked for us to write a tic-tac-toe program as one of our sample
programs. In the beginning of class 6, Mihir wrote such a program in front of
you all. The goal of that program was to be simple and straightforward, and it
was successful.
I've written another version, with a different goal: to be polished. My
implementation is considerably different, and that's fine; we all have
different styles of programming. Take a look. It's extensively commented, but
feel free to email with questions.
File: tictactoe.py (PY)
***** Sample Program 2 â Connect Four *****
Here's another sample program with the goal of being polished. This is a great
example where the implementation is not trivial (unlike in Tic-Tac-Toe), so
abstraction is vital to prevent bugs and to keep the code readable.
There are some Python things in the code that you may not know yet. The assert
statement just throws an error if the following condition isn't True. Writing a
string with the % symbol lets you plug in the variables that follow into that
spot in the string (%s means string, %i means integer and %c means one letter).
So take a look. It's not quite so extensively commented as the Tic-Tac-Toe
program, so feel free to email me with questions.
