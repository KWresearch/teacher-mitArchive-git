Session 7 

Administrivia 
Name: 

Instructions: 

1. Err..complete the questions :). 

2. When we ask for output, you DON'T have to write the spaces/newlines in. 

Program Text: 

print “X”,

print “X”,


Output: 

XX


Day 4: More Loop Practice 
Problem 20: 

Each of the following function definitions takes a list as a parameter and solves a specific problem. 

Correctly fill the blanks in the following code to solve the problems. 

There is a way to solve each problem by only filling in the blanks. Don’t just add extra lines to force a 

solution. Also, there may even be more elegant solutions that don’t use all the blanks – feel free to use 

those too. 

Program Text: 

def swap_first_last(my_list): 

"""This function swaps the first and last elements in a list. It 
has no return value.""" 

temp = _____________ 

_____________ = _____________ 

_____________ = _____________ 

Program Text: 

def second_biggest(my_list): 

"""This function returns the second biggest element in my_list. It 
assumes that my_list contains distinct, positive integers.""" 

Page 2 

second_biggest = -5 

biggest = -1 

for i in my_list: 

if i > _____________:


second_biggest = ______________


biggest = _____________________


elif i > second_biggest:


second_biggest = ______________


return second_biggest


Problem 13: 

You may recall the notion of a power series from Calculus. A power series is an infinite polynomial series 

that approximation a continuous function. For example, the power series of sin(x) is 

ݔ െ 

ݔ ଷ 

3! 

ݔ ଻

ݔ ହ
൅ െ ൅ ڮ

7!

5! 

The more terms you calculate, the closer your expression will be to sin(x) – hence the reason we call it 

an approximation. 

Write a function to calculate sin(x) using the above power series (well, fill in the blanks, at least.) 

Note: You've already seen the code for a function that can calculate the factorial of a number (Problem 

11.) Assume the existance of a factorial(x) function that calculates the factorial of x. 

Program Text: 

def calculate_sin(x, number_of_terms): 

"Calculates the value of sin(x) using the power series." 

number_of_terms = min(20, number_of_terms) #do at most 20 terms 

Page 3 

sin_value = 0 

for i in range(number_of_terms): 

new_term = x ** _____________


new_term /= factorial(___________________)


new_term *= (-1) ** ___________________


sin_value += new_term


return sin_value
