Linearized  equations 
One  mechanism  for  creating  internal  gravity  wave  is  ﬂow  over 
topography.  We’ll  consider  the  simple  case  with  zonal  ﬂow  U  at  a  si­
nusoidal  topography  at  z  =  h0 cos(kx).  The  basic  state  is  composed 
� 
of  a  mean  zonal  ﬂow  u  =  U (z ),  a  vertical  stratiﬁcation  ∂  b  =  N 2 (z )
∂ z 
z  b.  All  deviations  are  negligible  com­
in  hydrostatic  balance,  P  = 
pared with the basic state.  For simplicity we consider two dimensional 
problems  only  (  ∂  = 0  for  all  perturbations).

(We  can ﬁnd  the normal by  thinking about a  function F (x, y , z ) = z − 
h(x, y);  its  three-dimensional  gradient  is  perpendicular  to  the  surfaces 
of  constant  F ,  in  particular  the  one  at  F  =  0  which  represents  the 
boundary.)  This  linearizes  to

Generation  of  lee  waves  with  no  rotation

Boundary  conditions 
The  boundary  condition  over  a  bumpy  lower  boundary  in  terms 
of  a  streamfunction  is  given  by, 

ψ(x, 0, t) = U h(x, y). 

For  a  bumpy  lower  boundary  with  elevation  given  by 

h = h0 cos(kx) 

we  have 

ψ(x, 0) = U h0 e ıkx ,

φ(0) = U h0 . 

We  will  imagine  that  the  upper  boundary  condition  is  very  far 
and  idealize  that  by  considering  that  z  runs  between  0  at  the  lower 
boundary  and  inﬁnity  for  large  positive  z .

Short  scales 
For  a  mean  ﬂow  with  zero  shear,  we  have 
� 
k2  + m2  = 
� 
If  the  topographic  scale  is  short  compared  to  U /N , the  m2  will  be 
negative  so  that  if  ˆm =  k2  − N 2 /U 2  then 
ψ = U h0 (cid:5)(e 
ıkx∓ ˆ
mz ) 
We must  choose  the  negative  sign  so  that  the  disturbance  decays with 
� 
height 
ψ = U h0 cos(kx) exp(−  k2  − N 2 /U 2  z ) 

Long  scales 
If  k2  < N 2 /U 2  then m  is  real  and  our  solution  looks  like 
ψ = U h0 (cid:5)(e ıkx±ımz ) 

and we must decide which  sign  to use  (or have  some contribution  from 
each).  We  shall  discuss  a  number  of  ways  of  resolving  the  issue. 

Group  Velocity:  Since  the  topography  is  the  source  of  the 
waves,  we  would  expect  the  vertical  component  of  cg  to  be  positive. 
This  means  that  if  we  suddenly  add  or  eliminate  the  topography,  the

disturbance  in  the  wave  ﬁeld  would  propagate  upwards.  Therefore

∂m 
� 
The  positive  sign  is  the  correct  one,  so  that 
ψ = U h0 cos(kx +  N 2 /U 2  − k2  z ) 
Energy  Flux:  For  these  2-D motions,  we  can  write  the  average 
(as  in  zonal  average)  vertical  energy  ﬂux  as 
P  = −ψ 
∂P 
∂ψ

and  we  expect  it  to  be  positive.  Using  the  zonal  momentum  equation

wP  = ±  U 3h0

again  showing  the  plus  sign  to  be  the  desired  one. 

Damping:  Another  approach  is  to  add  damping  to  the  equations 
so  that  even  the  vertically  wavy  mode  decays  and  reject  any  growing 
solution.  We  take 

u + U  u = −∇P  + bzˆ − u

so  that  vertically  decaying  solutions  (cid:7)(m)  >  0 require  (cid:5)(m)  >  0 as 
before.

The  Nonlinear  Problem

The  steady  equations 

u · ∇q = − 
∂ 
b 
∂x 
u · ∇(b + N 2 z ) = 0 
can  be  solved  by  noting  that  u  · ∇φ  =  0  implies  φ  = Φ(ψ) – the 
advected  property  is  constant  along  streamlines,  since  the  parcels  of 
ﬂuid  move  along  the  streamlines  in  steady  ﬂows.  The  streamfunction 
(cid:4) (x). 
here  includes both the mean ﬂow and the ﬂuctuations ψ = U z + ψ

Critical  levels 
Critical  levels  appear when  the  phase  speed  of  the waves matches 
the  mean  ﬂow  speed.  For  stationary  non-rotating  lee  waves  this  hap­
pens  when  U  =  0.  The  vertical  wavenumber  m  ≈ N/U  → ∞, The
