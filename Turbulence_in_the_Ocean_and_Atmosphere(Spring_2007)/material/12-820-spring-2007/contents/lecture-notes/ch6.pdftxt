2-D  Turbulence 

One  rnight  th ink   t h e   two-tlirnensional  problem  rrligllt  be  a  sirnpler,  more  trac tab le  
version  of  3-D  turbulence.  However) t h e   dynarnics  t u r n   ou t   t o  be  qu i te   different.  To  see 
why  th i s   is  t h e   case,  le t's  consider  t h e   vorticity  dynarnics  of  each  kirld  of  flow.  Frorn  t h e  
Navier-Stokes  equations  for  a  homogeneous  fluid 

we  can  derive  the   vorticity  equation 

and   t h e  energy  equatiorl 

wit11 E  = i u .  u 1)eing t h e   energy  and   Z  = + < . < being  t h e   enstrophy.  Tur1)ulence in  t h e  
presence  of  boundaries  can f l u x  energy  through   the  walls. h u t   for  homogeneous  turbulence 
t h e   flux  terrn  rrlust  on   t h e   average  vanish  and   t h e   dissipation  is  just  2 v Z .   Dissipation 
and  energy  cascades  are  closely  tied  to   the  rotational  nature  of  a  turbulent 
flow. 
In   t h e   classic  picture,  we  force  t h e   energy  a t   a  cer ta in   ra te ;   which  is  t h e n   balanced 
off  by  dissipation.  Bu t   t h e   spectrurn  depends  only  on  t h e   forcing  ra te   and   k :  no t   upon

t h e  viscosity  decreases  ant1 we  excite smaller and   srrlaller scales) t h e  e n s t r o p l~ y  will becorne 
larger  and   larger  t o  cornpensate. 
The   e n s t r o p l~ y  equa t ion  intleed  has  su i tab le  source  terrns: 

where  SiJ = ? [ V i u j+ V j u i ]is  t h e  r a t e   of  s t ra in  tensor.  Therefore, if  t h e  vorticity  vector

is  on  average  aligned  wit11  t h e   directions  where  t h e   s t ra in   is  causing  extension  ra the r  
t h a n   corltraction;  t h e   enstrophy  will  increase.  In   a  3-D  turbu len t   flow,  t h e   vorticity  is 
irltleed on  average undergoing  stretching since th i s  t e rm  entls u p  balancing  t h e  sign-definite

The  two-tlirnensional systern differs significarltly in i t s  vorticity dynamics.  Since u . i  = 
0  and   &U   = 0 ,   t h e   vorticity  is  purely  vertical  < = Cz. T h e   enstrophy  production  terrn

In  a  2D  system, the   energy and  enstrophy will  decay monotonically 

Since t h e  enstroplly  is bounded by  i t s  initial value, t h e  energy dissipation ra te  will decrease 
in  propor t ion   t o  t h e  viscosity;  a n  energy  cascade  in  t h e  Kolnnogorov  sense will  not  occur. 
However  the   t e r r r ~  giving  dissipation  of  e n s t r o p l~ y  will  have  a  non-trivial  generation

If  t h e   corltours  of  vorticity  are   aligned  w i th   t h e   axis  of  extension,  t h e   gradients  will  be 
aligned w i th   t h e  axis  of  cornpression  and   t h e  vorticity  lines will be  pushed  closer  toge ther ,  
increasing  t h e  rrlean  square  gradient.  Thus   enstrophy  (can cascade,  since  there   is  a  source 
terrn  for  vorticity gratlierlts. 

These  results  suggest  t h a t   we  could  derive  a  spectrurn  frorn  a n   enstrophy  (cascade

with  t h e   e n s t r o p l~ y  spectrurn  also  decreasing  a t   srnall  scales  Z ( k ) N  k p l .

We  car1 quan~tify t h e   irlverse cascade  using  a n  a rgu rne r~ t  of  Pe te r  Rhines:  consider  t h e

We  note  tlvat  E  = J E ( k )  ant1  Z  = J k 2 E ( k )  are   conservetl  in   irlviscid  rnotion.  If  we

Therefore 

As t h e  energy  spreatls in  t h e  spectrurn  i t s  rnean  scale increases.  Demos,  Page  3 :   mean

Multiple power  laws 

We  now  have  two  possil>le power  laws:  t h e  K41  law 

and   t h e  e n s t r o p l~ y  cascade  law

Calculations of  t h e   transfer  ra tes   (c.f.  Kra ichnan l  1967) show  t h a t   K41 gives upscale

and   as  t h a t   frorn  k / 2   t o   k .   Thus   t h e   transfers  are  not  local  and   t h e   argunr~er~ t  is  not

V o r t e x   dynamics 

Onsager  (19xx) realized  t h a t   vortex  dynarnics  r r ~ i g l ~ t  indeed  be  a  significar~t p a r t   of

To  tlerive  t h e   forrrlula  for  G ,  we  locate  t h e   origin  a t   t h e   vortex,  use  syrnrnetry  t o  replace

and   use  t h e   free  solution  away  from  r  = 0.  Irltegrating  over  a  srrrall

Vortex  dynamics 
To  urlderstarld  t h e   rnerger  process,  let  us  consitler  t h e   irlviscid  tlynarrlics  of  a  single 
vortex ernbedded  in  a  shear  or  s t ra in  field.  We  car1 represent  t h e   vorticity  as

The  points on  t h e  1)oundary of  D are  ma ter ia l  poirlts since they  separa te  fluid with tlifferer~t 
vorticities.  Furthermore,  t h e   velocities  can  be  w r i t ten   as  a  line  integral  around   t h e   pa tch

Thus   t h e   evolution  of  t h e   vorticity  contours  can  be  posetl  as  a  tlyrlarr~ical systern  (in  fact 
a  Harniltonian  one).  We'll analyze  linearizetl  versior~s bu t   show  fully  r~onlirlear examples.
