As  a n   exanlple,  we  examine  t h e   randoin  flight  model.  which  assumes  t h a t   t h e   accel-
era t ions  have  a  stochastic  component  and   use  Newton's equations 

d X  = V d t  
d V  = A d t  + P d R  

where  A  is  t h e  acceleration  produced  by  deterministic  (or large-scale)  forces.  We  include 
randoin  accelerations with  t h e   random   increment  d R  satisfying  ( d R i  d R j )  = G i j d t .  
As  examples, consider  a  d rag  law  for  t h e   acceleration 

with  u  being  t h e   water  velocity.  The   dispersion  is  determined  by  P  and   T ;   from  t h e  
equations:  we  can  show  t h a t  

The  l a t t e r  corresponds  t o  a  diffusivity  of  r ;   = p 2 / 2 r 2 .

If  we  assume  t h a t   t h e   scale  of  a  typical  particle  excursion  over  t ime   Tint is  small 
compared t o  t h e  scale over which t h e  flow variesl we  can relate t h e  Lagrangian and  Eulerian

Let  us  assuine  t h a t   t h e   integrals  with  respect  t o  T exist  and   split  t h e   covariance  in to

We  can  write  a n  a rb i t ra ry   ailtisymmetric tensor  in ter ins  of  t h e  un i t   ailtisymmetric tensor

Note  t h a t   t h e  antisymmetric  p a r t   of  t h e  contribution  t o  t h e  Lagrangian  velocity  is  nondi-

Thus   t h e   Lagrangian mean   velocity  has  contributions  from t h e  mean   Eulerian  flowl from 
t h e   Stokes' dr if t ,   and   a  t e rm  which  tends   t o  move  into  regions  of  higher  diffusivity 

We  will  discuss  t h e  meanings  of  these  te rm s   in  more  de ta i l  next.

Separable  Problems 

The   inesoscale  eddy  field  has  horizontal  velocities  in  t h e   near-surface  layer  which 
are  nearly  independent  of  z;  a n d   t h e   vertical  velocity  increases  linearly  w i th   dep th   w' = 
s ( x ;  t ) z .   The  s tre tch ing  satisfies 

For  linear  (or linearized  pe r tu rba t ion )  problems  in t h e  near-surface  layers, we  can  separa te  
t h e  physics  and   t h e  biology  using  Greens' functions. 
We  define  t h e  Greens  function  for  t h e  horizontal flow  problem: 
(4+ u ( x ,  t )   V - V  1G ( x , x'; t  - t')  = 6 ( x  - x 1 ) 6 ( t- t') 
The  pe r tu rba t ion   equations  can now  be   solved:
