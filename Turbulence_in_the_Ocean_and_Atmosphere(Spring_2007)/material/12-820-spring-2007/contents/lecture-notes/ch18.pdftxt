The   Ray le igh l   Charney-Stern  theorem  gives  a  necessary  condition  for  instability:  the  
gradient  Q g  nnist  change  sign  e i ther   in  the   horizontal  or  in   the   vertical;  th is   will  occur 
when

To  solve;  we  take  q'  =  qexp(zk  . x  + ot) w i th   $I  defined  similarly.  from  the   P V

The  mean  field approximation disclissed previolisly  relies on  th is  mechanism.  Becaiise 
of  channel walls,  the   growing modes  have 
qi  = & ( t )cos(kx - B i )   sin(!y)

In   this  case  the   divergence  of  the   eddy  f l~ ixes  vanishes,  so  there  is  no  feedback  on  the  
mean.  The   linearly  growing wave  is  a n  exact  sohition  t o   the   fully  nonlinear  eq~ ia t ion s :  if 

then   the   inversion  implies  41' = g ( < )  with 

Bu t   the   nonlinear  te rm  is  now 

Pedlosky  (1975) and   Pedlosky  a n d  Polvani  (1987) suggest  t h a t   the   growing wave  can 
itself becorne iinstable  t o  o ther  waves which  then  remove  the  energy.  We  can  illlistrate  this 
by  using  a  wave  t r iad   in  which  the   middle  wavm~ i rnbe r  is  the   baroclinically  iinstable  one 
while  the   smaller  and   larger  ones  are  s tab le .  

The   indices  are   t r iad   minlber:  these  need  t o   be  solved  in   each  layer  so  t h a t   there  are   12 
degrees  of  freedom  ( 6  cornplex q's).

So  t h a t   the  Arnol'd invariant  simply decays  w i th   time. 

We  thus   obt,ain the   two  theorems: 
Unstable  flows  imply  t,hat t,he energy  and  enstrophy  are growing in time;  this can only 
happen   if  the   second  te rm   can  offset  the   first.  Thus ,   if  Qq   > 0  everywhere,  the   flow 
is  stable. 
If  Q g   is  everywhere  negat,ive, the  flow  can  still be  nns tab le   if  t,he available  waveniim-
hers  are  so  large  t h a t  A is  negative  definite. 
For  nonlinear  stability, we  define  the   Hamiltonian  fimctional 

and   a  so-called  Casirnir

&[nl = H[q l  - H[Q1+ C[ql - C[121 

is conserved, is equal t o  zero when q'  = 0  and  i t s  first  variation also vanishes  ( i t ' s  q ~ i a d r a t ~ i c
