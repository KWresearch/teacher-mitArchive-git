Nonlinear  waves 

Theories  of  nonlinear  waves  have  been  developed  for  inany  systems;  we  shall  t r e a t  
two-dimensional  in terna l  gravity wave  dynamics here. 

We  assume  t h a t   there   is  no  variation  in  y  and   write  t h e   horizontal  and   vertical  velocities 
in  te rm s  of  a  streamfunction 

Forming  a  horizontal vorticity  equa t ion   ( C   = -C. 9 = ik!  2 = ~ 2 1 1 , )gives  t h e  set
a% -

We  shall use  B ( z )  = J Z  N2 for  t h e  basic  stratification. 

Steadily propagating waves 
We  begin  by  looking  for  steadily propaga t ing  nonlinear  solutions.  If  we  replace  6 by 
-cz ,a  we  have 

The  las t   equa t ion  implies 

.7($  + cz; <) = -3 b  
ax 

.7($  + cz, b + B ( z ) )  = 0 

b +   B ( z )  = B ( z +   -)$ 
C 

which  has  a  (by no  means  unique)  solution 

For  th i s  solution,  11,  and   b  go  t o  zero  smoothly  and   are  re la ted   in  t h e   linear  limit  by 

which  is  exactly what  one  gets  for  linear waves. 
The  vorticity  equation  now  gives 
1a$ 
.J($  + cz, vZ$ )= B ' ( z+ $1~)--c a x  

Therefore we  have 

z 
v"  - - N ~ ( Z  + $/c)  = Z ( z  + - )
$
C 
C 
or  ( tak ing  t h e  same  kind  of  extension of  t h e   linear  solution) 

Ou r   final  equation  is 

When   N Z ( z )  is  cons tan t   - unifornz  stratification  - t h e   wave  equation  is  linear  with 
solutions like 
$ = Aco s (kx )  s i n (m z )   ,  c2 = N Z / ( k Z+ m Z )  
with m = n / H  for a domain height  H bounded by  horizontal surfaces.  Th is  is t h e  s tanda rd  
in terna l  gravity wave  dispersion  relationship.  For  th i s  case, t h e  linear waves  are a  solution 
t o  t h e   nonlinear  equations. 
For  a  non-uniform  s tra t if ica t ion ,  if  t h e  wave  amp l i tude  is  small enough; we  can  sepa- 
ra te   variables 

$ = d~( x )F ( z )  

with 

The  vertical  s t ruc tu re  equa t ion  gives a  relationship  between  c and  y Z  while  t h e  horizontal 
equation  just  gives  sinusoidal disturbances  w i th  wavenumber  k  = y .   Note  t h a t   there   will 
be  a  gravest  long  wave  nzode  corresponding  t o   t h e   value  c  = el,  where  y Z  goes  through  
zero. 

Stokes' expansion 

For  small, bu t   finite,  amp l i tude  waves, we  can  Taylor-expand  t h e  equa t ion  t o  get 

Th is   is  like  t h e  oscillator  equation w i th   a  iloilliilear  restoring  force. 
We  expand 
$ = t$l   + t 2 ? J I 2 + t3$3... 
2 c  = X o   + â‚¬A l + t 2 X 2  
and   use  t h e   ilotatioil  S  = N 2  t o  get  a  sequence  of  problenls 

The  first  equation  gives 

We  apply  solvability  coilditioils  t o  t h e  second  and   th i rd   equations:  if 

then  

H 

dx  F  ( z )  c o s ( k x )R , ,  ( x ,  z )  = 0

For  t h e  second  equation,  th is   implies  X 1   = O  and   therefore 
- X i / '   c o ~ ( 2 k x ) F ~ ~

Thus  we  see  asynlmetries in  t h e  shape  of  t h e  wave.  If  we  multiply  t h e  F z z   equa t ion  above 
by  F and   in tegra te ,  we  see  t h a t  

Thus  for S' > 0 , FZ2will be  negative  and  t h e  cos(2kx)  te rm  will have  a positive  coefficient: 
streamfunction  highs  will  be  sharper   and   lows  f la t ter .   Also,  t h e   isotherms  will  have  flat 
crests  and   sha rp   troughs.  I n  add i t ion ,  t h e   $I2  field  has  a  net  nleail  flow  contribution.  We 
can  get  rid  of  th i s   te rm   if  we  choose  by  going  back  t o   t h e   equation  for  t h e   vorticity  and  
writing  i t   as 

with  t h e   last  t e rm  order  E .   T h e  sequence  of  equations now  has 

Th is  kind  of  ambiguity is  characteristic  of  nonlinear  waves - there   can  be  many  different 
solutions  depending  on   t h e   choice  of  functionals.  W i thou t   some  fur ther   specification, 
there will be  aspects which are undetermined.  One such consideration is elimination of  t h e  
mean zonal  flow  a t  second  order; ano ther  might  be  requiring  t h a t   t h e  volume  between  two 
isotherins be t h e  same as in  t h e  case when  t h e  buoyancy  is just  B ( z ) .  Since t h e  streamlines 
are  isotherms;  th i s   coines  back  t o   t h e   same  requirement:  we  want 
d x $   = 0 .   Therefore 
we  choose

For  t h e   th i rd   equa t ion ,  we  have 

Subs t i tu t i i lg  for  t h e   last  te rm ,   doing  t h e   averages  of  t h e  cosines,  and   in tegra t ing  by  pa r t s

This  determines  t h e   corrections  t o  t h e  phase  speed: 

For  t h e  case  S' > 0,  S" = 0  (buoyancy  increasing quadratically  w i th   he igh t) ,  we  have 

The  wave  moves more  slowly, which makes  sense  since  it  extends  downward  more  into  t h e  
weakly  stratified  zone. 

Solitary wa,ves 

We  can   also  find  long  wave  solutions  limit  which  are  spatially  isolated.  Since  such 
solutions decay  t o  zero,  t h e  original choices for  B ( Z )  = B ( Z )  and  Z (Z )  = - Z N 2 ( Z ) / c   are 
necessary;  t h e   values  are  set  along  a  streamline  by  t h e   fields  flowing  in   from  +awhere 
t h e  streanllines correspond  t o  t h e  background  s t a t e .   We  now  analyze 

under  t h e  assumption  t h a t   u / c

condition  for  t h e  next  order problem  is 

To  have  decaying  solutions  a t  infinity,  we  must  have  A 1   < 0;  since  c = el,  - iXlcf,',,  th is  
implies  t h a t   solitary  waves  move  faster  t h a n   t h e   longest  linear  wave.  Th is   makes  sense 
from  t h e   linear  dispersioil relation:  if 

and   lc2  <  O  representing  exponential  decay  ( a t   t h e   fron t)   or  growth  ( a t   t h e   back) ;   t h e  
phase  speed  will  be  increased  ra the r   t h a n   decreased  from  t h e   long  wave  value  N /m .   In  
add i t ion ,   t o   t u r n   t h e   rising  wave  on   t h e   left  t o   a  decaying  wave  on   t h e   r igh t ,   we  must

single-signed;  for  S'  > 0,  we  find  only waves  w i th   t h e   isotherms depressed. 
We  call write  a n  explicit  solution t o

We  can  examine  t h e   time-dependent  behavior  of  nonlinear  disturbances  in  t h e   liinit 
where dispersion and  nonlinearity  are weak, bu t  comparable, effects.  We  again use multiple 
scale  expailsions  with  t as  a  "marker" 

U H ;  <  - U / H ,  c 
To  th ink   of  these  as  nondimensional,  scale  x  - L ,   z  - H ,  ?i, 
N O H , t  - L / N U H ;and   b  - N oU .   Then   S  is  t h e   nondimeilsional  function  N ' / N ;   and  
E  = U / N o H  = H Z / L 2 . The   last  equality  expresses  t h e   relationship  between  U  and   L  so 
t h a t   iloilliilearity  a n d  dispersion  are  similar  in  s t reng th .  
The   expailsion gives 

and  

At  lowest  order,  we  have  disturbances  moving  a t   t h e   long  wave  speed  el,  with  vertical 
s t ruc tu re  Fl,: 

(we'll drop   t h e  lw  subscript  henceforth).  At  t h e  next  order ,  we  have 

We  multiply  b o t h   equations by  F and   average  t o  find 

Multiplying t h e  first  equation  by  -co  and   adding gives 

The  solvability condition  gives t h e  KdV  equation:

INTERNALWAVES:  AS a  warning,  though ,   we  cannot  be  sure  t h a t   similar  "particle-

directions. 

G r o u p   solitary  waves 

Noilliilearity  can  also  ac t   on   wave  groups,where  i t   can  create  solitary  wave  packets 
and   lead  t o  modu la t iona l  instability - t h e  breakdown  of  a  regular wave  into groups.  The  
i n a t h  here  is more  complicated, unfortunately.  We  again expand  t h e  wave  in to  

e tc . ,  with  X = ex; T = d , T  = e2 t . T h e  sequence  of  problems  becomes 

with  N 2 = cons t   for  simplicity  and   t o  avoid  t h e   Stokes' wave  kind  of  nonlinearity.  These 
give  t h e  basic  wave  solution 

with  = exp(zkx - scukt) s i n (m z ) ,  K = d m , a n d   co  = N / K .  
At  order  e 2 ,  we  have 

We  note  t h a t   . J ( g l ,C 1 )   =  0  and   . J ( ? l , l ,   b l )   =  0 .   The   solvability  condition  comes  from
