Boundary  layer  turbulence 

Turbulence in the ocean and atmosphere is strongly aﬀected by the presence of bound­
aries.  Boundaries  impose  severe modiﬁcations  to  the momentum  and  buoyancy  bud­
gets.  At  solid  boundaries,  the  boundary  condition  that  the  ﬂuid  velocity  is  zero 
applies  to  both  the mean  velocity  and  to  the  ﬂuctuations.  Thus  the  turbulent  ﬂuxes 
of momentum must vanish.  At the ocean  free surface winds apply a stress that drives 
strongly  turbulent  motions.  Surface  ﬂuxes  of  heat,  salt  and  moisture  can  generate 
turbulent convection as we have seen at the beginning of this class.  Finally the combi­
nation of surface stresses and ﬂuxes determines the full spectrum of turbulent motions 
that can develop at the ocean and atmosphere boundaries.  Before discussing in detail 
the  physics  of  planetary  boundary  layers  in  the  ocean  and  atmosphere,  it  is  useful  to 
review  some  fundamental  results  that  apply  to  boundary  turbulence  in  general. 

20.1  Shear  boundary  layers 

Let  us  consider  shear-driven  turbulence  at  solid  boundaries.  At  ﬂluid  boundaries, 
the  condition  that  the  ﬂuid  velocity  is  zero  applies  at  every  instant  in  time.  Thus  it 
applies  to  the mean  velocity  and  the  ﬂuctuations  separately, 
u�  = 0. 

u¯ = 0, 

(20.1) 

The  fact  that  the  ﬂuctuations  drop  to  zero  at  the wall  has  the  particular  implication 
that  the  Reynolds  stress  vanish, 
−uiuj  = 0. 
The  only  stress  exerted  directly  on  the  wall  is  the  viscous  one.  Away  from  the  wall, 
instead, turbulence generates a Reynolds stress typically large compared to the viscous 
stress.  Tritton  (chapter  5,  page  337)  shows  in  Figure  21.12  the  transition  between

(Schubauer,  J.  Appl.  Physics,  1954).  The  total  stress  parallel  to  the  wall  does  not 
change  with  distance  from  the  wall,  but  there  is  an  exchange  of  balance  between  the 
viscous  and  turbulent  contributions.

To simplify the algebra let us consider a parallel irrotational ﬂow over a ﬂat boundary. 
Turbulence  is  generated  because  the  no-slip  condition  ¯u = 0  at  the  boundary  means 
that  a  shear  layer  results,  and  vorticity  is  introduced  into  the  ﬂow.  Boundary-layer 
ﬂows are more complicated  than  free  shear ﬂows, because  the  importance of viscosity 
at the boundaries (which enforces the no-slip condition) introduces a new spatial scale 
in  the  problem.  As  a  result  there  is  a  viscous  sublayer  next  to  the wall,  whose width 
is  set  by  viscous  forces,  and  a  high  Re  boundary  layer,  whose  thickness  is  controlled 
by the turbulent Reynolds stresses.  These two layers are separated by an inertial sub-
layer.  The three diﬀerent regions of the boundary layer are somewhat analogous to the 
viscous range, inertial range, and forcing ranges of isotropic, homogeneous turbulence. 

1.  The  viscous  sublayer 
For  distances  close  to  the  wall,  i.e.  z < zf  where  zf  is  the  distance  at  which  Re = 1, 
friction is important.  This can be compared to length scales l ≈ 1/kd  in homogeneous 
turbulence,  where  viscosity  is  important. 

2.  The  inertial  sublayer 
At  distances  further  away  from  the  wall  than  zf ,  we  can  neglect  viscosity.  Similarly, 
if  we  are  not  close  to  the  edge  of  the  boundary  layer  at  z  =  δ ,  we  can  assume  that 
the  ﬂow  will  not  depend  directly  on  the  size  of  the  boundary  layer.  Therefore  we 
have  an  inertial  sublayer  for  zf  << z  << δ .  This  region  is  similar  to  the  inertial 
range  in  homogeneous  turbulence,  where  the  ﬂow  is  not  aﬀected  by  ν  or  by  k0 ,  the 
wavenumber  of  the  energy  input. 

3.  The  turbulent  boundary  layer 
The  full  turbulent  boundary  layer  is  determined  by  the maximum  size  of  the  eddies, 
the  so-called  the  integral  scale  δ .  This  region  corresponds  to  the  forcing  range  of  3D 
turbulence. 

4.  The  ambient  ﬂow 
Finally  at  some  distance  z > δ ,  the  ﬂow  is  no  longer  turbulent  and  we  are  in  the 
irrotational  ambient  ﬂow.

(20.3) 

We  will  assume  a  constant  background  ﬂow  u¯0 ,  which  is  independent  of  distance 
along  the  plate  x  and  distance  normal  to  the  plate  z .  We  assume  2-dimensional  ﬂow 
(∂ /∂ y = 0),  and  also  assume  that  downstream  evolution  is  slow.  If L  is  a  streamwise 
lengthscale,  we  are  assuming  δ/L  <<  1,  so  that  we  can  neglect  variations  in  the 
streamwise  direction  compared  to  those  in  the  vertical  for  averaged  variables  (i.e.

∂ /∂x = 0).  Given  these  assumptions,  the  Reynolds  averaged  equations  become,

this  stress  is  constant  throughout  the  boundary  layer.  Near  the  boundary  the  stress 
is  dominated  by  the  viscous  term.  Away  from  the  boundary  we  will  have, 
τ  = −w �u� . 

(20.6) 

We  can  deﬁne  a  velocity  scale  from  this  surface  stress 

u 2  = τ ,

where  u is  the  friction  velocity.  Away  from  the  boundary  eq.  (20.6)  implies  that

u∗  is  the  turbulent  velocity  ﬂuctuation magnitude. 

20.1.2  Viscous  sublayer:  law  of  the  wall 

The  frictional  length  scale  zf  is  the  scale  at  which  Re  =  1,  i.e.  the  scale  at  which 
the  viscous  and  turbulent  stresses  are  of  comparable  magnitude.  Thus  the  frictional 
length  scale  can  be  deﬁned  as, 

ν

u∗ 
This  lengthscale determines the transition between the inertial and viscous sublayers. 

(20.8) 

zf  =

In  the  viscous  sublayer  z < zf ,  the  velocity must  depend  on  z ,  the  distance  from  the

wall,  u∗ ,  the  friction  velocity  and  ν ,  the  viscosity.  We  can  write  this  relationship  as,

ν
Note  that  ¯u  has  been  nondimensionalized  by  u∗ ,  and  the  distance  z  has  been  nondi­
mensionalized  by  the  frictional  lengthscale  ν /u∗ .  We  can  rewrite  the  relation  in 
nondimensional  form, 

(20.9)

u¯+  = f (z + ) 

(20.10) 

where  ¯u+  = ¯
u/u

∗  and  z+  = zu∗/ν .

Near  a  rough  wall,  the  characteristic  scale  instead  of  being  controlled  by  a  frictional 
scale,  it  may  be  controlled  by  roughness  length  z0 ,  if  z0  > zf ,  and  the  self-similar 
solution  in  eq.  (20.10) must  be  interpreted  with  z+  = z/z0 . 

20.1.3  Turbulent  boundary  layer:  velocity  defect  law 

= 

(20.11) 

Outside  the  viscous  sublayer,  we  can  neglect  viscosity.  Thus  the  only  dimensional 
parameters  that  enter  in  the  problem  are  the  turbulent  velocity  scale  u∗ ,  the  total 
�  � 
depth  of  the  boundary  layer  δ ,  and  the  height  z  away  from  the wall.  We  can  express 
this  dependence  as,

This relationship states that the mean velocity gradient, d ¯u/dz , which is the reciprocal 
of  a  transverse  time  scale  for  the  mean  ﬂow,  has  to  be  of  order  u∗/δ  and  varies  on 
spatial  scales  of  order  δ .  Notice  that  we  cannot  make  a  similar  scaling  argument  for 
the  mean  velocity  ¯u  and  say  that  u¯ =  u∗g(z/δ),  because  the  mean  velocity  depends 
on  an  additional  external  parameter,  the  velocity  outside  the  boundary  layer  ¯u0 .  We 
know  that  for  z/δ → ∞,  we  have  ¯u

This similarity solution is only valid outside of the viscous boundary layer, and cannot

20.1.4 

Inertial  sublayer:  logarithmic  layer 

Thus far we have two diﬀerent laws for  ¯u+ .  One applies close to the wall in the viscous 
sublayer  and  satisﬁes  the  no-slip  condition  u¯ =  0.  The  other  applies  further  away 
from  the  wall  and  is  not  guaranteed  to  satisfy  the  no-slip  boundary  condition  at  the 
wall;  actually  it  turns  out  that  away  from  the  wall  u∗  � u¯0  and  thus  ¯u − u¯0  ≈ −u¯0 . 
This indicates that a viscous sublayer with very steep gradients is required in order to 
satisfy  the  boundary  conditions.  Of  course  the  velocity  doesn’t  suddenly  jump  from 
one scaling behavior to another - there  is a transition region.  In this transition region 
we  expect  both  the  law  of  the  wall  and  the  velocity  defect  law  to  apply. 

From  eq.  (20.10)  we  expect  that, 

From  eq.  (20.14)  instead  we  have,

The  value  of  the  Von  Karman  constant  has  been  measured  in  a  variety  of  labora­
tory  ﬂows  that  indicate  a  universal  value  of  0.41.  Some  early  measurements  in  the 
atmosphere  (Businger  et  al.,  1971)  suggested  a  much  smaller  value  of  0.35,  and  this 
led  to  speculations  for  a  while  that  the  constant might  not  be  universal,  but  instead 
a  function  of  salient  nondimensional  numbers  in  the  ﬂow  (for  example  the  Rossby 
number).  Careful  reexamination  of  the  errors  involved  (Hogstrom,  1996)  and  more 
recent observations (Zhang, 1988) indicate that the constant is indeed a constant with 
a  value  around  0.40 ± 0.01.

20.3	 Planetary  Boundary  Layers 

The  boundary  layers  in  geophysical  ﬂows  are  also  aﬀected  by  rotation  through  the 
Coriolis  force.  This  is  discussed  by  Tennekes  and  Lumley,  chapter  5.3.

20.4	 Convection 

Convection is the process by which vertical motions modify the buoyancy distribution 
in  a  ﬂuid.  In  the  example  considered  above,  the  mixing  of  the  upper  ocean  layer  is 
caused  by  the  mechanical  action  of  the  wind  stress,  and  convection  is  said  to  be 
forced.  Free  convection  arises  when  the  only  source  of  energy  is  of  thermodynamic 
origin,  such  as  an  imposed  heat  ﬂux.  A  common  occurrence  of  free  convection  in 
geophysical  ﬂuids  is  the  development  of  an  unstable  atmospheric  boundary  layer. 

Ra =	

Glenn  showed  that  free  convection  occurs  when  the  Rayleigh  number  Ra, 
Δbh3 
, 
ν κT 
exceeds a critical value, which depends on the nature of the boundary conditions.  For 
a  ﬂuid  conﬁned  between  two  rigid  plates  and  maintained  at  diﬀerent  tempertures  at 
the two plates,  the critical Rayleigh number  is Ra = 1708.  At values slightly over the 
threshold,  convection  organizes  itself  in  parallel  two  dimensional  rolls  or  in  packed 
hexagonal  cells.  At  higher  values  of  the  Rayleigh  number,  erratic  time  dependent 
motions  develop,  and  convection  appears much  less  organized. 

(20.24) 

Geophysical ﬂows almost always  fall  in  this  last  category, because of  the  large depths 
involved  and  the  small  values  of  molecular  viscosity  and  diﬀusivity  of  air  and  water. 
In the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer, where the Rayleigh number easily ex­
ceeds 1015 , convection is manifestly turbulent and viscosity/diﬀusivity play secondary 
roles.  In  this  limit,  the  usntably-stratiﬁed  part  of  the water  column mixes  to  become 
essentially uniform.  For ﬁxed buoyancy boundary conditions, thin layers develop near 
the  boundaries  with  thickness  such  that  the  local Rayleigh  number  is  nearly  critical. 
if  the  ﬂux  of  buoyancy  is  ﬁxed,  these  layers  do  not  occur  and  the  buoyancy  gradient 
decreases  to  small  values. 

20.5	 Ocean  Mixed  Layer  Models 

20.5.1	 Bulk  Mixed  Layer  Models:  Price  Weller  and  Pinkel 
Model 

Price, Weller,  and Pinkel  (PWP)  proposed  a  simpliﬁed  boundary  layer model  for  the 
upper ocean.  The model  is based on simple heuristic arguments and has proved quite 
accurate.  The  model  adjusts  the  distributions  of  momentum  and  tracer  properties, 
and  in  doing  that  it  sets  the  mixed  layer  depth.  The  internal  workings  are  rather 
simple.  After  adding  the  surface  forcing,  one  applies  three  criteria  for  vertical  sta­
bility  (i.e.  whether  water  should  mix  vertically,  and  whether  the  mixed  layer  should 

7


deepen).  After that, it applies advection and diﬀusion (vertical advection and vertical 
diﬀusion)  to  the  water  column. 

Static  Stability  Criterion 

The ﬁrst stability criterion, and the one that proves the most important in the model, 
is  static  stability.  In  fact,  it  accounts  for  about  80%  of  the  ”action”.  Quite  simply 
put, one cannot have denser water overlying  lighter water.  This means that one must 
have  ∂z b  ≥  0.  Thus  one  goes  through  the  model  domain  (let  ”i”  be  the  position 
¯
index,  with  “i”  increasing  downward),  one  tests  to make  sure  that, 
¯bi  ≤ ¯bi+1 , 
and  where  this  is  not  the  case,  one  then  mixes  all  the  cells  above  this  depth  (that  is 
average them among themselves).  In general, what one should really do is to just mix 
the  two  cells  together,  then  start  from  the  top  of  the  model  and  do  it  again.  What 
happens  in  practice,  however,  is  since  all  the  heat  exchange  (in  particular  cooling, 
which decreases buoyancy)  takes place  at  the  top  of  the model,  one  always ﬁnds  that 
the  eﬀect  of  this  instability  is  to  mix  all  the  way  back  to  the  top.  So  one  may  as 
well  do  it  the  ﬁrst  time.  This  scheme  is  equivalent  to  the  convective  overturning 
scheme  described  above,  if  one  sets  the  diﬀusivity  to  inﬁnity whenever  there  is  static 
instability. 

(20.25) 

Bulk  Richardson  Number  Stability  Criterion 

The  second  stability  criterion  is  the  bulk  Richardson  Number  stability.  This  arises 
due  to  the  fact  that  if  the  mixed  layer  gets  going  too  fast  (i.e.  the  wind  stress  is 
allowed  to  accelerate  it  to  too  great  a  speed),  it  tends  to  ”stumble”  over  itself.  What 
actually  happens  is  that  if  there  is  too  much  velocity  shear  at  the  base  of  the  mixed 
layer,  it  will  tend  to  mix  downward.  This  eﬀect,  determined  by  ﬁeld  and  laboratory 
experiments  is such that the mixed  layer deepens  if the bulk Richardson number goes 
below  a  critical  value, 

h  Δ¯b 
Rb  =  |Δu¯ |2  ≥ 0.65, 
where  h  is  the  height  (thickness)  of  the  mixed  layer,  Δ¯b  is  the  buoyancy  contrast 
between  the mixed  layer  and  the water  below,  and Δ u¯ is  the  diﬀerence  in  horizontal 
velocity  between  the  mixed  layer  and  the  underlying  water.  This  eﬀect  tends  to 
be  important  when  the  mixed  layer  becomes  very  thin,  because  a  thin  mixed  layer 
becomes  easily  accelerated  by  wind  stress,  and  the  inverse  quadratic  nature  of  the 
dependence makes for a strong damping.  The relative activity of this process is about 
20%  of  the  static  instability. 

(20.26) 

Gradient  Richardson  Number  Stability  Criterion 

The  third  stability  criterion  is  based  on  the  gradient  Richardson  number,  and  has 
the  eﬀect  of  stirring  together  layers  where  the  velocity  gradient  becomes  too  great. 

8


One  can  think  of  this  as  the  mixed  layer  ”rubbing”  against  the  water  underneath 
it.  This  largely  has  the  eﬀect  of  blurring  the  transition  between  the mixed  layer  and 
the  seasonal  thermocline  below,  which  would  normally  be  rather  sharp.  Laboratory 
experiments indicate that there is a critical gradient Richardson number, below which 
stirring  occurs, 
¯∂z b 
∂z u¯ 2  ≥ 0.25. 
|
|
This turns out to be a not very vigorous process, but becomes a little more important 
in  the  absence  of  any  explicit  turbulent  vertical  diﬀusion.  Notice  that  the  gradient 
Richardson number  introduced by Price, Weller, and Pinkel diﬀers  from  the one used 
in  KPP  in  that  it  does  not  include  any  parameterization  for  unresolved  turbulent 
shear.
