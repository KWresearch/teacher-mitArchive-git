Surface  Quasi  Geostrophy 

The quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory introduced by Glenn describes the ﬂow departures 
from solid body rotation in a rapidly rotating, stably stratiﬁed ﬂuid.  In its Boussinesq 
version,  the  ﬂow  evolves  according  to  the  coupled  vorticity  (ζ )  and  buoyancy  (b) 
equations, 

∂tζ  = −J (ψ , ζ ) + f ∂zw, 
∂tb = −J (ψ , b) − N 2 w, 
b ≡ f ∂z ψ . 
ζ  ≡ �2ψ , 

(12.1) 
(12.2) 
(12.3) 

Here  ψ  is  the  streamfunction  for  the  horizontal  geostrophic  ﬂow,  (u, v) = (−ψy , ψx ), 
w  is  the  vertical  velocity,  f  is  the  constant  vorticity  due  to  the  background  rotation, 
while  N (z )  is  the  buoyancy  frequency  of  a  reference  state.  The  vorticity  ζ  is  deﬁned 
as in two-dimensional ﬂows.  Eliminating the vertical velocity, one obtains the pseudo-
� 
� 
potential  vorticity  equation, 
S 2  ≡ (N/f )2 . 
q ≡  ∂xx  + ∂yy  + ∂z S −2∂z  ψ , 
∂tq = −J (ψ , q),
If  we  specialize  to  the  case  of  constant N ,  the  Prandtl  ratio  S  can  be  subsumed  into 
a  rescaled  vertical  coordinate,  N z/f  (in  which  case  we  retain  the  notation  z  for  the 
rescaled  coordinate),  and  the  potential  vorticity  is  now  simply  the  three-dimensional 
Laplacian of the streamfunction.  At ﬂat lower boundaries, the condition of no normal 
ﬂow  is, 

(12.4) 

∂tb = −J (ψ , b), 

at  z = 0. 

(12.5) 
(12.6) 

If  a  ﬂat  upper  boundary  is  imposed,  then  (12.5)  also  holds  at  z = H . 

The  familiar  special  case  of  two-dimensional  ﬂow  is  obtaining  by  assuming  that  the 
streamfunction  is  independent  of  z .  Charney  suggested  that  a  more  geophysically 

1


relevant  limit  is  to  retain  vertical  dependence  in  ψ  and  q  assuming  that  the  top  and 
bottom  boundaries  are  homogeneous,  i.e.  b  =  0.  Charney’s  model  has  become  the 
de-facto  standard  tool  for  QG  studies  of  oceans  and  atmospheres.  A  less  familiar 
special  case  is  that  of  surface  quasi-gesotrophic  (SQG)  ﬂow,  in  which  it  is  assumed 
that  q = 0,  so  that  the  interior  equation  is  identically  satisﬁed,  and  the ﬂow  is driven 
entirely  by  the  surface  b-distribution.  If  the  surface  is  ﬂat,  if N 2  is  a  constant,  and  if 
there  is  no  upper  boundary,  then  the  resulting  equations  are, 
∂tb = −J (ψ , b), 
b ≡ f ∂z ψ , 
q ≡ (∂xx  + ∂yy  + ∂zz ) ψ = const, 
as  z → ∞.

for  z > 0, 

One  can  easily  generalize  to  the  case  of  q  =  q0  a  non-zero  constant.  For  example, 
in  the  presence  of  a  uniform  horizontal  shear,  with  the  total  ﬂow  described  by  the 
streamfunction  1/2q0y 2  + ψ ,  one  need  only  incorporate  advection  by  the  mean  ﬂow, 
u = −q0y ,  into  the  buoyancy  equation. 

The  QG  and  SQG  equations  are  complementary  description  of  stratiﬁed  rotating 
ﬂows.  One  can  always  divide  the  total  ﬂow  at  any  instant  into  a  part  induced  by 
the  surface  b-distribution  and  a  part  induced  by  the  interior  q -distribution.  The 
QG  approximation  has  attracted  more  attention  after  the  seminal  work  of  Charney. 
However  there  are  meteorological  and  oceanographic  problems  for  which  the  SQG 
approximation  is  thought  to  be  more  appropriate.  Examples  are  the  evolution  of 
temperature  anomalies  at  the  tropopause  (Juckes,  JAS,  1994)  and  density  anomalies 
at  the  ocean  surface  (LaCasce  and Mahadevan,  JMR,  2006). 

12.1  2D  turbulence  versus  QG  turbulence 

Some  of  the  distinctions  between  SQG  and  2D  ﬂows  are  immediately  evident  from 
the  form  of  the  equations.  In  two-dimensional  ﬂow,  the  streamfunction  induced  by 
a  point  vortex,  ζ  =  δ(x� ),  in  an  unbounded  domain  is  ψ(x) =  −(2π)−1 In(|x − x� |). 
In  SQG,  b  =  δ(x)  results  in  the  ﬂow  ψ(x) =  −(2π |x − x� |)−1 .  The  circumferential 
velocities around the vortex are proportional to r−1  for 2D ﬂow and r−2  for SQG ﬂow, 
r  being  the  distance  from  the  vortex  centre. 

The more singular SQG Green’s function has several important consequences.  Nearby 
point vortices  rotate  about  each other more  rapidly  than  in  the  twodimensional  case; 
in  consequence,  a  greater  ambient  strain  is  required  to  pull  them  apart,  since  the 
rapid  rotation  averages  out  the  eﬀects  of  the  strain.  Conversely,  distant  eddies  are 
less  tightly  bound  to  each  other  than  in  two-dimensional  ﬂow.  Taken  together,  a 

2


greater  tendency  to  form  localized  vortex  assemblages  is  implied.  Since  the  ﬂow  dies 
away from a point vortex as r−2  rather than r−1  in SQG, the aggregate eﬀect of distant 
eddies  on  the  local  velocity  ﬁeld  is  more  limited.  SQG  is  qualitatively  characterized

by  the  preponderance  of  spatially  local  rather  than  long  range  interactions.

ζˆ(k, t) = −|k|2ψˆ(k, t). 
(12.11) 
Since  the  vertical  structure  of  a  sinusoidal  disturbance  in  SQG  theory  is  e−|k|z ,  the 
analogous  relation  is, 

ˆb(k, t) = −|k|ψˆ(k, t). 

(12.12) 

In  both  models,  the  ﬂow  can  be  thought  of  as  determined  by  a  smoothing  operator 
acting on  the conserved scalar, but  in SQG  there  is  less  smoothing.  This  implies that 
large-scale  strain  will  play  a  relatively  smaller  role  in  the  advection  of  small-scale 
features  in  SQG,  resulting  in  a  cascade  of  variance  to  small  scales  that  is  more  local 
in  wavenumber.  Held  et  al.  (JFM,  1994)  discuss  the  implications  of  the  locality  of 
interactions  for  atmospheric  and  oceanic  ﬂows. 

12.2  Conserved  properties 

In  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  lecture  we  consider  SQG  ﬂows  with  a  rigid  lower  boundary 
and  no  upper  boundary.  These  SQG  equations  preserve  energy,

where  �·�  denotes  an  average  over  the  full  3D  domain  and  the  overbar  a  2D  average 
along  the  lower  boundary.  For  zero  potential  vorticity  ﬂows,  the  conservation  of 
energy  becomes, 

1 
E  = −  ψb 
z=0 
. 
2 
Furthermore  the  SQG  equations  conserve  the  buoyancy  variance  along  the  lower 
boundary, 

1 
Θ =  b2
2 
Indeed,  they  conserve  the  average  of  any  function  of  buoyancy,  not  just  the  square, 
so that we have to worry about whether or not the energy and buoyancy variance tell 
the  whole  story.

There  is  a  remarkable  confusion  in  the  literature  on  the  appropriate  deﬁnition  of  en­
ergy for SQG ﬂows.  The discussion hinges on a misunderstanding about the diﬀerence 
between  surface  averaged  energy, 

and  volume  averaged  energy,

the  two  spectra  have  diﬀerent  units  and, more  importantly,  diﬀerent  slopes. 

12.3  SQG  turbulence 

Blumen  (1978)  has  presented  the  Kolmogorov-Kraichnan  scaling  arguments  for  the 
spectral  shapes  expected  in  the  SQG  turbulent  inertial  ranges,  and  these  have  been 
compared  with  numerical  simulations  by  Pierrehumbert,  Held  and  Swanson  (1994).

(12.13)

with  Θ(K ) =  KE (K ) =  U (K ),  where  U (K )  is  the  power  spectrum  of  the  velocity 
ﬁeld.  The  spectral  ﬂuxes  are  deﬁned  by  ∂tE  =  −∂K FE  and  ∂tΘ =  −∂K FΘ .  In 
equilibrium,  both  FE  and  FΘ  must  be  constant. 

The dimensions of FE /FΘ  are L.  The fundamental tenet of the Kolmogorov-Kraichnan 
scale analysis  is that the only available  length scale  is the  local eddy scale K −1 .  Since 
the ﬂuxes must be independent of K , only one of FE  and FΘ  can be nonzero.  Nonzero 
FE  yields  the  energy  cascading  spectrum;  since  the  dimensions  of  E  are  L2T −2  and 
the  dimensions  of  FΘ  are  L3T −3 ,  dimensional  analysis  implies, 
E (K ) = CE (FE )2/3K −3 , 
Θ(K ) = CΘ (FE )2/3K −1 . 

(12.14) 

Following  similar  reasoning,  the  spectrum  in  the  variance  cascading  range  is, 
E (K ) = CE (FΘ )2/3K −8/3 , 
Θ(K ) = CΘ (FΘ )2/3K −5/3 . 

(12.15)

�� 
�� 
Following Kraichnan, the strain rate due to eddies with scale 1/K  is  K 2U (K )dK  = 
KΘ(K )dK .  Substituting  (12.15)  for  the  spectrum,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  enstrophy 
cascade  is  dominated  by  local  strain  in  SQG.  In  the  direct  enstrophy  cascade  range 
of  QG,  the  K −1  local  scaling  spectrum  is  the  same  as  the  passive  scalar  spectrum 
predicted  for  the  strongly  nonlocal  case  in  which  straining  is  dominated  by  large 
eddies with a ﬁxed timescale.  Thus, the spectral behavior shades continuously over to 
the nonlocal scaling.  This is because  in QG the conserved quantity q  is coincidentally 
the  straining  rate. 

It  is  important to notice that the energy spectrum E  refers to the 3D volume  integral 
of  potential  plus  kinetic  energies.  However  the  kinetic  and  potential  energies  at  the 
lower  boundaries  both  scale  like  the  buoyancy  variance  spectrum  Θ.  In  SQG  the 
energy  spectrum  in  the  interior  diﬀers  from  that  at  the  surface,  because  each  normal 
mode  of  the  system  decays  at  a  diﬀerent  rate  away  from  the  boundary  so  that  the 
surface  and  interior  spectra  can  be  quite  diﬀerent. 

12.3.1  Fj¨ort¨oft’s  argument 

Fj¨ort¨oft’s  (1953)  argument  for  the  direction  of  the  energy  ﬂux  in  2D  turbulent  ﬂows 
can  also  be  applied  to  the  SQG  ﬂow  problem  with minor modiﬁcations.  Suppose  we 
have  unit  energy  at  a  wavenumber K  such  that, 

Θ(K ) = KE (K ), 

and  we  wish  to  transfer  it  elsewhere  through  inviscid  interactions.  Let  a  fraction  α1 
go to larger scales (K/2) and α2  to smaller scales (2K ).  Then our energy and variance 
pictures  look  like,

If  we  conserve  both  energy  and  variance  by  this  interaction  (i.e.,  we’re  in  an  inertial 
range),  we  ﬁnd  α1  = 2α2  so  that,

More  energy  is  transferred  to  large  scales  and more  variance  to  small  scales.  In  SQG 
the  baricenter  of  the  energy  remains  at  wavenumber  K  while  the  baricenter  of  the 
buoyancy  variance  shifts  to  K (1 + 1.5α2 ).  In  the  energy  cascade  to  larger  scale,  the 
vertical  scale  can  increase  –  the  ﬂow  becomes more  barotropic. 

12.4  Spectral  transfers 

A  study  of  triad  interactions  illustrates  the  dynamics  behind  the  direct  and  inverse 
cascades  of  SQG  turbulence.  Let  us  transform  the  streamfunction  to  wavenumber 
space, 

ψ  = ψˆ(k , �, t) exp(ıkx + ı�y − K z ), 
b  = ˆb(k , �, t) exp(ıkx + ı�y − K z ). 
We introduce a shorthand ψj  = ψˆ(k , �, t) so that each diﬀerent subscript j corresponds 
to  a  diﬀerent  set  of  {k , �}  values.  The  streamfunction  is  related  to  the  buoyancy 
variance  by, 
j )1/2ψj  = −Kj ψj . 
2  + �2 
bj  = (kj 
Now  we  can  pro ject  out  the  equation  for  the  amplitude  of  one  mode  by  multiplying 
the  equation  by  exp(−ik2  · x)  and  surface  averaging,

These  equations  are  identical  to  those  obtained  for  the  QG  problem  except  for  the

replacement  of  K2
between  the  two  conserved  quantities:  energy  and  enstrophy  in  QG,  energy  and 
buoyancy  variance  in  SQG.  Following  the  approach  described  for  the  QG  problem,

Let us  look  at  one  triad  of wavenumbers k1 , k2 , k3  and  choose  the  labelling  such  that 
K1  < K2  < K3 .  The  dynamics  of  this  triad  is  given  by,

Energy  leaving  component  2  will  transfer  into  both  1  and  3;  when  it  does  so,  the 
triads with K3 − K2  > K2 − K1  put more  energy  into  the  larger  scale mode  than  the 
smaller  scale  one,  and  put more  buoyancy  variance  into  the  smaller  scale mode  than 
the  larger  scale  one.

Following Merilees  and Warn  (JAS,  1975), who  studied  triads  interactions  in  the QG 
problem,  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  energy  ﬂows  from  or  to  the  middle  wave, 
represented  by K2 ,  will  be  considered  for  the  SQG  problem.  We  can  write,

The  region  in  (φ, r)  space where  the  vector  k1  may  terminate  is  shown  in  Fig.1.  The 
conditions  K1  < K2  and  ∂tE1/∂tE3  ≥  0  provide  the  respective  boundaries  of  this 
region,  i.e.  r = 1 and  cos φ = −r/2.  The  energy and  enstrophy  exchange diagram  for 
QG  is  very  similar  to  Fig.1,  although  the  relative  magnitudes  of  the  regions  where 
∂tE1/∂tE3  ≥  1  and  ∂tZ1/∂tZ3  ≥  1  are  slightly  diﬀerent.  In  the  present  case  about 
61% of  the  interactions  lead  to a  larger exchange of depth-integrated energy with  low 
wavenumbers, ∂tE1/∂tE3  ≥ 1.  More available potential energy on the boundaries,  i.e. 
boundary buoyancy variance,  is sent to high wavenumbers  in 57% of the  interactions, 
∂tΘ1/∂tΘ3  < 1. 

12.5  The  eﬀect  of  a  rigid  upper  lid 

A  rigid  upper  lid  changes  the  properties  of  SQG  turbulence,  because  it  introduces  a 
vertical  scale  in  the  problem, 
∂tb = −J (ψ , b), 
b ≡ f ∂z ψ , 
q ≡ (∂xx  + ∂yy  + ∂zz ) ψ ,

A remarkable property of the ﬁnite-depth SQG problem is that it transitions between 
quasi-two-dimensional barotropic ﬂow at large scales and baroclinic three-dimensional 
ﬂow  at  small  scales. 

The solution to the SQG problem with a bottom rigid lid shows that as the horizontal 
scales get larger (or K  gets smaller), the penetration depth of the buoyancy anomalies 
increases,  with  aspect  ratio  given  by  the  Prandtl  ratio,  S  =  N/f .  At  large  enough 
scale,  the  penetration  will  reach  deep  into  the  interior  ﬂow  all  the  way  to  the  upper 
lid.  The  eﬀect  of  an  upper  limit  in  the  penetration  of  buoyancy  anomalies  is  best 
described  in  terms  of  the  solutions  of  the  SQG  problem, 

ˆψ(k, z ) = 

cosh[S (z + H )K ] 
ˆb(k, 0), 
SK sinh(SHK ) 

which  at  the  upper  surface  becomes, 
ˆψ(k, 0) = (SK )−1  tanh(SHK )ˆb(k, 0). 

(12.28) 

(12.29) 

The  remarkable  property  of  this  ﬁnite-depth  SQG  model  results  from  the  properties 
of  the  hyperbolic  tangent  in  the  inversion.  At  large  scales,  or  K  �  (SH )−1 ,  the 
buoyancy  is  related  to  the  streamfunction  like  ˆb(k, 0)  ∼  S 2HK 2ψˆ(k, 0),  while  at 
small  scales,  or  K  �  (SH )−1 ,  the  inversion  is  approximately  ˆb(k, 0)  ∼  SK ψˆ(k, 0). 
Thus  the  relation  at  the  surface  of  streamfunction  to  advected  quantity  (buoyancy) 
transitions  from  a  2D-like  inversion  at  large  scales,  to  an  SQG-like  inversion  at  small 
scales,  with  the  transition  occurring  at  the  wavenumber 
Kt  ≡ (SH )−1  =

The  transition  scale  is  the  deformation  radius. 

Tulloch  and  Smith  (2006)  have  recently  suggested  that  the  transition  between  2D 
and  SQG  spectral  slopes  in  ﬁnite  depth  ﬂuids  can  be  seen  in  measurements  of  at­
mospheric  spectra.  The  horizontal  spectra  of  atmospheric  wind  and  temperature  at 
the  tropopause  have  a  steep  −3  slope  at  synoptic  scales,  but  transition  to  −5/3  at 
wavelengths of order 500 − 1000 km.  The basic idea is that temperature perturbations 
generated  at  the  planetary  scale  excite  a  direct  cascade  of  energy  with  a  slope  of −3 
at  large  scales,  −5/3  at  small  scales  and  a  transition  near  horizontal  wavenumber 
Kt  =  f /N H ,  where  f  is  the  Coriolis  parameter.  Ballpark  atmospheric  estimates 
for  N ,  f  and  H  give  a  transition  wavenumber  near  the  one  observed.  Numerical 
simulations  also  support  the  expected  behavior.

12.6  The  Eady  problem 

Introducing an environmental horizontal buoyancy gradient in SQG, analogous to the 
β -eﬀect  in  two-dimensional  ﬂow,  results  in, 
∂tb = −J (ψ , b + Λy), 

at  z = 0, H . 

(12.31) 

The  constant Λ  can  equivalently  be  thought  of  as  due  to  a  background  vertical  shear 
in the x-component of the ﬂow, f uz  = −Λ.  As this contributes nothing to the interior 
potential vorticity, the interior equation is unaltered.  This system now supports linear 
waves  with  the  dispersion  relation,

.  (This  should  be  contrasted  with  the  familiar  Rossby 
wave dispersion  relation, ω = −β k/K 2 .)  These  are  edge waves  that decay  away  from 
the  surface  as  e−K z .  The  interaction  between  two  such waves,  one  at  the  surface  and 
another  at  the  tropopause,  gives  rise  to  baroclinic  instability  in  Eadys  (1949)  classic 
model  of  that  process.

In  the  Eady  problem  perturbations  develop  as  a  result  of  a  baroclinic  instability 
of  the  basic  state.  the  most  unstable  wavenumber  (k , �)  =  (2.4f /N H, 0)  can  be 
considered  as  the  injection  scale.  One  might  therefore  expect  a  2D  inverse  cas­
cade  of  energy  toward  larger  scales  and  an  SQG  direct  cascade  of  buoyancy  vari­
ance  toward  smaller  scales.  The  corresponding  spectral  slopes  are  expected  to  be,

The direct numerical simulations shown in the webpage do not seem to reproduce the 
transition between  the direct  and  inverse  cascade  regimes.  however more needs  to be 
done  to  properly  explore  the  parameter  space  of  the  problem. 

Held  et  al.  (1994)  discuss  in  detail  the  properties  of  the  direct  and  inverse  cascades 
in  Eady  turbulence.  In  the  direct  cascade  of  buoyancy  variance  to  small  scales  they 
show that strains generates ﬁlaments of high vorticity.  This vorticity ﬁeld is of interest 
when  one  considers  the  geostrophic  momentum  (GM)  equations  (Hoskins  1975).  In 
this  extension  of  quasigeostrophic  theory,  one  approximates  the  momentum  by  the 
momentum  of  the  geostrophic  ﬂow,  but  advects  it  with  the  full,  geostrophic  plus 
ageostrophic, ﬂow.  It turns out that the GM equations can be solved by transforming 
to geostrophic  coordinates  in which  coordinate  system  the  equations  simply  reduce  to 
quasigeostrophy.  Therefore,  one  can  take  a  quasi-geostrophic  solution,  such  as  those 
shown  in  the  webapge,  and  transform  it  into  a  solution  of  the  GM  equations.  The 
Jacobian of the transformation is essentially 1−ζ /f , where ζ  is the vorticity.  When the 
Rossby number ζ /f  reaches unity, GM predicts the  formation of a  frontal singularity.

The  implication  is  that  one  can  anticipate  a  ﬁligree  of  microfrontal  singularities  in 
homogeneous  turbulent  simulations  of  the  geostrophic  momentum  equations.  The 
possibility  that  the  quasi-geostrophic  equations  themselves  would  also  form  such  a 
pattern  of  discontinuities  has  been  raised  by  Constantin  et  al.  (1994).  But  GM 
predicts  that  the  ﬂow  will  develop  a  singularity  well  before  the  SQG  equations  do. 
The  main  point  is  that  SQG  can  be  expected  to  reproduce  well  the  eddy  stirring  of 
buoyancy  at  the  boundaries,  but  not  necessarily  the  ﬁnal  frontal  collapse. 

The  inverse  energy  cascade  in  SQG  appears  to  have  much  in  common  with  that  in 
the  two-dimensional  case.  held  et  al.  (1994)  show  snapshots  from  the  free  evolution 
of  an  SQG  ﬂow  with  an  initial  white  noise  temperature  ﬁeld.  In  the  movie  of  Eady 
turbulence  there  is  a  transfer  of  energy  toward  larger  scales  during  the  spinup  phase. 
Vortices  form  as  the  cascade  proceeds,  more  or  less  as  in  two  dimensional  ﬂow  (e.g. 
McWilliams  1984),  and  the  evolution  can  be  thought  of  as  the  movement  of  the 
vortices in the ﬂow ﬁeld induced by other vortices, with occasional intense encounters. 
There  is  considerable  pairing  of  vortices  and  the  sporadic  formation  of  larger  groups, 
but  we  have  not  yet  attempted  to  determine  whether  there  is  a  greater  tendency  for 
the  formation  of  assemblages  than  in  two-dimensions,  as  suggested  by  the  discussion 
at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter.  A  qualitative  diﬀerence  hinted  at  by  the  movie  is 
that  vortex  encounters  are  more  violent  than  in  two-dimensional  ﬂow:  rather  than 
merger accompanied by the  formation of relatively passive ﬁlaments,  encounters such 
as  that  seen on  the  left  edge of  the domain are almost  invariably accompanied by  the 
formation  of  small  satellite  vortices,  through  the  ﬁlamentary  instabilities  described 
above.  The  formation  of  these  satellite  vortices  should  modify  the  evolution  of  the 
vortex  size  probability  distribution  in  important  ways. 

Rhines  (1975)  has  discussed  the  way  in  which  the  inverse  energy  cascade  in  two-
dimensional ﬂow  is halted by the presence of an environmental vorticity gradient,  the 
beta-eﬀect (see also Vallis and Maltrud 1992).  In the two-dimensional case, within the 
K −5/3  inverse  energy  cascade  range  the  characteristic  inverse  timescale,  or  advective 
� 
frequency,  of  an  eddy  with  wavenumber  is, 
ωad  =  K 2E (K )dK  ∝ K 2/3 
Comparing  with  the  Rossby  wave  dispersion  relation,  ωR  =  −β k/K 2 ,  one  sees  that 
wave dispersion will eventually dominate, except along the k = 0 axis.  The transition 
is  a  fairly  sharp  one:  ωR/ωad  ∝  K −5/3  for  l  =  0.  In  the  SQG  case,  the  surface 
ﬂow  and  buoyancy  are  predicted  to  have  a  K −5/3  spectral  shape  as  well.  The  edge 
wave  frequency  is  ωE  =  −Λk/K ,  giving  the  ratio  ωE /ωad  ∝  K −2/3 .  Thus,  we  still 
expect  a  transition  between  turbulent  and  wavelike  behaviour,  but  a  more  gradual 
one, with increasing scale.  Numerical experiments in which the inverse energy cascade 
is  arrested  with  an  environmental  temperature  gradient  have  yet  to  be  performed.
