Chapter  1 

Introduction 

Richard  Feynman  (1964)  in  his  Lecture  on  Physics  observed  that, 

Often,  people,  in  some  unjustiﬁed  fear  of  physics,  say  you  can’t  write  an 
equation  for  life.  Well,  perhaps  we  can.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  we  very 
possibly already have the equation to a suﬃcient approximation, when we 
write  the  equation  for  quantum  mechanics: 
H ψ = − 
¯h 
∂ψ 
. 
i  ∂ t 
However, we  are unable  to  reconstruct  the ﬁeld  of biology  from  this  equa­
tion,  and  we  depend  on  detailed  observation  of  biological  phenomena. 

(1.1)

Uriel  Frisch  (1995)  in  his  book  Turbulence  points  out  that  an  analogous  situation 
prevails  in  the  study  of  turbulent  ﬂows.  The  equation,  generally  referred  to  as  the 
Navier-Stokes  equation,  has  been  know  since  Navier  (1827)  and  Stokes  (1845), 
= − ∇p + ν∇2 u, 
Du 
1 
Dt 
ρ0 
∇ · u = 0, 
The  Navier-Stokes  equations  probably  contain  all  of  turbulence.  Yet  it  would  be 
foolish  to  try  to  guess  from  these  equations  all  the  variety  of  regimes  of  turbulent 
ﬂows  without  looking  at  experimental  facts.  The  phenomena  are  almost  as  varied  as 
in  the  realm of  life.  The ﬂows  shown  in Fig. 1 are  example  of  solutions  of  the Navier-
Stokes  equations,  with  modiﬁcations  to  account  for  rotation  and  density  variations. 
But  nobody  knows  how  to  derive  these  solutions  from  the  equations  themselves. 

(1.3) 

(1.2)

A  good  way  to  make  contact  with  the  world  of  turbulence  phenomena  is  through 
observations  of  natural  ﬂows.  Examples  are  ubiquitous  in  the  ocean,  atmosphere,

atmosphere,  in  the  Gulf  Stream  at  the  ocean  surface,  and  in  a  volcanic  eruption. 

lakes,  and  rivers  of  our  Earth,  in  the  atmospheres  of  other  planes,  in  stars,  galaxies, 
and  space  gases  (neutral  and  ionized).  A  few  examples  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  These 
ﬂows are very irregular and do not display the regularity of the solutions of the Navier-
Stokes equations that you studied in introductory courses in ﬂuid dynamics.  The ﬁeld 
of  turbulence  can  be  deﬁned  as  the  attempt  to  bring  together  our  understanding  of 
the  laws  that  govern  ﬂuid  dynamics  (the Navier-Stokes  equations)  with  the  irregular 
nature  of  real  ﬂows. 

But how  can we  tell which  natural ﬂows  are  turbulent  and which  are  not?  As  for  the 
problem  of  deﬁning  life,  there  is  no  simple  answer.  A  useful  approach  is  to  list  what 
properties must  be  present  to  consider  a  ﬂow  turbulent. 

1.1  Properties  of  turbulent  ﬂows 
•  Broadband  spectrum  in  space  and  time 
Turbulent  ﬂows  are  characterized  by  structures  on a broad  range of  spatial  and 
temporal  scales,  even  given  smooth  or  periodic  initial  conditions  and  forcing. 
That  is  turbulent  ﬂows  have  a  broadband  spectrum  both  in  frequency  and 
wavenumber  domains.

If  L  is  the  length  scale  of  the  largest  motions  and  l  is  the  length  scale  of  the 
smallest motions in a ﬂow, then a large range of spatial scales implies L (cid:2)  l. The 
scale l is typically the scale at which dissipation becomes important and removes 
energy  from  the  ﬂow.  The  scale  L,  instead,  is  set  by  the  forcing  mechanisms 
that  set  the  large-scale  ﬂow.  The  ratio  L/l  is  the  Reynolds  number  Re, and 
L (cid:2)  l  implies  that  the  Reynolds  number  be  large.  Turbulent  ﬂows  have  large 
Reynolds  numbers  (Fig.  1.2  and  1.3). 
•  Dominated  by  advective  nonlinearity 
A  ﬁeld  of  non-interacting  linear  internal  waves  with many  diﬀerent  frequencies 
and  wavenumbers  can  also  have  a  large  range  of  length  scales,  but  it  is  not 
turbulent.  Why  not?  In  a  turbulent  ﬂow  the  diﬀerent  scales  interact,  through 
the nonlinear terms in the equations of motion.  And these nonlinear interactions 
are  responsible  for  the  presence  of  structure  on many  diﬀerent  scales.  Thus  the 
broad band  spectrum  appears  as  a  result  of  the  internal  dynamics.  In  a  ﬁeld  of 
linear internal waves,  instead, the broad band spectrum is generated by external 
controls  like  forcing,  initial  or  boundary  conditions  (Fig.  1.4). 
•  Unpredictable  in  space  and  time 
Turbulent  ﬂows  are  predictable  for  only  short  times  and  short  distances.  Even 
though we know  the equations  that govern  the evolution  of the ﬂuid, we  cannot 
make  predictions  about  the  details  of  the  ﬂow  due  to  its  sensitive  dependence 
on  initial  and  boundary  conditions.  This  sensitive  dependence  is  once  more 
a  result  of  the  strong  nonlinearity  of  the  ﬂow.  Predictability,  however,  can  be 
recovered in a statistical sense, as we will see in lecture 2 (Fig. 1.5).  The sensitive 
dependence  on  initial  and  boundary  conditions  is  a  fundamental  property  of 
chaotic  systems.  Are  thus  turbulence  and  chaos  synonyms?  No.  Turbulent 
motions  are  indeed  chaotic,  but  chaotic  motions  need  not  be  turbulent.  Chaos 
may  involve  only  a  small  number  of  degrees  of  freedom,  i.e.  it  can  be  narrow 
band  in  space  and/or  time.  There  are  numerous  examples  of  chaotic  systems 
characterized  by  temporal  complexity,  but  spatial  simplicity,  like  the  Lorenz’s 
system.  Another  class  of  chaotic  ﬂows  is  represented  by  amplitude  equations

space  shuttle  on  Jan.  14,  1986.  The  picture  shows  the  sea  surface  of  the  Eastern 
Paciﬁc,  around  the  Galapagos  Islands,  600  miles  oﬀ  the  coast  of  Ecuador.  The  sea 
surface  coverage  of  a  photograph  is  about  of  75  km  by  75  km.  There  is  a  clear 
diﬀerence  between  the wavy  patterns  of  internal waves  and  the  turbulent  patterns  of

that  describe  the  slow  time  and  large  scale  evolution  of  nearly  monochromatic 
waves.  Turbulence  is  diﬀerent,  because  it  is  always  complex  both  in  space  and 
time. 
•	 Time  irreversible 
Turbulent  motions  are  not  time  reversible.  As  time  goes  on,  turbulent  motions 
tend to  forget their  initial conditions and reach  some equilibrated  state.  Turbu­
lence mixes  stuﬀ  up,  it  does  not  unmix  it  (Fig.  1.6).  A  challenge  of  this  course 
will  be  to  explain  how  irreversibility  can  arise  in  ﬂuids  that  are  governed  by 
classical  mechanics,  i.e.  Newton’s  dynamics,  which  is  time  reversible. 

The  classiﬁcation  of  properties  that  a  ﬂow  must  display  to  be  considered  turbulent 
is  a  sub ject  of  continuous  debate  in  the  scientiﬁc  community.  Many  authors  make 
narrower  deﬁnitions  of  turbulence,  limiting  the  scope  to 
•	 ﬂows  exhibiting  explosive  three  dimensional  vortex  stretching 
•	 ﬂows  obeying  Kolmogorov’s  cascade  law  (to  be  described  later) 
•	 ﬂows  with  a  ﬁnite  cascade  of  energy  toward  smaller  scales. 

These  deﬁnitions  are  arbitrarily  exclusive,  since  there  are  many  geophysical  ﬂows 
which  share  the  fundamental properties of broadband  spectrum,  advective  nonlinear­
ity,  unpredictability,  and  time  irreversibility,  yet,  due  to  the  eﬀects  of  rotation  and 
stratiﬁcation,  are  not  fully  three  dimensional,  do  not  satisfy  Kolmogorov’s  law,  and 
have  no  energy  transfer  toward  smaller  scales. 

The  properties  of  turbulent  ﬂows  are  better  described  in  terms  of  dualities  between 
regular  and  turbulent  ﬂows.  Here  we  follow  a  list  proposed  by  Jim  McWilliams,  a 
very  inﬂuential  oceanographer  from  UCLA. 
•	 Deterministic  vs  random. 
The  equation  of  motions  are  deterministic,  but  their  solutions  have  many  at­
tributes  of  random  processes. 
•	 Orderly  versus  chaotic. 
Many of  the spatial  and  temporal patterns are orderly,  but  the overall behavior 
is  clearly  chaotic. 
•	 Time  reversible  versus  time  irreversible. 
If  we  neglect  ν  and  κ  (because  Re  is  large),  then  the  equations  are  time  re­
versible,  i.e.  any  solutions  for  (t, u, p, b)  is  also a  solution  for  (−t, −u, p, b), but 
the  outcome  is  evidently  irreversible,  even  after  a  short  period  of  time  of  the 
order  of  the  eddy  turnover  time,  L/U .  The  breaking  of  symmetries  is  a  salient 
feature  of  turbulent motions.

upstream,  i.e.  initial  conditions.  The  statistical  properties  of  the  two  signals  are 
similar,  but  the  details  of  the  ﬂow  are  completely  diﬀerent.

Figure  1.6:  Evolution  of  a  simulated  tracer  deployed  in  the  Arctic  vortex  in  April 
1993.  The  circles  on  plots  for  30  April,  1,  6,  and  7  May  are  the  location  where 
tracer  values  representative  of  vortex  air  where  measured  aboard  the  ER-2  aircraft. 
There  is  good agreement  between  the  location of  the ﬁlaments  of  ex-vortex  air  in  the 
simulation  and  the  locations  where  vortex  air  was  observed  (See Waugh  et  al.,  1997 
for  details).  The  tracer  tends  to  spread  out  from  the  location where  it  was  released. 
•	 Materially  conﬁned  versus  dispersive. 
Parcels  initially  close  to  each  other,  tend  to  spread  in  time.  Turbulence  mixes 
tracers,  it  doesn’t  unmix  them. 
•	 Conservative  versus  non-conservative. 
If  we  neglect  ν  and  κ,  then  the  equations  are  conservative  (of  energy,  tracer 
variance,  etc.),  but  the  outcome  of  turbulence  is  dissipative  (the  second  law  of 
thermodynamics applies).  If dissipation continues to occur in a regime with only 
large-scale forcing or initial conditions – as is true for the Earth’s climate system 
– then there must be a continuing  transfer of ﬂuid properties from larger spatial 
scales  to  smaller  ones,  and  eventually  small  enough  so  that  diﬀusive  terms  can 
be  comparable  to  the  advective  ones.  This  process  is  called  the  forward  (i.e. 
toward  smaller  scales)  turbulent  cascade. 
•	 Quasi-periodic  and  spatially  smooth  versus  broad-band. 
Turbulence  develops  a  broad  spectrum  in  (ω , k)  space  even  when  given  smooth 
or periodic initial conditions or forcing.  The spectra of atmospheric and oceanic 
ﬂows  can  show  some  indication  of  preferred  time  and  spatial  scales,  but  have 
broad-band  shape  (examples:  atmospheric  near-surface  wind  frequency  spec­
trum and oceanic internal wave frequency spectrum).  Spectra often have power-
−5/3 
law  forms  over  wide  frequency  and  wavenumber  ranges  (e.g.  the  famous  k
−5 
form  of  the  Kolmogorov  cascade  in  three-dimensional  turbulence  and  the  ω

10 

frequency  spectrum  for  surface  waves  in  the  open  ocean). 
•	 Predictable  versus  unpredictable.  A  turbulent  ﬂow  is  predictable  for  only  a 
limited  period  of  time,  usually  of  the  order  of  several  eddy  turnover  times, 
L/U .  On  the  other  hand  statistical  properties  of  the  ﬂow  can  be  quite  stable, 
hence in principle predictable.  This situation is reminiscent of thermodynamics: 
if  we  put  two  bodies  of  diﬀerent  temperatures  in  contact  we  can  predict  their 
ﬁnal  temperature,  but  not  the  tra jectory  of  every  single  molecule. 
•	 Smooth  versus  sensitive  dependence. 
The  evolution  of  the  partial  diﬀerential  equations  of  ﬂuid  dynamics  is  ill-posed 
in  the  classical  sense,  in  that  small  changes  in  any  aspect  of  the  problem  for­
mulation  (initial conditions,  boundary conditions, model parameters,  etc.) lead 
to  large  macroscopic  changes  in  the  solution  after  a  ﬁnite  time,  the  so-called 
predictability  time. 
•	 Statistically  regular  versus  statistically  irregular. 
Some statistical measures of turbulence have nearly Gaussian probability distri­
butions, but the overall structure of turbulent ﬁelds is highly non-Gaussian with 
rare  and  intense  events  relatively  more  probable  (i.e.  turbulence  has  bursts). 
•	 Globally  ordered  versus  locally  ordered. 
Global  ordering  is  rare  for  large  Re,  unless  it  is  established  through  ordered 
forcing  or  domain  geometry.  But  local  ordering,  particularly  of  the  vorticity 
ﬁeld,  is  nearly  universal.  This  local  ordering  is  the  coherent  structures. 
•	 Persistent  versus  transient,  evanescent,  chaotically  recurrent  patterns. 
The  evident  ordering  in  the  ﬂow  patterns  is  usually  transient.  Coherent  struc­
tures  appear  and  disappear  in  an  unpredictable  sequence. 

In  real  turbulent  ﬂows  neither  pair  of  the  antonyms  is  entirely  false.  However  much 
of  our  understanding  of  turbulence  lies  in  comprehending  how  ﬂows  transitions  from 
one member  of  the  antonym  to  the  other. 

1.2  Governing  equations 

We  will  take  a  simpliﬁed  form  of  the  governing  equations  for  use  in  this  course, 
viz.,  the  Boussinesq  equations.  The  ocean  and  the  atmosphere  have  a  more  complex 
thermodynamics  than  these  equations  do,  but  this  is  largely  extraneous  to  the  fun­
damental  behaviors  of  turbulence  and  thus  will  be  ignored.  The  three  dimensional

where p is the pressure,  f  is the Coriolis frequency associated with planetary rotation, 
and  the  vertical  versor  zˆ is  assumed  to  be  parallel  to  both  gravity  and  the  axis  of 
rotation.  The  buoyancy  b  is  deﬁned  in  terms  of  density  as  ρ =  ρ0 (1 − g
−1b).  Notice 
that  b  has  the  dimension  of  an  acceleration.  These  equations must  be  complemented 
by  forcing,  boundary  and  initial  conditions  to  obtain  a  well  posed  problem.  We  can 
also  consider  the  evolution  of  a  passive  tracer  c:  it  satisﬁes  the  same  equation  as  b, 
but  it  has  no  inﬂuence  on  the  evolution  of  u.  [The  Boussinesq  equations  follow  from 
the  full  Navier-Stokes  equations  if  one  neglects  all  density  ﬂuctuations  except  those 
due  to  heat,  salt,  and  humidity]. 

These  equations  have  conservative  integral  invariants  for  energy,  and  all  powers  and 
other  functionals  of  buoyancy,  in  the  absence  of  friction  and  diﬀusion.  For  non-
conservative  dynamics,  the  energy  and  scalar  variance  satisfy  the  equations,

In  deriving  (1.8),  it  is  assumed  that  there  are  no  boundary  ﬂuxes  of  energy  or  scalar 
variance.  These  integrals  measures  of  the  ﬂow  can  only  decrease  with  time  through 
the action of molecular viscosity and diﬀusivity.  The only exception is the compressive 
work,  κz∇2 b,  which  can  act  as  a  source  of mechanical  energy.  We  will  return  to  this 
issue  in the  chapter on convection. 

Every  problem  we  will  consider  lies  within  the  set  of  solutions  of  the  PDE  system  in 
(1.4)  through  (1.7).  No  general  solution  is  known,  nor  is  any  in  prospect,  because 
we  do  not  know  a mathematical  methodology  that  seems  powerful  enough.  However 
computers  are  giving  us  access  to  progressively  better  particular  solutions,  i.e.  with 
progressively  larger Re. 

12 

The  brackets  in  (1.4)  through  (1.5) contain  the  eﬀects  of buoyancy  and  rotation,  and 
these  terms  are  ignored  in  the  classical  literature  on  turbulence,  which  deals  with 
uniform  density  ﬂuids  in  inertial  reference  frames.  In  these  simpler  circumstances, 
the  Boussinesq  system  is  called  the  incompressible  Navier-Stokes  equations,  or  with 
the  further  elimination  of  the  frictional  term,  the  incompressible  Euler  equations. 

Because  of  the  lack  of  general  solutions  to  the  Boussinesq  equations,  it  is  useful  to 
identify which  terms might be neglected  in  speciﬁc  situations  in  order  to  simplify  the 
problem  and  make  analytical  progress.  The  relative  size  of  the  various  terms  that 
appear  in  (1.4)  through  (1.7)  can  be  estimated  in  terms  of  nondimensional  numbers. 
The  ones  that  will  be most  useful  in  this  class  are  as  follows. 

•	 Inertia  and  friction

The Reynolds  number  is  deﬁned  as

Re ≡	

U L 
ν 

(1.10)

Here  U  and  L  are  characteristic  velocity  and  length  scales  of  the  ﬂow  and  ν  is 
the  kinematic  viscosity  of  the  ﬂuid.  The  Reynolds  number  measures  the  ratio 
of  inertia  and  friction, 

(1.11) 

|(u · ∇)u|  U/L  U 
|ν∇2u| ≈
νU/L2  = Re.	
Equivalently,  the Reynolds  number  is  the  ratio of  the  characteristic  scale  of  the 
ﬂow  L  and  the  scale  at  which  momentum  is  dissipated  l  =  ν /U .  In  turbulent 
ﬂows Re (cid:2) 1, advective  dominance ⇒ nonlinear dynamics ⇒ chaotic  evolution 
and  broadband  spectrum. 
The  focus  of  this  course  is  on  turbulence  in  the  Earth’s  ocean  and  atmosphere. 
Typical  values  for  ν  near  the  Earth’s  surface  are  1.5 × 10
−5  m2  s
−1  for  air 
and  1.0 × 10
−6  m2  s
−1  for  water.  These  values  are  small  enough,  given  typical 
velocities  U , that  Re  (cid:2) 1  on  all  spatial  scales  L  from  the  ﬁnescale  of  about 
−1  and 
1  m  to  the  planetary  scale  of  about  104  km.  For  example,  U  = 1 m s
L = 103  m give Re = 109 − 1010  respectively  for  the  atmosphere  and  the  ocean. 
For Re (cid:2) 1,  the  frictional  term  is  small,  at  least  at  the  scale  L.  Paradoxically, 
however,  the  dissipation  terms  in  (1.8)  control  the  energetics  of  the  system. 
Thus,  there must  be  a  profound  diﬀerence  in  solutions  between  the  asymptotic 
tendency  as  Re  → ∞,  and  the  Euler  limit,  Re  = ∞ or  ν  =  0.  The  diﬀerence 
is  that  as  long  as  Re  ≤ ∞,  there  are  small  scales  at  which  friction  becomes 
important  and  Re  is  small. 
It is instructive to check how Re controls the behavior of solutions in a real ﬂow. 
Let us consider a ﬂuid of uniform density  in an inertial reference system,  i.e.  let

us neglect rotation and variations in buoyancy  in (1.4) and (1.5) (b = f  = 0).  A 
classical  example  is  a  uniform  ﬂow  incident  on  a  cylinder  (ﬁgure  1.7).  Figures 
1.8  through  1.10  show  how  the  ﬂow  past  the  cylinder  changes  for  diﬀerent 
Reynolds  numbers.  And  the movie  by Wim  de  Leeuw  at Re = 22000  gives  you 
the  feeling  of  how  complex  is  the  ﬂow  that  develops  behind  the  obstacle  (run 
dns-midi.mpg). 
•  Advection  and  diﬀusion 

P e ≡ 
U L 
κ 
The  Peclet  number  is  the  direct  analog  of Re  for  a  conserved  tracer  c  with  a 
diﬀusivity  κ  and  measures  the  relative  importance  of  advection  and  diﬀusion. 
At  large  P e,  the  tracer  evolution  is  dominated  by  advection.  Once  more,  the 
limit  P e → ∞ is  very  diﬀerent  from  P e  =  ∞,  because  dissipation,  no  matter 
how small,  eventually  is responsible  for removing  structure  from the tracer ﬁeld 
(Fig.  1.11). 
•  Friction  and  diﬀusion 

P r ≡ 
ν 
κ 
The  frictional  length  scale  is  lν  = ν /U  and  the  diﬀusive  length  scale  lκ  = κ/U . 
The  Prandtl  number  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  these  two  length  scales,  P r ≡

becomes  important  are  larger  than  those  for diﬀusion  and,  at  some  small  scale, 
we  expect  to  ﬁnd  smooth  velocity  ﬁelds  together  with  convoluted  tracer  ﬁelds. 
For P r < 1 we  expect  the opposite.  The Prandtl numbers  for air  and water  are 
0.7 and  12.2  respectively.  The  paper  by Paparella  and Young  (Journal  of Fluid 
Mechanics,  2002)  shows  examples  of  ﬂows  with  low  and  high  P r . 
•  Inertia  and  Coriolis

The Rossby  number  Ro measures  the  relative  importance  of  the  real  inertial 
forces  and  the  ﬁctitious  Coriolis  force,  that  appear  because  of  the  rotating  ref­
erence  system.  Thus Ro measures  the  importance of  rotation  in  the problem at 
hand.  Ro (cid:2)  1  characterizes  essentially  non-rotating  turbulence,  while  Ro ≤  1 
ﬂows  are  strongly  aﬀected  by  rotation  (Fig.  1.12).

In  convective  problems,  motions  are  generated  by  imposing  an  unstable  den­
sity  stratiﬁcation  on  the  ﬂuid  (∂ b/∂z  <  0).  In  these  problems,  it  is  useful  to 
characterize  turbulence  in  terms  of  the  Rayleigh  number,  i.e.  the  ratio  of 
the  diﬀusive  timescale  tκ  =  L2/κ  and  the  buoyancy  timescale  tb  = (L/∆b)1/2 . 
The  buoyancy  scale  ∆b  is  the  buoyancy  diﬀerence  maintained  across  the  layer 
depth  L  through  external  forcing.  If  the  forcing  is  imposed  by  maintaining  a

of  thermal  expansion  of  the  ﬂuid,  and  g  the  acceleration  of  gravity.  Convec­
tion  starts  if  tκ  (cid:2)  tb ,  i.e.  if  RaP r  (cid:2)  1,  when  diﬀusion  is  too  slow  to  change 
substantially  the  buoyancy  of  water/air  parcels  as  they  rise  (Fig.  1.13).

Ri ≡ 

∂ b/∂z 
|∂u/∂z |2 
In  the  presence  of  stable  buoyancy  stratiﬁcation,  vertical  motions  tend  to  be 
suppressed,  but  turbulence  can  still  emerge,  if  there  is  enough  energy  in  the 
horizontal  velocity  ﬁeld.  A  useful  parameter  to  characterize  the  ﬂow  in  these 
problems  is  the  ratio  of  the  buoyancy  timescale  tb  = (L/∆b)1/2  = 1/(∂ b/∂z)1/2 
and  the  inertial  timescale  due  to  horizontal  shears  in  the  ﬂow  ti  =  L/U  = 
1/(∂u/∂z).  This  ratio  is  called  the  gradient  Richardson  number  Ri. If  Ri  (cid:9) 
1,  buoyancy  can  be  neglected  in  the  momentum  equations,  and  it  becomes  a 
passive  scalar  with  no  feedbacks  on  the  dynamics  (Fig.  1.14).

A  ﬁnal  remark  about  the  only  term  that  never  appeared  explicitly  in  the  nondimen­
sional  numbers  presented:  the  pressure  force.  Pressure  can  be  formally  eliminated 
from  the  equations.  This  is  a  consequence  of  the  Boussinesq  approximation.  We 
simply  need  to  take  the divergence  of  the momentum  equation  in  (1.4)  and note  that 
∇ · ut  = 0  because  of  incompressibility.  This  yields  the  relation,

(cid:15) 
∇2 p = ρ0∇ ·  −(u · ∇)u + ν∇2 u + bzˆ − f zˆ × u  .

Since  there  are  no  time  derivatives  in  (1.17),  pressure  is  a  purely  diagnostic  ﬁeld, 
which  is  wholly  slaved  to  u.  It  can  be  calculated  from  (1.17)  and  then  substituted 
for  the  pressure  gradient  force  in  the  momentum  equations.  Its  role  is  to  maintain 
incompressibility  under  the  action  of  all  other  forces.  It  would  be  redundant  to  in­
troduce  nondimensional  parameters  involving  pressure,  because  any  such  parameters 
can  be  expressed  as  combinations  of  the  parameters  already  discussed.
