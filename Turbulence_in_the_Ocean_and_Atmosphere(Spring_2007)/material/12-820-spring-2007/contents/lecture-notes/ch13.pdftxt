Eddy  Diﬀusivity 

Glenn  introduced  the  mean  ﬁeld  approximation  of  turbulence  in  two-layer  quasi­
gesotrophic  turbulence.  In  that  approximation  one  must  solve  the  zonally  averaged 
equations  for  the  zonal mean  ﬂow  and  temperature  and  in  addition  the  equations  for 
the  pertrurbation  potential  vorticity.  This  approach  is  computationally  very  expen­
sive,  because  the  perturbation  potential  vorticity  must  be  solved  at  full  resolution 
and  require  short  time  steps.  In  this  lecture  we  discuss  under  what  approximations 
we  can  step  forward  the  zonal  mean  equations  without  solving  for  the  perturbation 
equations.

where  K  is  a  positive  deﬁnite  quantity  generally  referred  to  as  the  eddy  diﬀusivity. 
If  we  can  specify  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  in  terms  of  zonally  averaged  quantities,  we  can 
use  (13.6)  to  solve  the mean  ﬁeld  equations. 

The goal of this lecture is to introduce in a formal way the concept of eddy diﬀusivity. 
In  the  next  lecture we will  come  back  to  the  zonal mean  problem  for QG  turbulence. 
But  in  this  lecture we will  study  the  relationship  between mean  tracer  concentration 
and  tracer  ﬂuxes  in  general.  The  tracer will  be  any  concentration  c  that  satisﬁes  the 
advection-diﬀusion  equation.  The QGPV  budget  is  an  example  of  such  a  tracer. 

13.1  Tracer  transport 

We  want  to  study  the  tracer  ﬂuxes  generated  by  a  turbulent  ﬂow.  Our  goal  is  to 
derive  an  expression  for  the  eddy  ﬂuxes  in  terms  of  mean  quantities.  Consider  a 
generic  passive  tracer  of  concentration  c, 
ct  + u · �c = κ�2 c, 
(13.7) 
where  κ  is  the  molecular  diﬀusivity  and  u  is  an  incompressible  (� · u  =  0)  velocity 
ﬁeld.  The  velocity  ﬁeld  is  given  in  this  problem,  i.e.  we  do  not  write  a  momentum 
equation to solve for the velocity ﬁeld.  The equation for the mean tracer concentration 
is, 
c¯t  + u¯ · �c¯ + � · u�c�  = κ�2c.¯
(13.8) 
The  fundamental  problem  of  tracer  turbulence  is  to  determine  the  eﬀect  of  the 
Reynolds  ﬂuxes  u�c�  on  the mean  tracer  concentration. 
In  order  to  determine  the  Reynolds  ﬂuxes,  we must  solve  the  equation  for  the  tracer 
� 
� 
ﬂuctuations, 
t  + u¯ · �c�  + � ·  u�c�  − u�c�  − κ�2 c�  = −u�  · �c.¯
c�
(13.9) 
Inspection  of  eq.  (13.9)  further  suggests  that  if  c�  =  0  at  t  =  0  then,  c�  and  �c¯ are 
linearly related at all times.  The equation for the tracer ﬂuctuations is linear in c�  for a 
prescribed velocity ﬁeld and it is forced by �c¯:  doubling the forcing doubles the tracer 
ﬂuctuations.  In  other  words  we  are  stating  that  tracer  ﬂuctuations  c�  are  generated 
by advective distortion of  the mean gradient, �c¯.  It  follows  that  the  eddy ﬂux u�c�  is 
linearly  related  to  the  mean  gradient  �c¯.  The  coeﬃcient  of  proportionality  between 
the  tracer  ﬂux  and  the  mean  tracer  gradient  turns  out  to  be  the  eddy  diﬀusivity 
introduced  in  the  previous  lecture.

13.2  Eddy  ﬂuxes  and  the  multi-scale  method 

Using  an  assumption  of  scale  separation  between  the  turbulent  eddies  and  the mean, 
we  will  show  how  the  concept  of  a  tracer  diﬀusivity  arises  in  a  Eluerian  context. 
The  scale  separation  approach  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  advected  tracer 
is weakly  inhomogeneous on a  scale L much greater  than  the  scale  l0  of  the  turbulent 
ﬂuctuations.  The  goal  is  then  to  derive  equations  for  the  evolution  of  the  coarse-
grained  averaged  tracer  on  the  length  scale  L,  and  on  a  time  scale  T  large  compared 
with  the  time  scale  t0  ∼  l0/u0 ,  characteristic  of  the  energy  containing  eddies  of  the 
turbulence.  We  may  then  choose  an  intermediate  scale  λ,  e.g.  λ  = (l0L)1/2 ,  and  an 
intermediate  time  τ ,  e.g.  τ  = (t0T )1/2 ,  satisfying, 
t0  � τ  � T , 
l0  � λ � L, 
and  think  of  the  overbar  average  as  a  “local  average”  over  a  cube  of  side  λ,  and  a 
time  of  order  τ .  Averaged  quantities  will  vary  only  on  larger  scales  of  order  L  and 
longer  times  of  order  T .  The  replacement  of  ensemble  and  volume/time  averages  is 
possible  only  if  the  turbulence  is  homogeneous  and  stationary  on  the  small  spatial 
and  temporal  scales,  so  that  an  ergodic  assumptions  can  be made. 

(13.10) 

The  multi-scale  method  that  we  use  here  was  ﬁrst  introduced  by  Papanicolaou  and 
Pirroneau  (1981).  The  scale  separation  assumption  suggests  that  a  perturbation 
expansion  can  be  done  in  terms  of  the  small  parameter  � ≡  l0/L.  Suppose  now  that 
c(x, 0)  is  slowly  varying  so  that, 

(13.11) 

c(x, 0) = C0 (�x). 
Eq.  (13.7),  together with  the  initial  condition  in  eq.  (13.11)  suggests  a multiple  scale 
analysis  with  the  slow  variables, 
X  = �x, X2  = �2 x,
T  = �t, T2  = �2 t. 
The  solution  of  eq.  (13.7)  then  takes  the  form, 
c(x, t; �) = C0 (X , T ) + � C1 (x, t; X , T ) + �2C2 (x, t; X , T ) + . . . . 
The  quantity  of  interest  is  the  large-scale,  long-time,  averaged  ﬁeld  ¯c = C0 (X , T ) + 
O(�).  Its  evolution  is  obtained  by  usual  asymptotic  methods.  Substituting  the  ex­
pansion  (13.13)  into  the  advection  diﬀusion  equation  (13.7),  one  obtains  a  series  of 
equations  order  by  order  in  �. 

(13.12) 

(13.13) 

The  advecting  velocity  ﬁeld  must  be  expanded  as  well.  We  will  assume  that  the 
velocity ﬁeld  is  composed of a mean ﬂow varying on  the  slow variables only U (X , T ) 
and  a  turbulent  perturbations  u� , 
u ≡ U (X , T ) + u� (x, t; X , T ). 
We do not assume that the mean ﬂow is of small amplitude compared to the turbulent 
ﬂow  as  it  is  often  done  in  the  literature  of  eddy mean  ﬂow  interactions

13.2.1  Zeroth  order  solution 

Let’s  write  the  series  of  equations  order  by  order  in  �.  At  ﬁst  order  we  have, 
C0t  + (U  + u� ) · �xC0  − κ�2 C0  = 0. 
x

O(�0) : 

(13.15) 

The  solution  to  this  equation,  satisfying  the  assumption  that  the  initial  tracer  con­
centration  is  smooth,  has  the  general  form, 
C0  = C0 (X , T , X2 , T2 ). 

(13.16) 

13.2.2  First  order  solution 

O(�) : 

2 C1  = −C0T  − (u�  + U ) · �X C0 . 
C1t  + (u�  + U ) · �xC1  − κ�x
(13.17) 

Averaging  over  the  small  and  fast  scales  scales,  we  have, 
C0T  + U  · �X C0  = 0, 

(13.18) 

from  which  it  follows  that, 
C1t  + (u�  + U ) · �xC1  − κ�x
2 C1  = −u�  · �X C0 . 
(13.19) 
Solutions  to  this  problem  can  be  written  in  the  form  C1  =  −(ξ  · �)C0  + C1 (X , T ), 
with  ξ(x, t)  satisfying  the  equation, 
ξt  + (U  + u� ) · �xξ − κ�x
2 ξ = u� . 
This equation resembles the equation  for a particle displacement,  except  for the pres­
ence  of  the molecular  diﬀusive  term.  This  diﬀerence  is  extremely  important,  because 
molecular diﬀusion is ultimately the only process that can mix the tracer.  Any theory 
of  diﬀusion  which  neglects  molecular  processes  must  be  taken  with  suspicion.  The 
terms  C1 (X , T )  represents  a  small  correction  to  the  initial  tracer  concentration.

By  taking  the  large  scale  and  long  time  average  of  this  equation,  we  obtain  the 
solvability  condition,

processes.  This  is  best  seen  if  we  write, 
κ�2 
X C0  + (u�  · �X ) ξ · �X C0  =  �X  ·  κ�X C0  + u�ξ · �X C0 
=  �X  · [D�X C0 ], 

(13.25) 
(13.26) 

where  the  tensor D , 

Dij  = κδij  + u�
iξj , 

(13.27) 

is  the  eﬀective  diﬀusivity  tensor. 

Summing  the  solvability  conditions  at  O(�)  and  O(�2 )  we  obtain  the  evolution  equa­
tion  for  the mean  tracer  concentration, 
c¯t  + u¯ · �c¯ = ∂xi [Dij ∂xj c¯]. 
(13.28) 
The  mean  tracer  concentration  is  given  by  c¯ =  C0  +  �C1  and  derivatives  include 
variations on  the  slow  space and  time of ﬁrst  seond order.  The eﬀective diﬀusivity D 
is  obtained  by  solving  eq.  (13.20)  and  computing  the  correlations  between  ξ  and  the 
velocity  ﬂuctuations  u� . 

13.2.4  Eddy  diﬀusivity 

The  main  result  of  the  multiple  scale  analysis  is  that  there  is  a  relationship  between 
the  eddy  ﬂux  u�c�  and  the mean  tracer  gradient �c¯, 
ic�  = −Dij ∂xj c.¯
u�
We  want  to  understand  what  is  the  meaning  of  this  diﬀusivity.  Let  us  decompose 
diﬀusivity  tensor  into  its  symmetric  and  antisymmetric  components, 

(13.29) 

D = Ds  + Da , 

where  the  symmetric  component  is,

The  ﬁrst  line  is  symmetric  and  represents  the  diﬀusive  component.  The  second  line 
is  asymmetric  and  is  the  skew  component.  Molecular  diﬀusion  contributes  a  positive 
deﬁnite  term  to  the  diﬀusive  component. 

13.2.5  Antisymmetric  component  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity 

The  role  of  the  antisymmetric  component  of  the  diﬀusivity  tensor  is  best  interpreted 
if  we  write Da  in  the  form, 
ij  = −�ij kΨk . 
Da 
(13.35) 
This  is  the  generic  form  of  an  antisymmetric  tensor  in  three  dimensions,  i.e.  any 
antisymmetric  tensor  can  be  written  in  the  form  (13.35).  The  tracer  ﬂux  associated 
to  the  antisymmetric  component  of  the  diﬀusivity  is  the  so  called  skew  ﬂux, 
u�c� a  = −Da ∂xj c¯ = �ij kΨk ∂xj c¯ = Ψ × �c.¯
ij 

(13.36) 

The  skew  ﬂux  can  also  be  written  as, 
� · u�c� = � × (Ψc¯) − (� × Ψ) · �c¯ = � × Ψc¯ + u¯ S  · �c,¯
a 

(13.37) 

where, 

u¯ S  = −� × Ψ. 
The  skew ﬂux  is  therefore equal  to the  sum of a  rotational ﬂux and an advective ﬂux. 
The  rotational  ﬂux  does  not  aﬀect  the  tracer  evolution,  since  it  has  no  divergence. 
The  advective  component  represent  the  transport  of  tracer  by  the  Stokes  drift  u¯ S .

Changes  in  tracer  variance  can  be  induced  by  the  terms  inside  the  divergence  or 
the  term  in  the  rhs.  The  terms  inside  the  divergence  depends  both  on  the  antisym­
metric  and  the  symmetric  components  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity.  The  term  on  the  rhs 
instead  depends  on  the  symmetric  component  only.  The  terms  inside  the  divergence 
represent  processes  that move  tracer  variance  around  the  ﬂuid  without  changing  the 
total  integral  of  the  tracer  variance.  The  rhs  term,  instead,  represent  a  net  source  of 
tracer variance.  hence only the symmetric component of the eddy diﬀusivity represent 
processes  that  enhance/reduce  tracer  ﬂuctuations.

The  molecular  processes  and  transience  terms  that  appear  in  the  symmetric  com­
ponent  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  tend  to  reduce  the  tracer  variance,  i.e.  they  tend  to 
homogenize  the mean  tracer  concentration.

An  alternative  approach  to  understand  the  eﬀect  of  the  eddy  diﬀusivity  on  the mean

13.2.8  Summary  about  eddy  diﬀusivity 

In  summary  then, 

•	 The  symmetric  part  of  the  diﬀusivity  tensor  corresponds  to  something  like  dif­
fusive  transport. 
•	 The  antisymmetric  part,  which  is  almost  never  zero,  and  it  is  in  fact  usually 
dominant  for  rotationally  dominated waves,  corresponds  to  an  advective  trans­
port.  As a result,  the mean advecting velocity that appears  in eq. (13.28)  is not 
u¯ ,  but  the  velocity u¯ + u¯ S .  This  seems  to  be  telling  us  that  the Eulerian mean 
velocity  u¯ is  not  the most  natural  choice  of  “mean”.
