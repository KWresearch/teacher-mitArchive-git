Problem  1 

The  problem  of  the  onset  of  turbulence  is  an  area  of  active  research.  In  class  we 
brieﬂy discussed the original model proposed by Landau and the more recent  ideas of 
Ruelle and Takens.  The textbooks by Landau and Lifshitz and Tritton have chapters 
on  the  two  theories.  The  article  ”Hydrodynamic  Instabilities  and  the  Transition  to 
Turbulence,”  published  by  H.L.  Swinney  and  J.P.  Gollub  in  Physics  Today  (August 
1978)  is  another  good  review  of  the  issue.  Read  this  material  (and  whatever  else 
you  might  ﬁnd  useful)  and  summarize  the  diﬀerences  between  Landau’s  explanation 
versus the modern view of the onset of turbulence,.  Discuss what  is the observational 
evidence which supports one or the other explanation.  Your answer should not exceed 
a  couple  of  pages. 

Problem  2 

Consider  the  cubic  map, 

xn+1  = r xn (3 − 4x 2 ). 
n
The  parameter  r  plays  the  role  of  a Reynolds  number  in  that  it  controls whether  the 
solutions  are  regular  or  erratic.  The  map  is  deﬁned  in  the  interval  x  ∈  [−1, 1]  and 
r ∈  [0, 1].

Part  1 

Write  a  MATLAB  program  to  draw  the  bifurcation  diagram  of  the  cubic  map  for 
r  ∈  [0, 1].  How  do  the  solutions  change  as  r  becomes  larger?  Is  there  a  transition 
to  a  “chaotic”  behavior?  Does  the  bifurcation  diagram  look  similar  to  the  one  of  the 
logistic map? 

Part  2 

Consider  the  cubic  map  with  r  =  1.  Select  a  set  of  diﬀerent  initial  conditions  x0 
and  plot  the  PDF  of  this  set,  i.e.  the  P (x0 ).  Now  integrate  the  map  for  this  set  of 
initial  conditions,  and  plot  the  PDF  after  n  iterations,  i.e.  the  P (xn ).  Repeat  this 
exercise  for  diﬀerent  values  of  r  in  the  range  [0, 1].  Do  the  PDFs  asymptote  some 
simple  distribution?  How  do  the  PDFs  change  as  a  function  of  r?

Problem  3 

Let  x  be  a  Gaussian  variable.  First  show  that  all  odd  moments  of  x  are  zero.  Then 
show  that all even moments are  related  to  the variance σ 2  = (x − x¯)2  and write what 
is  the  relationship.  In  particular  write  the  skewness  and  the  kurtosis  of  a  Gaussian 
variable. 

Problem  4 

The  logistic  map  presents  the  same  closure  problem  encountered  in  turbulence.  The 
equation for any moment of x depends on higher order moments and cannot be solved 
without additional information on these higher order moments.  Consider for example 
the  equation  for  the  ensemble  average  of  x, 
x¯n+1  = r x¯n  − rxn
2 , 
where  the  overbar  denotes  the  ensemble  average.  The  equation  for  the  ﬁrst moment, 
x¯,  depends  on  the  second  moment  x2 .  Derive  the  equation  for  the  second  moment 
and  shows  that  it  depends  on moments  higher  than  second. 

(2) 

Most methods of  closing  the hierarchy of moments make assumptions about  the  rela­
tionship of (n + 1)-th order moments to n-th order moments.  A typical approach is to 
assume that the statistics of x are Gaussian and use the results of problem 3 to relate 
all  moments  to  the  second.  Apply  this  method  to  close  the  equation  for  the  second 
moment.  With  this  assumption,  the  equation  for  the  ﬁrst  and  second  moment  form 
a  closed  set.  Use  MATLAB  to  iterate  the  two  equations  for  r  =  4.  What  happens? 
Can you explain why this approach  fails  [Hint:  you might want to go back to Lecture 
2  and  remind  yourself  of  what  is  the  stationary  distribution  for  the  logistic map]?
