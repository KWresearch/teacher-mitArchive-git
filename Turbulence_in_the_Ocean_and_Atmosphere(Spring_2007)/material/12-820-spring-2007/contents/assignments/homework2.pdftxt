1 .   Hele-Shaw  Cell  Convect ion  

The   Hele-Shaw  cell  has  a  t h i n   layer  of  fluid  confined  between  two  glass  or  plexiglass 
plates  a t   y = 0  and   y = 6 .   I t   allows  us  t o  s tudy  real  analogues  t o  2-D  flows. 
1) Assume  t h a t   u  and   w  have  t h e  characteristic  parabolic  profile  in   y 

and   t h a t   pressure  and   buoyancy  are   independent  of  y  and   v = 0.  Take  t h e   y  average  of 
t h e  scaled  equa t ione

v . u = e  

( b  being  t h e  deviation from 5 = z ) .  Show t h a t   the   averaged  momentum equa t ion  reduces 

when  6  is  very  small  ( t h i n  fluid  layer)  and   t h e  R.ayleigh number  is  big. 
2)  Define  t h e   streanlfunction  and   t h e   y-component  of  t h e   vorticity.  Eliminate  t h e  
pressure  and   write  coupled  equations  for  II, and   b.

free-slip  conditions  on  t o p  and   b o t t om ,  
4)   8ons ider   now  t h e   iloillinear  problem.  We  could  solve for  weakly  supercritical  con- 
ditions by  assuming t e Ru  - R a g  is  small and   expanding in  su i tab le  powers.  However,  it 
is  easier  t o  follow Loreilz  and   examine  a  tru i lca ted   systems.  Derive  t h e  equivalents  t o  t h e  
Loreilz equatioils  for  th is   system.  You  can use  t h e  same expansions  for  b  and   t h e  vorticity 
as  in  t h e   notes.  Show  t h a t   t h e   resulting  equations  have  a  simple  bifurcation  from  t h e

A  line  plume  is  driven by  a  s teady  buoyancy  flux per  un i t   length Go  (un i ts  of  m 3 s p 3 )  
on  a  line which  extends  infinitely  far  in  one  horizontal direction  y .   T h e  resu l tan t   plume  is 
therefore  2-dimensional,  w i th   no  variation  in  t h e   y-direction.  Entraiilment  in to  t h e  plume 
occurs  only  in  t h e   x-direction.  I11  th i s  problem,  we'll examine  t h e  derivation of  t h e  plume 
equations  and   t h e  solutions.

impermeable surface,  then  we  would  have

2)  How  consider  t h e   flux  of  buoyancy,  in tegra t ing   from  O  te  T +   where  t h e   outside 
buoyancy  value  is  b,. Assume  you  can   replace  t h e   average  of  wb w i th   W  times  B ;  t h e  
average  of  b.

4)   Now  look  for  similarity solutions:  assume  W  - z n ,  r  - zm  and   find  t h e   solutions

5)  Suppose you can assess t h e  effects of  ro ta t ion  by finding t h e  height  zf  beyond which 
t h e  plume  R.ossby numbee Ro  = W / ( f r )   is less  t h a n  1 using  t h e  similarity solutions above.
