Problem  1.  Tracer  spectra. 

Glenn  showed  that  the  eddy  kinetic  energy  spectrum  for  homogeneous  isotropic  tur­
bulence in two dimensions has diﬀerent slopes in the direct and inverse cascade ranges. 
Can you derive the spectral slopes for a passive tracer advected by the two dimensional 
turbulent ﬂow?  Assume  that you are  in  the  inertial-convective  regime  (i.e.  molecular 
friction  and  diﬀusion  do  not  matter),  but  discuss  separately  the  tracer  spectrum  for 
the  direct  and  inverse  cascade  regimes.  Tennekes  and  Lumley’s  book  and  Vallis’  one 
are  good  references  for  this  problem. 

Problem  2.  Rotational  constraints  on  3D  turbulence. 

Over most of the ocean N/f  > 1, so that turbulence is more likely to be inﬂuenced by 
stratiﬁcation  than by  rotation.  However,  in  regions where N  ≈ 0,  such as  the  surface 
mixed  layer,  rotation may  constrain  unstratiﬁed  turbulence.  Assuming  that  rotation 
constrains the turbulent motions when the Rossby number U /f L < 1, where U  is the 
velocity  scale,  and  L  the  length  scale,  ﬁnd  the  length  scale  �  above  which  rotation 
aﬀects  the  turbulence.  Assume  for  L < �  the  turbulent  motions  are  in  the  inertial 
range  of  the  Kolmogorov  spectrum. 

Problem  3.  Transformed  Eulerian  Mean. 

This  problem  shows  how  eddies  can  drive  a  mean  advection  with  skew  eddy  ﬂuxes. 
Let  us  consider  small-amplitude  (linear),  quasi-geostrophic,  Rossby  waves  in  a  β ­
channel  0  < y < L,  semi-inﬁnite  in  the  vertical,  forced  by  a  zonal  mean  ﬂow  over 
small  amplitude  topography  h� (x, y)  centered  on  z  = 0.  The  bottom  boundary  is  an 
impermeable  surface  at  z = h� (x, y), 

h� (x, y) = H0 cos(kx) sin(ly), 
where l = πy/L.  The basic state of the ﬂuid is Boussinesq, with uniform stratiﬁcation 
N 2  and  a  spatially  uniform  westerly  ﬂow  U ;  there  is  no  dissipation.

Rossby  waves.
