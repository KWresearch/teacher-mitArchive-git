1.  Your  colleague  is  using   the  following  viscoelastic   model  to  predict  a  material’s  behavior: 
two Kelvin-Voigt  models  in   series  with  each  other  and  with a  single  spring.   What  is  the 
eﬀective  stiﬀness  of  this  arrangement   at  short   time  scales  /  high  strain  rates?  At  long   time 
scales  / low  strain  rates? 
SOLUTION:  At   high  strain  rates,   dashpots  act  like  rigid  connections,  and  springs   act  like 
springs.  At   early  times  and   high  strain  rates,   the  eﬀective  stiﬀness  is   therefore  that  of  the 
sole  spring;   the  two  K-V  elements  are  eﬀectively  rigid  and  do  not  displace. 
Conversely,  at  long  times  and   low  strain  rates,   dashpots  act  as  though  they  are  not  even 
connected,  so  the  eﬀective  stiﬀness   is   that  of  three  springs   in  series. 

2.  Find  the  maximum  diﬀerence  (x%)in  magnitude  between  the  stress  state  that  will   produce 
plastic failure   (yielding) of a  metal  according to the Tresca  criterion or to the von  Mises 
criterion.  This  is  the  location  on   the  yield  surface  where  the  two  surfaces  are  furthest  apart. 
SOLUTION:  The  maximum  diﬀerence  between  these  two  cases   occurs   for  pure  shear.  On 
the  yield   surface  diagram,  this  is   the  diagonal  line  that  bisects   quadrants  2  and  4.  If   we 
insert  this  stress  state  into  the  two  criteria,  we  obtain  diﬀerent  magnitudes  of  the  shear  stress  
magnitude   σ13  that  will  be  suﬃcient to  cause failure by  yielding. 
√
Tresca  says: σ13  = σy/2;   von   Mises  says:   σ13  = σy/ 
3. 
Thus,  the  magnitudes  diﬀer  by   ≈13%,  with  Tresca  being  the  more  conservative  criterion 
(i.e., lower  stress  required to   meet the  condition for failure by  yielding). 

3.  Consider  a  material  that  is  about  to  experience  uniaxial  loading  of  a  magnitude  suﬃcient  to 
make  the  material yield.  Could  you  prevent  the  material  from  yielding by  applying  loads  on  
other  axes?  How?  Why does  this  work? 
SOLUTION:  See  John   Maloney’s 
/Resources   for  a  nice  discussion  of 
available on MIT Server 
Tresca  related  to   this  point.  Recall  that  the  yield  criteria  we  covered  relate  the  diﬀerence 
between  maximum and   minimum  normal  principal  stresses (Tresca) or the diﬀerence  among 
all  three  principal  stresses  (von   Mises)  to  the  magnitude  of  the  yield  stress.  Intuition  may 
tell you that adding   more   stress to a  material will surely bring on failure, but if that  stress  
decreases  the  diﬀerence  between two  principal  stresses, it  can  actually prevent failure. 

4.  The  stiﬀness  matrix  component   C45  is   shorthand  for  C2313  in  the  full  stiﬀness  tensor.  How­
ever, the  compliance  matrix  component S 45  equals   not  S 2313 but 4S 2313 .  Show why by writing 
out  �4  (using  �i  = S i jσ j ) and   its  equivalent 2�23  (using  �i j  = S i jklσkl ). 
Explain  why this  doesn’t happen  with  the  stiﬀness  matrix.  
SOLUTION: By  expanding  the  indicial  notation, 

ε4  = S 41σ1  + S 42σ2  + S 43σ3  + S 44σ4  + S 45σ5  + S 46σ6 

1 

Its  equivalent, 2ε23 ,  is  expanded  as 

2ε23  = 2(S 2311σ11+S 2312σ12+S 2313σ13+S 2321σ21+S 2322σ22+S 2323σ23+S 2331σ31+S 2332σ32+S 2333σ33 ) 

Using  the fact that  σi j  = σ ji , we note  that  the  coeﬃcients   of  the  equivalent  stress  components

σ5  and  σ13  are  S 45  and 4S 2313 ,  respectively.  These  coeﬃcients   must  also  be  equivalent. 

In  general,  S ab  = S i jkl  for  a and   b both  equal  to  1,  2,  or  3;  S ab  = 4S i jlk  for  a and  b both  equal

to 4, 5,  and 6;   and   S ab  = 2S i jkl  for  all  other  cases (S 14 ,  for  example).  In  contrast, Cab  always

equals  C i jkl ,  which  can  be  seen  by  expanding  σa  = Cabεb  and  σi j  = C i jklεkl .

As  noted in   Monday’s review  session, the 4 in the 4S 2313  comes   from  two factors  of  2:  The

ﬁrst is  from the fact  that  ε4  = 2ε23 , due to the factor of two  relationship  between  engineering 

shear  strain  ε4  and   tensorial  shear  strain  ε23 .  The  second factor  of 2  is   from  the fact  that

S 2313  =  S 2331 , a fact you proved in PS5 using the four  Kronecker  deltas for  C i jkl ,  and  you

already  know  that  σ13  = σ31  from  equilibrium.  So  when  we  write  out  ε23  = S 23klσkl ,  we  get

S 2313σ13  + S 2331σ31  = 2S 2313σ13 .


5.  Which  of  the  following  are  easy  slip  plane  / slip  direction  combinations   for a  copper  crystal? 

(a)  (111),  [110] 
(b)  (11-1),  [00-1] 
(c)  (101),  [11-1] 
(d)  (100),  [0-11] 

SOLUTION: None  of  them.  Remember  that  a  slip  system  is   a  slip  plane  and  a  direction  on 

that  plane.  Typically,  the  primary  slip  system  is   the  close-packed  plane  and  a  close-packed

direction  on   that  plane.  For  Cu  (fcc),   this  will   be  the  {111} �110� system.   However,  speciﬁc

directions  must  be  ON   speciﬁc  planes,  which  means   that  the  dot  product  of  the  slip  plane

normal  (which   is  oriented   90o  to   the  slip  plane)  and  the  slip  direction  must  be  zero  (cos(90o )

= 0).

For  a  cubic  system,  it   turns  out  that  the  slip  plane  normal  has  the  same  indices  as  the  slip 

plane  itself  (here,  the  slip   plane  normal  is   �111�).  However,  the  dot  product  of  some  of   the

above  combinations is  not  zero. For example,  the  ﬁrst   one would  be:

2)  = 2/ 

[111]dot[110]  = (1  + 1 + 0)/(

(1)

Same  deal   for  the  second   combination.   The  last  two  are  also  not  the  easy  slip  systems

because,  although  the  dot  product  is   zero,   these  are  not  the  close-packed  planes   of  fcc.


6.  What is  the  relationship  (both direction  and  magnitude)  between  b and  a for  an  fcc  crystal? 
A bcc  crystal? 
SOLUTION: For an fcc  crystal, we covered this in lecture on  10.30.06.   Looking at the (100) 

plane  and   assuming  r  is  the  atomic  radius   of  a  hard-sphere  model  of  the  fcc  crystal,  we  see

that

2r. We  know  that  b is the vector that  deﬁnes unit slip in the  close-packed  direction, 
or  a = 2
a  �110� =  a .√
so  b =  2

For  a  bcc  crystal,  we  know  the  atoms  touch  along  the �111� or  body-diagonal  direction,  so  
√
a  �111� =

here  a =  4r and   b =  2

7. Your  chemist  friend is  puzzled by a  question of  crystal  symmetry:  “A cubic  material  has  the 
same  stiﬀness  in   all   three  axes  1,  2,  and  3,  and  an  isotropic  material  has  the  same  stiﬀness in 
all  three  axes  1,  2,  and   3.  So  what’s  the  diﬀerence?”  How  would  you  answer? 
SOLUTION: One  answer  would  be: 
“You’re  right   that  the  properties  measured  along  three  diﬀerent  axes  may  be  numerically 
equal  if  the  material  is  cubic  or  isotropic.  However,  that  would  be  a  special  case  in  a  cubic 
material, such that if I rotated the  material and took  measurements along a diﬀerent  three  (yet 
still  orthogonal)  axes,  the  value  in  the  second  experiment  need  not  equal  the  value  obtained 
in  the  ﬁrst. 
In  general,  an  isotropic  material  is   an  idealized  case  where  the  properties  are  independent 
of the direction in   which they  were  measured, so it would not  matter how I rotated a  repre­
sentative volume  element of  that  material  – I would ALWAYS  measure the  same value of a 
given  property. A cubic  material  has a  structure  and  properties  that  are  deﬁned by  the  orien­
If  the  1,  2,  and 3 directions  of  my  measurement  are  equal  to  the  �100� 
tation  of  the  atoms. 
vectors  deﬁning  that  unit  cell,  all  the  properties  measured  will   be  independent  of  direction. 
However,  those  that I measured  along a  rotated  set of  orthogonal vectors  (e.g.,  �110�) would 
not  necessarily be equal to the values I measured along the  �100�. 
So  you  see,  my  chemist  friend,  the  properties  of  the  cubic  material  are  deﬁned  by  the  struc­
ture  of  the  material  (the  arrangement   of  the  atoms  in  the  unit   cell).  The  properties  of   the 
isotropic  material  are  assumed  independent  of  the  arrangement   of  the  atoms.”
