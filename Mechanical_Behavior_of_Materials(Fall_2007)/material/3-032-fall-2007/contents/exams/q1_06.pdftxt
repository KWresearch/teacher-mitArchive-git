DO NOT TURN THIS PAGE OVER AND START THE QUIZ UNTIL YOU 

ARE ASKED TO DO SO.


Guidelines: 

1.  Show  all  your  work  on  the  sheets  included   in  this  stapled  document. 

2.  Use  partial  credit  to  your  advantage.	 If  you’re  running  short  on  time,  solve  algebraically  and  then 
solve  numerically  (plugging  in  numbers)  later. 

3.  If  there  is  not  much  space   given  for  you  to  provide  an  answer,  we  want  you  to   be  brief. 

4.  You   may  not  need  to  use  all  the  information  given  (e.g.,  dimensions)  to   reach  your  conclusions. 

5.  Enjoy your  dark  chocolate  before  getting  started!  It  lowers  blood  pressure (JAMA,  2003),  contains 
antioxidants (Nature,  2003),   and   supposedly  helps  neural  synapses  responsible  for  memory  to  ﬁre 
faster (Nature  Health,  2003).

1.  Harvard  University  is  currently  using  several   large  cranes  to   complete  construction  along  the  Charles 
River.  Below  is  a  schematic  of  one   such  crane,  with  dimensions  and  the  position  of  a  counterweight 
indicated.  

Figure  1:  Schematic   of  crane  used  to  complete  construction  along  the  Charles,  indicated  with  the  horizontal 
element of the  crane (a trussed beam)  parallel to the  ground. (a)  Entire  crane; (b)  Hook-end of the  horizontal 
element.

(a)  Draw a free body diagram of the  horizontal   element of the  crane (the   horizontal span in Fig. 1a), 
treating   it  as  a  beam  and   indicating  all  known  and  unknown  applied   / reaction  forces.  You  will  
need  to  make  assumptions  about   how  the  crane  is  connected  to   the  real   world,  and  these  should 
be  brieﬂy  justiﬁed. 

(b) If this  counterweight exerts a force of 1 MN, what is the  magnitude of the vertical force due to 
the  vertical  support  Pv  such  that  the  horizontal  element  remains  stationary  and  parallel  to  the 
ground   (as  pictured)? 

(c) Now assume that a steel I-beam that weighs 5 kN is lifted by the  crane at the hook, and should be 
held   such  that  the  horizontal  element  remains  stationary  and  parallel   to   the  ground  (as  pictured). 
The  critical  counterweight  and  the  force  Pv  will  change.  What   is  the  required  magnitude  of  the 
new  counterweight?

(d)  Consider  the  hook-end  of  the  crane’s  horizontal   element  (Fig.  1b),  now  loaded  by  the  weight  of 
the  steel  I-beam.   Can  member AC be  made  from a  thin  steel  cable  (essentially  an  elastic  rope)? 
Here,  you’re  considering  the  elements  of  the  truss  explicitly,  so  their  weight  as  a  whole  beam 
structure  (i.e.,  q) can  be  neglected.  Explain  your  answer  fully. 

2.  We  know  σi j  and   �i j  can be expressed as  quadrics.  Explain  concisely, but fully and  accurately, what 
this fact  immediately  implies  about  tensorial  stress  and  strain.

3.  Tractor-trailers  are  used  to  transport   liquid  propane   in   cylindrical  tankers  made  of  stainless  steel, 
precisely  because  the  trailer  must  act   as  a  pressure  vessel  as  the  contents  change  temperature  (and 
thus  internal  pressure  levels)  over  the  course  of  the  trip,  and  so  that  accidental  combustion  could  be 
relatively  safely  contained.  

(a)  Draw  a  two-dimensional  (side   view)  free  body  diagram  of  the  tanker  (the  part  pulled   by  the  cab 
where  the  driver  sits),  indicating  supports  and  corresponding  reaction  forces  as  well  as  applied 
forces. 

(b)  Idealizing  the  tanker  as  a   thin-walled  pressure   vessel,  how  much  internal  pressure   Pi  can  the 
tanker  handle  without   catastrophic failure?  Stainless  steel fails at a  normal  stress   (only) of 200 
MPa, and at a  shear  stress  (only) of 100 MPa. You   can neglect the  pressure diﬀerential  with  the 
atmosphere,  such  that   Pi  = ΔPi .

(c)  For  this  ultimate  loading  state  (i.e.,  using  the  value  of  Pi  obtained   above),  express  the  tanker 
wall  stress  state  numerically  in  tensor/matrix  notation:  σi j  =  [matrix  of  all  zero  and  nonzero 
stresses].  Clearly  indicate  your  assumed   orthogonal  axes  with  respect   to   the  dimensions  of  the 
tanker. 

(d) You would like to  measure this stress state using strain gages, but the tanker company will not let 
you place the strain gages anywhere except on the  letters of “PROPANE”. As shown, these gages 
are  the  width  of  the  painted  letters,  so  you’re  forced  to  align  them  with  the  letter  orientation. 
What  is  the  stress  tensor  σi j  that you expect to  measure at the  position of  strain gage 1 when the 
tanker  is  pressurized  to  its  maximum  value  Pi ?  Give  the  full   matrix,  and  solve  this  using  any of 
the  three   approaches  discussed  in   class.

(e)  Brieﬂy  (but  accurately)  describe  how  you  would  use  the  other  two  methods  you  could  have 
chosen  to  transform   this  stress  tensor. 

(f)  Let  us  assume  that   you   could  align  the  strain gage  along  the  longitudinal  axis of  the  tanker,  and 
that  this  strain gage is a  single  strip of Cu of  initial   length  Lo  =  1  cm  with a gage factor of 1 
(Δresistance  = � ).  The  strain  in  that  Cu  strip  will  be  equal   to   the  longitudinal  strain � of  the  steel, 
which is  �  = 0.4σlongitudinal /E . 
What is the expected change in length of the Cu strip that you expect to  occur under this  principal 
stress  σlongitudinal  = σ2  due   to  this  pressure  Pi ? You  can  assume  engineering  strain,  and  that   the 
elastic  moduli  E of  Cu  and   steel  are  110  GPa  and  210  GPa,  respectively.
