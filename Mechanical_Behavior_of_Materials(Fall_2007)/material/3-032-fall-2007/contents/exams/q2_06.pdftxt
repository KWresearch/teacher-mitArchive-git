3.032 Quiz 2

Fall 2006

DO NOT TURN THIS PAGE OVER AND START THE QUIZ UNTIL YOU 

ARE ASKED TO DO SO.


Guidelines: 

1.  Show  all  your  work  on  the  sheets  included   in  this  stapled  document. 

2.  Use  partial  credit  to  your  advantage.	 If  you’re  running  short  on  time,  solve  algebraically  and  then 
solve  numerically  (plugging  in  numbers)  later. 

3.  If  there  is  not  much  space   given  for  you  to  provide  an  answer,  we  want  you  to   be  brief. 

4.  You   may  not  need  to  use  all  the  information  given  (e.g.,  dimensions)  to   reach  your  conclusions. 

5.  Enjoy your  dark  chocolate  before  getting  started!  It  lowers  blood  pressure (JAMA,  2003),  contains 
antioxidants (Nature,  2003),   and   supposedly  helps  neural  synapses  responsible  for  memory  to  ﬁre 
faster (Nature Health,   2003).  

NAME   (PRINTED): 

I agree  that  this  document  represents  my  own  independent  work  on  this  quiz,  using   only  my  own  brain,  my 
allowed   crib  sheet  of  equations  and   notes,  and  my  pen  / pencil  / calculator  / protractor  / compass  / ruler  / 
sliderule.

1.  You   and   your  labmate  have  been  given  a  joint  project  by  your  UROP  advisor.  He  has  asked  you  both 
to  measure  all  the  elements  of  the  stiﬀness  tensor  C i jkl  of  two  new  proteins  he  has  crystallized  and  is 
considering  for  use  in  a  ﬂexible,  organic  integrated  circuit   that  must  withstand  mechanical   bending. 
Another  student  has  already  used  x-ray  diﬀraction  to   determine  the  crystal  structure  of  the  proteins: 
protein A  exhibits a  tetragonal  unit  cell,  whereas  protein B  exhibits  an  orthorhombic  unit  cell. Your 
labmate  says,  “Let’s  each  measure   the  elastic  constants  C i jkl  of  one  protein.  Which  one  do  you  want 
to  do, A or  B?” 

Figure 1: (a) Tetragonal; (b)  Orthorhombic  unit  cells. 

Under  the  assumption  that   you’d like  to  spend  as  little   time  as  possible  on  this  project,  what  is  your 
answer?   Explain  concisely, but  as  fully  and  accurately  as  possible,  using  the  concepts  discussed  in 
3.032. 

2.  Poly(dimethylsiloxane)  or  PDMS  is  a  crosslinked  elastomer  that  is  commonly  used  to  build  opti­
cal/electronic/biomedical  devices  via  soft  lithography (borrowing  from  microelectronics  processing 
approaches  to  make  ﬂexible,  patterned  surfaces).  The   glass  transition  temperature  of  pure  PDMS   is 
-120oC,  and   crosslinking  can  be  induced  by  exposure  to   UV  light. 
At  molecular  weights  on  the  order  of  106  g/mol  or  degree  of  polymerization  (DP)  ≈  60,  PDMS   is 
said to exhibit a  viscoelastic   response  with Young’s  elastic  modulus  E  reported to be  about 2 MPa for 
short  times  /  high  strain  rates.  At very low  molecular  weights (∼102 g/mol)  or  DP,  PDMS   acts  as  a 
Newtonian  ﬂuid. 

(a)  Brieﬂy  discuss why it is  confusing  that  PDMS is  widely described as a  rubber  elastic  polymer, 
but  is  also  widely  reported  to  exhibit  measurable  elastic  moduli E .

(b)  Propose an experiment you would try to   assess  whether PDMS is best  described as a hyperelastic 
or  a  linear  viscoelastic  material. 

3.  A jewelery  maker  has  created  a  die  that  she  is  using  to   form  a  new  cuﬄink  made  of  stainless  steel. 
From  matweb.com,  she  knows  that  the  yield  strength  of  this  particular  stainless  steel  (AISI  304)  σy  is 
about  200   MPa,  the  elastic  modulus  E  is  about  200  GPa,  and  the  Poisson’s  ratio  ν is  about   0.33.  She 
needs to know how much  stress to apply to the metal slab to reduce the  thickness to 3 mm, the cuﬄink 
thickness.  
The die is a simple  channel that does not   constrain the metal in the  x-direction, and the  channel is well 
lubricated  so  that  all  frictional   forces  and  stresses  along  the  channel  walls  can  be  ignored. 

Figure 2: Die in which  stainless steel slab of  initial   thickness 6  mm will be  subjected to a  normal  stress  σzz . 

(a)  State  all  the  components  of  the  stress  tensor  σi j  that  exist   in   the  stainless  steel  slab  under  that  
applied  stress.  Be  sure   to  note   components  that  are  identically  zero. 

(b)  Which  normal  strain  components  εii  are  zero,  and  why?

(c)  Treating  the  stainless  steel  as  an  isotropic  continuum,  use  your  answers  in   (a)  and  (b)  to  express 
the  nonzero  stresses  in  terms  of  elastic  constants  and  σ.  Assume  the  applied   stress  in  the  z-
direction  σzz  = σ,  some  constant  value. 

(d)  What  is  the  magnitude  (value   in  [Pa])  of  the  stress  required  to   permanently  deform  the  stainless 
steel  according to the Tresca  criterion of  yielding? 

(e)  What  is  the  magnitude   (value   in  [Pa])  of  the  stress  required  to   permanently  deform  the  stainless 
steel  according   to  the  von  Mises  criterion  of  yielding? 

(f)  If  you  were   her,  which  criterion  would  you  use  to   make  your  decision  about  how  much  stress  to 
apply,  and   why?

(g)  She  has  tacitly  assumed  that  the  yield  criterion  that  tells  her  the  stress  required  to  initiate  plastic 
deformation  is  the  same  stress  she’ll   need  to   compress  the  stainless  steel  to  the  desired  thickness 
of 3  mm. 
Draw  a  uniaxial  stress-strain   response   that  shows  how  she  thinks  stainless  steel  deforms  both 
before  and   after  yielding,  as  quantitatively  and  as  accurately  as  possible. 

(h)  Her  available  instruments  are  not  capable  of  applying  the  required  stress  σ  that  you  computed 
above.  Describe  one   way  you  would  modify  the  material  or  the  process  in   order  to   reduce 
the  stress  σ  required  to  initiate  plastic  deformation,  and  why  that  mechanism  is  likely  to  be 
successful.
