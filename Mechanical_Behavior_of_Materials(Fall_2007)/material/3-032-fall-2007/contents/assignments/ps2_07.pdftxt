1. In the beam considered in PS1, a steel beams carried the distributed weight of the rooms 
above.  To reduce stress on the beam, it is common to add extra support to these long beams at 
the point of internal maximum bending moment. Where should this support be located, and what 
are the shear forces and bending moments at this location? 
 
To answer this, construct the shear force V(x) and internal bending moment M(x) diagrams 
along the entire beam length, and note the magnitude of each at every point in the beam where 
the loading situation changes, as well as at the point of maximum M.

2. At a seminar at MIT last week, Prof. Ilya Zharov (Univ. of Utah, Department of Chemistry) 
showed that his group could create self-assembled colloidal films, which are basically a few 
planes of close-packed silica (SiO2) spheres with nanoscale pores between them (Fig. 2A). He 
proposed these as a potential new material for fuel cell proton-exchange membranes (PEMs), 
because he can coat the nanoscale pores between the silica spheres with sulfonated molecules 
that selectively allow proton exchange through the nanopores.

This sounds exciting, but someone quickly pointed out this is basically 
a very thin, porous sheet of glass: as a free-standing film, it might fail 
mechanically under its own weight or under the loads due to proton 
flux. Prof. Zharov said he had no idea how strong these colloidal films 
were, but thought engineers would figure it out for him. He thought 
that laying strips of the films onto a metal grid (like a window screen) 
would keep the stresses low enough by supporting the film at several 
points along its length.  
 
Let us see if he is correct in this guess, treating a strip of the film as a 
beam and assuming it deforms elastically up to the point of fracture. 

 
(a) We will first test the force required to break these films, using two different loading 
configurations: three-point bending and uniaxial tension (Fig. 2b). In both tests, we use 
identical samples which are 100 μm in length and have rectangular cross-sections of 20 μm 
width and 2 μm thickness.  Draw the expected tensile stress along the beam length σ(x) in 
each case. Assume all stresses remain within the elastic regime.  (It may be useful to 
construct shear and bending moment diagrams.)

 (b)  We measure that these test samples catastrophically fail (i.e., transition from elastic 
deformation to fracture, without any prior plastic deformation or yielding) at an average 
load of 75.0 μN for the 3-pt. bend tests and at a load of 3.4 mN for the tensile tests.  
Determine the stress at which the colloidal films failed in both cases; this is called the 
flexural strength and tensile strength, respectively.  

 
(c)  In this case, the colloidal film is brittle: when the film fails, it fails at the nanopore defects as 
the spheres break free from one another. The mechanical strength of brittle materials 
depends strongly on the existence and density of defects in highly stressed regions of the 
material. Considering the stress distributions determined in (a), explain any differences in 
the flexural and tensile strength properties of the colloidal films calculated in (b).   

 
(d)  For this new proton-exchange membrane application, Zharov wants to “simply support” 
these beams of colloidal film by laying them on a copper transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) grid. the standard grid holes are 3 mm x 3 mm.  He estimates the distributed load on 
the colloidal film due to proton flux to be 10 mN/mm. Considering this new loading 
condition and the flexural/tensile strengths we determined experimentally, will the colloidal 
film fail under this application? If so, how would you redesign the film and/or support to 
enable this fuel cell application? 

 
 
3. Solid polymer pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) are used for electronic component-to-heat 
sink attach to minimize interfacial thermal resistance, typically comprising polyacrylates filled 
with conductive ceramic particles  These thermally conductive adhesives are applied between the 
interfaces of the electronic component and the heat sink (Fig. 4).  The polymer becomes highly 
adhesive under elastic deformation, due to application of this uniform pressure between the 
electronic component and heat sink.  

 
Let us treat this PSA tape as an 
elastic continuum of Poisson’s 
ratio ν = 0.45.  A press applies 
1000 N to the electronic package to 
compress the adhesive tape (Figure 
5).  The initial gap distance 
between the package and the heat 
sink is 0.35 mm.

(a)  If the electronic package is 100 mm wide x 20 mm deep (into page), what is the applied  
 
stress?  
 
(b)  Derive the relationship between true strain and engineering strain:  εt = ln (εe+1).  Is there  
a significant difference in these strain values for the normal strain resulting from 
compression of the PSA from a thickness of 0.35 mm to 0.15 mm? 
 
 
(c)  To fit this PSA-joined device into the larger circuit, a final joint thickness of 0.15 mm is 
required (Figure 5).  To ensure a reliable joint, the polymeric adhesive must deform laterally 
under the applied pressure to completely fill the joint (a change in length equal to 2x in Fig. 
5).  Given these two requirements, what is the minimum initial length of PSA tape that we 
need to ensure complete interfacial contact between the adhesive and electronic package 
after pressing? Use engineering strain calculations and idealize the PSA tape as an elastic 
continuum.   

 
 
 
4. Strain gages are designed only to measure normal (tensile or compressive) strains, but the 
engineering state of strain of the material plane is defined by εxx, εyy and γxy. Strain gage rosettes 
as you used in Lab 1 are one solution to this problem, because γxy can be calculated from 
experimentally measured εxx, εyy and ε(45o).  Considering the axes transformation equations of 
strain, determine this relation.
