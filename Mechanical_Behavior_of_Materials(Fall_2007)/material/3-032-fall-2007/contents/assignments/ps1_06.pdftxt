1.  Thin-ﬁlm  silicon   nitride   cantilevers  such  as  the  one  shown  in  Figure 1  are  used  in 
scanning  probe  microscopy,  resonant  frequency measurements,   and  electrostatic  ac­
tuation.  Let  us  approximate   this  cantilever  as  a  clamped-free  beam  with  a  length  of 
200  µm,  a  width   of  30  µm,  and  a  thickness   of  0.8  µm.  Take  the Young’s  modulus  
to be 210 GN/m2 . The weight of the cantilever   can  be 
of  thin-ﬁlm  silicon  nitride
neglected.

(a)  If  the  free  end  of  the  beam  contacts  a   surface  (represented  by  a  point  load  in  
Figure  1),  and  is  deﬂected  upwards  by  1.0  µm,  ﬁnd  the   magnitude  of  the  point 
load. 
(b)  Draw  a  free-body  diagram  of   the   beam.  Sketch  the  shear  and  bending  moment 
in   the  beam  along  its  length,  labeling  maximum  and  minimum  values.  Use   the 
following  sign   convention  for  positive  shear  and  bending  moment  [Beer  and  
Johnson,  Mechanics of Materials (1992)]:

(c) In your scanning probe experiments, you need to be able to 
measure point loads
that  are  only   one-tenth  of  the   value  you  calculated   above.  Assuming  that  a 
deﬂection  of 1  µm  produces  a  suitable   signal   for   detection,   how  much  longer 
does  the  cantilever  need  to  be?  

2.  You  are  assembling   a  structure  in  a  heavy  wind,   which  acts  as  a  distributed  load   q 
(force per length) on one of the wide  boards you are  erecting (Figure 2). Your  friend

(weight   150  lb)  can  just  barely  keep  the  board  upright  by  hanging  from  a  ﬂexible 
cord  connected to the  board.  The  board is   connected to the  ground by a pin  joint, and  
the  mass of  the  board is 30 kg/m.  Ignore  the  eﬀect  of  the  wind  on  your  friend. 

Figure  2:   Upright  board  subject  to  a  distributed  load  and  a  point  load.  

(a)  Draw a free-body   diagram of the  board and ﬁnd the wind load  q and  the  reaction  
forces  at  the  pin  joint. 
(b)  Sketch   the  shear  and   bending  moment  in  the  board. 

3.  The  Harvard  Bridge  on   Mass.  Ave.  (Figure  3(a,b))  was  rebuilt  in  the  late  1980s  due 
to  the fact  that  the  pin-and-hanger  assemblies of  the expansion  joints  on  the bridge 
were  the  same  as  those  of  the  Mianus   River  Bridge  in  Connecticut.  The  Mianus   River 
Bridge   collapsed in   1983  when a  single pin  became overloaded  and  caused  the  death  
of three people and   serious injury of three  others. Your task is to ﬁnd the  normal and 
shear  forces and   moment  associated with that failure,  which  occurred at the position 
marked  x,  the  midspan   between  pins C and D (Figure  3(c)). 

(a)  Draw  a  free  body  diagram  of  the  entire  pin-and-hanger  assembly.  The  weight 
of  the  assembly  can  be  neglected. 
(b)  Determine  the  reaction   forces  about  joint  B. 
(c)  Determine  the  forces  along  and  normal  to  the  horizontal  beam,   and  the  moment 
at  the  point of failure in  the  steel  beam.  

4.  Nanowires  of  amorphous  silica  (SiO2 ) (Figure  4)  are  considered  as  possible  optical 
waveguides  in   miniaturized  electronics.  For  handling  and  assembly  purposes,   it  is 
necessary  to   know  and   be  able  to  measure  the  critical  buckling  load  Pcr  of  such 
nanowires.

al.,  Nature 426:  816  (2003)].  (b)  Critical buckling  load  can  be  measured  via  compression  
with  instruments   such   as  atomic   force   microscopes. 

(a)  For  the  above  nanowire   of  400  nm   diameter  and  1 mm  length,   determine  the 
critical buckling  load.  Assume   the value of  the Young’s  modulus  E  for bulk 
silica,  which is 70 GN/m2 . 
(b)  Using  the  cantilever  in  Problem  1,  what  is  the  deﬂection  of  that  cantilever  that 
you  would  need   to   achieve  to  impose   this  elastic  instability?
