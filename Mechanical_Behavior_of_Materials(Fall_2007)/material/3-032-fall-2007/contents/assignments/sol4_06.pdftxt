1.  Strain can be coupled not only to  stress but also to  thermal expansion or  contraction (this 
+ν σi j  −
is  known   as  thermoelastic  coupling).  The  general  constitutive  equation  is   εi j  =  1
E 
ν σkk δi j  +  αΔT δi j ,  where  α  is  the  material’s  thermal   expansion  coeﬃcient  and  ΔT  is  the 
E
change in   temperature. For  metals,   α is   on  the  order  of  10 ppm/◦C. 

Figure  1:   Bar  of  original   length  L in  contact   with  two  rigid  walls. 

(a)  Consider  the  case  of  a  long  rod  of  length  L  that  is   in  contact   with  two  rigid  walls 
and   subject  to   a  temperature  increase  ΔT  (Figure  1).   We  are  interested  in  the  lateral 
strains—that is, the  strains in the 2 and 3  directions.  (Assumption: the walls do not 
limit   strain  in   these  directions.) 
Is  the  2-3  plane  in  a  state  of  plane  stress   or  plane 
strain? Derive  the  value  of ε22  = ε33  as  a  function  of  α,  ΔT ,  and  the  elastic  constants. 

SOLUTION:  Because  ε11  = 0,  the  2-3  plane  is   in  a  state  of  plane  strain. We  can  write 
1 
ε11  =  σ11  − 
ν 
(σ22  + σ33 ) + αΔT  = 0
E

Since  the  normal  stresses  σ22 ,  σ33  are  zero  at  the  surface  (no  external  loads  at  the 
surface)  and  at   the  center  (by  symmetry),  let  us  assume  that   σ22  = σ33  = 0 throughout  
the  rod.  Then  σ11  = −αΔT  and  we  can  express ε22  = ε33  as

ε22  =  σ22  −

(σ11  + σ33 ) + αΔT  = αΔT (1  + ν)

(b)  Find  the  change  in   volume  ΔV of  the  bar,  assuming  small  strains (i.e.,   neglecting  terms  
of  order  ε2  and   smaller).  Compare  this  change  in  volume  to  the  change  in  volume  if 
the  bar  were  not  constrained. 
SOLUTION:  The  new  volume V  �  is  
V �  = V (1  + ε11 )(1  + ε22 )(1  + ε22 ) ≈ V [1  + 2αΔT (1  + ν)] 
where  we  have  ignored  terms  of  order  ε2  and  smaller.  The  change  in  volume  is   ΔV   = 
V � − V .  If  the  bar  were  unconstrained,  the  new  volume  would  be 
V � ≈ (1  + 3αΔT ) 

and  the  change  in   volume  would  be 

ΔV  ≈ 3αΔT V 

(c)  What is the  change in volume  ΔV if  the  Poisson’s  ratio  ν of  the  constrained  bar  is   zero? 
If  ν is  0.5? 

SOLUTION:  If  ν  =  0 (imagine  a  rod  made  of  cork,  for  example),   then  the  change  in 
volume  would  be 

ΔV  = 2αΔT V 
and  solely  due  to   thermal   expansion.  If  ν  =  0.5 (a  rod  made  of  rubber,  for  example),  
then 

ΔV  = 3αΔT V 
which is  the  same  as  an   unconstrained  rod.  

(d)  What is the  ﬁnal  diameter of a titanium rod of  length 10 cm and  original  diameter 4 mm  
after a temperature  increase of 250  ◦C?  Use  reasonable  material  properties  for  titanium. 
Would you expect the rod to buckle due to this  temperature  increase? 
SOLUTION:  If  we  take  α = 10 ppm/◦C and ν = 0.32  for  titanium,  then  the  ﬁnal  diame­
ter d �  is 
d �  = d(1  + ε22 ) = d[1  + αΔT (1  + ν)]  = 1.0033d ≈ 4.01 mm

which is  approximately  454 MPa if  we  take E  = 115 GPa  for  titanium.  The  stress   asso­
ciated  with  being  constrained  is  

σcr  =

σ = αEΔT  = 288 MPa 

The rod is therefore unlikely to buckle.  As  some of you noted, however, the bar may 
yield  (plastically  deform)  due  to  this  large  stress. 

(e)  Physically,  what  would  you  do  in  this  experiment  to  ensure  that  the  assumption  in  (a) 
is  met? 

SOLUTION: To  ensure  that  ε22  and  ε33  are  unconstrained,  we  might  polish  the  ends  of 
the  rod   and  the  walls  or  add  a  lubricant  to  reduce  friction.   We  might  also  restrict  our 
measurements  of   the  rod’s  diameter   to  locations  far  from  the  ﬁxed  ends. 

2.  Since  there  are  only  two  independent  elastic  constants   associated  with  isotropic   materials, 
the  shear  modulus  G  is  related  to  the Young’s  modulus   E  and  the  Poisson’s  ratio  ν.  Your 
goal  is  to   derive  this  relationship. 

(a)  Consider a square region in a state of pure shear (Figure 2(a)). We expect the region to 
deform  as  shown   in   Figure  2(b).  The  shear  modulus   G is   deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  shear 
stress  τ  to   the  angular  deformation  γ  (assuming  that  γ  �  1).   By  what  name  is  the 
variable  γ known? 

SOLUTION:  This  is  the  engineering  shear  strain. 

Figure  2:   (a)  Square  region  under  a  stress  state  of  pure  shear;  (b)  Deformed  shape. 

(b)  Calculate  the  post-deformation  distance  between  points A and B (or  AB) in  terms  of γ 
and   �.  Feel  free  to   use  the  small-angle  approximations  sin  γ ≈ γ and  cos  γ ≈ 1. 

3 

SOLUTION:  Let  us  position  the  origin  at  the  bottom  left  corner.  Using  small-angle 
approximations,  we  ﬁnd  that   points A and B have  moved  from  (0,l)  and  (l,0)  to (γl/2,l) 
� 
� 
and  (l,γl/2), respectively.  The  new  distance  between A and B  can be  calculated  as

(c)  Transform  the  stress  state  into  the  principal  stress  state  by  a  method  of  your  choosing. 
Plot  the  magnitudes  and   directions  of  the  principal  stresses  on  the  original  square  region 
(Figure  2).  Deﬁne  a  new  set  of  axes,   i�  and  j� ,  corresponding  to  the  directions   of   the 
principal  stresses. 
SOLUTION:  The  principal  stresses  in  the  new  axes  are  σ1� 1�  =  −σ2� 2�  =  τ.  These 
stresses  act   at   an   angle  45◦  from  the  normal  directions  of  the  original  square. 

(d)  Express  the  strain  εi� j�  and   also  the  post-deformation  distance  between  points A and B 
(AB) as  a  function  of  the  principal  stresses.   By  equating  your  two  expressions   for   AB, 
express  G in   terms  of  E and  ν.

initial   length  of  16   cm  and   an  initial  cross-sectional  area  of  0.4  cm2  for  all  samples.

(b)  Which   sample  (A,  B,  or  C)  is   likely  to  be  the  ceramic?  Why? 

SOLUTION:  The  best-ﬁt  slopes  for  these  data produce a Young’s  elastic  modulus E 
of 73 GPa  for  sample A, 69 GPa  for  sample B,  and  205 GPa  for  sample C.  Sample A,  
which fractured  in   a  brittle  manner—with  no  sign  of  plastic  deformation—is  probably 
the  ceramic. 

(c)  What  is  a  possible  composition  of  each  metallic  sample? 

SOLUTION:  Sample B could be  aluminum,   and  sample C could be  one of a  number of 
types  of   steel. 

4.  Materials  (single   crystals  of  metals  and  ceramics,   composites,  and  even  types   of  polymers  
and  proteins)  have  symmetry  that  reduces  the  number  of  independent  values  in  fourth  rank  
tensors  that  modulate  second   rank  tensors.  You  will   prove  this  and  consider  the  number 
of  independent  elastic  constants  in  the  context  of  elastic  constants   for  cubic  and  isotropic 
materials. 
(a)  δi j  is  the  Kronecker  delta  and  = 1 (i =  j)  or  = 0 (i �  j).  We  can  write  this  as  a  matrix

, 
where  ai j  = −δi j  and   ai j  is  the  direction  cosine  matrix,   as always. We  can  use  this fact 
to   write  down   some  pretty   obvious  truths,  e.g.,  

(1) 
δi jσ jl  = σil 
because,  of  course,  σ11  = 1 ∗ σ11  + 0 ∗ σ12  + 0 ∗ σ13  = σ11 . For  this  reason,  the  matrix 
δi j  is  also  called  the  substitution  matrix. Fascinating.  Use  this fact  to  prove  something  
useful  about  the  stiﬀness  tensor  C i jkl : 

C i jkl  = δimδ jnδkoδl pCmno p 

(2) 

SOLUTION:  Let’s  let i  = 1; j  = 1; k  = 1; l  = 1 (arbitrarily).  The  nonzero  terms  in  the 
above  statement   of   the  stiﬀness   tensor Cmno p  would  be: 

C1111  = δ11δ11δ11δ11C1111 . 

(3) 

(+  all  other  terms  =  0  because  corresponding  δi j  =  0).   This  is   true,  but  not  very 
interesting; it is  equivalent to restating the  identity of C1111 .  However,  what  if  we  switch 
the  order of   just i and j: 

C jikl  = δ jmδinδkoδl pCmno p 

(4) 

5 

but   since i = j in   this  case,  then  we’d still  obtain 

C1111  = δ11δ11δ11δ11C1111 

(5) 

(+ all   other  terms  = 0 because  corresponding δi j  = 0). 

so  this  means  that C i jkl  = C jikl .  And  here,  of  course,  we’d  ﬁnd  the  same  result  if  we

switched k and  l.  This  would  in  fact  also  be  true  of  the  values   of i and j  were  diﬀerent

from the  values of k and l, and  would  also be  true if i  �  j or k  �  l.  In  the  latter  case,

the  Kronecker  delta  δi j  would  be  zero  for  those  unmatched  indices.

Important point:  It is  this fact  that   allows us to reduce C i jkl  from 81  components (the

number  that  would  be  needed  to  relate  the  nine  stress   components   in  σi j  to  the  nine

strain  components  in   �kl ) to  only  36  components  (switching  the  order  of  the  ﬁrst  two 

indices, i and j, or the  second two  indices, k and l, does not change the  value of C i jkl .

Cool,  and  so  much faster  to  write  down  a  36  component  matrix. 


(b)  This  also  means  that a  component of the stiﬀness  and  compliance  tensors  is   unchanged 
in   its  value  if  the  reference  axes  are  rotated  about  a  center  of  symmetry  of  the  material. 
For  example,  a  cubic  materials  has  symmetry  in  the  [100],   [010],   and  [001]  directions 
such  that,  in   the  contracted  two-suﬃx  notation  of  the  fourth  rank  tensor  C i jkl , 

C11  = C22  = C33 ; C12  = C23  = C31 ; C44  = C55  = C66 . 

(6) 

To reduce  from  cubic  symmetry (3 independent  elastic  constants) to  isotropic   symmetry  
(2  independent  elastic  constants),  we  can  consider  a  rotation  of  the  reference  axes  in  a 
cubic  crystal  under  uniaxial  tensile  strain (�11  =  �11 ; all  other  strains = 0).   Express  the 
normal  stresses  σi j  in   terms   of  �i j  and  C i jkl ,  and  then  rewrite  this  expressing  C  in  the 
contracted  two-suﬃx  notation. 

SOLUTION: 

σ11  = C1111 �11 

(+ all   other C i jkl �kl  terms  = 0 because  those  strain  components = 0) 
or 

σ1  = C11 �1

(c)  Consider  a  45o  CCW  in-plane  rotation  from  this  old  axis  set   (1,   2,  3)  to  a  new  axis  set 
(1’,  2’,  3’)  about  the  3-axis.  Express   the  direction  cosine  matrix  of  this  transformation 
ai j . 

SOLUTION:  ai j  for  a  rotation  about  the  3-axis   (i.e.,   an  in-plane  rotation)  where  θ  = 
45o  is:

Now  note  that  this  is  a  bit  sloppy  in  terms  of  notation  because  I’m  mixing  second  rank 
tensor  σi j  with  contracted  two-suﬃx  notation for C i jkl  to  save on the  writing. I know in 
my  head  that C11  = C1111  and so forth, and this  saves time but I’ll remember not to do  
any  tensor operations on this  contracted form of C i j  because that form is NOT a  tensor! 

(f)  From (d) and (e) and the fact that you have proved that certain  C i j  have  the  same  value 
independent  of  rotation  for  materials   of  cubic  symmetry,  equate  σ�
12  with  � �
in  terms
12 
of  C11  and   C12 . 

SOLUTION:  Important  point:  The  elastic  constants C11  and C12  are  unchanged by  this  
�  ? Then by substituting  
rotation of reference  axes.  Notice that we have never  written C i jkl
the  result   of   (d)  into  (e),  we  obtain: 
σ1� 2�  = (C11  − C12 )�1� 2� 

(11) 

(g)  Now,  for  an  isotropic  material,  you  know  that  shear  stress  is   proportional  to  (engineer­
ing  and   tensorial)  shear  strain  via  the  shear  modulus.  Equate  σ1�2�  with  �1� 2�  in  terms  
of  C44  on   this  basis. 

SOLUTION:  We  know  that   engineering  shear  stress   is   proportional   to  engineering 
shear  strain.  Now,  in   tensorial  strain  notation,  we  know  this  means   that  

�12  = σ12/(2G) 

7 

(12) 

where  the  factor of 2  comes from  the relation  between  engineering  and  tensorial  shear  
strain.  Since C44  = G,  then  we  could  write  this  as: 

σ1� 2�  = 2C44 �1� 2� 

(13) 

and  there’s  nothing  special  about  the  primes   here.  This  equation  would  be  true  for  
“old”  or  “new”  axes  since  the  elastic  constants  are  unchanged  by  choice  of  reference 
axes.  You   know  this  is  true  even  though  you’re  relating  “12”  stresses  and  strains  with  
a  “44”  elastic  constant  because  you  are  told  that   for  a  cubic  or  isotropic  matrial, 
C44  = C66 ,  and  you   know  that C66  = C1212  in  the  fourth-rank  tensor  notation; it is C1212 
that  relates  these   shear  stresses   and  strains. 

(h)  Finally, compare (f) and (g) to prove that three  independent  constants in a cubic  material  
reduces  to   two  independent  constants  for  an  isotropic   material,  and give  the  mathemat­
ical   relationship  among   these  three  independent  elastic  constants  C11 ,  C12 ,  and  C44  for 
this  isotropic  approximation. 
SOLUTION:  If  we  equate  σ1� 2�  =  (C11  − C12 )�1� 2�  and  σ1� 2�  =  2C44 �1� 2� ,  we  will  arrive 
at   the  conclusion   we  stated  in  our   notes.  For  an  isotropic  material,   there  are  only  two  
elastic  constants,  because: 
C44  = (C11  − C12 )/2 
(14) 
and  so  you’ve  proved  this  dependency  through  a  coordinate  system  transformation   to 
relate  the  shear  and  axial  strains! 

5.  Most  metals  are  elastically   anisotropic,   meaning  that  the  measured Young’s  elastic  modulus 
E i jk  depends  on   the  direction  with  respect  to  the  crystal  structure   along  which  load  is   applied. 
This  can  be  expressed   in   terms  of  the  compliance  matrix  S i j  as:  
1
1/E i jk  = S 11  − 2(S 11  − S 12  − 
2
where  this  time  ai j  is  the  direction  cosine  matrix  between  the  unit   cell  crystallographic  di­
rections  [100],  [110],  and   [111]:

so  one  can  compute  E110  and   compare  it  to  E111 ,  for  example.  If  all  E i jk  are  the  same,  that 
material is  elastically  isotropic.  Referring to Table 2.4 (Meyers and Chawla) for  S i j , compute 
E100 , E110 , andE111  as  well  as  the  Zener  anisotropic  elastic  constants   A for  the  following  pairs 
of  materials:  

(a)  Ag   and   Au,  two  FCC  group  11  noble  metals; 

8 

(b)  W and   Mo,  two  BCC  group  6B  heavy  metals.  

SOLUTION:  Note  that,  here,  the  indices  i,  j, k  are  the  crystallographic  indices,   not 
tensor  notation.  From Table  2.4  of M&C,  Ag  has   the  following  elastic  compliances:  
S 11  = 2.29; S  44  = 2.17; S  12  =  -0.983  x  10−2  GPa−1 ; and Au  has   the  following: S 11  = 
2.33; S  44  = 2.38; S  12  = -1.065 x 10−2  GPa−1  . 
Given  these  values  and  the  ai j  direction  cosine  matrix  relating  the  three  crystallo­
graphic  directions  [100],  [110],  and  [111],  we  obtain  the  elastic  moduli  as  measured 
parallel  to   these  crystallographic  directions.  The  easiest  way  to  do  this  is   to  compute 
the products of   the  direction  cosine  elements  for  each direction. For example,

This is easy to   compute in a spreadsheet  format or via  Mathematica,  Matlab, or  similar. 
We  obtain   the  following E i jk ,  all in  units of GPa:

(c)  Why do   you  think  these   diﬀer  within  (a)  and  (b)  [i.e.,  same  crystal  class  and  group]; 
and   among  (a)  and   (b)? 

SOLUTION: Ag and Au are both fcc, but note that Ag is   located just above Au in the 
periodic  table.  The  diﬀering  electronic  structure,  despite  the  fact  that   they both  have d 
and  s  orbitals  occupied,  relates  to  the  electronegativity  diﬀerence  among  these  atoms  
in   a  crystal   and  will  aﬀect U (r). 
Of   course,  the  equilibrium  interatomic  spacing  ro  and  binding  energy  Ub  will  also 
diﬀer  due  to   the  fact  that  these  elements  are  in  the  same  group, but  diﬀerent  periods. 
The  compliance  values  between  these  two  metals  do  not  diﬀer   much,  and  neither  does 
the  level  of   anisotropy.  If  you  calculate  the  percent-diﬀerence  among  these E i jk  for Ag  
and Au, Ag is  slightly  more  elastically  anisotropic (E100  diﬀers  from  E110  by  91.5% 
as  compared  to   89.8%  for Au,  for example).   Same  argument  for Mo  and W,  the  bcc

comparison, but Mo is  more  elastically  anisotropic (E  ranging from 290 to 357 GPa)  
owing  chieﬂy  to   a  less  spherical  electron  distribution.  
The  elastic  anisotropy  and  elastic  constants  themselves  would  be  expected  to  diﬀer 
signiﬁcantly  among  these   alloys,  especially  between  the  two  groups,   due  to  diﬀerences 
in   electronegativity  (electronic  structure,  aﬀecting  the  favored  crystallographic  form 
at   room  temperature  and  pressure)  and  atom   size.  As  you  know,  W  is   an  elastically 
isotropic  metal,  whereas  the  fcc  metals  you  considered  are  not.  
The  Zener  anisotropy ratio A could be  calculated from C i j  values in Table 2.3. As given  
in   Ex.  2.11, A  = 3.01   for Ag  and  only  1.00  for W.
