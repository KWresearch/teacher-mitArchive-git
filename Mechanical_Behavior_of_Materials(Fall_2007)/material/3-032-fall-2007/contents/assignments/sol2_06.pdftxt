1. You make a questionable  back-to-school  purchase: a new pair of  platform-sole  sneak­
ers  that  may  make  you  look a  bit  taller.  Much  to  your  dismay,  your  “friend”  tells   you 
that  when  you  put  them  on   she  can  see  that  the  green  soles   are  compressed  to  about  
half  their  original  height  (i.e.,  half  of  the  thickness  shown  in  Figure   1(a)).  Looking 
from  the  top,  you  can  see  that  your  soles   were  ﬂush  with  the  shoe  upper  before  you 
put  them  on.  However,  under  your  weight,  the  soles   stick  out  about 1 cm  on  each 
side.

(a)  What  is  the  Poisson’s  ratio  of  the  material  from  which  your  sneaker  soles   are 
made? 

Solution: To  determine  ν,  we  need  the  lateral  strain  �lat  and  normal   strain  �norm  . 
The  normal  strain  is  given  as  �norm  =  −0.5  (your   sole  compressed  by  half   or 
50%  of   its  original   height).   The  lateral  strain  must  be  calculated  as: 

�lat  = Δw/wo 

where  wo  is  the  original  width  of  your   shoe.  My  shoe  is   10  cm  wide  at  the 
toebox, so I’ll   assume this as wo . We are told your sole jutted out 1 cm on  either 
side,  so  Δw  = 2 cm  and 

Then


ν = −

(b)  Based  on   this  back-of-the-envelope  calculation,  what  can  you  tell  your  friend 
about  the  likely   composition  and  structure  of  that  material? 
Solution:  Since  metals  and  ceramics  have  ν ≈ 0.3 and  polymers  have  ν ≈ 0.4– 
0.49, this is likely a sole made from a (green) polymer. In reality,  sneaker  soles 
were  originally  made  of  rubber,  and  in  fact  the  term  “sneaker”   as  synonym   for  
athletic  shoes  is  an   American  invention.  It  was   supposedly  coined  by  the  US 
Rubber  Company  who   made  the  ﬁrst   pair   of Keds—the  rubber   sole  made  the 
wearer  hard to   hear  when  approaching  on  foot∗ .  Although gum  rubber   sneakers 
still exist  (think  Chuck Taylor   All-Stars),  synthetic  elastomers  and  polyurethane 
foams  are  now  more  common.

2. You  are  hanging   from a  rope  that is of 4 cm  diameter  and  originally of 6 m  length. 
The rope is  stationary and   clamped  tightly at the  other end. Treat the rope as a square 
spring  (i.e.,  Cartesian  coordinates  are  OK)  of  eﬀective  spring  constant k  = 100 N/m. 

(a)  At   the  clamped  end,  at  the  point  halfway  down  the  rope  length,  and  at  the  end 
from  which you’re  hanging,  deﬁne all the  components of the  displacement vec­
tor  u = (ui , u j , uk ). 

Solution:  Let’s  assume  you  weigh  600  N,  and  that   the  clamped  site  is   labeled  
A,  the  midpoint  is  labeled  B,  and  the  end  on  which you’re  hanging  is   labeled  C. 
Since  the rope  has a  stiﬀness k of  100 N/m, it will  displace  downward 0.01 m for 
every  Newton  of   axial  force  applied.  This  means   that   the  rope  length  will  in­
crease by  (600  N)(0.01 m/N) = 6 m,  for a  ﬁnal  length of 6  + 6 = 12  m.  However, 
the  displacement  is  NOT  uniform  along  the  length  of  the  rope,  as  shown  in  the 
ﬁgure  below:

Thinking  this  through,  |uA | = 0 m, |uB | = 3 m,  and |uC | = 6 m.  This  means   that 
u x  =  u1  =  (P/k)( x/L),  where  x  is   the  distance  from  the  clamped  end  and L is 
the  initial rope  length of 6 m.  More generally,  u = (P/k)( x/L)ˆi + 0ˆj + 0kˆ . 

(b)  Compute  all   the  components  of  the  small-strain,   small-rotation  strain  tensor  �i j 
at  the  end   from  which  you  are  hanging.  
⎡⎢

⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥
Solution:  By  deﬁnition,  �i j  is   based  on  the  partial  derivatives  of  u:

Here,  only  u1  is  nonzero  and  depends  only  on  x1 ,  so  only  �11  is   nonzero  and  �i j 
becomes:

(c)  Compute  the  normal  stress  σii  at  the  same  three  points   of  the  rope  considered 
in   (a). 

Solution:  At  all  points  along  the  rope  length, 

F i  = 
Ai 

600  N 
π(2  × 10−2 m)2 

σii  = 

= 4.8 x105  N/m2  = 480  kPa.

In  other  words,  stress  in  a  tensile  member  under  an  axial   load  is   uniform  along 
the  member  length. 

(d)  What  do   you  notice  about   the  variation  in  u and in  σii  as  a  function  of  distance 
from  the  clamped  end? 

Solution:  Under  this  axial   load,  u  varies   along  the  length  of  the  rope  and  is 
maximum  at   the  end   furthest  from  the  clamp,  while  σii  remains  constant.  Here, 
the  important  point  to   notice  is   that   the  functional  form  of  the  displacement  ﬁeld  
may  be  quite  diﬀerent   from  that   of  the  stress   ﬁeld  in  a  material  body. 

3.  Concrete,  sometimes  called  “the  ultimate  material,”  has  enabled  impressive  achieve­
ments  in   construction  for  thousands   of  years.  Concrete  is   also  simple  to  make, 
consisting–in  its  simplest  form–of  only  lime  (calcium  oxide),  sand,  gravel,  and  wa­
ter.  An   unfortunate  limitation of  concrete, however, is   that it is far, far  weaker in 
tension  than  in   compression.  In  this  problem,  you  will   develop  a  way  around  this  
limitation.  The  technique  you  will   use,  known  as  pretensioning,  is   commonly  used 
to  create  long  spans  such  as  those  pictured  in  Figure  3.

(a)  Let  us  model  a  concrete  span  as  a  pin-and-roller-anchored  beam  with  a  length  
L  =  6 m,  a  thickness h  =  0.8 m,  and  width w  (Figure  3(a)).  The  span  is   loaded 
with  a  distributed  load  q (force  per  area) of  50 kN/m2 .  Determine  the  values  
and   locations  of  the  maximum  tensile  and  compressive  stresses  in  the  beam.   (It 
may  be  useful  to   construct  shear  and  bending  moment  diagrams).  

Solution:  The  stress  in   the  beam  is

steel  rods  to   provide  pretensioning. 

where y is the  distance from the neutral axis (in this case, the center) of the span. 
From   free-body  diagrams,  the  reaction  force  at  each support   is   qwL/2 and  the 
maximum  bending  moment  is   qwL2 /8 at  the  center  of  the  span.   The  maximum 
stress  therefore  has  magnitude  3qL2 /4h2  =  2.11 MPa:  negative  (compressive) 
at   the  top  of   the  span   and  positive  (tensile)  at  the  bottom.  

(b)  You   have  decided  that  it  is   best  to  allow  no  part   of  the  concrete  span  to  be  in 
a  state  of  tensile  stress.  To  accomplish  this  goal,   you  will   position  steel  bars 
along  the  length  of  the  span  before  pouring  the  concrete.   You  will   then  stretch  
the bars, pour the concrete and allow it to harden, and  release the  tension (Figure 
3(b)).  The  released   steel  bars   will   exert  an  axial  compressive  stress  on  the  span 
that  is  superposed  with  the  bending  stresses.   Determine  the  force  per  meter 
of  span  width  to   cancel  the  maximum  tensile  stress  you  calculated  previously. 
Assume  that  the  load  created  by  the  steel  bars   is   distributed  evenly  across  the 
cross  section  of  the  span  and  that  the  addition  of  the  bars   does   not  signiﬁcantly 
change  the  cross  section.

Solution: We require  an  axial   compressive  stress of  3qL2 /4h2  to  cancel  the  ten­
sile  stress  and  the  bottom  of  the  span.   The  required  force  per  unit   width  is 
3qL2 /4h = 1.69  MN/m. 

(c) You   are  told  that  the  steel  you  are  using  has a failure  strength  σF  =  400 MPa 
and the  bars have a  diameter of  one  inch. You  wish to avoid failure in the  bars 
with a factor of safety of two.  What is the  maximum  load you  can  allow in 
each  bar?  How  many bars  are  needed  per  meter  of  span  width  to  provide  the 
necessary  compressive  load  that  you  calculated  previously? 

Solution:  The  maximum  load P is  
σFπd2

P =  σF A =

The  numbers  of   bars  needed  per  meter   of  span  width  is

4.  A  spiral  fracture  can  occur  when  long  bones  such  as  the  femur  are  exposed  to  an 
excessive  torsional  load  (Figure  4(a,b)).  The  diaphysis   (middle  portion)  of  the  fe­
mur  consists  of  an  outer  circle  of  dense  cortical  bone  surrounding  a  center  of  much 
weaker  trabecular  (meshlike)  bone.  Biomedical  engineers  have  modeled  the  stronger  
cortical  bone  portion  as  an  annulus,   as  shown  in  Figure  4(c).   Let  us  assume  that  this  
annulus has an  outer  diameter of 26 mm and an  inner  diameter of 20 mm, and that the 
diaphysis has a length of 30 cm. The shear  modulus of  cortical bone is approximately 
17 GPa. 

(a)  The  maximum  shear  stress  occurs   at  the  surface  of  the  bone.  If  a  shear  stress  
τF  =  60 MPa  will  cause failure  in  cortical  bone,  ﬁnd  the  maximum  torsional 
load  that  this  femur  can  withstand.  What  is   this  load  in  Newtons,  assuming  a 
lever  arm of 2 m? 

Solution:  The  stress  distribution  under a  torsional   load T  is 

T y

τ = 
J 
� 
� 
where y is the  distance from the  center and J is the polar  moment of  inertia. 
The  maximum  allowable  torque  is   therefore 
τF (π/2)  (OD/2)4  − (ID/2)4 
τF J 
(OD/2) 
(OD/2) 
The  load in Newtons  corresponding to a lever  arm of 2 m is   67.3 N.

(b)  If  the  dimensions  of  the  cross  section  (outer  and  inner  diameters)  are  reduced 
by   50%, by   what  percentage is   the  maximum  torsional  load  reduced? 

Solution:  If  the  cross-section  dimensions   are reduced by half,  the  new maximum 
torque is  calculated to be  16.8 N−m—an  88%   decrease.
