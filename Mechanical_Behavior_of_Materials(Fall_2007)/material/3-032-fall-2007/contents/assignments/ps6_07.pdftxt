3.032 Problem Set 6 
Fall 2007 
Due:  Start of Lecture, Wednesday 11.28.07  
(NOTE THAT THIS DATE IS LATER THAN IN YOUR SYLLABUS.  
PS7 WILL GO OUT ON 11.28 AND BE DUE ON 12.07.) 

1. There is very little information available on wikipedia.org (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) 
about the strengthening mechanisms available to increase the yield strength of crystalline and 
amorphous materials. Those wiki stubs that do exist are fragmented discussions of specific 
materials, and there is very little discussion of the physical mechanisms that govern this 
strengthening so that one could know how to choose a base material and/or alter the 
microstructure of that material to achieve a target strength, or to know the fundamental limits of 
the maximum attainable strength for a chosen mechanism. 

Your task, individually and as a class, is to modify existing articles and create new articles, 
graphics, examples, and links that describe the concepts covered in lecture (and beyond) as 
clearly, accurately, and interestingly as possible. This is supposed to be interactive and the 
article(s) will get better as everyone contributes, and should help you really understand and 
integrate this material in prep for Quiz 3. The credit for this problem will be as follows: 

• 67% from the material you personally edit/create. To do this, you will have to create one new 
wiki account on any computer (please use your MIT user name as your login “name”), and sign 
on using this account every time you edit any wiki pages from any computer. That way, we can 
also compare versions as the articles evolve. When you’re done, print your personal wiki 
“history” for this login name and turn that printout in with your pset, as you will have likely 
contributed to several different changes or made changes that are no longer visible. You don’t 
have to print out the pages you’ve created (please!) so we need this history to go find what wiki 
content you’ve edited. 

• 33% for the total quality of the contributions to wikipedia that you as the 2007 3.032 
class have made through your additions of material related to strengthening mechanisms in 
materials. It does not matter if you modify these pages or decide to create a new article that you 
all work on. You can add graphs, images, text, and equations, and link any new/existing pages 
created by classmates.  

If you have not contributed much to wikis yet, there is a helpful FAQ at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editing FAQ. If you contribute early on, you’ll have the 
most chance to shape the site but the least to work with; if you wait too long to get started, you 
will have to work harder to think of creative and accurate ways to add to the site. Remember that 
citations in your own academic work should NOT come from wikipedia, because it is not 
rigorously peer-reviewed and is only as accurate as the last person who edited the page. Have 
fun – this is something you can do and enjoy while traveling on your Thanksgiving break! 

2. We’ve discussed that hardness expressed in units of [Pa] is generally proportional to yield 
strength, and that engineers often assume H = P/A = 3σy. Here, you will derive this relation to 
understand the basis of this gross approximation.

Assume the indenter is a flat punch and that we consider indentation only in a plane 
(2D, for simplicity). Define the work done by the indenter as it applies a force Pz 
acting over the punch width (or cross-sectional area in 3D) A to exert a vertical 
displacement hz onto the material surface. 
Now assume the material beneath the indenter displaces only at locations of 
maximum shear stress, as shown.  Determine the relative displacement of the material 
triangle edges (filled arrows) in terms of hz, and the “area” of those isosceles triangle 
edges over which this displacement occurs. 
The triangles will only start to displace when the work done by the punch = work 
required to attain shear stress in the material that is high enough to yield the material. 
Equate the work in (i) to the sum of the work done on all of these internal triangle 
edges (8 in total, shown in the Fig. Q2) that move under the shear stress τ. As the 
displacement uz appears on both sides of this equality, you will obtain an equation of 
the form P α Aτ. 
Since we have implicitly assumed the maximum shear stress or Tresca criterion in 
this analysis, now express τ in terms of the yield strength according to this criterion, 
and note that H is defined as P/A, to obtain an equation that relates H to σy. 
Explain at least two cases where this approximation would be inaccurate, and whether 
you think this proportionality factor would go up (so H is more than thrice the yield 
strength) or down. To think about this, consider the simplifications that were made in 
order to derive this relation. Note especially that hardness is a value you measure 
after considerable yielding over a material volume has occurred, not just at the instant 
that the yield stress is attained.

3. Materials engineers have become increasingly interested in whether the yield strength of 
crystalline materials changes as the physical size of the material decreases toward the nanoscale. 
Until very recently, conducting uniaxial tension/compression tests on tiny material volumes < 
100 microns in diameter was technically infeasible, but Uchic et al. have shown that they can 
make and measure the compressive stress-strain response of single crystal Ni and other materials 
for pillar diameters as small as 5 microns (see Fig. 2). The full paper is available on MIT Server, 
and is a very cool read.

microsamples having a  134  orientation. (A) Stress-strain curves for microsamples ranging in size from 40 to 5

machining. (C) A SEM image of 5-µm-diameter microsample after testing, where the sample achieved

strain during a rapid burst of deformation that occurred in less than 0.2 s.

(a)  The authors show an engineering stress vs. engineering strain response, but I don’t  	observe 
the ultimate stress beyond yielding where the stress decreases before fracture. Why not? 
(b)  For the Ni sample of 10 μm diameter and 2nd highest engineering fracture stress (~100 MPa), 
replot these data as true stress vs. true strain (yes, you will need to pull some points off the 
curve). 
(c)  Determine the strain hardening coefficient of this sample from these data, and compare that 
to literature values of n for Ni. 
(d)  The authors wanted to consider whether the yield strength as a function of pillar diameter 
followed a Hall-Petch type relation. Why would they make this analogy between polycrystals 
of decreasing size and single crystal pillars of decreasing size? 
(e)  Compute the average yield strength for each pillar diameter and graph σy as a function of d to 
determine (i) whether Hall-Petch type strengthening is observed; (ii) What the “power” x of 
such strengthening would be for a Hall-Petch type equation.

4. Creep can occur via several different mechanisms in amorphous and crystalline materials, 
each with their own activation energy Q. Typically, there is an Arrhenius behavior to this creep 
response, with an exponential prefactor that is particular to the material considered and on the 
operating mechanism. 

(a) You are running two separate creep experiments on polycrystalline Ni, one at 527oC (=800 
K) and the other at 532oC (=805 K). You observe that strain rate dε/dt increases by a factor of 
1.5 for the sample tested at the higher temperature, as compared to the lower temperature. 
Assuming there is a single dominant mechanism (and therefore a single activation energy Q) for 
creep over this temperature range, determine Q. 

(b) What do you think this deformation mechanism could be, and why? Note that the actual grain 
size d and stress magnitude need not be stated to figure this out, but you can use deformation 
mechanism maps (Fig. Q4) to narrow down your options, with key data for Ni indicated in figure 
caption. 

(c) You are running these tests because you would like to develop a new polycrystalline Ni alloy 
for Boeing aircraft engines. The Ni parts will be under a constant stress of about 1.3 GPa due to 
centrifugal forces, and a temperature of about 1100oC. Which creep mechanism are you most 
concerned about in this application, and how do you propose to modify the polycrystalline Ni 
alloy to minimize creep rates for this application?
