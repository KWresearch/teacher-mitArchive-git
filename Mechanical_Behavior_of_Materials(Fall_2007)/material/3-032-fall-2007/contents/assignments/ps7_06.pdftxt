3.032 Problem Set 7

Fall 2006

Due:  12/08/06 before the start of lecture


1.  Creep  can  occur  via  several  diﬀerent  mechanisms   in  amorphous  and  crystalline  materials, 
each  with  their  own   activation  energy  Q.  Typically,  there  is   an  Arrhenius  behavior  to  this  
creep  response, with an exponential prefactor that is   particular to the  material  considered and 
on  the  operating  mechanism. 

(a)  You   are  running  two  separate  creep  experiments  on  polycrystalline  Ni,   one  at  527oC 
and   the  other  at  532oC.  You  observe  that  dε/dt  increases  by  a  factor  of  1.5  for  the 
sample  tested   at  the  higher  temperature.  What  is   the  activation  energy  Q for  this  creep 
mechanism? 
(b)  What  do   you  think  the  mechanism  at  532oC could  be,  and  why?  Note  that  the  actual 
grain  size  d and   stress  magnitude need not be  stated to ﬁgure this out, but you can use 
deformation  mechanism  maps   to  narrow  down  your  options.  
(c)  You   are  running  these  tests  because  you  would  like  to  develop  a  new  polycrystalline 
Ni   alloy for  Boeing  aircraft   engines.   The  Ni  parts  will   be  under  a  constant   stress  of  
about  1.3  GPa  due  to   centrifugal  forces,   and  a  temperature  of  about  1100oC.  Which  
creep  mechanism  are  you  most  concerned  about,  and  how  do  you  propose  to  modify  
the  polycrystalline  Ni   alloy to  minimize  creep  rates  for  this  application? 

2.  One  of  your  colleagues  proposes  that  the  advancing  crack  in  the  cast   copper-and-tin  Liberty 
Bell in  Philadelphia, PA could have been halted early on by drilling a small hole just beyond 
the  crack’s  termination point. Would this be likely to work? Why  or why not? 

3.  Earlier  this  semester,  you  learned  about  the  stresses  generated  in  thin-wall  pressure  vessels  
and  how  to   calculate  the  minimum  necessary  wall  thickness  to  avoid  yielding.  However, 
yielding that leads to   localized  deformation and leaking is far more  preferable than the alter­
nate failure   mode of  rapid  crack  propagation. 

(a)  Assuming  Mode  I  failure,  obtain  an  expression  for  the  maximum  crack  length  in  a 
vessel wall   that would  allow  yielding  before  crack  propagation,  assuming a factor of  
safety  of  two. 
(b)  Select   four  materials  (any  class)  and  rank  them  by  their  ability  to  satisfy  the  yield-
before-break   criterion  for  this  application,   referencing  your  data  sources.  Clearly  state 
any assumptions. 

4. A plate of  glass is  placed  under a  tensile  stress of 60 MPa. 

(a)  Determine  the  maximum  surface  ﬂaw  size  that  can  be  accommodated  without   fracture. 
Take  the  speciﬁc  surface  energy  of  the  glass   to  be  0.3 J/m2 . 
(b)  What  instruments  could  you  use  to  visualize  ﬂaws   of  that  size,  in  order  to  rule  in/out 
the  likelihood   of  such  ﬂaws   in  the  as-processed  glass? 
(c)  Aluminum  has  the  same Young’s elastic modulus  as  glass.  Compare   the  maximum  ﬂaw 
size  that  could  be  tolerated  in  Al  without   fracture,  clearly  justifying  any assumptions.

5.  One  of  the  ways  that  the  yield  strength  and  toughness  of  alloys  like  steel  are  controlled  is 
through a process  called   tempering,   which  means   heating  the  material  well  below the  melting 
temperature  to   relieve  internal  stresses  via  defect   annihilation.  Unfortunately,  strength  as 
measured by   σy  is  generally  reduced  via  tempering,  whereas  toughness  as  measured  by  KI c 
is  increased  via  tempering. 
√
√
For example,  AISI  4340  steel  can go  from (σy  =  1190  MPa;  KI c  =  135  MPa 
m) to (σy 
m),  varying  almost  linearly  through  this  range  of  tempering 
=  1620   MPa;  KI c  =  60   MPa 
times/temperatures.  It  is  often  important  to  ﬁgure  out  whether  a  ductile  material  component 
like  steel  will fail by   yielding  or by  fracture in a  particular  application  such as a vertical 
member  in   tension. 

(a)  Given  that  visual  inspection  of  the  4340  steel  member  can  detect  all  cracks   greater   than 
a = 2 mm,  determine  whether  the  toughest  steel  noted  above  will fail by  yielding  or fail 
by   fracture.  Assume a  through-thickness   center  crack in a  semi-inﬁnite  body,  such  that 
f  = 1. 
(b)  Ideally,  the  steel  should  carry  the  maximum  possible  load  without  yielding  or  fracture. 
√
That  means  it   should  be  processed  so  that  the  yield  and  fracture  strengths   are  the  same 
value.  Calculate  σ f (KI c ) over  the  range  of  50  ≤  KI c  150  MPa 
m.  Plot  this  result   on  
a  graph   of  stress  (y-axis)  vs.  KI c  (x-axis),  identifying  this  ideal  yield/fracture  strength  
value  as  the  stress  at  which  σy (KI c ) and σ f (KI c ) cross  on  this  graph. 

6.  Review  the  paper, “Fatigue  behavior  of  nanocrystalline   metals  and  alloys”,  Hanlon  et  al.,  Int. 
J. Fat.  27   (2005). 

(a)  In  your  own   words,  explain  why the  reduction  of  grain  size  d is   generally  considered  a 
desirable  microstructure to   increase  fracture and fatigue  resistance in  metals.  
(b)  In  Section   2.2,  the  authors  detail  the experimental  conditions  for  this fatigue  life  study. 
Were the fatigued  samples ever  loaded in  compression? How do you know? 
(c)  The  authors  ﬁrst  computed  the  stress  intensity factor  KI  according  to  Eq.  1.  Given  that 
they observed  later  that  the  range  of  a/W  they accessed  was  0.1  to  0.7,  what  was  the 
range of  KI  that  they  explored,  according  to  Eq.  1? 
(d)  What  is  the  J -integral,  why  did  the  authors  (and  anyone  else)  use  it  to  consider  this  
material’s  fracture  behavior,  and  what  was  the  range  of  the  J -integral   they  explored, 
according to Eqs. 1  - 2? 
(e)  In  Section   3,  the  authors  relate  their  results. 	 Why  do  you  think  the  ductility  of  the 
nanocrystalline,  ultraﬁne  crystalline,  and  microcrystalline  Ni  ranked  the  way  they did? 
(f)  What is the fatigue limit (i.e.,  stress  amplitude in [Pa]) of nc, ufc, and mc Ni,   according  
to   Hanlon  et  al.,  Scripta  Mater.  (2003)  as  reproduced  in  Fig.  4? 
(g)  What  is  the fatigue  crack  growth  threshold  or  threshold  stress  intensity factor  o  for  nc 
Ni   at  the  various  load  ratios  considered,  according  to  Fig.  5? 
(h)  Assuming  that  the  cyclic  crack  growth  characteristics   of  nc  and  ufc  Ni  are  well  char­
acterized by   the Paris law,  determine  the values of  C  and  m  for  both  materials  from

the  data  in   Figs.  5a-c.  From  this  analysis,   state  whether  you  ﬁnd  the fatigue  fracture 
lifetime  to   be  a  stronger  function  of  microstructure  or  of  loading  conditions,  and  why 
you  think  this  to   be  the  case.  
(i)  Brieﬂy explain the  mechanisms you  understand to be  responsible (either from the paper 
or  your  own   knowledge  via  3.032  and  other  sources)  for  the  chief  conclusion  of   the 
authors:   Grain  size  reduction  correlated  with  decreased  subcritical fatigue  fracture  in 
nc  Ni, but   also  to   an  increased  total fatigue  life. 

7.  Select  one  topic  that  has  been   covered  this  semester  in  3.032  (other  than  visco/rubber  elas­
ticity) and   contribute to the  corresponding Wikipedia  article (or  create a new  article if  none 
exists).  This  is  a  good  opportunity  to  get  up  to  speed  in  any  areas  in  which  you  lack  conﬁ­
dence. 
•	 An   ideal  contribution  will  be  several  paragraphs   of  correct  and  useful   information, 
possibly  including  equations  or  ﬁgures. 
•	 Make  sure  to   reference  your  sources   correctly. 
•	 It  will  make  grading  easier  if  you  make  a  single  update  (proofread  your  work   ﬁrst) 
rather  than  multiple  updates.  Please  print  out  your  contribution  or  indicate  the  article 
URL  and   your  user  name  in  your  pset.  

Congratulations on completion of your last graded pset for 3.032!
