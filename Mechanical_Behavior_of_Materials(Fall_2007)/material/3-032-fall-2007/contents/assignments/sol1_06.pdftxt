1.  Thin-ﬁlm  silicon  nitride  cantilevers  such  as  the  one  shown  in  Figure 1  are  used  in 
scanning  probe   microscopy,  resonant  frequency measurements,  and  electrostatic   ac­
tuation.  Let  us  approximate  this  cantilever  as  a  clamped-free  beam  with  a  length  of  
200  µm,  a  width  of  30   µm,  and  a  thickness  of  0.8  µm.  Take  the Young’s  modulus 
of  thin-ﬁlm  silicon  nitride  to  be  210 GN/m2 .  The  weight  of  the  cantilever  can  be 
neglected.

(a)  If  the  free  end   of  the  beam  contacts  a  surface  (represented  by  a  point  load  in 
Figure  1),  and   is  deﬂected  upwards   by  1.0  µm,  ﬁnd  the  magnitude  of  the  point 
load. 

Solution:  The  deﬂection  of  a  clamped-free  beam  under  a  point  load  P  at  the 
end   of   the  beam  is

(b)  Draw a  free-body   diagram of the beam. Sketch the  shear and  bending  moment 
in   the  beam  along  its  length,   labeling  maximum  and  minimum  values.  Use  the 
following  sign   convention  for  positive  shear  and  bending  moment  [Beer  and 
Johnson,  Mechanics  of   Materials  (1992)]:

(c) In your scanning probe experiments, you need to be able to  measure point loads 
that  are  only   one-tenth  of  the   value  you  calculated   above.  Assuming  that  a 
deﬂection  of 1  µm  produces  a  suitable   signal   for   detection,   how  much  longer 
does  the  cantilever  need  to  be?  
Solution:  The  point   load required to create a  given  deﬂection  scales  with L−3  , 
√
3
so the new  length   needs to be larger by a  factor of 
10.  The  new  length  should 
be  at   least   431   µm. 

2.  You  are  assembling   a  structure  in  a  heavy  wind,   which  acts  as  a  distributed  load   q 
(force per length) on one of the wide  boards you are  erecting (Figure 2). Your  friend 
(weight  150   lb)  can   just   barely  keep  the   board  upright  by  hanging  from  a  ﬂexible 
cord  connected to the  board.  The  board is  connected to the  ground by a pin  joint, and 
the  mass of  the  board is 30 kg/m.  Ignore  the  eﬀect  of  the  wind  on  your  friend. 

(a)  Draw a free-body  diagram of the  board and ﬁnd the wind load  q and  the  reaction 
forces  at  the  pin   joint.

(b)  Sketch   the  shear  and   bending  moment  in  the  board. 

Solution:  The  wind  load q is   found by  summing  the  moments  around  the  pin: 
1
T (3 m) cos 30◦ −  q(4 m)2  = 0
2
T  = (150  lb)(4.45 N/lb)  = 667 N 
q = 217 N m−1 
The  reaction   forces  are  calculated  as  follows:

RY  = T sin 30◦  + W  = 1511 N

RX  = T cos 30◦ − q(4 m)  = −289 N

3.  The  Harvard  Bridge  on   Mass.  Ave.  (Figure  3(a,b))  was  rebuilt  in  the  late  1980s  due 
to  the fact  that  the  pin-and-hanger  assemblies of  the expansion  joints  on  the bridge 
were  the  same  as  those  of  the  Mianus   River  Bridge  in  Connecticut.  The  Mianus   River 
Bridge   collapsed in   1983  when a  single pin  became overloaded  and  caused  the  death  
of three people and   serious injury of three  others. Your task is to ﬁnd the  normal and 
shear  forces and   moment  associated with that failure,  which  occurred at the position 
marked  x,  the  midspan   between  pins C and D (Figure  3(c)).

(a)  Draw  a  free  body  diagram  of  the  entire  pin-and-hanger  assembly.  The  weight 
of  the  assembly  can  be  neglected. 

Solution:  The  FBD  is  shown  below.  Note  that   the  reaction  moments  are  zero  at 
pins A and E, as a pin  cannot  sustain a  moment. 

(b)  Determine  the  reaction   forces  about  joint  B.

Solution:  Members  AB,  BC,   and  BD  are  connected  by  pins   and  loaded  at  their  
ends  only,  so  they  can   sustain  only  axial   loads  (this  can  be  conﬁrmed  by  FBD).  
From   this  consideration it is   found  that Ay  = 0.  Setting  the  sum  of  forces  in  the 
y direction  in   the  complete  FBD  equal  to  zero:

ΣFy  = 0 → Ey  − 1500 N  − 300 N(6 m)(
) → Ey  = 2400  N

Setting the sum of   moments around point E equal to zero:

An FBD of pin B is  also  useful  (note  that the  angle  belongs to a 3-4-5  right 
triangle):

(c)  Determine  the  forces  along  and  normal  to  the  horizontal  beam,   and  the  moment 
at  the  point of failure in  the  steel  beam.  

Solution:  Midway  between pins C and D, we can apply the  method of  sections 
to   the  segment  CX. 

Demanding  equilibrium, 
ΣF x  = 0 → N x  = −7.75 kN  · (4/5)  = −6.2 kN 
ΣFy  = 0 → V x  = 1.5 kN − 7.75 kN  · (3/5)  = 3.15 kN 
ΣM x  = 0 → M x  = (3/5)(7.75 kN)(2 m)  − (1.5 kN)(2 m) = 6.3 kN−m 

4.  Nanowires  of  amorphous  silica  (SiO2 ) (Figure  4)  are  considered  as  possible  optical 
waveguides  in   miniaturized  electronics.  For  handling  and  assembly  purposes,   it  is 
necessary  to   know  and  be  able  to  measure  the  critical  buckling  load  Pcr  of  such 
nanowires. 

(a)  For  the  above  nanowire  of  400  nm  diameter  and  1 mm  length,  determine  the 
critical buckling   load.  Assume  the value of  the Young’s  modulus  E  for bulk  
silica,  which is 70 GN/m2 .

Figure  4:   Silica  nanowire.  (a)  Amorphous  silica  ﬁbers  act  as  optical  waveguides  [Tong  et 
al.,  Nature  426:  816  (2003)].  (b)  Critical buckling  load  can  be  measured  via  compression 
with  instruments  such  as  atomic   force  microscopes. 

Solution:  Assume  that  the  bottom  end of  the  wire in Figure  4(b) is   ﬁxed  and  the 
top end is free to move  laterally. The  critical load Pcr  is   then 
= 2.17  × 10−10 N = 217 pN 

Pcr  = π2 E I /(2L)2  =

π2 E (πr4/4) 
(2L)2 

Other  solutions  are  also  acceptable  if  the  end  constraints  are  clearly  stated.  If 
the top end of the wire is  assumed to be  pinned, for example, the eﬀective  length 
will  be  0.7L rather  than  2L and  the  calculated  critical load  will  be  larger  by  a 
factor  of   approximately  8.2. 

(b)  Using the  cantilever in   Problem 1,  what is the deﬂection of  that  cantilever  that 
you  would  need   to   achieve  to  impose  this  elastic  instability? 

Solution:  From   that  problem,  the  eﬀective  spring  constant  that   deﬁnes  the  re­
lationship  between  force P and  deﬂection  δ = 3E I /L3 ,  using  the E , I ,  and L of 
the  silicon  nitride  cantilever.  This  value k  = 0.101 N/m,   so  the  cantilever  would  
need   to   deﬂect  an   amount
