1.  Strain can be coupled not only to  stress but also to  thermal expansion or  contraction (this 
+ν σi j  −
is  known   as  thermoelastic  coupling).  The  general  constitutive  equation  is   εi j  =  1
E 
ν σkk δi j  +  αΔT δi j ,  where  α  is  the  material’s  thermal   expansion  coeﬃcient  and  ΔT  is  the 
E 
change in   temperature. For  metals,   α is   on  the  order  of  10 ppm/◦C. 

Figure  1:   Bar  of  original   length  L in  contact   with  two  rigid  walls. 

(a)  Consider  the  case  of  a  long  rod  of  length  L  that  is   in  contact   with  two  rigid  walls 
and   subject  to   a  temperature  increase  ΔT  (Figure  1).   We  are  interested  in  the  lateral 
strains—that is, the  strains in the 2 and 3  directions.  (Assumption: the walls do not 
limit   strain  in   these  directions.) 
Is  the  2-3  plane  in  a  state  of  plane  stress  or  plane 
strain? Derive  the  value  of ε22  = ε33  as  a  function  of  α,  ΔT ,  and  the  elastic  constants. 
(b)  Find  the  change  in   volume  ΔV  of  the bar,  assuming  small  strains (i.e.,   neglecting  terms  
of order  ε2  and   smaller).  Compare  this  change  in  volume  to  the  change  in  volume  if 
the  bar  were  not  constrained. 
(c)  What is the  change in volume  ΔV  if  the  Poisson’s  ratio  ν of  the  constrained  bar  is   zero? 
If  ν is  0.5? 
(d)  What is the  ﬁnal  diameter of a titanium rod of  length 10 cm and  original  diameter 4 mm  
after a temperature  increase of 250  ◦C?  Use  reasonable  material  properties  for  titanium. 
Would you expect the rod to buckle due to this  temperature  increase? 
(e)  Physically,  what  would  you  do  in  this  experiment  to  ensure  that  the  assumption  in  (a) 
is  met?

2.  Since  there  are  only  two  independent  elastic  constants   associated  with  isotropic   materials, 
the  shear  modulus  G  is  related  to  the Young’s  modulus   E  and  the  Poisson’s  ratio  ν.  Your 
goal  is  to   derive  this  relationship. 

(a)  Consider a square region in a state of pure shear (Figure 2(a)). We expect the region to 
deform  as  shown   in   Figure  2(b).  The  shear  modulus   G  is   deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  shear 
stress  τ  to   the  angular  deformation  γ  (assuming  that  γ  �  1).   By  what  name  is  the 
variable  γ known? 

Figure  2:   (a)  Square  region  under  a  stress  state  of  pure  shear;  (b)  Deformed  shape. 

(b)  Calculate  the  post-deformation  distance  between  points A and B (or  AB) in  terms  of γ 
and   �.  Feel  free  to   use  the  small-angle  approximations  sin  γ ≈ γ and  cos  γ ≈ 1. 
(c)  Transform  the  stress  state  into  the  principal  stress  state  by  a  method  of  your  choosing. 
Plot  the  magnitudes  and   directions  of  the  principal  stresses  on  the  original  square  region 
(Figure  2).  Deﬁne  a  new  set  of  axes,   i�  and  j� ,  corresponding  to  the  directions   of   the 
principal  stresses. 
(d)  Express  the  strain  εi� j�  and   also  the  post-deformation  distance  between  points A and B 
(AB) as  a  function  of  the  principal  stresses.   By  equating  your  two  expressions   for   AB, 
express  G in   terms  of  E  and  ν. 

3.  Listed  below  are  force  vs.	 strain  data  from  tensile  tests  on  one  elemental  polycrystalline

(a)  Graph  these  data  and   ﬁnd  the Young’s  elastic  modulus   E of  each  material,  assuming  an 
initial   length  of  16   cm  and   an  initial  cross-sectional  area  of  0.4  cm2  for  all  samples. 
(b)  Which   sample  (A,  B,  or  C)  is   likely  to  be  the  ceramic?  Why? 
(c)  What  is  a  possible  composition  of  each  metallic  sample? 

4.  Materials  (single   crystals  of  metals  and  ceramics,   composites,  and  even  types   of  polymers  
and  proteins)  have  symmetry  that  reduces  the  number  of  independent  values  in  fourth  rank  
tensors  that  modulate  second   rank  tensors.  You  will   prove  this  and  consider  the  number 
of  independent  elastic  constants  in  the  context  of  elastic  constants   for  cubic  and  isotropic 
materials. 

(a)  δi j  is  the  Kronecker  delta  and  = 1 (i =  j)  or  = 0 (i �  j).  We  can  write  this  as  a  matrix 
⎞⎟
⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟⎟

(not  a  tensor!),  such  that  δi j  =

, 
where  ai j  = −δi j  and   ai j  is  the  direction  cosine  matrix,   as always. We  can  use  this fact 
to   write  down   some  pretty   obvious  truths,  e.g.,  

(1) 
δi jσ jl  = σil 
because,  of  course,  σ11  = 1 ∗ σ11  + 0 ∗ σ12  + 0 ∗ σ13  = σ11 . For  this  reason,  the  matrix 
δi j  is  also  called  the  substitution  matrix. Fascinating.  Use  this fact  to  prove  something  
useful  about  the  stiﬀness  tensor  C i jkl : 

C i jkl  = δimδ jnδkoδl pCmno p 

(2) 

(b)  This  means  that  a  component  of  the  stiﬀness  and  compliance  tensors  is   unchanged  in 
its  value  if  the  reference  axes  are  rotated  about  a  center  of  symmetry  of  the  material. 
For  example,  a  cubic  materials   has  symmetry  in  the  [100],   [010],   and  [001]  directions 
such  that,  in   the  contracted  two-suﬃx  notation  of  the  fourth  rank  tensor  C i jkl , 

C11  = C22  = C33 ; C12  = C23  = C31 ; C44  = C55  = C66 . 

(3) 

To reduce  from  cubic  symmetry (3 independent  elastic  constants) to  isotropic   symmetry  
(2  independent  elastic  constants),  we  can  consider  a  rotation  of  the  reference  axes  in  a 
cubic  crystal  under  uniaxial  tensile  strain (�11  =  �11 ; all  other  strains = 0).   Express  the 
normal  stresses  σi j  in   terms   of  �i j  and  C i jkl ,  and  then  rewrite  this  expressing  C  in  the 
contracted  two-suﬃx  notation. 
(c)  Consider  a  45o  CCW  in-plane  rotation  from  this  old  axis  set   (1,   2,  3)  to  a  new  axis  set 
(1’,  2’,  3’)  about  the  3-axis.  Express   the  direction  cosine  matrix  of  this  transformation 
ai j .

in  terms  of  ai j  and  the  old  coordinate  system  

(d)  Express  the  shear  strain  component  � �
12 
strains. 
(e)  Now  express  the  shear  stress  σ�
12  in  terms  of  the  old  coordinate  system  stresses,  and 
then  in   terms  of  the  old  axial  strains  that  deﬁne  those  stresses.  
(f)  From (d) and (e) and the fact that you have proved that  certain  C i j  have  the  same  value 
independent  of  rotation  for  materials   of  cubic  symmetry,  equate  σ�
12  with  � �
in  terms  
12 
of  C11  and   C12 . 
(g)  Now,  for  an  isotropic  material,  you  know  that  shear  stress  is   proportional  to  (engineer­
ing  and   tensorial)  shear  strain  via  the  shear  modulus.  Equate  σ�
12  with  � �
in  terms  of  
12 
C44  on   this  basis. 
(h)  Finally, compare (f) and (g) to prove that three  independent  constants in a cubic  material  
reduces  to   two  independent  constants  for  an  isotropic   material,  and give  the  mathemat­
ical   relationship  among   these  three  independent  elastic  constants  C11 ,  C12 ,  and  C44  for 
this  isotropic  approximation. 

5.  Most  metals  are  elastically   anisotropic,   meaning  that  the  measured Young’s  elastic  modulus 
E i jk  depends  on   the  direction  with  respect  to  the  crystal  structure   along  which  load  is   applied. 
This  can  be  expressed   in   terms  of  the  compliance  matrix  S i j  as:  
1
1/E i jk  = S 11  − 2(S 11  − S 12  −  S 44 )(ai1
2
where  this  time  ai j  is  the  direction  cosine  matrix  between  the  unit   cell  crystallographic  di­
rections  [100],  [110],  and   [111]:

so  one  can  compute  E110  and   compare  it  to  E111 ,  for  example.  If  all  E i jk  are  the  same,  that 
material is  elastically  isotropic.  Referring to Table 2.4 (Meyers and Chawla) for  S i j , compute 
E100 , E110 , andE111  as  well  as  the  Zener  anisotropic  elastic  constants   A for  the  following  pairs 
of  materials:  

(a)  Ag   and   Au,  two  FCC  group  11  noble  metals; 
(b)  W and   Mo,  two  BCC  group  6B  heavy  metals.  
(c)  Why do   you  think  these   diﬀer  within  (a)  and  (b)  [i.e.,  same  crystal  class  and  group]; 
and   among (a)  and   (b)?
