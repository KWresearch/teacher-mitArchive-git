1. You make a questionable  back-to-school  purchase: a new pair of  platform-sole  sneak­
ers  that  may  make  you  look a  bit  taller.  Much  to  your  dismay,  your  “friend”  tells   you 
that  when  you  put  them  on   she  can  see  that  the  green  soles   are  compressed  to  about  
half  their  original  height  (i.e.,  half  of  the  thickness  shown  in  Figure   1(a)).  Looking 
from  the  top,  you  can  see  that  your  soles   were  ﬂush  with  the  shoe  upper  before  you 
put  them  on.  However,  under  your  weight,  the  soles   stick  out  about 1 cm  on  each 
side.

wearing. 

(a)  What  is  the  Poisson’s  ratio  of  the  material  from  which  your  sneaker  soles   are 
made? 
(b)  Based  on   this  back-of-the-envelope  calculation,  what  can  you  tell  your  friend 
about  the  likely   composition  and  structure  of  that  material? 

2. You  are  hanging   from a  rope  that is of 4 cm  diameter  and  originally of 6 m  length. 
The rope is  stationary and   clamped  tightly at the  other end. Treat the rope as a square 
spring  (i.e.,  Cartesian  coordinates  are  OK)  of  eﬀective  spring  constant k  = 100 N/m 
and   with  a  Poisson’s  ratio  of  zero.  

(a)  At   the  clamped  end,  at  the  point  halfway  down  the  rope  length,  and  at  the  end 
from  which you’re  hanging,  deﬁne all the  components of the  displacement vec­
tor  u = (ui , u j , uk ). 
(b)  Compute  all   the  components  of  the  small-strain,   small-rotation  strain  tensor  �i j 
at  the  end   from  which  you  are  hanging.

(c)  Compute  the  normal  stress  σii  at  the  same  three  points   of  the  rope  considered 
in   (a). 
(d)  What  do   you  notice  about   the  variation  in  u and in  σii  as  a  function  of  distance 
from  the  clamped  end? 

3.  Concrete,  sometimes  called  “the  ultimate  material,”  has  enabled  impressive  achieve­
ments  in   construction  for  thousands   of  years.  Concrete  is   also  simple  to  make, 
consisting–in  its  simplest  form–of  only  lime  (calcium  oxide),  sand,  gravel,  and  wa­
ter.  An   unfortunate  limitation of  concrete, however, is   that it is far, far  weaker in 
tension  than  in   compression.  In  this  problem,  you  will   develop  a  way  around  this  
limitation.  The  technique  you  will   use,  known  as  pretensioning,  is   commonly  used 
to  create  long  spans  such  as  those  pictured  in  Figure  3.

(a)  Let  us  model  a  concrete  span  as  a  pin-and-roller-anchored  beam  with  a  length  
L  =  6 m,  a  thickness h  =  0.8 m,  and  width w (Figure  3(a)).  The  span  is   loaded 
with  a  distributed  load  q  (force  per  area) of  50 kN/m2 .  Determine  the  values  
and   locations  of  the  maximum  tensile  and  compressive  stresses  in  the  beam.   (It 
may  be  useful  to   construct  shear  and  bending  moment  diagrams).  
(b)  You   have  decided  that  it  is   best  to  allow  no  part   of  the  concrete  span  to  be  in 
a  state  of  tensile  stress.  To  accomplish  this  goal,   you  will   position  steel  bars 
along  the  length  of  the  span  before  pouring  the  concrete.   You  will   then  stretch  
the  bars,  pour  the  concrete  and  allow it  to  harden,  and  release  the  tension  (Figure 
3(b)).  The  released   steel  bars   will   exert  an  axial  compressive  stress  on  the  span 
that  is  superposed  with  the  bending  stresses.   Determine  the  force  per  meter 
of  span  width  to   cancel  the  maximum  tensile  stress  you  calculated previously. 
Assume  that  the  load  created  by  the  steel  bars   is   distributed  evenly  across  the 
cross  section  of  the  span  and  that  the  addition  of  the  bars   does   not  signiﬁcantly 
change  the  cross  section.

steel  rods  to   provide  pretensioning. 

(c) You   are  told  that  the  steel  you  are  using  has a failure  strength  σF  =  400 MPa 
and the  bars have a  diameter of  one  inch. You  wish to avoid failure in the  bars 
with a factor of safety of two.  What is the  maximum  load you  can  allow in 
each  bar?  How  many bars  are  needed  per  meter  of  span  width  to  provide  the 
necessary  compressive  load  that  you  calculated  previously? 

4.  A  spiral  fracture  can  occur  when  long  bones  such  as  the  femur  are  exposed  to  an 
excessive  torsional  load  (Figure  4(a,b)).  The  diaphysis   (middle  portion)  of  the  fe­
mur  consists  of  an  outer  circle  of  dense  cortical  bone  surrounding  a  center  of  much 
weaker  trabecular  (meshlike)  bone.  Biomedical  engineers  have  modeled  the  stronger  
cortical  bone  portion  as  an  annulus,   as  shown in  Figure  4(c).   Let  us  assume  that  this  
annulus has an  outer  diameter of 26 mm and an  inner  diameter of 20 mm, and that the 
diaphysis has a length of 30 cm. The shear modulus of  cortical bone is approximately 
17 GPa. 

(a)  The  maximum  shear  stress  occurs   at  the  surface  of  the  bone.  If  a  shear  stress  
τF  =  60 MPa  will  cause failure  in  cortical  bone,  ﬁnd  the  maximum  torsional

lever  arm of 2 m? 
(b)  If  the  dimensions  of  the  cross  section  (outer  and  inner  diameters)  are  reduced 
by   50%, by   what  percentage is   the  maximum  torsional  load  reduced?
