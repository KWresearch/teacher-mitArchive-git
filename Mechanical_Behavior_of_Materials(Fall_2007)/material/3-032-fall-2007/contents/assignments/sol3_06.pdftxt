1.  In  PS2-4,  you  considered   a  femur  under  a  torsional  load  that  induced  a  spiral  fracture,  ap­
proximating  the  load  as  pure  torsion.  

Figure  1:   Femur  under  pure  torsional  loading  T . 

(a)  Draw  a  representative  in-plane  element  from  the  outermost  surface  of  the  femur  diaph­
ysis.  The  femur  is  idealized  as  an  annular  cylinder  of  uniform  diameter  subjected  to  a 
pure  torque  T  (Figure   1).  Indicate  all  the  normal  and  shear  stresses  σi j  acting  on  that 
material  volume  element,  expressed  only  as  a  function  of  T . 

Solution:  τ12  = -τo  = Tr/J. Using the  values of r and J calculated in  PS2-4, τo  = (4.46  
x 105 /m3 )T . 

(b)  Construct  Mohr’s  circle  of  stress  to  identify  the  average  normal  stress  σavg  in  the  bone.  

Solution:  Since  there  is  only  a  shear  stress,  the  only  point  on  Mohr’s  circle  is   the  black 
spot   shown   at (σii  = 0,  τi j  = -τo ),  the  magnitude  of  which is   given  in  (a).

(c)  Draw  the  orientation   of  the  representative  material  element  (indicate  magnitude  of  θ p s ) 
and give  the  magnitudes of  the  principal  normal  stresses  σ1  and  σ2 ,  assuming  a  critical 
torsional  load  F of 67 N for a  moment  arm of 2 m. 
Solution: From   the  same  Mohr’s  circle, it is   clear  that 2θ p s  = 90◦ ,  so  θ p s  = 45◦  and  the 
magnitudes  of   the  principal  stresses  are  σ1  = τ and  σ2  = -τ.  The  magnitude  of  τo  is  60  
MPa  for  this F and  moment  arm (T  = F d). 

(d)  Compare/contrast  this  ﬁnding  with  what  is   observed  for  the  principal  stress  state  and 
maximum shear state for the same bone subjected to  uniaxial  compression with a mag­
nitude  σ11  = σ1  = 60 MPa. 

Solution:  In  uniaxial  compression  of  the  same  stress   magnitude,  the  maximum  shear  
stress  is  only  σ1 /2,  or  30   MPa.  Interestingly,  there  is   no  plane  of  pure  shear  under  
uniaxial  compression,  though.  You  can  see  this  by  noting  that   the  Mohr’s  circle  is  not 
centered  at   zero, but   at   σ1 /2.

2.  Thin  ﬁlms  used  in   microelectronics  can  develop  considerable  internal   strain  when  they  are 
deposited  onto  a  substrate  of  a  diﬀerent  material.  The  two  materials   may  have  diﬀerent  unit 
cell  lattice  parameters  and/or  may  have  diﬀerent  coeﬃcients   of  thermal  expansion,  and   the 
thin  ﬁlm  is  forced   to   take  on   the  lateral  dimensions  of  the  substrate  to  which  it  is   adhered. 
This  strain  can  lead   to   substrate-ﬁlm  curvature  (Figure  2).   The  midplane  of  such  thin  ﬁlms 
is  often  approximated as being in a  state of  in-plane  normal  strain in cylindrical  coordinates: 
�rθ  = 0; �rr  = �θθ  = �o  − κz 
where  �o  is  an  isotropic  extension  of  the  substrate  (and  the  ﬁlm),  κ  is   the  curvature  of   the 
ﬁlm/substrate,  and   z  is  the  distance  from  the  ﬁlm  neutral  axis  (its  midplane). 

Figure  2:  Top:  Substrate  before  deposition;  Bottom:  Substrate  and  thin  ﬁlm  after  deposition  (the 
actual  curvature  may  be  in   the  opposite  direction  depending  on  the  mismatch  between  lattice  pa­
rameters  and  thermal  expansion   coeﬃcients).  

(a)  In  a  scientiﬁc  programming  language  of  your  choice,   write  a  program  that  can  be  used 
to   determine  the  normal  strain  � x� x�  and  engineering  shear  strain  � x� y�  on  the  (thin  ﬁlm  
material)  plane  oriented  at  an  angle  θ with  respect  to  your  original  coordinate  system 
( x, y). Your  program  must  report:  
i.  � x� x�  and   engineering   shear  strain  � x� y�  for a given  θ 
ii.  principal  strains  �1  and  �2  and  the  material  volume  element  orientation  θ pe 
iii.  maximum  in-plane  shear  strain	 � x� y� ,ma x  and  the  corresponding  material  volume 
element   orientation   θ pe,ma x 
iv.  average  normal  strain  �avg 
Note:  Mathematica,  Matlab,  Maple, C++, and Fortran90  are excellent  choices to build  
this  program.  Practice  with  Mathematica  will   beneﬁt  you  in  future  lab  experiment 
analyses, so  here’s a good excuse to  brush up (available on 
However,  a  brute-
MIT Server).
force  execution  in   Excel  is   acceptable  as  a  last  resort.  In  all  cases,  you  must  provide 
the  program  and   indicate  the  embedded  equations  with  your  problem  set   solution.

Solution:  These  equations  were  covered  in  lecture. 

(b)  Assume  all   the  strain  at  the  midplane  of  a  Ge  ﬁlm  deposited  on  a  Si  substrate  comes 
from  a  mismatch   of  the  unit  cell  lattice  parameters  a  of  those  two  materials.  Compute 
that  strain. 

Solution: From   www.matweb.com, the  lattice parameters of Si and Ge  can be  obtained. 
aS i  = 0.54  nm;  aGe  = 0.57   nm.  Thus,  the  extensional  strain  �o  in  Ge  can  be  calculated  
from   the  diﬀerence  in   lattice  parameters  (engineering  strain  is   the  typical  form): 
�o  = (aS i  − aGe )/aGe 
which is  -0.053  or  5.3%  compressive  strain.  

(1) 

(c)  Is  the  ﬁlm  in   a  state  of  tensile  or  compressive  strain,  and  will   the  ﬁlm/substrate  system 
show  positive  (smile)  or  negative  (frown)  curvature? 

Solution:  To  place  the  ﬁlm  under  compressive  strain,  a  force  must  be  applied  at  the 
interface  that  is  equivalent  to  a  compressive  force  applied  to  the  midpoint  of  the  ﬁlm 
plus  a  negative  moment.  The  curvature  is   therefore  also  negative. 

(d)  Assume  the  ﬁlm  is  500  nm  in  thickness  and  that  you  have  measured  the  radius   of  curva­
ture  ρ of  the  ﬁlm/substrate  system  as  10 km,   the  resolution  of  laser-based  instruments 
used  to   measure  wafer  curvature.  What  is   the  in-plane  normal  strain  �rr  = �θθ ? 

Solution: 

�rr  = �θθ  = �o  − κz 
(2) 
The  curvature  component  κz  contributes  only  (250  nm)/(10  km)  = 2.5 x 10−8  [unitless], 
so  the  strain  in   this  case  is  due  mostly  to  the  lattice  parameter  mismatch (5.6%). 

(e)  This  strain  state  is  the  principal   strain  state.  How  do  you  know  this? 

Solution: There are no shear strains present, so by  deﬁnition this is the  principal strain  
state. 

(f)  Assume a  Cartesian  coordinate  system is a fair  approximation in the plane  strain   state 
of  the  ﬁlm  (i.e.,  �rr  = �θθ  = �1  = �2 ).  Use  your  program  to  determine  the  orientation and  
magnitude   of  maximum  in-plane   shear  strain  in  the  Ge  ﬁlm.  

Solution: Your program,  using  the  equations of  Mohr’s  circle  for  the  plane  strain  case, 
would  tell  you   that  the  maximum  in  plane  shear  strain  is   0%  because  �1  = �2 .  However, 
Mohr’s  circle  would  tell  you  that   the  maximum  shear  strain  exists  in  the  1-3  and  2-3 
planes,  and  is  equal  to   � xy,ma x  =  (1/2)5.3%  =  2.7%,  at  an  orientation  with  respect  to 
the  original   axes  of   45◦ .  This  maximum  shear  strain  is   equal  to  the  radius  of  Mohr’s 
circle  showing  strain in   all 3  axes.

(g) If the principal strain state of a thicker piece of Ge were not in an  equibiaxial strain state 
as  described  above, but   instead a  random  biaxial  strain  state  (e.g., 2�1  = �2 ; �3  = 0),  use 
Mohr’s  circle  to   determine  the  magnitude  of  maximum  shear  strain  and  the  plane  of  
the  ﬁlm  on   which  that  shear  strain  would  be  (1–2,  1–3,  or  2–3).  You  can  assume  the 
3-direction  to   be  through  the  ﬁlm  thickness. 

Solution:  The  magnitude  of  the  maximum  shear  is   equal  to  the  radius  of  Mohr’s  circle, 
or  �1 .  This  is  on   the  plane  represented  by  the  two  points   at  the  diameter  of  this  circle, 
or  the  2-3  plane. 

3. A beam of 2000 mm2  cross-sectional area is   composed of two pieces of wood glued  together 
along  a  plane  at  an  angle  θ  with  the  beam  axis  (Figure  3).   It  has  been  found  from  previ­
ous experiments  that  the  joint  will fail at 20 MPa  and 10 MPa  normal  and  shear  stresses, 
respectively, and the wood at 56 MPa and 28 MPa  normal and  shear  stresses,   respectively. 
Determine  the  maximum  allowable  axial  load  that  the  bar  can  carry  with a  safety factor of  
two  and  the  corresponding  value  of  the  angle  θ.

Solution:  The  maximum  load P and  angle  θ are  found  by  solving  the  equations

cos2 θ = 20 MPa 

cos  θ sin  θ = 10 MPa 

to  give P  = 25 kN,  θ = 26.6◦ . 

Late  addition:  one  of   your  colleagues   came  up  with  an  elegant  way  to  visualize  the  solution. 
To  maximize  the  load,  we  seek  the  largest   Mohr’s  circle  that   stays   inside  the σ  =  20 MPa, 
τ  =  10 MPa  limitation.  Since  the  load  is   uniaxial,  the  circle  must  pass  through  the  point 
(0,0).   The  angle is  calculated by  trigonometry to be 26.6◦  and  the  maximum  axial   stress  to 
be 25 MPa (resulting in a  maximum  load of 25 kN).  

4.  In  1654,  the  German  scientist  Otto  von  Guericke  performed  an  experiment   for  Emperor 
Ferdinand   III  to   demonstrate  the  nature  of  atmospheric  pressure.  Guernicke  connected   two 
copper  bowls  with  an  outer  diameter  D of  14  in,  pumped  out  the  air  between  them,  and  tried 
to  pull   them  apart  with  two  teams   of  eight   horses   each  (Figure  4).   The  horses   were  unable 
to  separate  the  bowls. 

(a)  Assuming  that  Guernicke’s  pump  was  capable   of  removing  75%   of  the  air  from  the  as­
sembly  and   idealizing  the  connected  bowls   as  a  sphere  with  a  wall  thickness  of  0.4  cm, 
what  was  the  maximum  normal  stress  in  the  copper  bowls   before  the  horses   started 
pulling?

Figure  4:  Otto   von   Guericke’s  experiment   with  two  connected  copper  bowls,  a  vacuum  pump,  and 
two  teams  of  horses  [http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/eugeniik/history/guericke.html]. 

Solution:  The  pressure  on   the  sphere  is   0.75  atm  = 76 kPa.  The  maximum  normal  stress 
in   the  copper  bowls  is 
(−76 kPa)(0.178 m)

(b)  Using a failure  stress  σF  for  copper  in  compression  of  370 MPa,  how  thin  in  theory 
could  the  copper bowls be  made  without failure?  If  this value  seems   impractical, ex­
plain  why using  the  terminology  and  concepts  of  3.032.

Solution:  The  minimum  thickness  is 

t  =

2σF 
If  the  bowls  were  perfectly  hemispherical  and  subject  to  no  other   loads  than  a  uniform 
pressure,  this  vessel  could in  theory  withstand a pressure diﬀerential  of  0.75  atm.  How­
ever,  any  deviations  from   sphericity   (such  as  dents)  or  deﬂections  from  lateral  forces 
would change the geometry (invalidating the pressure  vessel  assumptions),  induce  non-
axial  loads  such  as  bending  moments,  and  probably  cause  the  bowls  to buckle  when 
vacuum  is  applied. 

(c)  Assume that the bowls are not  hemispheres but  rather two  identical  shells of revolution 
of  y = (7 in) sin [ xπ/(14  in)] for  x between 0 and 14  inches with axis of revolution  x  = 7 
inches.  The  bowls  are  sealed  at  the  joint  with  epoxy  (Figure  5).   The  wall  thickness   is 
0.4  cm  and   the  interior  is  75%  evacuated  as  before.  What  is   the  actual  shape  of   the 
stress  distribution  σ( x),  and  what  is   its   average  value? 

Solution:  The  shape  of   the  bowls  does  not  aﬀect  the  total  load  at  the  joint,  which  is 
still  πr2 p.  The  only  diﬀerence  is   that   the  bowls  are  joined  at  an  angle  of  114.6◦  (2 rad)
