Fall 2006

Due:  Start of lecture, 10/27/06


1.  The  potential  energy   between  ions   can  be  expressed  as  an  equation  from  which  the  equi­
librium  spacing   between  ions  ro  and  the  binding  energy  between  ions   Ub  can  be  deter­
mined.  Here,  you  will  compare  these  quantities  as  determined  from  the  functional  form 
U (r)  =  U (r)attractive  + U (r)re pul sive  and  from  your  graphical  representation  of  U (r) for  the 
following  Lennard-Jones  potential  approximation  of  an  fcc  metal  crystal: 
U (r)attractive  = −1.45/r6 
U (r)re pul sive  = 6.5 x10−6/r12

(a)  From  manipulation  of  the  above  equations,   determine  ro  as  the  inter-ion  distance  at 
which  U (r) is  a  minimum  value. 
(b)  From  manipulation  of  the  above  equations,   determine  Ub  as  the  binding  energy  at  the 
equilibrium  spacing  ro . 
(c)  Graph  U (r) and   compare  the  values  you  estimate   from  this  graph  to  those  calculated 
through  evaluation   of  the  above  equations.  

Note that use of  Mathematica or a similar  program is   encouraged for this  analysis of a simple 
U (r),  and   this  will  be  helpful  for  your  consideration  of  U (r) in  Lab  2.  Note  also  that  the 
units  of  the  coeﬃcients  and   of  r  are  not  given  here,   and  often  are  omitted  because  they  are 
normalized   by   the  magnitude  of  Ub  and  ro . In  other words, it is   often  implied but  not  stated  
that  you  are  really  considering  U (r/ro )/Ub . 

SOLUTION:  Using  Mathematica  to  graph  this  function,  we  can  state:  which produces  the 

following graphs: 

Figure 1:   U (r) and  corresponding  derivatives.  

so the  (normalized) ro is  about  0.144 and the  (normalized) Ub is   about  80,000.  Derivatives 
of  the  power  functions  of   r  necessarily  yields  the  same  results. 

2.  As  noted  in   lecture,  pseudo/superelasticity  results  from  an  austenite/martensite  phase  trans­
formation  under  stress.  The  magnitude  of  the  reversible  strain  is   on  the  order  of  the  strain   in­
duced  when  the  austenite  phase  transforms   to  the  martensite  phase. For  pseudoelastic  AuZn, 
the  martensite  phase   has  been   reported  to  be  an  ordered  fcc  of  lattice  parameter  a = 0.42 nm  
(with Zn in   the (0, 1/2, 1/2) lattice  positions),  and  the  austenite  phase  is   body  centered  tetrag­
onal  of  lattice  parameters  a = 0.33  nm  and  c = 0.70  nm  (with  Zn  in  the  body  centered  lattice 
position).

Explain  the  mechanism  of  pseudoelasticity,  and  predict  the  maximum  reversible  strain   you 
would expect to   observe in   this  alloy under a  full cycle of  uniaxial  tension  (loading  such  that 
→ 
all  austenite  martensite,  then  unloading  to  σ11  = 0).

SOLUTION:  The  maximum  strain  would  be  obtained  if  all  the  austenite  unit   cells   trans­
formed  to   martensite,  so  the  strain  would  be  computed  as  that   associated  with  the  change  in 
the  volume  of   the  unit  cell.  One  could  consider   the  maximum  uniaxial  strain  as  a  maximum 
(reasonable),  and  this  can   be  calculated  in  terms  of  engineering  strain: 
0.7 − 0.42nm 
ΔL 
0.42nm

L 
which  exceeds  the  lateral   contraction  of  the  unit   cell  (21.4%  strain). 


= 66.6%

3.  Consider a  viscoelastic  model  that  consists of a  spring (E1 ) in  parallel  with  a  Maxwell   ele­
ment (E2 , η for a spring and   dashpot in  series).  The  springs   are  purely  elastic and the dashpot 
is  purely  viscous. 

(a)  Draw  a  schematic  of  this  model.   What  is   its   eﬀective  stiﬀness  at  high  strain  rates?  At 
low  strain  rates? 

SOLUTION:  As  discussed  at  recitation,  at  high  strain  rates  dashpots  act  like  rigid 
connections  (springs  act   like  springs  no  matter  what  the  strain  rate  is).   At  early  times 
and  high  strain  rates  the  eﬀective  stiﬀness   is   therefore  E1  + E2 .  Conversely,  at  long 
times  and  low  strain  rates  dashpots  act  as  though  they  aren’t  even  connected.  Under 
these  conditions  the  eﬀective  stiﬀness is E1 . 

(b)  Derive  the  constitutive  relationship  for  this  model,   expressing  the  equation  in  a  form 
that  includes  strain  and   its  time  derivative  on  one  side  of  the  equation  and  stress  and   its 
time  derivative  on   the  other. 

SOLUTION:  Let  us  divide  the  model   into  two  branches (1 and  2) and  further  divide  the 
Maxwell  branch into  2D   and  2S.  The  stress-strain  relationships   for  these  branches   are 

ε = ε1  = ε2  = ε2D  + ε2S 

σ = σ1  + σ2  = σ1  + σ2D  = σ1  + σ2S

The  stress-strain  relationships  for  the  individual  components  are 

σ1
E1 
σ2D
η 
σ2S
E2

By  manipulating  these  equations  (start  by  writing  ε˙ = ε˙ 2D  + ε˙ 2S ),  we  obtain


ε˙ 2D  = 

ε1  = 

ε2S  = 

η(E1  + E2 ) ˙ε + E1 E2ε = ησ˙ + E2σ 

(c)  Sketch   the  response  of  the  model  for  a  constant  stress  applied  at  t1  and  released  a  long  
time  later  at  t2 .  Assume  (arbitrarily)  that  E1  = 2E2 . 

SOLUTION: 

(d)  What  characteristics  of  creep  does   this  model  simulate  that  are  not  available  with   the 
Maxwell  model? With the Kelvin-Voight  model?  Are  there any disadvantages of   this  
three-element  model?  

SOLUTION:  This  model  predicts  an  asymptotic  limit  to  deformation  at  very  long   peri­
ods,  which is  appropriate  for  modeling  solids;  the  Maxwell  model   predicts  continually 
increasing   deformation  for  any  stress   input.  This  model   also  predicts  an  immediate 
elastic  deformation, a  feature  not  available  with  the Kelvin-Voight  model. 
Some  limitations  of   the  standard linear  solid  model   are  that   it  only  allows   ﬁrst-order 
transient  solutions,  it   can   not  accommodate   permanent  deformation,  and  it  predicts  
that  loading  and  unloading  responses  will  be  perfectly   symmetric,  which  may  not  be 
the  case  for  an   actual  material.  

4.  There is very  little  information available on  wikipedia.org about the  viscoelasticity that char­
acterizes  the  mechanical  behavior  of  polymers.  A  cursory  search  indicates  the  following 
stubs:

•	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscoelasticity 
•	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin-Voigt   material 
•	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell  material 
•	 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer 
Your  task,  individually  and   as  a  class,  is   to  modify  existing  articles   and  create  new  articles 
that  describe  the  concepts  covered  in  lecture  (and  beyond)  as  clearly,  accurately,  and  inter­
estingly   as  possible.  This  is  supposed  to  be  interactive  and  the  article(s)  will   get  better  as 
everyone  contributes.  The  credit  for  this  problem  will   be  as  follows: 
•	 66%  from  the  material  you  personally  edit/create,  turned  in  as  a  hard  copy of  the  his­
tory  comparison  of  the  previous  version  and  your  new  version,  every  time  you  edit  the 
document.  To  do   this,  you  will   have  to  create  one  new  wiki  account  on  any computer  
(please  use  your  MIT  user  name  as  your  login  “name”),   and  sign  on  using  this  account  
every  time  you   edit  any  wiki  pages  from  any computer.  That  way,  we  can  also  compare 
versions  as  the  articles  evolve. 
•	 33%  for  the  total  quality   of  the  contributions   to  wikipedia   that  you  as  the  2006  3.032 
class  have  made  through  your  additions  of  material  related  to  viscoelasticity. 

It  does  not  matter  if  you  modify  these  pages   or  decide  to  create  a  new  article  that  you  all 
work on. You can add graphs, images, text, and  equations. If you have not  contributed much  
to  wikis yet,  there is a  helpful FAQ at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Editing  FAQ. If  
you  contribute early on, you’ll have the most chance to shape the site but the least to work 
with; if you wait too long to get   started, you will have to work harder to think of creative and 
accurate  ways  to   add   to   the  site.  Remember  that  citations  in  your  own  academic work 
should  NOT  come  from  wikipedia,  because  it  is  not  rigorously  peer-reviewed  and  is 
only as accurate as the last person who edited the page. Have  fun! 

SOLUTION: The  content, range, and depth of the pages made to the wikis over the course of 
the  week  was  impressive.  Several  of  you  noticed  that   others in  the  world  were “helping”  with  
the  process,  making  their  own   changes  and  suggesting  moving  of  articles   from  one  place  to 
another.  Some of   the  content   was  correct but  incomplete  or  out of  context.  For example, 
viscoelasticity is  one example of  anelasticity,  or  nonlinear  elasticity, but it is   not  the  only 
example and is not  considered a real  synonym.  Also, there was a nice  start on how to  measure 
viscoelastic responses, but it’s  incomplete and  those are no longer the preferred approaches. 
I’ll  update  these  pages  as  time  allows,  and  I’m  sure others will  do  the  same.  Overall, though, 
you did an outstanding job and provided valuable information and education to the world 
by creating accurate wiki content.
