1. 	 Here, we will analyze the stress states of a solid block of aluminum under various 
loading conditions using the Mohr’s Circle construction.  We will use the following 
convention to describe the different components of stress: 

z 

σzz 

τzx 

τxz 

τzy 

τyz 

τxy 

τyx 

σyy 

y 

σxx 

x 

For each of the following situations, describe the stress state in terms of a stress 
matrix σij.  Determine the principal normal and shear stresses and give the 
orientation of the principal axes as well as the orientation of the max shear stress.  

(a)  One very popular application of aluminum is for use as thin films for metallization 
layers in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication.  In the case of thin-films (or other thin 
geometries), where one of the dimensions of the material is much smaller than the 
other two, the stress acting through the smaller dimension is negligible and can be 
neglected during analysis.  This case, where the stresses acting on one of the 
orthogonal planes is zero, is known as plane stress.  Let us assume that the thickness 
dimension of the Al thin-film is along the z-direction (parallel to the x-y plane), so 
that the plane stress condition is σzz = τxz = τyz = 0. 

During a bend test of the Al thin film, a point on the surface of the film was found to 
have high stresses.  It was decided that this point of the thin film would be further 
analyzed. The stresses on the film, with respect to the coordinate system shown 

1 

above, were found to be σxx = 95MPa, σyy = 25MPa, and τxy = 20MPa.  Determine all 
of the information stated in the problem (in bold italics) and note the value of the 
maximum normal stress.   

(b) 	 Aluminum is also used in electrical transmission 
lines for power distribution.  In order to assess the 
mechanical integrity of the lines, the lines are 
loaded in uniaxial tension. It is observed that the 
lines permanently deform at an applied uniaxial 
stress of 20 MPa. In addition to the requirements 
in bold font (σij, magnitude and orientation of 
principal/max shear stress states), also draw the 
orientation of the material representative volume 
element (here, a plane) that is under maximum 
shear stress.  Assume the following orientation 
and axis-set for the Al lines loaded in tension:

loaded under uniaxial force F. 

(c) 	 One common forming process for aluminum parts is known as extrusion.  In the 
extrusion process, a billet of material is forced through a die in order to obtain a 
workpiece with the desired cross-sectional geometry.  One type of extrusion process 
is known as hydrostatic extrusion.  Unlike many 
extrusion operations, where pressure to the billet is 
supplied by a hydraulically-driven ram or pressing stem, 
the pressure in hydrostatic extrusion is supplied through 
an incompressible fluid medium surrounding the billet 
(see Figure 1b below).  Hydrostatic extrusion is a very 
popular operation for ductile materials such as aluminum 
due to its ability to reduce defects in the extruded part 
through the compressive environment.  Typical pressures 
exerted on the workpiece are around 1400 MPa.

extrusion process   

Write the stress state of a representative volume element 
of the Al billet inside of the extruder under the 
hydrostatic pressure of 1400 MPa (noted by the grid
region in Fig. 1b), and determine all other information 
requested in bold font. 

2. You are responsible for performing uniaxial tensile tests on three very different 
materials:  a 316 stainless steel alloy, alumina (Al2O3), and high density polyethylene 
(HDPE).  However, before performing the actual tests, you are asked to predict what the 
elastic stress vs. strain responses of each of the materials based on the mechanical 

2 

properties of these materials documented in the literature (e.g., material property 
databases such as matweb.com, linked on the MIT Server).   

(a) Graph the stress [MPa] versus strain [%] response for all three materials on a single 
graph and on 3 separate graphs, up to an applied strain value of .01 (or 1%) in strain 
increments of 0.0005.   

(b) Remark on the differences in behaviors seen for each of the three materials as related 
to their relevant mechanical properties.  Also, looking at the magnitude of the stresses at 
the maximum applied strain, do you expect all of these materials to deform elastically up 
to these strains?  If not, what was the fallacy in solely using Hooke’s law to predict the 
stress-strain behaviors for each of the materials?

 (c) All three samples were given to you as cylinders with identical initial dimensions of 
10 cm length and 2 cm diameter. Show whether a uniaxial load frame of maximum load 
capability = 100 kN (like the ones you used to crush the beverage cans in Lab 1) will be 
sufficient to deform all three materials to the requested engineering normal strain of 1%. 
Here, neglect the possibility that the materials might not remain intact to that strain. 

3. You and your labmate have been given a joint project by your UROP advisor. He has 
asked you both to measure all the elements of the stiffness tensor Cijkl of two new 
proteins he has crystallized and is considering for use in a flexible, organic integrated 
circuit that must withstand mechanical bending. 

Another student has already used x-ray diffraction to determine the crystal structure of 
the proteins: protein A exhibits a tetragonal unit cell, whereas protein B exhibits an 
orthorhombic unit cell. Your labmate says, “Let's each measure the elastic constants Cijkl 
of one protein. Which one do you want to analyze, protein A or B?'” 

Fig. 3: Unit cells for (a) tetragonal and (b) 
orthorhombic crystals. 

Under the assumption that you'd like to spend as little time as possible on this project so 
you can get back to your 3.032 studies, what is your answer? Explain concisely, but as 
fully and accurately as possible, using the elasticity concepts discussed in 3.032.
