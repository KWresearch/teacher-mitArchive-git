1.  	 A microelectronic sensor is to be made of conductive wires deposited on a thin Si wafer.  
During design considerations, it was decided that only metals having cubic symmetry were 
to be used as fibers (metallic wires) in this composite sensor.  Another design criterion for 
the sensor is that the fibers of the sensor do not undergo any elastic (true) normal or shear 
strains >  0.1% and 0.01%, respectively, when subjected to a given stress state. (We will 
assume plane stress since the device is very thin.)

Figure 1:  Orientation of composite sensor with respect to 
original loading conditions 

(a)  The fibers in the sensor are subjected to an initial plane stress state, given below, with 
respect to the orientation seen in Fig. 1.  Determine the stress state on the fibers by resolving 
the original stress state onto an axis-set aligned with the fibers (instead of aligned with the 
applied stress state σij as shown in Fig. 1). 

Solution:  In order to resolve the original stress onto the orientation of the fibers, we need to 
rotate our original axes 40° in the clockwise direction.  If we use a Mohr’s Circle 
construction, this is the same as an 80° rotation in the same direction.  This transformation 
is shown below where the solid line with blue endpoints represents the original stress state 
and the dotted line with green endpoints represents the new stress state:

In order to calculate our new stress state after the rotation, we need to determine the 
average stress (center of circle) and the radius: 

σavg  = (130 + 80) / 2 = 105MPa

Next, we want to find the angle between our new stress state and the σ-axis so that we can 
calculate our new stress state through geometry of Mohr’s circle.  To determine this angle 
(labeled β, green line) we can subtract the total angle of rotation (θ=80°, red line) by the 
angle between the original stress state and the σ-axis (labeled α, blue line). This last angle 
is the same as the orientation of principal normal stresses as we have seen before and can 
be calculated as follows:

(b)  Given the elastic compliance constants for various cubic crystals (see Hosford Table 2.2. 
below), calculate the complete strain tensor εij for the stress state you determined in part 
(a) for all of the metallic and organic materials from which we might make these fibers 
(writing a small program would be ideal here!). Identify the metals that satisfy the design 
criterion that the fibers do not undergo elastic normal strains (εii) equal or greater than 
0.1% or true shear strains (εij) equal to or greater than 0.01%. (Note:  The units of sij are 
given in (TPa)-1 = 1x10-12 Pa-1).

Solution:  Looking at our stress state we see that σx=σ1=56.4MPa, σy= σ2=153.6MPa, and 
σxy= σ6=16.8MPa.  Knowing that s11=s22, s21=s12, s44=s66 for cubic crystals we can 
calculate each of the elements of strain through the equations given below.  Note: the first 
equation is written out in its entirety for the reader to see how each of the strain values are 
calculated.  The next three are the condensed versions which taken into account the terms 
that become zero (either because there is no applied stress in a certain direction or the 
value of sij is zero due to crystal symmetry). 
ε1  = s11 σ1  + s12 σ 2  + s13 σ3  + s14σ4  + s15 σ5  + s16σ6

eliminating zero terms

Using the last three equations we can calculate the total normal and shear strains of the 
fibers made out of each of the various cubic metallic materials given in Table 2.2. We 
eliminate the materials from Si to GaAs (as listed in the chart) because they are non ­
metallic materials. Here is a table of the results (values rounded to three decimal places):

Therefore, considering our design criterions for total strain, the only materials that are 
possible candidates as metallic fibers in our microelectronic sensor are Cr, Mo, W and C.  
One should observe how small carbon’s compliance values are compared to the metallic 
materials.  This is the reason why carbon is popularly used as fiber reinforcements to 
increase the strength of composite materials which tend to have matrixes made up of very 

compliant materials (such as in our example where it can be seen that Si has relatively high 
sij values compared to the other materials). 

2. 	 Atomic interactions can be modeled using a variety of potential energy approximations.  
One very common potential form is the Lennard-Jones 6:12 potential: 

⎡ σ 12  σ 6 ⎤
⎛

( )  = 4  ⎢⎜
−
⎥ 
⎟

⎣ r

⎠ 
⎝
⎠ 
⎢⎝
⎥⎦

where σ and ε are constants specific to a given material (note: they are NOT equivalent to 
stress and strain, but this is the standard notation for the L-J parameters).  The parameters σ 
and ε are related to the equilibrium bond length and the bond strength, respectively. Here, r 
is the interatomic spacing given in units of Angstroms (1 Angstrom = 10 nm = 10-10 m), and 
U(r) is given in units of eV/atom. 

A molecular dynamics simulation was performed by Zhang et al. [1]  to study the properties 
of Al thin films in which the authors proposed a Lennard-Jones potential of the form above 
to model Al-Al interactions.  The values used for the material parameters were:  ε = 0.368 
and σ = 2.548 (we’ve rounded off the values in the paper for your pset).  

(a) What are the assumed units of σ and ε in Zhang et al’s potential for aluminum? 

(b)  Using the given material parameters and the form of the interatomic potential energy curve, 
plot U(r) for aluminum from r = 0 to 3.5 Angstroms in increments of <0.25 Angstroms.  
Tips: 
i. We strongly suggest you use a scientific programming language such as Mathematica, 
Matlab, or Maple  here to graph and take derivatives of U(r), as this will be a big help in 
prep for Lab 2. If you didn’t take 3.016 or use this in another class, now is your chance to 
learn – e.g., by working with a classmate who did. You must include your own program and 
output in the pset, of course, not a duplicate of someone else’s program. 
ii. Since r =0 will give you an error, use a very low value for your starting point instead, 
i.e., r=0.001 A. 
iii. In order to make your graph more readable, you may want to adjust the scale of your 
axes so that it only emphasizes the points around the equilibrium interatomic spacing, ro. 

Solution:  Using Excel, the following plot of U(r) was generated.  The scale of the x-axis 
was set so that it ranged from 2.25 to 4 angstroms, while the scale of the y-axis was set so 
that it ranged from -0.4 to 1eV in increments of 0.2eV.

(c) 	 Determine the equation for and graph the interatomic forces F as a function of interatomic 
separation r for Al over the same range of r used in part (a), indicating units of F(r).  Also, 
analytically and graphically determine the equilibrium interatomic spacing, ro.  Mark this 
point on both the graphs produced in parts (a) and (b).  

Solution:  The interatomic forces between atoms can be determined from the interatomic 
potential energy function given the relationship:  
∂U
∂r 
Taking the derivative of the Lennard-Jones 6:12 form of U(r) with respect to r gives the

R (Angstrom) 

The equilibrium interatomic spacing can be determined by setting F(r) equal to zero and 
solving for r (this can be easily done using a computer program or a graphing calculator). 
Doing this, one obtains an equilibrium interatomic spacing of ro=2.86 Angstroms (0.286 
nm). This point is marked as a red dot on both the graphs for parts (a) and (b).  Notice that 
the equilibrium interatomic spacing corresponds to the minimum point on the potential 
energy curve U(r), whereas this corresponds to the zero point on the interatomic force curve 
F(r).   

(d) 	 Compare this equilibrium interatomic spacing to the literature value of atomic radius for 
aluminum, and from that comparison explain what you think Zhang et al. assumed in 
choosing the constants σ and ε that made ro come out this way. 

Solution: This is exactly twice the atomic radius of Al (0.143 nm). Zhang et al. actually 
chose the LJ constants so that this equilibrium  interatomic spacing would reflect the 
interatomic distances in the close-packed or <110> direction of this fcc metal. 

(e) 	 Figure 2 below shows interatomic energy curves [V(r) = our U(r)] for Mg that were 
calculated by Chavarria [2] (squares) and McMahan et al. [3] (dotted and solid curve). 
These data are shown in “arbitrary units” or “a.u.” which is typical of computational / 
experimental results that have funny units, but r turns out to be expressed in ~2 x Angstroms 
(i.e., 9 a.u. = 4.5 Angstroms).  Comparing these curves with that calculated in part (a) for 
Al, would you expect magnesium to have a lower or higher elastic modulus than aluminum? 
Is this confirmed by the literature values of elastic properties of Al and Mg? Hint:  One can 
compare the shape or curvature of the Al and Mg potential energy curves by normalizing 
energies by the minimum or binding energy Ub or (U/Ub) and distances by ro or (r/ro). 

Figure 2:  Interatomic potential for magnesium 
as calculated by Chavarria [2] (squares) and 
McMahan et al. [3] (dotted and solid cuve). 

Solution:  From consideration of the atomistic basis for linear (small strain) elasticity we 
derived the following relationship in class: 

∂ 2U 
E = ∂r 2 
ro 
where the term in the numerator represents the curvature of the interatomic potential 
energy curve at r = ro, and the term in the denominator represents the interatomic 
equilibrium spacing.  Thus, if and only if we assume the U(r) of two materials had the same 
curvature at the energy minimum, we see that a larger equilibrium interatomic spacing 
leads to a smaller elastic (or Young’s) modulus. Since magnesium is seen to have an 
equilibrium interatomic spacing of about 3 Angstroms (0.32 nm) which is larger that 
calculated for aluminum ( ro=2.8 A or 0.28 nm), we would expect magnesium to have a 
smaller elastic modulus (i.e.,  magnesium is more compliant than aluminum).  The increase 
in equilibrium interatomic spacing can be attributed to the fact that Mg has a much lower 
density compared to Al, which in turn means larger interatomic separations between atoms.  
In fact, if we look up the actual values for Young’s modulus using MatWeb we find the 
moduli of aluminum and magnesium to be 68 GPa and 44 GPa, respectively.  This is a 
pretty significant difference for two elements which lie right next to each other on the 
periodic table and have essentially the same melting temperatures!!! 

(f) 	 Again, considering the relationship between the Young’s modulus and the equilibrium 
interatomic spacing and U(r) curvature, what effect do you think temperature has on the 
Young’s modulus?  Provide a conceptual explanation of your answer. (Hint:  Think about 
what happens to atoms inside of a material as you heat it up) 

Solution:  As temperature increases, atomic vibrations are caused which cause the 
equilibrium spacing between atoms to increase.  Since the Young’s modulus decreases with 
increasing equilibrium spacing, an increase in temperature causes the elastic modulus to 
decrease.  To see this another way, we can also note that the modulus is proportional to the 
slope of the interatomic force, F(r), curve. Taking our calculated F(r) graph for aluminum, 
we see that if we move our original equilibrium spacing from ro=2.86 A to a higher value 
’ = 3.1 A), the slope of the curve greatly decreases which represents a decrease 
(let’s say ro
in the elastic modulus. Additionally, the atoms will vibrate more about this ro, which means 
that the curvature at the bottom of the U(r) well will be decreased (the well gets wider), so

the 2nd derivative of U(r), which is directly proportional to E,  will decrease. Physically, the 
resistance to bond stretching decreases as the well curvature decreases. 

3. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) or PDMS is a crosslinked elastomer that is commonly used to build 
optical/electronic/biomedical devices via soft lithography (borrowing from microelectronics 
processing approaches to make flexible, patterned surfaces). The glass transition temperature of 
pure PDMS is -120oC, and crosslinking can be induced by exposure to UV light. 

At molecular weights on the order of 106 g/mol or degree of polymerization (DP) ~ 60, PDMS is 
said to exhibit a viscoelastic response with Young’s elastic modulus E reported to be about 2 
MPa for short times / high strain rates. At very low molecular weights (<102 g/mol) or DP, 
PDMS acts as a Newtonian fluid of viscosity η ~ 10-2 poise (1 poise = 0.1 N-s/m2 = 0.1 Pa-s). 
Note that this viscosity increases with molecular weight at shown in Fig. 3a. 

(a) Briefly discuss why it is confusing that PDMS is widely described as a rubber elastic 
polymer, but is also widely reported to exhibit measurable elastic moduli E. 

Solution: Rubber elasticity is governed by entropy dU(dS)  and expressed by the relationship 
between chain extension, contour length, etc, whereas E is a measure of linear elastic behavior 
for a material for which dU(dW) and is only weakly dependent on entropic effects. Further, 
elastomers tend to exhibit highly nonlinear stress-strain responses under uniaxial tension, and E 
would be obtained by a linear fit to some portion of the stress-strain curve. 

(b) Let us assume PDMS is reasonably described as a linear viscoelastic (LVE) material up to at 
least 100% normal strain. You’ve built a microfluidics device of 1 mm-high channels inside 
PDMS (Mw = 106 g/mol), then placed a sheet of glass on top that applied a constant compressive 
stress σo of 1 MPa to keep it sealed (Fig. 3b).  

Assuming that E = 2 MPa and η is given by Fig. 3a, determine and graph ε(t) of this PDMS for 
both Kelvin-Voigt and Maxwell models of the linear viscoelastic response. Note the magnitude 
of strain at t = 0 s and t = infinity for both assumptions. 

Solution: 

Let s = stress sigma; e = strain epsilon, and h = viscosity eta. The Maxwell model, a spring and 

dashpot in series, has the constitutive law de/dt =1/E(ds/dt) + s/n, so if s = so then ds/dt = 0 and  

de/dt = so/h.

The graphical prediction is that e(t=0) = so/E and then e(t) is a straight line of slope so/h for all 

t thereafter; e(t = infinity) = infinity. 


The Kelvin-Voigt model, a spring and dashpot in parallel, has the constitutive law de/dt = s/h – 

Ee/h, so if s = so then the solution of the differential equation de/dt + Ee/h = so/h is: 

 e(t) = so/E[1 – exp[-Et/h].

The graphical prediction is that e(t=0) = 0 and increases to approach a constant strain of so/E at

t=infinity. 


(c) You’ve noticed that as soon as you apply this stress to the device, the pressure required to 
move fluid through the channels at a fixed velocity increased; you checked this pressure level the 
next day and it had leveled off. Considering this observation and your results in (b), which LVE 
model do you think best captures the deformation of your PDMS, and why? 

Solution: This means that the channel got smaller (shorter) right away, which could be predicted 
by either model though instantaneously by the Maxwell model, and then steadied to a constant 
size (height). The Voigt model correctly predicts this leveling off of size because it predicts a 
constant strain (normalized change in thickness of the PDMS) at long times. 

(d) According to the model you find most appropriate in (c), what is the channel height you 
would expect at t = 1 min after you applied the sealing stress to this PDMS device?

(b) Sealed microfluidics device comprising 
PDMS between 2 glass plates. Visible channels 
of PDMS were originally 1 mm high before the 
top glass plate was put on top to exert a constant 
stress of 1 MPa. 

Solution: For the K-V model, if we assume E = 2 MPa and h = 5 x 10^6 poise or 0.5 MPa-s from 
the graph in Fig. 3a, then e(t) = so/E[1 – exp[-Et/h] = -0.5[1 – exp(-4t)] where I include the 
negative sign to note that the stress is compressive. Thus, e(t=60 s) = -0.5. This means a 50% 
decrease in the channel height, or a height of 0.5 mm after only 1 minute. 

Incidentally, you should have noticed that this exponential really quickly decays for these values 
of E and h. The characteristic time it takes to decay is sometimes expressed as h/E, or 0.25 

seconds for these values, or the time it takes for the strain to attain [1-1/e]*(steady-state value), 
or 63%*so/E = 0.32 s for these values.
