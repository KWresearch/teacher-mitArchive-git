1.  When  engineers  decided that,  indeed,  dislocations must exist in  crystalline  materials, several 
new  questions  emerged. 

(a)  For  example,  experimentally  it  is   known  that  crystalline  materials  that  have  been  cold 
worked  (mechanically  deformed  at  temperatures  much  lower  than  melting  tempera­
tures)  exhibit   compressive/tensile  yield  stress  σy  that  increases  as  the  dislocation  den­
sity   ρ  increases.  The  more  deformation,  the  more  dislocations,  the  higher  the  yield 
stress.  However,  we  learned  that  the  theoretical   shear  strength  of  a  material  with 
NO   dislocations  is  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  the  the  shear  strength  of  a  well-
annealed  material  that  has  some  dislocations  (102 /cm2 ).  Explain  how  both  of  these 
things  can  be  true. 

SOLUTION:  Dislocations  make  crystals  weaker—that   is,  weaker  than  they would  be  if 
dislocations  did  not  exist. 
In  the  theoretical  absence  of  dislocations,  deformation  would  require  whole  planes  of 
atomic   bonds  to   be  broken  simultaneously.  (Alternatively,  other   mechanisms  of  defor­
mation   such  as  twinning  or  phase  transformation  would  be  involved.)  A  dislocation 
moving  through  a  material  allows  deformation  to  occur   with  a  relatively  few  number 
of   bonds  breaking  at   any  one  time. 
Conversely,  any  density  of   dislocations   in  a  real  material  increases  the  chance  of  in­
tersection  and  entanglement.  Just  like  any  impediment   to  dislocation  motion,   entan­
glement   increases  the  stress   required  to  initiate  and  continue  permanent  deformation. 

(b)  Others  have shown   that,  theoretically, dislocation  density  increases  with  the  square  root 
of  strain: 
ρ √
ε 
where C is a  constant  particular to the  crystalline  material.  In  addition,  others have 
shown   that,  experimentally,  shear  strength  τ  of  materials   such  as  single  crystal  and 
polycrystalline  Cu  varies  linearly  with  ρ: 
From  these  ﬁndings  for  ε(ρ) and τ(ρ),  ﬁnd  the  strain  hardening  (aka  work  hardening) 
exponent   n  that  would  be  expected  solely  from  cold  working  of  a  crystalline  material.

SOLUTION:  We  note  that  the  slope  of  log(shear  stress)  vs.   log(dislocation  density)  
is  1
2 ,  so  that  the  shear  stress   increases  as  ρ1/2  .  Since  ρ  =  Cε1/2 ,  the  shear  stress  is 
1  . 
proportional  to   ε1/4  and n  =  4

Note  that  this  range   of   n  (0.25–0.5)  is  a  bit  higher   than  is  experimentally  observed 
(0–0.4). 

2.  Your  boss  at   NewAlloys,  Inc.  has  asked  you  to  investigate  a  new  nickel  alloy with  several 
weight  percent  of  other  metals  to  provide  strengthening.  You  decide  to  perform  a   Brinell 
hardness  test   with a 10  mm-diameter  tungsten  carbide  sphere  and  1000 kgf  force. You  mea­
sure  an  average  indentation  diameter  of  2.85  mm.  

(a)  Estimate  the  tensile  strength  of  this  alloy,  using  linear  interpolation  if  necessary. 

SOLUTION: The  Brinell hardness is   found to be (Eq. 3.40 in M&C) 
2P
πD(D − √
D2  − d2 ) 
where D and d  are  the  diameters of   the  sphere  and  the  impression, respectively.   The 
tensile strength is  estimated to be 524 MPa from Table 3.2 in M&C.  It  is  also  acceptable 
to   divide  the  hardness  value  by  three   to  obtain  an  estimate  of  the   alloy’s  ﬂow   stress: 

= 154 

HB  =

(151 kgf /mm2 )(9.81 N/kgf ) 
3 

= 502 MPa 

(b)  Your  colleague  has  performed  additional  indentation  tests  using  much  probes  of  much  
smaller  diameter  and   lower  applied  forces,  and  her  data  features  much  larger  scatter 
(variation  from  measurement  to  measurement)  than  yours.  Describe  two  possible  rea­
sons  why this  might   occur. 

SOLUTION:  It’s  possible  that   her  tests   are  characterizing  individual  grains  or  pre­
cipitates rather  than   the bulk   average of  these eﬀects.   The  relatively   large  inﬂuence  of 
surface roughness  for  small   indentations  may  also  cause   scatter. Finally,  the resolution 
of   her  instrument  (with   its  smaller  forces  and   indentation  depths)   may  be  poorer.

(c)  Sketch   a  quantitative  stress-strain  diagram  for  this  alloy out  to  a  strain  of  0.4%.  State 
any assumptions  you  make  and  include  any references  you  consulted  to  produce  this  
diagram. 

SOLUTION: The key elements of the diagram are a  linear region that   corresponds to 
elastic response  (the  elastic  modulus of  nickel is   approximately  210 GPa,  and  the  alloy 
will  have  a  similar  stiﬀness  as  long  as  the  amount  of  alloying  materials   is   low),  and  a 
plastic  region  that  initiates  before  a  strain  of  approximately  σ
T S  =  0.25%   (the  strain  
E
that  corresponds  to   our  estimate   of  tensile  strength). 

3.  The extent of  strain  hardening of  materials is   important  from a  processing  perspective,  when  
a  desired   level  of  permanent  deformation  is   required  to  make  a  part. 

(a)  Estimate  the  strain  hardening  exponent  n  for  the  uniaxial  tensile  test  in  Example  3.5   of  
Meyers  and   Chawla  (p.  131-132). 

SOLUTION:  One  approach is   to  take  the  logarithm  of  both  sides   of  σ = σ0  + K εn  and 
ﬁnd  the  slope  of   ln(σ) plotted against   ln(ε).  The  resolution  of  the  answer   suﬀers  from 
the size of the ﬁgures in Meyers and Chawla, but we might  estimate n to lie  between 0.5  
and  1.0. 

(b)  Prove  that  true  strain  εt  is  always  smaller  than  engineering  strain  εe . 

SOLUTION: We  could Taylor expand  εt  =  ln(1  + εe ): 
ln(1  + εe ) ≈ εe  − 

ε2 
e 
2 
which  is  less  than  εe .  We  could  also  show  that   the  two  expressions   are  both  zero  at 
l =  l0  and  that  the  slope  of   positive  εt  is   less  than  the  slope  of  positive  εe  thereafter. 

(c) Given this proof, why does the true strain data extend far to the right of the  engineering  
strain  data  in   Figure  E3.5.2  of  Meyers   and  Chawla  (p.   133)?  Think  about  what  is 
directly  measured  and   what  is   inferred  in  a  uniaxial  tensile  test. 

SOLUTION:  At  the  point  of  necking,  the  deﬁnition  of  true  strain  changes  from  εt  = 
ln(l/l0 ) to   εt  =  ln(A0/A) (Eqs.   3.16  and  3.17 in M&C). True  strain  calculated by  cross-
sectional   area  can   be  larger  than  engineering  strain  (which is   still  calculated  at  εe  = 
Δl/l0 ). 

4. As the chief  materials  scientist at  Strengthened Metalworks, Inc. you are developing a model 
to  predict  the  amount  of  precipitate  strengthening  (aka  precipitate  hardening)  in  a  material 
which  includes  precipitates  shaped  as  rods  rather  than  spheres.   You  ﬁrst   attempt  is   a  2-D 
model  in   which  a  dislocation  cuts   through  a  rectangular  precipitate   with  side  lengths   L and 
2r,  and  random  orientation  θ,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.

Figure  2:   2-D  model  of  an  alloy containing  precipitates  that  will   induce  strengthening. 

Develop  an  expression  for  the  shear  stress  τ required  for  a  dislocation  to  move  through  this  
2-D  material. Your  model  should  consider  details  such  as:  
•	 The  chance  of  a  dislocation  encountering  a  precipitate   (assume  a  volume  fraction  f  for  the 
precipitated  second  phase).  
•	 The  distance a  dislocation must travel through the  precipitate as a  function of  θ,  and  the average 
distance  for  the  case   where  θ is  random  (as  it   is  here). 
•	 The  increase in  surface  area   when a  dislocation   with Burgers vector  b cuts  through a  precipitate 
(assume   the  energetic  cost  of  creating   a  new  surface  is  γ [J/m]).  The   actual   type  of  dislocation 
is  not  important. 
•	 The  limits of the expression when  L and 2r  are  approximately  equal,  and  also   when  one  is  much 
larger  than   the  other. 

Your  answer  will  likely  be  in  the  form  of  τ  =  F (r, L, γ,  f , b).  Feel   free  to   make  any  assumptions 
necessary, but be  sure to  clearly  state and  justify  them. 

SOLUTION:  Many   people  went  straight  for  the  full   3-D  model,  so  we  follow  their  bold example.  Here 
is  one  approach,  after  Meyers  and   Chawla: 
Chance  of  encountering   a  dislocation:  Assume  that  the  dislocations  are  arrayed  in   a  cubic  arrange­
ment.  The   precipitate  volume  is 

V f  = N πr2 L 
πr2 L  �1/3 
� 
� V �1/3 
where V  is  the  total  volume  and N  is  the  number  of  dislocations.  The  average  distance d  between 
dislocations is 
N
f 

d =

= 

√
Cross-sectional  distance  through   the  precipitate: Without getting  into  secants  and  tangents,  we  might 
assume  an  average  angle  of  45◦  so  that  the  average  distance l  = 2
2r.

Calculation   of  required  shear  stress:  The  shear  stress required  for precipitate   cutting is  calculated by 
setting  equal  the  work   done  by  the  dislocation  (force  times  distance)  to  the  energy  required  to  create 
additional  surface  area: 
· 
(2b) = πrbγ
πγr 
τ = 
2bd 
The  distance   2b corresponds  to  two  slip  steps,  one  at  the  new  area  where  the  dislocation  enters  the 
precipitate and one where is exits.  Other  solutions are  possible; credit was given  primarily for clarity 
of explanation.
