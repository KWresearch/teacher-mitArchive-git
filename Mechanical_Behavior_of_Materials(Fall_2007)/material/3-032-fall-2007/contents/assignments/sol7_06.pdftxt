3.032 Problem Set 7

Fall 2006

Due:  12/08/06 before the start of lecture


1.  Creep  can  occur  via  several  diﬀerent  mechanisms   in  amorphous  and  crystalline  materials, 
each  with  their  own   activation  energy  Q.  Typically,  there  is   an  Arrhenius  behavior  to  this  
creep  response, with an exponential prefactor that is   particular to the  material  considered and 
on  the  operating  mechanism. 

(a)  You   are  running  two  separate  creep  experiments  on  polycrystalline  Ni,   one  at  527oC 
and   the  other  at  532oC.  You  observe  that  dε/dt  increases  by  a  factor  of  1.5  for  the 
sample  tested   at  the  higher  temperature.  What  is   the  activation  energy  Q for  this  creep 
mechanism? 

SOLUTION: Take  the ratio of  the  two  strain rates expressed  as  Arrhenius  equations.  
Since  the  temperatures  diﬀer   very  little,  you  would  expect  the  same  mechanism  and 
therefore the  same Q at   both  temperatures.   Remember to express   temperature in [K], 
since R is in [J/mol  K]:

(b)  What  do   you  think  the  mechanism  at  532oC could  be,  and  why?  Note  that  the  actual 
grain  size  d and   stress  magnitude need not be  stated to ﬁgure this out, but you can use 
deformation  mechanism  maps   to  narrow  down  your  options.  

SOLUTION:  The  melting   temperature  of  Ni  is   1455C,  or  1728K,  so  this  temp  of  805K 
is  at T /Tm  = 0.46.  Referring  to  deformation  mechanism  maps   of  Ni  for  several  grain  
sizes,  the  options  would  depend  on  the  magnitude  of  stress   applied,  and  could  include 
elastic  behavior,  Coble  creep,  or  dislocation  creep  (and,  at  really  high  stress,  disloca­
tion  glide).  Since  this  must  be  creep  (we’re  measuring  a  strain  rate,  so  the  material  is 
creeping!),  our  options  are  Coble  or  dislocation  creep.  Have  to  know  the  stress   to  say 
for sure, but Coble creep will  dominate until  normalized stresses get to be around 10−3  . 

(c)  You   are  running  these  tests  because  you  would  like  to  develop  a  new  polycrystalline 
Ni   alloy for  Boeing  aircraft   engines.   The  Ni  parts  will   be  under  a  constant   stress  of  
about  1.3  GPa  due  to   centrifugal  forces,   and  a  temperature  of  about  1100oC.  Which  
creep  mechanism  are  you  most  concerned  about,  and  how  do  you  propose  to  modify  
the  polycrystalline  Ni   alloy to  minimize  creep  rates  for  this  application?  SOLUTION: 

1


To  locate my  position on a  deformation mechanism map, I note that T /Tm  = 0.79  and 
that  normalizes  stress  is  about  1.3  GPa/13  GPa  =  0.1.  All  creep  mechanisms   could  
operate, but   the  most   concerning  mechanism  is   the  dominant  one.  At  this  normalized 
temperature,  Coble  creep  and  dislocation  creep  are likely, though  deformation  will  also 
occur  via   dislocation  glide.  Note  that   dislocation  glide  is   NOT  a  diﬀusive  mechanism, 
but   dislocation  creep  is  diﬀusive   (vacancies  diﬀuse  to  dislocations   to  enable  climb). To 
inhibit Coble creep, I would  increase the grain  size d to reduce the  volume fraction of 
grain  boundaries  comprising  the  material. To  inhibit  dislocation  creep, I would  inhibit 
diﬀusion   of   vacancies  (or  self  diﬀusion  of  Ni)  by,  say,  alloying.  Note  that   since  yield 
strength  relates  to   the  diﬃculty of  dislocation  glide  and will  decrease  as I increase  the 
grain  size,  this  approach would  also  make  the  material  weaker  UNLESS  the  alloying 
compensated   for  the  increased  grain  size’s  deleterious  eﬀect   on  strength. Tradeoﬀs. 

2.  One  of  your  colleagues  proposes  that  the  advancing  crack  in  the  cast   copper-and-tin  Liberty 
Bell in  Philadelphia, PA could have been halted early on by drilling a small hole just beyond 
the  crack’s  termination point. Would this be likely to work? Why  or why not? 

SOLUTION: Yes,  placing a hole right  ahead of the crack tip, eﬀectively  blunting  the  crack by 
increasing the tip radius, should work. This proposal is   discussed by Hertzberg (p. 274), who 
attributes it to Wilfred Jordan  (1915). The approach would likely halt the crack by relieving 
the  sharp  crack-tip  radius  (and  therefore  the  high  stress   concentration)  in  a  way  that  the 
alloy  is  evidently  unable   to   do   on  its   own  through  plastic  deformation.  However,  one  would 
need  to   be  sure  that  the  hole  is  indeed  drilled  ahead  of  the  crack  tip  and  that   the  drilling 
process  creates a  suﬃciently  smooth  hole  that   new  cracks  are  not  initiated.  Additionally,  this  
solution   does  not  address  the  material’s  fundamental  inability  to  resist  crack propagation  in 
other  locations. 

3.  Earlier  this  semester,  you  learned  about  the  stresses  generated  in  thin-wall  pressure  vessels  
and  how  to   calculate  the  minimum  necessary  wall  thickness  to  avoid  yielding.  However, 
yielding that leads to   localized  deformation and leaking is far more  preferable than the alter­
nate failure   mode of  rapid  crack  propagation. 

(a)  Assuming  Mode  I  failure,  obtain  an  expression  for  the  maximum  crack  length  in  a 
vessel wall   that would  allow  yielding  before  crack  propagation,  assuming a factor of  
safety  of  two. 
(b)  Select   four  materials  (any  class)  and  rank  them  by  their  ability  to  satisfy  the  yield-
before-break   criterion  for  this  application,   referencing  your  data  sources.  Clearly  state 
any assumptions. 

SOLUTION:  The  allowable  stress  is   σ
y  where  σy  is   the  yield  stress.  Applying  this  value  to 
2 
the relationship   between mode I fracture  toughness KI c , crack length a, and stress, we have

(Note that the stress is related to the pressure p in a  cylindrical pressure  vessel as

where r  and t  are  the radius  and  thickness of  the  vessel, respectively.) 
The  ﬁgure  of   merit  (number  that   allows   you  to  compare  outcomes   on  an  equal  basis)  for  
KI c 
ranking diﬀerent   materials   is 
. To  achieve  the 
I c 
σ
σy 
y 
yield-before-break  criterion,  we  are  interested in  materials   with a  high KI c  and a  low  σy , 
even  though a  low  σy  limits  the  application  pressure.  (In  other   words,  designing  the  tank  for  
high  pressures  isn’t worth   it   if   one  day  the  tank  explodes  without  warning).  

4. A plate of  glass is  placed  under a  tensile  stress of 60 MPa. 

(a)  Determine  the  maximum  surface  ﬂaw  size  that  can  be  accommodated  without   fracture. 
Take  the  speciﬁc  surface  energy  of  the  glass   to  be  0.3 J/m2 . 
(b)  What  instruments  could  you  use  to  visualize  ﬂaws   of  that  size,  in  order  to  rule  in/out 
the  likelihood   of  such  ﬂaws   in  the  as-processed  glass? 
(c)  Aluminum  has  the  same Young’s elastic  modulus  as  glass.  Compare  the  maximum  ﬂaw 
size  that  could  be  tolerated  in  Al  without   fracture,  clearly  justifying  any assumptions. 

ac  = 

SOLUTION: Let us  assume a  condition of plane stress. The  critical crack length ac is (M&C 
equation  7.6a) 
2Eγ 
πσ2  ≈ 3.7 µm 
where the  elastic  modulus is taken to be 70 GPa for  glass. 
This  size  crack  is  large  enough  be  detected  optically.  Alternatively,  scanning  electron  mi­
croscopy  could be used, but this is challenging on  materials like glass that are not  conduc­
tive; you’d have to coat it with gold like you did in lab with the rat tail  tendon, and that   could  
obscure  the  crack length. 
Fracture  in   aluminum  involves  a  signiﬁcant  amount  of  plastic  deformation,  so  we  would  not 
√
want  to   simply  recalculate  a  critical  crack  length  using  the  surface  energy  of  aluminum. 
Alternatively,  we  might  use  the KI c  equation  with KI c  ≈  30 MPa 
√
m  (aluminum  alloys  typi­
cally  have  a  fracture  toughness  in  the  tens  of  MPa 
m).  The  critical   crack length  ac  is  thus 
estimated to be about 8 mm—far larger than the  corresponding crack length for glass! 

5.  One  of  the  ways  that  the  yield  strength  and  toughness  of  alloys  like  steel  are  controlled  is 
through a process  called   tempering,   which  means   heating  the  material  well  below the  melting 
temperature  to   relieve  internal  stresses  via  defect   annihilation.  Unfortunately,  strength  as 

3


measured by   σy  is  generally  reduced  via  tempering,  whereas  toughness  as  measured  by  KI c 
is  increased  via  tempering. 
√
√
For example,  AISI  4340  steel  can go  from (σy  =  1190  MPa;  KI c  =  135  MPa 
m) to (σy 
m),  varying  almost  linearly  through  this  range  of  tempering 
=  1620   MPa;  KI c  =  60   MPa 
times/temperatures.  It  is  often  important  to  ﬁgure  out  whether  a  ductile  material  component 
like  steel  will fail by   yielding  or by  fracture in a  particular  application  such as a vertical 
member  in   tension. 

(a)  Given  that  visual  inspection  of  the  4340  steel  member  can  detect  all  cracks   greater   than 
a  = 2 mm,  determine  whether  the  toughest  steel  noted  above  will fail by  yielding  or fail 
by   fracture.  Assume a  through-thickness   center  crack in a  semi-inﬁnite  body,  such  that 
f  = 1. 

SOLUTION:

135M Pa

√
π ∗ 2 x10−3m 
Since  this  failure  stress  exceeds  the  yield  stress,  the  material  will  pass  through  yielding 
before  this  stress  is  attained  (fail  by  yielding). 

KI c  = ( f 

=

= 1.7GPa 

(3)

(b)  Ideally,  the  steel  should  carry  the  maximum  possible  load  without  yielding  or  fracture. 
√
That  means  it   should  be  processed  so  that  the  yield  and  fracture  strengths   are  the  same 
value.  Calculate  σ f (KI c ) over  the  range  of  50  ≤  KI c  150  MPa 
m.  Plot  this  result   on  
a  graph   of  stress  (y-axis)  vs.  KI c  (x-axis),  identifying  this  ideal  yield/fracture  strength  
value  as  the  stress  at  which  σy (KI c ) and σ f (KI c ) cross  on  this  graph. 

SOLUTION: Two  straight  lines  are graphed.  The  ﬁrst is   given by  the (KI c , σy ) data 
given  in   the  problem  statement,   and  has   a  negative  slope.  The  other   are  the  failure 
stresses  as  a  function  of   KI c ,  as  shown  in  (a),  and  has   a  positive  slope.  These  lines 
cross  at   a  stress  of   about  1400  MPa. 

6.  Review  the  paper, “Fatigue  behavior  of  nanocrystalline   metals  and  alloys”,  Hanlon  et  al.,  Int. 
J. Fat.  27   (2005). 

(a)  In  your  own   words,  explain  why the  reduction  of  grain  size  d is   generally  considered  a 
desirable  microstructure to   increase  fracture and fatigue  resistance in  metals.  

SOLUTION:  Reduced grain  size generally  increases  yield  strength,  with  one explana­
tion  of   this  stated  as  “Small  grains  leave  little  room  for  dislocation  pileup  between 
closely  space   grain  boundaries,  so  the  externally  applied  stress   must  be  increased  to 
induce general   plastic  ﬂow in  many grains.”  This is   true, but is   not  an  answer   for frac­
ture  and  fatigue  resistance.  Fracture  resistance  implies   that   a  material  can  dissipate 
strain  energy  by  means  other   than  fracture  (e.g.,   plasticity).  Materials  with  high  yield 
strength  also   exhibit  high  hardness.  This  means   it  takes  alot   of  energy  to  rearrange 

4


bonds,  and  even  more  to   break  them.  If  it  takes  alot   of  energy  to  nucleate  a  crack,  the 
material is fracture resistant. If it takes a lot of  energy to  nucleate a crack, it takes even 
more to grow  that crack  enough to generate  fatigue  failure (a  combination of  plastic 
deformation  and  crack propagation  under  cyclic  loading),   so  the  material  is   resistant 
to   fatigue  failure. 

(b)  In  Section   2.2,  the  authors  detail  the experimental  conditions  for  this fatigue  life  study. 
Were the fatigued  samples ever  loaded in  compression? How do you know? 

SOLUTION: R  was  always greater  than  zero,  so  σmin/σma x  ¿ 0.  This  implies   tension.  

(c)  The  authors  ﬁrst  computed  the  stress  intensity factor  KI  according  to  Eq.  1.  Given  that 
they observed  later  that  the  range  of  a/W  they accessed  was  0.1  to  0.7,  what  was  the 
range of  KI  that  they  explored,  according  to  Eq.  1? 

√
√
SOLUTION:  The  range  of   f  (a/W ) can  be  computed  from  this  to  range  2.1  to  10.6,  so  
√
Kmin  and Kma x  ranged from 2.1σ 
a.  Since you  know w, you  ﬁnd the range 
a  to  10.6σ 
of   a  and  also   know  the  stress   σ applied,  so  you  can  compute  actual  [MPa 
m].  

(d)  What  is  the  J -integral,  why  did  the  authors  (and  anyone  else)  use  it  to  consider   this  
material’s  fracture  behavior,  and  what  was  the  range  of  the  J -integral   they  explored, 
according to Eqs. 1  - 2? 

SOLUTION: The  J-integral is the  energy required to  separate crack faces, and provides  
a way to   calculate  valid KI c  for  small  samples in which the  plastic  zone size r p might 
not be  small  compared to the crack and sample  dimensions.  The range of J  can be 
calculated  from   Eq.  2  for  the  range  of  f(a/w)  explored  (0.1  to  0.7),   but  can  also  be 
calculated  directly from   its relationship to KI c . 

(e)  In  Section   3,  the  authors  relate  their  results. 	 Why  do  you  think  the  ductility  of  the 
nanocrystalline,  ultraﬁne  crystalline,  and  microcrystalline  Ni  ranked  the  way  they did? 

SOLUTION:  The  authors  found  nanocrystalline  samples  to  be  the  least  ductile  be­
cause   slip   of   dislocations  from  one  grain  to  the  next  was   inhibited.  The  stress   had  to  be 
applied   (by  the  machine)  to  force  dislocations   into  new  grains,  since  pileup  of  disloca­
tions  to   create  a  driving  force  for  slip  into  the  next  grain  was   not  possible  (no  room  for  
pileup).  When   dislocation   plasticity is no longer an easy  option,  energy is   dissipated by 
other  means  such  as  fracture.  Thus,  the  material  fractures  rather   than  yields  at  small 
strains  for  small  grain  sizes.  

(f)  What is the fatigue limit (i.e.,  stress  amplitude in [Pa]) of nc, ufc, and mc Ni,   according  
to   Hanlon  et  al.,  Scripta  Mater.  (2003)  as  reproduced  in  Fig.  4? 

SOLUTION: The stress range at which the fatigue life was   independent of actual stress 

5


magnitude  was  200  MPa  (mc),  350  MPa  (ufc)  and  400  MPa  (nc),   so  it  increased  as  
grain  size  decreased. 

(g)  What  is  the fatigue  crack  growth  threshold  or  threshold  stress  intensity factor  ΔKo  for 
nc  Ni   at  the  various  load  ratios  considered,  according  to  Fig.  5? 

√
√
SOLUTION:  The  ΔKo is the  value at which measurable crack growth  starts: 4 MPa 
(R  = 0.1), 3 MPa 
m (R  = 0.3),   and  2.5  MPa 
m (R  = 0.7). 

√

(h)  Assuming  that  the  cyclic  crack  growth  characteristics   of  nc  and  ufc  Ni  are  well  char­
acterized by   the Paris law,  determine  the values of  C  and  m  for  both  materials  from 
the  data  in   Figs.  5a-c.  From  this  analysis,   state  whether  you  ﬁnd  the fatigue  fracture 
lifetime  to   be  a  stronger  function  of  microstructure  or  of  loading  conditions,  and  why 
you  think  this  to   be  the  case.  

SOLUTION:  This  requires  ﬁtting  lines  to  these  data  shown  as  da/dN  vs.   ΔK  on  log 
scales.  Easiest way is to take the ratio of two points to solve for m, and then  insert that 
m  back into  one  such equation  to  solve  for C .  Alternatively,  one  can  use  ΔKo  and  the 
value of da/dN  at   this  threshold  to  insert  into  the Paris   law  equation: 
log(da/dN ) = m  ∗ log(ΔK ) − x 
where x  = the power of 10 related to C. I prefer the  former approach. For example, for  
R =  0.3:  for  nc,  m  =  3.5  and C  =  10−8 ; for  ufc,  m =  4.0  and C  =  10−10 .  Comparing 
values  obtained  this  way  for  all R, I  ﬁnd  that   the C  and m  varied  more  between  the 
materials   (e.g.,  m  ∼  3.5  for  nc,  but  4.0  for  ufc)  than  as  a  function  of  R  for  a  given  
material.  This  means  the  fatigue  response  is   a  strong  function  of  the  microstructure. 

(4) 

(i)  Brieﬂy explain the  mechanisms you  understand to be  responsible (either from the paper 
or  your  own   knowledge  via  3.032  and  other  sources)  for  the  chief  conclusion  of   the 
authors:   Grain  size  reduction  correlated  with  decreased  subcritical fatigue  fracture  in 
nc  Ni, but   also  to   an  increased  total fatigue  life. 

SOLUTION: As grain size decreases, the  material gets harder (more resistant to  plastic 
deformation),  and  therefore  more  resistant  to  nucleation  of  new  cracks  (energy  dissi­
pated by plasticity if   possible, then fracture).  However,  once a crack is   nucleated,  small 
grain  size  enables  a  straighter  crack path:  the  crack does   not  need  to  make  large  turns 
as  it   works  its  way  around  grains   (assuming  transgranular  fracture  for  simplicity).  If 
it’s a straight crack, it will feel that Mode I  loading at full strength, and  continue to 
open  under  that  tensile  stress   to  grow  quickly.  The  overall  fatigue  life  increases  due  to 
the resistance to crack nucleation and  subcritical crack growth, not to a more favorable 
da/dN.
