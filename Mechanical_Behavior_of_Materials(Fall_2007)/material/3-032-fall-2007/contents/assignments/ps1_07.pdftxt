1.	

The I35 bridge in Minneapolis collapsed in Summer 2007. The failure apparently occurred at a pin 
in the gusset plate of the truss supporting the bridge span, at a time when the loads on the bridge 
span were unequal due to construction crews working on the westbound side. We’ll treat a simplified 
section of this truss (Fig. 1a) to consider whether this unbalanced load could have generated enough 
force for the truss to fail. We will examine the truss section denoted by the dotted lines, and replace 
the gusset plate with a pin joint.

On the day of the bridge failure, construction crews occupied the westbound lanes (right side of Fig. 
1b).  Let F be the forces acting on the truss members by the regular traffic and 2F be the forces 
acting on the truss by the heavier construction equipment.  Taking into account the average mass of a 
car to be 1362 kg, we can estimate F to be ~13.35 kN.

(a)  	 Determine the reaction forces at supports E and F.  Show any free-body diagrams used in your 
calculations. 

(b)  	 Determine the forces in members AB and AE. Draw all the free-body diagrams you use in your 
calculations and show whether the forces on the members you calculate are in tension or 
compression.  

(c)  	 The diagonal members BF and EC are called counters, thin cables that are designed to be loaded 
only in tension.  It is known that the support pins at E and F will fail if any of the counters is under a 
tensile force greater than 10 kN.  From the loading on the truss described above, determine the 
forces on each of the members BF and EC and state which, if any, of the pins will fail.  Show all the 
free-body diagrams associated with your calculations.

The MIT varsity diving team is practicing their back flips on the Z-center’s diving boards (Fig. 2).  
The diving boards have a total length of 3 m, width of 0.5 m, and thickness of 0.1 m.  The core of the 
boards is made of a Douglas fir wood with an estimated Young’s modulus E of 0.6GN/m2.  Let us 
 
approximate the diving board as a clamped-free beam, neglecting the springboard support at the 
midspan of the diving board and the weight of the diving board.

(a)	

If the average weight of a student standing on the free-end of the board is about 155 lbs, how much 
will the board deflect? Note that, in the US, “weight” is commonly stated in units of mass [pounds, 
or lbs] instead of force, and state your solution in SI MKS units. 

(b)	 Draw a free-body diagram of the diving board, again neglecting the spring board near the midspan 
for simplicity, and determine all reaction forces and moments for the “typical diver” in (a). 

3. Bundles of protein filaments inside tissue cells are structural elements that can generate contractile 
force against the materials to which they adhere. Figure 3 shows struts called “stress fibers” that extend 
from one end of the cell to the other. These fibers are made of crosslinked, filamentous actin, with an 
average diameter of 2 μm and an effective “stiffness” E of 16 kN/m2.

If we assume the connections at either end of the stress fiber can be modeled as pins, how much force P 
would the cell need to generate to buckle the longest of these stress fibers?

4.  A U.S. based company was in charge of designing MIT’s new physics lab, near the new DMSE 
headquarters in Bldg 6.  They used 30-ft long, wide-flanged structural steel beams for the floor joists to 
carry the distributed weight of the rooms above. The actual weight distribution is shown in Fig. 4, which 
is different from what they anticipated, so they want to know where to add an extra support to minimize 
the shear force and bending moment on this beam. This week, you’ll get started on that calculation.

(a)  Being a US-based engineer, the first step to analyzing the beam is to convert all units from the US 
architects to SI MKS units.  Perform these conversions.  

(b)  Draw a free-body diagram of the beam and calculate the reaction forces at A and B.
