1.  In  PS2-4,  you  considered   a  femur  under  a  torsional  load  that  induced  a  spiral  fracture,  ap­
proximating  the  load  as  pure  torsion.  

Figure  1:   Femur  under  pure  torsional  loading  T . 

(a)  Draw  a  representative  in-plane  element  from  the  outermost  surface  of  the  femur  diaph­
ysis.  The  femur  is  idealized  as  an  annular  cylinder  of  uniform  diameter  subjected  to  a 
pure  torque  T  (Figure   1).  Indicate  all  the  normal  and  shear  stresses  σi j  acting  on  that 
material  volume  element,  expressed  only  as  a  function  of  T . 
(b)  Construct  Mohr’s  circle  of  stress  to  identify  the  average  normal  stress  σavg  in  the  bone.  
(c)  Draw  the  orientation   of  the  representative  material  element  (indicate  magnitude  of  θ p s ) 
and give  the  magnitudes of  the  principal  normal  stresses  σ1  and  σ2 ,  assuming  a  critical 
torsional  load  F  of 67 N for a  moment  arm of 2 m. 
(d)  Compare/contrast  this  ﬁnding  with  what  is   observed  for  the  principal  stress  state  and 
maximum shear state for the same bone subjected to  uniaxial  compression with a mag­
nitude  σ11  = σ1  = 60 MPa. 

2.  Thin  ﬁlms  used  in   microelectronics  can  develop  considerable  internal  strain  when  they  are 
deposited  onto  a  substrate  of  a  diﬀerent  material.  The  two  materials   may  have  diﬀerent  unit 
cell  lattice  parameters  and/or  may  have  diﬀerent  coeﬃcients   of  thermal   expansion,  and   the 
thin  ﬁlm  is  forced   to   take  on   the lateral  dimensions  of  the  substrate  to  which  it  is   adhered. 
This  strain  can  lead   to   substrate-ﬁlm  curvature  (Figure  2).   The  midplane  of  such  thin  ﬁlms 
is  often  approximated as being in a  state of  in-plane  normal  strain in cylindrical  coordinates: 
�rθ  = 0; �rr  = �θθ  = �o  − κz 
where  �o  is  an  isotropic  extension  of  the  substrate  (and  the  ﬁlm),  κ  is   the  curvature  of   the 
ﬁlm/substrate,  and   z is  the  distance  from  the  ﬁlm  neutral  axis  (its  midplane).

Figure  2:  Top:  Substrate  before  deposition;  Bottom:  Substrate  and  thin  ﬁlm  after  deposition  (the 
actual  curvature  may  be  in   the  opposite  direction  depending  on  the  mismatch  between  lattice  pa­
rameters  and  thermal  expansion   coeﬃcients).  

(a)  In  a  scientiﬁc  programming  language  of  your  choice,   write  a  program  that  can  be  used 
to   determine  the  normal  strain  � x� x�  and  engineering  shear  strain  � x� y�  on  the  (thin  ﬁlm  
material)  plane  oriented  at  an  angle  θ with  respect  to  your  original  coordinate  system 
( x, y). Your  program  must  report:  
i.  � x� x�  and   engineering   shear  strain  � x� y�  for a given  θ 
ii.  principal  strains  �1  and  �2  and  the  material  volume  element  orientation  θ pe 
iii.  maximum  in-plane  shear  strain	 � x� y� ,ma x  and  the  corresponding  material  volume 
element   orientation   θ pe,ma x 
iv.  average  normal  strain  �avg 
Note:  Mathematica,  Matlab,  Maple, C++, and Fortran90  are excellent  choices to build  
this  program.  Practice  with  Mathematica  will   beneﬁt  you  in  future  lab  experiment 
analyses, so  here’s a good excuse to  brush up (available on 
However,  a  brute-
MIT Server). 
force  execution  in   Excel  is   acceptable  as  a  last  resort.  In  all  cases,  you  must  provide 
the  program  and   indicate  the  embedded  equations  with  your  problem  set   solution. 
(b)  Assume  all   the  strain  at  the  midplane  of  a  Ge  ﬁlm  deposited  on  a  Si  substrate  comes 
from  a  mismatch   of  the  unit  cell  lattice  parameters  a of  those  two  materials.  Compute 
that  strain. 
(c)  Is  the  ﬁlm  in   a  state  of  tensile  or  compressive  strain,  and  will   the  ﬁlm/substrate  system 
show  positive  (smile)  or  negative  (frown)  curvature? 
(d)  Assume  the  ﬁlm  is  500  nm  in  thickness  and  that  you  have  measured  the  radius   of  curva­
ture  ρ of  the  ﬁlm/substrate  system  as  10 km,   the  resolution  of  laser-based  instruments 
used  to   measure  wafer  curvature.  What  is   the  in-plane  normal  strain  �rr  = �θθ ? 
(e)  This  strain  state  is  the  principal   strain  state.  How  do  you  know  this?

(f)  Assume a  Cartesian  coordinate  system is a fair  approximation in the plane  strain   state 
of  the  ﬁlm  (i.e.,  �rr  = �θθ  = �1  = �2 ).  Use  your  program  to  determine  the  orientation and  
magnitude   of  maximum  in-plane   shear  strain  in  the  Ge  ﬁlm.  
(g) If the principal strain state of a thicker piece of Ge were not in an  equibiaxial strain state 
as  described  above, but   instead a  random  biaxial  strain  state  (e.g., 2�1  = �2 ; �3  = 0),  use 
Mohr’s  circle  to   determine  the  magnitude  of  maximum  shear  strain  and  the  plane  of  
the  ﬁlm  on   which  that  shear  strain  would  be  (1–2,  1–3,  or  2–3).  You  can  assume  the 
3-direction  to   be  through  the  ﬁlm  thickness. 

3. A beam of 2000 mm2  cross-sectional  area is   composed of two pieces of wood glued  together 
along  a  plane  at  an  angle  θ  with  the  beam  axis  (Figure  3).   It  has  been  found  from  previ­
ous experiments  that  the  joint  will fail at 20 MPa  and 10 MPa  normal  and  shear  stresses, 
respectively, and the wood at 56 MPa and 28 MPa  normal and  shear  stresses,   respectively. 
Determine  the  maximum  allowable  axial  load  that  the  bar  can  carry  with a  safety factor of  
two  and  the  corresponding  value  of  the  angle  θ.

4.  In  1654,  the  German  scientist  Otto  von  Guericke  performed  an  experiment   for  Emperor 
Ferdinand   III  to   demonstrate  the  nature  of  atmospheric  pressure.  Guernicke  connected   two 
copper  bowls  with  an  outer  diameter  D of  14  in,  pumped  out  the  air  between  them,  and  tried 
to  pull   them  apart  with  two  teams   of  eight   horses   each  (Figure  4).   The  horses   were  unable 
to  separate  the  bowls.

(a)  Assuming  that  Guernicke’s  pump  was  capable   of  removing  75%   of  the  air  from  the  as­
sembly  and   idealizing  the  connected  bowls   as  a  sphere  with  a  wall  thickness  of  0.4  cm, 
what  was  the  maximum  normal  stress  in  the  copper  bowls   before  the  horses   started 
pulling? 
(b)  Using a failure  stress  σF  for  copper  in  compression  of  370 MPa,  how  thin  in  theory 
could  the  copper bowls be  made  without failure?  If  this value  seems   impractical, ex­
plain  why using  the  terminology  and  concepts  of  3.032. 
(c)  Assume that the bowls are not  hemispheres but  rather two  identical  shells of revolution 
of  y = (7 in) sin [ xπ/(14  in)] for  x between 0 and 14  inches with axis of revolution  x = 7 
inches.  The  bowls  are  sealed  at  the  joint  with  epoxy  (Figure  5).   The  wall  thickness   is 
0.4  cm  and   the  interior  is  75%  evacuated  as  before.  What  is   the  actual  shape  of   the 
stress  distribution  σ( x),  and  what  is   its   average  value?
