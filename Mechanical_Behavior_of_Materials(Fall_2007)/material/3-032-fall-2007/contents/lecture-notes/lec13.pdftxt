3.032 Mechanical Behavior of Materials
Fall 2007

Using U(r): 
Measure parameters for U(r) in physical model to predict stresses that are high enough for
elastic instabilities to occur (e.g., nucleation of defects in crystals).

Raft of soap bubbles with 
interbubble potential similar to 
interatomic potential of fcc
metals, under distributed force 
of an indenter.

How does stress to 
move atoms depend 
on size of grains in 
polycrystalline 
metals?

Using U(r): 
Molecular dynamics simulations move atoms according to Newton’s Law, F = ma 
where F = dU/dr and U = interatomic potential such as L-J potential.
