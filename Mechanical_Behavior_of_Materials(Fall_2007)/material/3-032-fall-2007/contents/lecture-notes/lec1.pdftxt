B. Laboratory Experiments

 
Labs are conducted in groups and written up individually. The first recitation will outline the lab activities 
and schedule in detail. In short, you will attend lab 9am-1pm on EITHER Tuesday or Thursday of a 
given lab week, as indicated on the 3.032 calendar. You will attend recitation on the day (T or R) that 
you do not have lab that week. 

 
Lab 1: Stress transformations and pressure vessels  
 
Week of 9/17 
Everyone goes to recitation this Thursday, 10am 
Lab 2: Atomistic origin of elasticity 
Week of 10/15 
 
 
 
 
Week of 11/5 
 
 
 
Lab 3: Micro and nanoscale plasticity 
in 3-442. 
Lab 4: Uniaxial mechanical testing 
 
 
 
 
Week of 12/3

III. WHERE CAN I GO TO READ AND LEARN MORE?
 
Textbooks  
Required:  
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

3.032 Course Reader, Mechanical Behavior of Materials  
Available at CopyTech 3-011 ($63) 

Recommended Supplementary*:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hosford, Mechanical Behavior of Materials 
*Note: There are many texts that treat various aspects of mechanical behavior. However, these texts tend to treat 
either the mechanics or the materials perspectives well, rather than integrating the two. Your lecture notes provide 
this integration, and the Course Reader provides sufficient background material and worked examples from the 
“best” textbook for a specific topic. The Hosford text is recommended and heavily cited in the Course Reader, but 
is missing key material covered in the first third of the class.

Bookmark the class website, 
here you will find 
the assigned problem sets and laboratory materials, as well as resources such as material property 
databases, practice material for quizzes, and scientific and general-audience articles that include 
content related to our class topics.

IV. HOW IS MY UNDERSTANDING EVALUATED?
 
Grading 
1. Breakdown: 
15% each (Fri 10/5; Fri 11/9; TBA on week of 12/17) 
Quizzes (3) 
 
25% total 
Problem sets (7) 
30% total 
Labs (4) 
 
2. Acade  mic Honesty: We encourage you to work together on problem sets and lab analysis/discussion. 
However, all work turned in must be your own product, as it stands on the submission due date. What 
is cheating? 
•  Duplication of others’ problem set solutions, figures summarizing lab data, or quiz responses is 
cheating.  
•  Failure to cite sources of ideas and/or facts in your problem sets and laboratory written 
assignments is cheating.  
•  Falsifying excuses for late / missing assignments or lab participation is cheating. 
•  Backdating / alteration of submitted documents and false claims that electronic files have been 
submitted by the due date are cheating.  
A student who cheats will receive a formal letter in his/her file at the Office of Student Discipline and 

 

may be reported to the Council on Discipline. You do not need to cheat to succeed in this class! 
 
3. Who is grading?: Prof. Van Vliet will grade the three quizzes noted above. TA David Fischer will 
grade problem sets, but students should see Prof. Van Vliet regarding requests for re-grading. Prof. 
Vander Sande will grade all pre-lab quizzes and laboratory assignments, and will handle un/excused 
absences related to the labs.
