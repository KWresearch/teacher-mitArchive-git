STRESS AND STRAIN TRANSFORMATIONS: 
Finding   stress  on   a  material  plane  that  diﬀers  from  the  one  on  which  stress  is   known...

Force  balance  for  stress over a face  inclined  an  angle θ with  respect  to  the  original  (x,   y)  axes

Taking  the  derivative  of  Eq.  (1)  with  respect  to  θ  to  obtain  the  orientation  of  maximum  normal 
stress gives:

and  substituting  the  corresponding  sin2θ  and  cos2θ  expressions   into  Eqs.  (1  - 2)  to  obtain   the 
� 
maximum  normal  stresses  in   this  1-2  plane  gives:

Taking  the  derivative  of  Eq.

and  magnitude  of  the  maximum  shear  stresses  gives:

Note  that  the  equations  for  coordinate  transformations  of  strain  (strain  transformation  equations) 
are  completely  analogous. For example, 
� x x  − �yy co s2θ + � xy sin2θ 
� x x  + �yy  +

but  the  only  thing  to   note  is  that  this � xy  is   equal  to  half  the  engineering  shear  strain,  γ xy/2.  In  other  
words,  if  you  are  given  a  state  of  engineering  strain  for  a  material  body,  you  have  to  multiply  the 
engineering  shear  strain  components by 2 before using  these  equations to ﬁnd the full  strain   state 
on  some   other  plane  inclined  an  angle  θ. 

As  you  will  see  in   the  next   class,  a  very  smart  engineer  named  Otto  Mohr  ﬁgured  out  how  to 
represent  these   equations  in   the  shape  of  a  circle,  so  that  one  can  quickly  and  graphically  locate 
the  orientations  and   magnitudes  of  maximum  normal  and  shear  stresses  / strains!
