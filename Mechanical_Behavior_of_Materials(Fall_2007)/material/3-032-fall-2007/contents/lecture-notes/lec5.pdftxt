Which cross-section do I choose for moment of inertia, I ?


In equilibrium, the beam resists any bending due to applied loads, so we choose  

the cross-section that is perpendicular to the axis of that intended bending:


P [N] 

axis of bending


What is the moment of inertia

…and why are there multiple Ix  in Appendix D?


Strictly speaking, we mean the area moment of 
inertia, which relates to the resistance of that 
area to bending. It is also called the second 
moment of inertia or the second moment of 
area about the x-axis, taken over the tiny area 
dA, where y is the distance from the x-axis to 
dA: 

Appendix D from Bedford/Liechti in your 3.032 
Course Reader (p. 1-28) doesn’t annotate this 
well, and for some cross-sections like a rectangle 
gives Ix and Ix’. Both are area moments of 
inertia, but differ depending on whether they 
assume the x-axis is located along the centroid 
(x’) or located at the bottom of the shape (x). 

Neither is “incorrect”, but if we assume that the 
cross-section is made of a homogeneous 
material, we typically take this moment about the 
centroid or center of mass. In other words, the Ix’ 
in this appendix are the more standard 
expressions. 

Here is simpler table of centroids and area 
moments of inertia for solid cross-sections, and 
also for a hollow cylinder:
