Force-extension (F vs. λ) of F-actin filaments, polymerized actin protein bundles 
that comprise the cytoskeleton in tissue cells, exhibit hyperelastic or rubber 
elasticity predicted by the Worm-Like Chain (WLC) model.

λ-DNA (used in 3.034 Lab 3):
• How long is it (#AA)?
• How stiff is it (dF/dz)?
• How many AA in the rigid 
segments (Lp)?
• How much force does it take 
to uncoil coiled DNA?
