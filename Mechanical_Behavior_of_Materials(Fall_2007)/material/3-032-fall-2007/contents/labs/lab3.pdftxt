Plastic deformation

from the micro- to nanoscale


PreLab Questions: 

1.	 Name 2 ways in which instrumented indentation is different from 
uniaxial mechanical testing of materials. 

2.  Explain the physical meaning of a material's "hardness" in words. 

I. Introduction 

There are several examples in materials engineering in which materials are available 
only in small volumes – either because they result from new, expensive and difficult 
processing techniques, or because they are designed intentionally to be small in one 
dimension. An example of the latter is a thin film or structural coating.  In such cases, 
mechanical properties cannot be quantified easily through uniaxial force-displacement 
testing of structures (e.g., Laboratory Experiment 1) or stress-strain responses of 
macroscale materials (e.g., Laboratory Experiment 2). One alternative is mechanical 
testing based on three-dimensional contact between the sample surface and a rigid 
probe of known geometry and mechanical properties. In this experiment, you will 
analyze the contact response of several classes of materials via the simple but widely 
used approach of microscale hardness testing, as well as the more quantitative 
instrumented indentation testing at the nanoscale. We analyze the data from such 
experiments using concepts from contact mechanics. 

In hardness testing, a probe such as a cone-shaped diamond is pushed into a flat, 
well-polished sample surface to a specific maximum load, held for a specified duration, 
and then retracted from the surface.

Ares  is the projected (2-dimensional) 
area of the indentation that is observed after unloading (residual) via optical microscopy. 
As shown in Eq. (1), hardness has units of [N/m2], but is not physically equivalent to 
stress because the measured projected area of the indentation is not the actual area 
normal to the applied load of the 3-dimensional indenter. 
One of the early applications of hardness was as an approximate measure of the 
yield strength σy  of the material. For materials that undergo plastic deformation primarily 
via slip (e.g., metals for which dislocation motion requires shear stress), it has been 
demonstrated empirically and by “slip line theory” that: 
H ~ 3σy

In instrumented indentation, the experimental approach is quite similar, but the load P 
and the depth of penetration h of the indenter are measured continuously during loading 
and unloading (Fig. 1).  If Pmax  < 100 nN or hmax  < 100 nm, this is termed 
nanoindentation (but be aware that the term is often used in the literature even when 
the deformation actually exceeds this range). The result is a load-displacement 
response that is similar to that obtained in uniaxial mechanical testing, but the loading is 
multiaxial and thus more complex to analyze in terms of uniaxial mechanical properties 
such as E and σy. Most importantly, the geometry of the indenter dictates that there is a 
power-law relationship between P and h even during elastic deformation, unlike the 
linear relationship expected for uniaxial testing of a material in the elastic regime.

Hardness can also be calculated from these data according to Eq. (1), but the 
advantage of this approach is that the actual projected contact area A can be computed 
from the  P – h response rather than measured for each experiment. For the conical 
indenter used in this experiment:

where S= dP/dh|Pmax  is the tangent to the unloading portion of the P - h response and is 
also called stiffness S. The area between the loading and unloading portions of the P – 
h response directly quantifies the amount of work required to plastically deform the 
material Wp, and therefore the yield strength σy  can be calculated as a function of Wp. 
Note that instrumented micro- and nanoindentation are used for a range of 
purposes other than mechanical property extraction, including fracture toughness and 
residual stress determination in physically small samples (e.g., enamel-dentin junction 
of teeth) as well as dislocation nucleation (which requires high stresses and high 
displacement resolution). 

II.  Objectives 
The objectives of this experiment are to: 
1.	 Conduct hardness tests on: an amorphous ceramic (glass); 2 ductile metals, an alloy 
(brass) and a pure metal (copper); 2 polymers (low density polyethylene and 
ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene); and a heat-treated metal for which the 
microstructure and mechanical properties vary as a function of distance from the 
surface (case-hardened steel). 
2.	 Conduct and analyze nanoindentation as a function of Pmax  for two samples: bulk, 
pure copper and a thin film of pure copper on silicon.  Extract elastic modulus E and 
indentation hardness H from these data. 
3.	 Explore mechanical properties including elastic, plastic, and fracture behavior for this 
wide range of materials from the micro- to nanoscale.  Understand how structure,
