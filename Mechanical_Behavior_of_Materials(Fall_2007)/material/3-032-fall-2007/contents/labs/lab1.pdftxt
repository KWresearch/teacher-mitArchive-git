LABORATORY EXPERIMENT 1

Stress Transformations

and Pressure Vessels


PreLab Questions: 
1.	 What direction experiences the largest normal stress for a

pressurized cylindrical vessel and why?

2.	 What raw data is experimentally measured using a strain gauge 
and how is it converted into strain? 

I. Introduction 

Pressure vessels are typically cylinders with sealed ends designed to 
withstand large changes in internal pressure without failing catastrophically. An 
example of a well-designed pressure vessel is a metal (aluminum or stainless 
steel) beverage can, which is pressurized to maintain carbonation of the 
beverage. In this experiment, you will learn how to measure strains quantitatively 
during internal and external deformation of such pressure vessels, and to 
calculate from these strains the principal stresses of the cylindrical pressure 
vessel. Other examples of pressure vessels are given below :

II.  Objectives 

The objectives of this experiment are to: 
1.	
Instrument a pressure vessel with strain gages. 
2.	 Measure strain as a function of internal loading (pressurization) for 
both aluminum and steel beverage cans, and estimate the critical 
internal pressure for each can type. 
3.	 Use Mohr’s circle to resolve stresses calculated for an angle relative to 
the principal stress directions onto the principle stress axes. 
4.	 Compare the principal stress states from analytical formulations of 
stress as a function of pressure and geometry σ(P, r, t) and stress as a 
function of mechanical properties and strain σ(E, ε). 
5.	 Measure the force-displacement response and critical buckling load of 
unpressurized vessels under external loading (uniaxial compression). 
6.	 Compare the experimental and theoretical buckling loads for a 
pressure vessel that is not infinitely long compared to its diameter.
