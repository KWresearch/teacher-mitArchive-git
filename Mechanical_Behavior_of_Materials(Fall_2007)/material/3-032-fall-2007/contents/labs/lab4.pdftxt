Structural Origins of the Mechanical 

Properties of Materials 


PreLab Questions: 

1.  We are testing several materials under identical conditions (strain 
rate, maximum load, environment). Why must we note the 
dimensions of each sample to compute and compare mechanical 
properties among these materials? 
2.  How do true stress and true strain differ from engineering stress and 
engineering strain, in terms of both physical meaning and equations? 

NOTE: 
•  Bring a calculator.

I. Introduction 
The uniaxial tensile and compression tests are one of the simplest and most widely 
used experiments to characterize the mechanical properties (e.g., strength, stiffness, 
ductility, and toughness) of a material.  The engineering stress vs. engineering strain 
data obtained from such tests have direct design implications, and thus uniaxial tension 
and compression tests are used routinely to compare the mechanical properties of 
different materials, to assist in the development of new materials, and for quality control.  
Relevant definitions and equations: 
In uniaxial testing, typically the displacement is controlled at a desired rate, and the 
displacement and resulting load are recorded continuously. The load is measured via a “load 
cell” which is in fact a series of strain gages. For precise measurements of mechanical 
properties, strain gages are fixed to the “gage section” of the specimen; for less precise 
measurements, the engineering strain is inferred directly from the normalized change in 
displacement: 

 
 
 
 
 
εe = ∆L/Lo
where ∆L is the measured displacement and Lo is the initial gage length of the sample. 
Engineering stress can be calculated directly from the measured load P as: 
(2)
 
σe = P/Ao 
 
 
 
 
where Ao is the initial cross sectional area of the sample (area normal to the loading direction). 

(1)

However, the true stress and strain differ from these engineering expressions during plastic 
deformation, due to the continuous change in cross-sectional area and conservation of material 
volume. True stress and strain are related directly to engineering stress and strain as: 
(3) 
εt = ln (1 + εe) 
(4) 
σt = σe (1 + εe) 
By determining specific mechanical properties from the stress-strain response, materials can be 
compared directly without reference to geometry. For example, resilience, or the capacity of a 
material to elastically absorb energy, is quantified by the modulus of resilience UR: 
2/2E 
(5) 
UR = ½ σyεy = ½ σy*[σy/E] = σy
which is just the strain energy density (area under the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve). 
Similarly, the toughness, or the capacity of a material to plastically absorb energy, is quantified 
by the modulus of toughness UT: 

UT ~ (σu + σy)/2 * εf
(6)
 
 
 
 
which is a crude estimate of the energy or total area under the plastic portion of the engineering 
stress-strain curve. Thus, toughness includes both strength and ductility. Finally, strain 
hardening is a measure of the incremental resistance to plastic deformation after yielding.  
Although the strict definition of the strain hardening exponent n in terms of true stress and true 
strain is: 

n
(7)
 
 
 
 
 
σt = Kεt
(where K is an empirical value called the strength coefficient) and n is determined as the slope 
of the log(σt) vs. log(εt), the degree of strain hardening is readily apparent from the engineering 
stress-strain curve as the difference between the yield stress and maximum stress. 

In this lab, you will compare the bulk mechanical properties of several classes of 
materials, measured via uniaxial mechanical testing. These materials include pure 
metals and alloys, ceramic, polymers, and natural composites.

II.  Objectives 

The objectives of this experiment are to: 
1.  Gain experience in uniaxial testing of a wide range of materials. 
2.  Calculate the relevant elastic, plastic, and fracture properties of these materials from 
the stress-strain responses. 
3.  Compare elastoplastic properties measured under uniaxial loading to those 
predicted from local surface tests (hardness and indentation). 
4.  Interpret these results in the context of the nano- to micro- to macroscopic 
mechanisms of deformation.
