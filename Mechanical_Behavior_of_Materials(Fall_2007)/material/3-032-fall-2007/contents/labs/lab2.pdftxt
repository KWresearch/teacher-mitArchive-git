I.  Introduction 
The elastic  (reversible) and plastic  (irreversible) behavior of materials can be described 
by  mechanical  properties  such  as  elastic  moduli  (E)  and  yield  stress  (σy).  These 
mechanical  properties  quantify  the  average  behavior  of  materials  that  are  idealized  as 
semi-infinite blocks with  no underlying microstructure,  or  a continuum. However, elastic 
and  plastic  properties  clearly  derive  from  the  arrangement  and  interaction  of  atoms 
and/or molecules that comprise the material.  If you deform a material there  is a change 
in  the  internal  energy  between  atoms,  the  interatomic  potential  U(r),  where  r  is  the 
distance between atom centers.  The interatomic potential is the summation of attractive 
and repulsive forces between atoms and characterized by the Lennard-Jones Equation: 

The  force felt between atoms is related to the derivative of the  interatomic potential and 
the elastic modulus is related to the second derivative of the interatomic potential. 

In  this  laboratory  experiment,  we  will  model  and  measure  the  atomistic  and  molecular 
origins  of  elasticity  and  plasticity.  By  understanding  the  fundamental  mechanisms  of 
deformation,  we  will  be  able  to  predict  continuum  level  mechanical  properties,  and  to 
suggest atomistic changes to alter these mechanical properties. 

In 1947, years before the transmission electron microscope had been developed to 
observe materials at atomic length scales, Prof. W. Bragg of the Cavendish Laboratory 
in Cambridge University, UK, conceived of modeling metal crystals via rafts of bubbles. 
Legend has it that this idea occurred to him while pouring oil into his lawn mower, when 
he noticed that the bubbles formed in this viscous solution easily formed closely packed 
rafts that resembled the close-packed {111} plane in crystals. He and his graduate 
students created rafts in glycerine/soap solutions, simulating defect-free metal crystals, 
and measured the interbubble potential and elastic and plastic properties of this model 
metal.  It turns out that small bubbles floating on a soap solutions have the same forces 
between them as atoms in a metal and the interbubble potential is equivalent to the 
interatomic potential.  Having characterized the atomistic and continuum level behavior 
of this model metal, Bragg et al. later used the bubble raft to consider how defects 
impact mechanical properties of crystals1.

II.  Objectives 
The objectives of this experiment are to: 
1.	 Create  a  perfect  single  crystal model  via  a  soap  bubble  raft  and  an  alternative 
bubble raft. 
2.	 Determine  how  solution  density  and  internal  bubble  pressure  affect  the 
energetics (interbubble potential) of the model crystal. 
3.	 Compare  the  atomistic  and  continuum  interpretations  of  elastic  and  plastic 
behavior in the model crystal.

In order to simplify the final expression we introduce Laplace’s Constant, 

In order for bubbles to behave like atoms in a crystal, internal bubble pressure (Pint) 
must be greater than the hydrostatic pressure acting on the bubble (Phydro).
