Term Project Phase 3 

I.  DESCRIPTION 

 

Term Project  3  is  the  final  data-collection exercise  for  your  term  project. At  this phase,  you have  to  choose 
one of  the  two projects you proposed  in Term Project 2, and gather extensive  information on  it. Because of 
this,  you  will  NOT  be  required  to  submit  a  polished  report.    For  this  phase  you  may  submit  hard  copies  of 
your  raw  data  in  any  form  (this  may  include  copies  from  project  reports,  proposals,  computer  printouts, 
screen shots or memos)—See note on confidentiality below.   However,  if you choose  to submit hardcopies, 
they must be submitted  to Professor no  later  than 1pm Wednesday, April 28. Remember  that your objective 
here  is  to  collect  as much  data  as  is  necessary  to  support  your  arguments  and  analysis  in  the  term  project 
Part 4, and NOT to prepare a polished report. 

The  following questions are  intended  to guide and direct your data collection. Try  to gather  information  that 
answers these questions, either in its initial (raw) form, or after some interpretation or analysis. 

II.  PROJECT EVALUATION 

o  What  were  the  major  anticipated  achievements  of  the  project  and  what  resources  were  thought  to  be 
required in order to obtain those benefits (social, financial, strategic).

o  What activities were undertaken to evaluate the project? 
o 
If the perceived benefits changed during the course of the project, how and why did they change?  
o  How realistic and relevant were the project goals and objectives? 
o  What changed as a result of the project?  
o  Are there more cost-effective ways to achieve the project's objectives?  
o  Feasibility Analysis  
o  Develop success indicators and their measures 
o 
Identify technology, cost and schedule risk 
o 
Identify Environmental Factors and risks  
o  Challenge potential risk & benefit buffers and sources of flexibility

groups, consultants, and  research groups  that  interacted with  the main organizations.   Also  include  the 
frequency, type of interaction, and rationale of the interactions. 
o  Process used to forge the organizational structure. 
o  Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS). 
o  Management of personnel and flow of personnel into the project.

o  Describe any known looping in any activity or very erratic activities with rework and changes. 
o  Any  overlapping  or  concurrent  engineering  practiced  on  the  project  including  the  effects  of  work 
progress and sensitivity from downstream and upstream activities. 
 

V.  PROJECT MONITORING 

o  Review  Processes  including  type  of  review,  review  frequency,  format,  personnel  involved,  review 
results and follow-up. 
o  Earned Value Analysis including frequency and any decisions made based on it. 
o  Strategy used to monitor buffers and/or float. 
o  Methods of variance tracking. 
o  Effects of other projects on resources, time, or technology. 
o  A  description  of  any  performance  measurements  that  the  project  used.    Assess  the  usefulness  of  the 
measurements  and  look  for  correlation  between  the  values  of  the  measurements  and  the  success  or 
failure of the project. 
o  A  description  of  any  risk  management  techniques  that  were  used  during  the  program.    Discuss  the 
“return on investment” between the effort spent on the techniques and benefits of the risk program. 
o  How was the technical baseline managed? 
o  Direct cost of any added work and/or scope/program changes. 
o  Types of conflicts on the project and how they changed over time.

VI. PROJECT CONTROL: 

Spring 2004 

Term Project Phase 3 

o  Process of committee decision-making. 
o  Use and effectiveness of committees.   
o  Describe  any  reorganizations  that  took  place  during  the  project  and why  (e.g. work  changes  or  project 
evolution). 
o  Describe  the  delay  classification,  analysis,  management  and  responsibility  assignment  methods  used 
on the project for the main organization, clients, sub-contractors, and consultants. 
 

VII. 

POST PROJECT LEARNING: 

o  Final or forecasted, actual project cost. 
o  Final or forecasted Completion Date. 
o  Actual required effort (e.g. person hours/days/weeks/months and no. of drawings) so far or forecasted.  
o  Percentage of final effort that was rework so far or forecasted. 
o  Of  the degradation  in  productivity and/or work quality  from  optimal over  the  course of  the project, what 
percentage was due to: 
o  Prior work quality (in phase)? 
o  Availability and/or quality of work from other phases? 
o  Availability and/or quality of work from vendors, suppliers, and sub-contractors? 
o  Skill and experience dilution?

Identify an area in which a model could have been developed for an uncertain or problematic task. 
o  Describe  any  repetitious  work  over  time  or  at  different  locations  in  which  line  of  balance  could  have 
been applied. 
 
 
Provide a description and analysis of  the project on how you may have  improved  the project  to avoid some 
of the problems that occurred and strengthen the successes that were achieved. 

While completing this task, please bear in mind that the objective is to provide enough information about the 
project  so  that  a  project  manager  not  familiar  with  it  may  be  able  to  review  the  material  and  have  a  clear 
understanding of  the project’s history.   A good  frame of  reference  for your data collection  is  to assume  that 
the  information you provide will be read by a new project manager who will  take charge of  the project.   Also 
bear in mind that the story has to flow and be clear to the person reading it.

Term Project Phase 3 

Notes on Data Collection: 
1.  Obtain information for major work phases or activities where relevant/possible  

2.  Use interviews and/or best-estimates where hard data is not readily available. 

3.  Think of interesting information that one may want to know about the project. Talk about a situation that 
may  be  interesting,  challenging  or  unique.  Identify  a  protagonist  who  addresses  the  situation.  Talk 
about  what  happened  and  what  could  have  been  done  in  that  situation  by  the  protagonist.  Identify  at 
least  one  situation,  protagonist  and  solution  for  each  major  area  of  evaluation,  organization,  planning, 
monitoring, control and learning.  

Note on Confidentiality: 
If  the  project  you  are  working  on  contain  proprietary  information,  or  any  sensitive  information,  you  should 
protect  this  information as  requested by  the project manager working on  the project.   Some alternatives are 
to scale the data so that in a relative sense they are equivalent or you could also use percentages without a 
base number. 

Note on Project Plan: 
When  developing  and/or  describing  your  project,  please  limit  your  overall  analysis  and  presentation  to 
Levels  1  and  2  as  shown  in  the  figure  below.    Extend  your  analysis  to  Level  3  (i.e. more  in  depth  analysis 
and  greater  detail)  when  presenting  issues  that  contained  (or  are  anticipated  to  contain)  high  degrees  of 
uncertainty  or  were  (or  anticipated  to  be)  particularly  challenging  or  important  so  that  the  individual 
reviewing your material has a good sense of the details and how they relate to the overall project.
