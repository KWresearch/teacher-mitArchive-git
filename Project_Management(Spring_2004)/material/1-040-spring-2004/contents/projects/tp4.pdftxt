Term Project Phase 4 

I.  REPORT 

You are responsible for developing a case study of the project assigned to your group on the term project 2. 
This case study should be developed in such a way that a person not familiar with the project could obtain a 
clear  understanding  of  the  project  in  general  terms  of  the  evaluation,  organization,  planning,  monitoring, 
control and learning processes.  

Please  note  that  you  should  also  identify  a  situation  for  each  phase  (evaluation,  organization,  planning, 
monitoring,  controlling  and  learning).  This  situation  should  present  something  interesting,  challenging  or 
unique  about  this  project.  Provide  as  much  fact  as  possible  in  the  description  of  the  situation.  Also 
remember  to  identify  the  issues  that  are  relevant  to  that  situation.  Once  you  have  the  situation,  please 
identify  the  protagonist  of  that  situation.  The  protagonist  is  the  person  or  team  responsible  for  making  a 
decision or addressing the issues or challenges of the situation. Then you need to present what was done in 
the  project  for  this  particular  situation.  Provide  as  much  detail  as  you  could  obtain.  Finally  describe  what 
your  team would have done different  in  this situation  if you were  the protagonist. Support your decision with 
proper reference to any material from the class, homework, recitation or the literature. 

While completing  this section, please bear  in mind  that  the objective  is  to provide enough  information about 
the  project  so  that  a  person  not  familiar  with  it  may  be  able  to  review  the  material  and  have  a  clear 
understanding of  the projectâ€™s history.   A good  frame of  reference  for your data collection and analysis  is  to 
assume  that  the  information  you  provide  will  be  used  by  a  new manager  who  will  take  responsibility  of  the 
project.   

In  this  section  of  your  report  please  include  all  data  that  is  relevant  to  your  analysis  and  your  arguments 
emphasizing how the project  is being managed.   Any data that  is not relevant to your analysis or arguments 
should  be  included  in  an  appendix  with  a  brief  description  of  why  this  data  was  not  needed.    Also  in  your 
appendix, please list any data from the list provided that could not be acquired with a brief explanation as to 
why this data was not available to you. 

Note:  When  writing  your  case  study,  please  ensure  that  your  story  flows,  and  that  your  arguments  are 
logically consistent, well supported, and clear to the person reading your report.   

II.  PRESENTATION 

Create  a  table  or  chart  capturing  the  concepts  learned  in  class  that  were  applied  to  the  project  you  are 
studying.    Also  add  any  concepts  that  are  part  of  the  contractor,  owner,  designer  or  construction  manager 
culture.  Remember that learning can be positive or negative (i.e. Success or Failure). 

Prepare  a  30-minute  presentation  (i.e.  20  minutes  of  presentation  with  10  minutes  for  questions)  on  your 
case study for an audience of upper management charged with reviewing the project. 

Note: The time limit of 20 minutes above is a strict upper limit and will be enforced during the presentations.
