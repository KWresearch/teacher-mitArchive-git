Term Project Phase 1 

features  you want  to  learn more  about. Use  a  project  related  to  other  subjects  if  you want,  and most  of  all, 
have fun! 

Groups 
We have assigned you to groups of 5 students.    

Projects 
Section  3  lists  the  projects  in  which  you  showed  interest  during  the  1st  phase  of  the  term  projects  (TP1).  
Section 3 also  lists some projects  that have  just been completed or are  in progress or planned at MIT.   You 
will be working on two projects from this list for this phase of the term project.   

In order  to select on which particular projects you will be working, you will need  to send an ordered   ranking 
of the projects below – in other words, send a list of the projects below, ordered according to their interest to 
you.  The topmost project in this list should be your most desired project.    We will assign projects to groups 
based on a set of simple rules:   

• 

• 

• 

If  a  project  has  been  proposed  by  only members  of  a  single  team  and  the  proposers’  team  wants 
the project and still needs it to fulfill their quota of two projects, their group can have it.  
If  two  or  more  teams  including  proposers  of  a  given  project  want  and  need  the  project  to  fill  their 
quotas, it is allocated to one of them based on a lottery.   
If the project is not taken by a proposer’s team, it is given to the group that ranks it the highest and 
needs it to fill their quota. 
If two or more groups  in still  in need of a project rank a project equally, it will be assigned to one of 
those groups based on a lottery.   
Note:  Because of the algorithm used above, you can consider it a “sure thing” to get a project if it is one that 
you  or  someone  else  in  your  group  uniquely  proposed  and  if  you  have  not  already  received  two  projects 
ranked above that project.  So to spare yourself work in ordering the projects, you can take advantage of the 
fact that you only have to list as far to include two projects that a member of your group uniquely proposed.   

• 

Please  send  this  ranking  no  later  than  noon  on  Friday,  March  5.    The  time  between  release  of  this 
document and  this deadline should give  you an opportunity  to  “poke around” and see what  you can  find on 
certain  projects,  as  well  as  to  talk  with  colleagues  in  your  group  (our  outside  your  group  but  who  were 
responsible  for  other  project  suggestions).    Please  read  the  instructions  in  the  assignment  below  and 
consider  these  carefully  when  ranking  projects.    Be  especially  careful  about  taking  on  projects  when  you 
may not be able to get gather sufficient information about them. 

For  the  assignment,  you  should  strive  to  learn  about  the  projects.  Investigate,  at  a  preliminary  level,  their 
characteristics.  Use  the  framework  taught  in  class;  divide  your  work  into  sections  for  financial  justification, 
organization,  planning, monitoring,  controlling  and  learning  from  the  project.  Identify  interesting  and  unique 
features  in  both  managerial  and  technical  levels.  For  each  phase  of  the  projects,  identify  sources  of  data 
that you can use.   We  recognize  that you may not be able  to get perfect – or even  reliable –  information on 
all stages or aspects of a project; well-documented discussion of really interesting aspects of certain phases 
or  components  of  a  projects  will  help  make  up  for  omissions  caused  by  lack  of  data.    When  rankinig 
potential projects, however, do keep in mind,  that you will probably want to take on one of these projects for 
later  phases  of  the  term  project  –  and  if  you  have  trouble  getting  even  rough  data  now,  you  may  have  a 
more difficult time getting additional detail later.

II.  DELIVERABLES 

Spring 2004 

Term Project Phase 1 

Produce a 3-5 page report for each project, in which you describe your projects in a way that a professional 
project  manager  would  understand  and  be  interested  in.  Include  pictures  and  graphs  as  you  see  fit.  Your 
report should be divided into at least 4 sections: 

1.  Overall description (where, when, why, current status, participants etc.) 
2.  Project  management  framework:  Identify  features  and  characteristics  of  your  project  in  the 
framework taught in class: 
i.  Evaluation 
ii.  Organization 
iii.  Planning 
iv.  Monitoring 
v.  Controlling 
vi.  Learning 
3. 
Identify key issues or problems that you regard as unique in your project. 
4.  Wear  the  shoes  of  a  project  auditor,  who  is  asked  to  produce  a  report  on  learning  from  the 
particular  project.  Your  report  will  be  used  as  educational  material  for  other  people  in  your 
company. Given  the  time and  “cost”  constraint on  your  investigation, decide on  the  features of  the 
project that provide the maximum learning value for your peers.  
In an appendix, name  the  sources of  further data  you  intend  to  collect. Describe how  this data will 
be useful in your investigation.

III. PROPOSED PROJECTS 

Please  find  here  the  projects  proposed  by  each  of  you.  You  have  each  other’s  contact  information  of  the 
proposer if are interested in a project and want to ask for e.g. additional information about availability of data 
sources.   Please  note  that  the  text below  is  copied  from  the  project descriptions  –  in  some  case  it  includes 
first-person  comments,  and  is  not  guaranteed  to  be  accurate!    The  information  below  is  pulled  from  a wide 
variety  of  submissions  by  students.    Please  alert  the  professor  to  inaccuracies  in  the  attributions.    Please 
note  in  particular  that  one  project  (the  Pac-Bell  project)  originated  from  an  unlabeled  source;  the  proposer 
for this project should identify themselves to the professor to be ensured “first dibs” on the project. 

JFK Airtrain Monorial  
Location- Queens, NY 
Status- Completed 
Recently  completed,  the  monorail  connects  JFK  airport  to  NYC  Public  Transportation,  specifically  the 
subway lines.  Unsure of its ownership but I believe it is the port authority (NY/NJ)  

Simmons Hall  
Location- Cambridge, MA 
Status- Completed 
Privately  owned  by  MIT  and  completed  a  couple  of  years  ago  to  serve  as  an  undergraduate  dorm.    High 
profile  due  to  prestigious  architect  and  very  costly.   Wide  variety  of  challenging  issues  during  construction. 
Rumors of discontent among some current residents.   Medium sized project.  The professor can probably 
provide limited access to project superintendent and project manager.

Status -- Ongoing 

Spring 2004 

Term Project Phase 1 

Very interesting design.  A railway runs through the building.  Innovative energy-saving mechanisms based 
on Air-vapor-barriers used.  Interesting challenges and techniques to overcome concerns about noise and 
vibration in nearby buildings.  Planning flexibility allowed for material substitution based on market price 
changes.  The professor can probably provide contacts with team members. 

Central Artery & Tunnel Project (“Big Dig”) 
Location- Boston, MA 
Status -- Ongoing 

Only megaproject on the list.  Highly complex, controversial, expensive.  Lots of good local coverage.  
The professor can provide contacts. 

Davenport Commons  
Location- Roxbury MA 
Status -- Ongoing 

Mixed-housing development by Northeastern, Madison Park Development Corporation, and the lower 
Roxbury community that was opened in September of 2001. Davenport Commons, was a $51 million project 
that provided a housing for Northeastern students and mixed-income families. It also created more than 
2000 square feet of commercial space on Tremont Street. Could be an interesting study on how the various 
stakeholders where able to come to a consensus throughout the project. This is a completed project. No 
personal contacts for this project. However, the information may be accessible by contacting Northeastern, 
Madison Park and/or the Roxbury community.

Spring 2004 

Term Project Phase 1 

Housing complex in Boston encompassing just over 100,000 sf. 

 

Camp Bondsteel (United States Army KFOR)  
Location- Boston, MA 
Status – Completed 
 
Due  to downsizing and  the shifting of construction assets  to  the Reserves and National Guard,  the Army no 
longer  has  the  equipment  or  personnel  on  hand  to  handle  large  scale  construction  projects.    The  military 
contracts most of  this work out  to Brown & Root.    I  think  it would be  interesting  to  focus on  the contract  that 
Brown  &  Root  completed  in  constructing  American  basecamps  in  Kosovo.    Camp  Bondsteel  serves  as  the 
nerve center of American operations  in Kosovo, and Brown & Root was  responsible  for every aspect of  the 
project’s development,  from  acquirement  of  land  and  resources  to  construction  of barracks, helipads, mess 
halls,  hospitals  and  other  facilities.    I  would  imagine  that  particulars  on  the  contract  would  be  readily 
available either  through  the Army Corps of Engineers or Brown & Root.   While Brown & Root still maintains 
a  large  presence  in  Kosovo  to  maintain  the  facilities  they  constructed,  they  completed  the  majority  of  their 
contracted work in 1999/2000.  
 

Case Middle School  
Location- Honolulu, HI 
Status – Underway, to be completed Summer 2004 

$60 million new middle school constructed within operating school environment.  Includes a parking 
structure, auditorium, 9 classrooms and roadwork.  Key construction issues: safety (existing middle and high 
schools currently in session), Green Building classification.  Financed: Private K-12 institution, large 
endowment from alumnus Steve Case (former AOL Chairman). 
 

JFK Airport Terminal 4 Expansion  
Location- Queens, NY (John F Kennedy International Airport) 
Status – Completed 

Approximately a $900M construction project that created an additional 1.5M SF of terminal and retail space 
for the international terminal at the airport.  I have some basic information on this project, and feel that I 
could possibly get more. 
 

Force Protected Office Building  
Location- US Naval Base, Bahrain 
Status – Completed 

Construction of a force protected office building at the US Naval Base in Bahrain.  This project was a three 
story, $700K, CMU and concrete facility meeting all US force protection standards for the Middle East.  The 
project has recently been completed, and experienced large coordination, design, and scheduling 
challenges due to its location and stringent completion timeline requirement.  This project was an interesting 
 
design-build project that I can get information on.

Status – Completed 

Spring 2004 

Term Project Phase 1 

The NJ Dept. of Transportation has been reconstructing the Route 24/287 interchange. There are 
environmental and traffic impacts from this, there were many contractor issues, not to mention scheduling 
problems and design problems. It's a retrofit to a thirty-year-old design, and it's basically done now (at least 
 
as far as traffic is concerned). 

Kimmel Center  
Location- Philadelphia, PA 
Status – Completed 

Theater in Philadelphia, PA; 450,000 sq ft, takes up an entire city block; $265 million; Private financing. 

 

Texas Air National Guard Relocation  
Location- Fort Worth, TX 
Status – Completed 

7 Building complex, BRFAC funded.  Building construction includes a hangar, warehouse, administrative 
area, trans.  Information likely available via Freedom of Information Act. (Unclear how long would take to 
obtain information). 
 

Los Angeles Air Force Base Medical Clinic  
Location- Los Angeles 
Status – Completed 

$10M medical/dental facility.  Design-bid-build. Information likely available via Freedom of Information Act.

Location- Los Angeles 
Status – Completed 

$6M facility.  Design-build. Information likely available via Freedom of Information Act. (Unclear how long 
would take to obtain information). 
 

MIT projects  

Zeisiger Athletic Facility   
Status – Completed.  Dr. Osgood can provide contacts. 
http://web.mit.edu/evolving/projects/zesiger/index.html
 

MIT Biology Building 
Status – Completed 
Expensive  and  innovative  design.    Lots  of  unexpected  requests  by  faculty  during  construction.    Design 
incorporated  flexibility  to  accommodate  shifting  needs  over  time,  and  had  to  deal  with  complicated 
groundwater requirements. The professor can probably provide contractor contacts.
