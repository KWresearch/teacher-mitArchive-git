Calculations for the Unified Network Model with Negative Link Durations

Forward Pass:

Step 1:

Step 2:

¥
¥
¥
Set PL(i) = -      and TL(i) = -     , where      is a number larger than any link duration.
Set TL(PS) = 0
where PS = the project start node
PL(i) = the maximim distance from PS to node i
TL(i) = the maximim distance from PS to node i found at intermediate stages

Select node i for which TL(i) is the maximum among all nodes.
¥
Set PL(i) = TL(i) and TL(i) = -
For each link originating at node i,
¥
If PL(j) = -
and PL(i) + D(i, j) > TL(j),
then set TL(j) = PL(i) + D(i, j).
¥
If PL(j) = -
and PL(i) + D(i, j) < TL(j),
then do not change the labels on j.
¥
and PL(i) + D(i, j) > PL(j),
If PL(j) > -
¥
then set PL(j) = -
and TL(j) = PL(i) + D(i, j).
¥
If PL(j) > -
and PL(i) + D(i, j) > PL(j),
then do not change the label on j.

Step 3:

Step 4:

Repeat step 2 until  PL(PF) >  -  ¥
Set the earliest event time for each node, E(i) = PL(i).

, where PF is the project finish node.

Backward Pass:

Repeat application of the algorithm with the following changes:
1. Reverse each link direction.
2. Start with the project finish node PF with TL(PF) = 0.
3. At the end of step 3, set the latest event time, L(i) = E(PF) - PL(i) for all nodes i.
