Constructability Reviews
Constructability Reviews
A shared belief among contractors is that many scheduling problems, delays, disputes 
and technical difficulties during construction result from failure of the design 
professionals to consider how a builder will implement the design. This 
manifests itself in faulty working drawings, incomplete specifications, lack of 
standardization, complex contract language, but also in inherently “unbuildable” 
designs. Constructability reviews are a formal means of bridging the gap between 
designer and construction expertise so that these problems are overcome. 
Constructability issues should not drive the design, nor is the constructability review 
process (CRP) just a way to make life easier for the contractor. Rather, it is based 
on the idea that the design should accommodate constructability in its 
evolution from early on. 
A number of classification schemes for constructability information have aimed at 
identifying the areas where construction experts can contribute most to the design 
process .  These efforts have even resulted in automated expert systems that 
guide the conceptual design of a building with input about the structural 
material, the structural system, or details about the formwork, based on 
various parameters. The main benefit of this research, however, is the 
identification of constructability information that civil engineering designs 
lack, and the areas that should receive the most attention. Typically, these are 
issues that (1) provide the designer with plenty of flexibility, (2) have a high 
labour cost component, and (3) provide the greatest  opportunity for 
construction errors.

Financial, Management and Project 
Financial, Management and Project 
Audits
Audits
A financial, a management and a project audit are three 
separate things.
Management audits examine the organization’s management 
while project audits are focused on the impact of the 
management organization on a particular project and vice-
versa. Moreover, both financial and project audits may share 
processes and investigation procedures. However, they have 
a different focus. Project audits focus, among other things, 
on the financial performance, the expenditures and the time 
spent on the project by the time of the audit, as they 
compare to the plan. Financial audits focus on the use and 
preservation of the organization assets. The scope of the 
project audit is broader compared to the limited scope of the 
financial audit.

Scope of Auditing
Scope of Auditing
A full-extent audit is a very time-consuming and costly procedure, and it is not usually conducted unless there is a reason to do so. It may be sufficient to audit
one integrated and complete part of the project – the one that seemingly caused problems or the one that has more lessons to offer. This way, organizations 
can achieve the best return on the process of auditing; i.e., minimize its cost while maximizing the benefit. Cost need not only be expressed in terms of money. 
The parameters that can be identified as costs associated with a project audit are the following:
Time: More often than not, time is seen as a constraint rather than the cost parameter. Indeed, audits are time-consuming, and projects are short of time. 
Therefore, it is the time constraint that partly dictates the depth of the audit. The relationship between time allocated and depth of the audits should be 
identified in the beginning of the audit life cycle if the audits are pre-planned, or mid-way through the project, whenever the audit is ordered. If the audit is a 
final evaluation of the project, conducted after it is over, then time may not represent a constrain, but rather a direct cost. In that case, the organization has to 
decide what can be the best benefit-cost ratio for an audit. 
Note that the time needed for an audit depends on the nature of the project, its size, its complexity, whether it is localized or geographically dispersed, and the 
degree of completion. As the value of an audit changes according to the stage on the life cycle of a project that it is performed, the degree of completion must 
be taken seriously into account when managing the trade-off between time and depth of the audit process .
Money: The budget for an audit, and therefore its depth and extend, are most often determined by its requester. In any case, the expected cost must be justified 
by the expected benefits. These may vary from claims settlement to pure learning. However, in general, pre-planned audits tend to cost less than exceptionally 
requested ones: The average cost of an audit decreases, as the procedure is standardized and follows a predetermined baseline. 
Impact on Performance: In the case of project audits conducted in the course of a project, the price paid for the audit is effect on personnel performance. 
Apart from the time the personnel has to spend to provide the audit team with all the necessary information, and the distraction this may cause, their morale is 
adversely affected. These effects can be alleviated with the use of information technology and “pull” information systems. Nevertheless, the more 
comprehensive, deep and time-consuming the audit process is, the greater its effect on personnel performance.
The time and money required and the impact on personnel performance are reasons for wanting to keep the auditing process as small and focused as possible. 
However, this contradicts the character of an audit as a holistic evaluation; if it is to fulfil the objectives it is designed for, the audit must address at least one 
relatively independent aspect of the project comprehensively. Depending on the goals of the audit and the constraints mentioned above, organizations choose 
to conduct the following types of audits:
The General Audit (or Overview) is usually carried out after the completion of milestones specified by predefined contractual agreements. The resulting report 
superficially covers different issues such as current project status, future project status, status of critical tasks, risk assessment and limitations and assumptions 
of the process. An overview is conducted when the available time and money pose significant constraints. 
The Detailed (or Administrative) Audit goes a step further than the overview. It examines some of the issues covered in the general audit in greater depth. The 
focus of the administrative audit may be on factors that offer themselves as lessons, cause problems or exhibit risky behavior. Care must be taken so that the 
detailed audit does not place factors out of context. Often, it will not be possible to isolate one aspect of the project and examine it independently; doing so 
may cause the auditor to miss cause-and-effect relationships and subsequently lead to wrong evaluations.
The Technical (or Technical Quality) Audit may be independent of the general overview of the administrative audit, as long as the technical aspects audited in 
loosely woven with the managerial ones. Some construction projects of low (or platform) technology, such as steel structures, may be audited independently 
from a technical perspective. The same applies to projects where the management methods completely (or almost completely) follow the technical issues, such 
as in some R&D projects. Technical audits are usually conducted early in the lifecycle of a project, because such decisions are taken early.

Existing Data
Existing data, created and stored during project execution, is usually found in the files of the project, in electronic or paper form. Unless classified, it should 
be readily available to the audit team. 
We will go over different data categories, their sources and usages:
-Customer (end-user) needs: The customer needs are not always explicit from the beginning of a project, even though these needs can be sometimes found in 
bidding documents and specifications, when the owners are sophisticated. Information about customer requirements can also be found in change orders and 
addenda. These documents can be vital in auditing contract termination, price adjustments and claims. Finally, relevant information can sometimes be found 
in unofficial records of meetings, early reviews, memorandums, facsimiles and emails.
-Specifications, Regulations and Technical Constrains that largely affect the product development process can be identified from the corresponding regulatory 
or engineering documents. In large projects that span over long time periods, they may change during development. 
-Schedule, Cost Performance and Relevant Constraints: The relevant data can come from records of expenditures, invoices, account balances and bank 
records. These financial measures can be related to schedule performance, which in turn can be found in records of schedule, sub-contractor’s reports, and 
technical reviews. The constraints imposed by the customer or other factors are usually either included in records of the organization or the entities that 
impose the constraints.
-Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): The work breakdown structure is obtained from early records of planning, subsequent reviews, and documents related to 
change orders and addenda. The derived breakdown structure should be examined and compared to the actual schedule for effectiveness and robustness. The 
purpose of investigating the work breakdown structure is to assure that the disaggregated work items correspond to directly measurable costs and time 
durations.
-The Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS): This can be easily obtained from the organization’s strategic management plan. The project OBS is usually 
stated explicitly for large projects. It should be compared to the structure that was actually materialized (this information can become available from 
interviews and memos), and whatever discrepancies should be evaluated for the possibility that they are more effective than the original design.
-Monitoring and Controlling Metrics and Methods: Monitoring metrics are amply available in peer review, walkthrough and inspection minutes. Relevant 
information can also be gathered by verbal examination and interviews, but monitoring records (e.g., schedules and baselines, resource allocation, quality 
certificates and approvals) are usually the most useful sources. In fact, the available information will probably be much more than what is needed for the audit. 
The audit team should examine and evaluate the monitoring metrics and methods used during development, for effectiveness, truthfulness, completeness and 
bias. 
-Risk and Contingency Allowances: Risk management records and policies are to be found with the monitoring documents of the project and the tactical 
management’s plans. Comparing initial assessment of risk factors with the project ecosystem’s actual evolution provides an ad hoc indication of the success of 
risk management.
-Staffing Policy and Arrangements: Information about staffing policies and procedures, as well as their effectiveness, can be sought in new personnel’s 
resumes, performance records and interview minutes. Direct interviews with the project teams and their supervisors can also reveal how effective the staffing 
arrangements were. The objective is to evaluate the policies and the decision-makers themselves, not to criticise the personnel hired or laid off.
-Communications Logs: It is wise practice for any organization to keep written records of all external communications. In the case of phone calls or live 
conversations, this can be done in the form of a “verification email” right after the call. For the auditor, the communication logs can provide insight to the 
human aspects and dynamics of problems, conflicts and personal tension, which often manifest (or become the cause of) more serious situations. 
Furthermore, communication logs can reveal the response mechanisms to problems, and the time lag from the generation of a problem till it becomes an 
important issue of discussion.

Identifying Possible Conflicts
Identifying Possible Conflicts

In order to identify the conflicts that surface in a project, we
review the common sources of conflict, accepting these as 
the major sources of conflict on any given project. If the 
project does, then that may be an indication that perhaps it 
was not a good project to undertake. Identifying which of 
these conflicts have the potential to occur and have an 
impact on the project is the hardest step in the process of 
designing a Conflict Management Plan.

Returning to the Brock and Kelly case, the siblings are facing the task of designing a 
Conflict Management Plan. Kelly identified the following as the major sources of 
conflict in the $1.5 billion program.
By local regulation, Kelly was restricted to competitively bidding all of the contracts. 
To align the objectives, reduce miscommunication and disruption she decided to 
invest in a Partnering program. In addition to Partnering, she hired and independent 
Program Manager to help handle the load of the projects that the government agency 
is taking on. independent Quality Control inspectors were also assigned to the 
construction phase to watch over the contractor. A clause was added in the contract 
that requires the contractor to provide a Quality Assurance representative as well. 
Both of these personnel aim to reduce the Performance and Quality conflicts. 
Following the preventions aspects of the Plan, Kelly opted to use a DRB to resolve 
disputes that arise to reduce the impacts of these disputes. This was not included in 
the Table because it applied to all of the sources of conflict. The DRB panel will 
consist of 3 members, one appointed by each party and a third jointly select by the 
appointees. Disputes can be submitted to the DRB at any time during the project only 
after the parties have attempted at least three rounds of good faith negotiations, with 
or without a mediator paid for by the owner. The DRB panel has the power to issue 
binding solutions so as not to affect the schedule of other contracts.
