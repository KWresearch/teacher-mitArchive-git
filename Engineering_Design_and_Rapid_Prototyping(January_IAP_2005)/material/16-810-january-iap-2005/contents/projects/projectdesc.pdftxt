Design Project 
 
 
A  hypothetical  Indy  racecar  manufacturer  seeks  bids  for  a  new  wing  design  for  their 
2005/2006  model  year  vehicles.  The  rear-mounted  wings  are  intended  to  maximize 
downward  force  (negative  lift),  while  at  the  same  time  minimizing  incremental  drag  and 
weight added  to  the vehicle. The wings have  to conform  to regulations  (constraints) and be 
designed  and  manufactured  in  an  economical  fashion.  Teams  comprised  of  two  students 
(one aerodynamicist, one structural engineer) will conceive, design, implement and operate 
a prototype wing and compete for the bid during a 4-week period in IAP 2005. 
 
 
I. 
 
The challenge for each Indy Car Team is the same every year. Design and develop a race car that 
is  safe,  durable,  and  competitive  in  different  racing  conditions  (Fig.1  left). A major  competitive 
element  in  race  car  design  is  efficient  aerodynamic  design  [1,2,3].  Team  designers  consider 
aerodynamic  efficiency  to  be  the  most  important  element  in  developing  a  competitive  race  car. 
Roughly  speaking,  aerodynamic  design  is  concerned  with  two  primary  elements:  reducing  drag 
(D)  and  increasing  downforce  (negative  lift,  L).  The  principles,  which  allow  aircraft  to  fly,  are 
also applicable in car racing. The main difference being that the wing or airfoil shape is mounted 
upside down producing downforce instead of positive lift (Fig.1, right).

Downforce  is necessary  in maintaining high speeds  through  the corners and  forces  the car  to  the 
track.  In  actual  race  car  design  there  are  complex  interactions  between  the  aerodynamics  of  the

Project Description 

front wing, rear wing and the main chassis as all three main components (in addition to the tires) 
contribute to both drag and downforce. In this project we will focus on the isolated design of one 
component of the race car: the rear wing. 
 
II. 
 
The project  for  IAP 2005  is  for  the students  to design and build a wing section,  its supports, and 
then  test  the wing  in  the wind  tunnel.   The students will be given some boundary conditions and 
a  nominal  operating  condition.    The  main  focus  is  on  carrying  out  an  end-to-end  conceive-
design-implement-operate (CDIO) process and to learn from that experience. 
 
The maximum design  envelope  for  the wing  and  its  support  structure  is 20” x 20” x 40”  (width, 
height, span).  The wing model can be created as an extrusion of a 2D wing section, thus limiting 
the  aerodynamic  analysis  to  2D  section  airfoils.    There  will  be  no  taper  or  dihedral,  thus 
simplifying  the  analysis  further  and  allowing  for  easier  manufacturing.  However,  taper  or 
dihedral are not explicitly forbidden in the final design.  
The  design  task  also  includes  developing  an  attachment method  of  the wing  to  the  supports  and 
load cell.  The support fixture attachment points to the wing strut are pre-defined. This will allow 
quickly mounting  and  comparing wing  designs  produced  by  different  teams.   An  example wing 
support strut is drawn below (Fig.2); a drawing such as this will be due as a deliverable.

Dimensions: 
There  are  two  support brackets  located 39.75  (+/-0.5)  inches  apart,  from  inside  surface  to  inside 
surface.    The  two  bolts  holes  (5/16th  O.D.)  on  each  end  of  side  the  supporting  fixture  are  16.0 
inches  apart,  and  1.0  inch  above  the  lower  plane  of  the  design  envelope.   The  support  fixture  is 
shown  in  the 3D view below  (Fig.3).   This  support  structure will  interface with  the hypothetical 
race car and the wind tunnel load cell. 
 

 

Fig. 3: Wing lower support structure and attachment points 
 
These  brackets  are  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  support  struts,  which  the  student  teams  will 
design.   The design of the support strut to the wing is left open to the student design teams.  The 
material available for students for the support struts/structure is either:  
A.  24 x 24 inch Aluminum 6061 plate, 0.125 inches thick 
B.  24 x 24 inch Aluminum 6061 plate, 0.25 inches thick. 
Note  that  the 0.25  inch  thick Aluminum plate  is  roughly 3  times  as  expensive  as  the 6061 plate, 
and  this  will  have  to  be  taken  account  for  in  the  student’s  manufacturing  reports  and  cost 
estimations.   
 
Wing/Strut Interface: 
 
The  attachment  of  the wing(s)  to  the  support  structure  can  be  done  via  epoxy.   The wing might 
also  need  to  be  fiberglassed  for  strength.    Another  option  is  to  include  a  supporting  spar  (a 
hollow  aluminum  rod,  inside  the  wing).    This  option  would  involve  cutting  through  the  wing, 
span  wise,  to  incorporate  a  hollow  aluminum  rod  for  support.    This  is  an  option  students  may 
have in case fiberglass is not available or desired, but note that there will be a penalty involved in 
costs  associated  with  time  to  cut  the  wing  and  complete  the  assembly.    Students  will  need  to 
make  an  informed  design  decision  with  regards  to  fiberglassing,  using  a  support  rod  or  other 
innovative interface method.   
 
The 3D view below (Figure 4) is an example of a completed wing assembly that students will be 
fitting  to  the  test  fixture. A similar 3D model  for  the wing and support structure will also be due 

3 

as a deliverable.  The example below is not meant to limit designer’s imagination, but provides a 
rough  idea of what  the completed product might  look  like. Note  that  the design shown  in Figure 
4 has not been optimized or  refined, but  that  it will be entered as  the official  (staff) contribution 
in the design competition.

III.  Competition Objective Function and Constraints 
 
The hypothetical race car manufacturer will compare all bids entered into the design competition. 
The winner of the competition will maximize the following objective function: 
 
Objective Function:   ma
x
 
Where 
 
 
 
 
The nominal speed is vo = 60 [mph]. Any change from this nominal condition will be announced 
within  the  first  week  of  IAP.  The  actual  objective  function  value  for  each  team  will  be 
determined during wind tunnel tests during the last week of IAP. 
 

L = measured downforce (negative lift) at speed vo [N] 
D = measured drag at speed vo [N] 
W = total weight of the assembly (w/o support structure shown in Fig. 3) [N]

All designs have to conform to the following constraints: 
 
Constraints: 
1.  All wing assembly designs must entirely fit in the 20” x 20” x 40” (width x height x span) 
design envelope specified in Section II of this document. 
2.  No external energy source is allowed as part of the device. 
3.  The interface of the assembly must conform to the hole locations and diameters specified 
in Figure 3. 
4.  The core of the wing must be built from blue insulation foam as provided by the staff. 
5.  The  attachment  structure  must  be  built  from  either  24  x  24  inch  Aluminum  6061  plate, 
0.125 inches thick or 24 x 24 inch Aluminum 6061 plate, 0.25 inches thick. 
6.  Attachments  between  wing(s)  and  structure  must  be  made  with  epoxy  (glue)  or 
miscellaneous attachment hardware currently available in the AA machine shop. 

 
Cost Estimate: 
All  final  designs  must  be  accompanied  by  a  cost  estimate,  which  includes  an  estimate  of  both 
labor  (hours worked) as well as material costs. A standard  form will be provided separately  (see 
also Section VI). 
 
Safety: 
Aside  from  attempting  to  optimize  the  objective  function,  student  teams  will  investigate  the 
performance  of  the  wing  over  the  entire  wind  speed  range  up  to  vo,  look  into  the  center  span 
deflection,  mass  of  wing,  mass  of  support  structure  and  natural  frequency  of  vibration  of  the 
wing  and  so  forth. Each wing  assembly must  pass  a  static  load  test  and  safety  inspection  before 
the assembly can be entered in the competition. There will be the option to fiberglass the outside 
of the foam wing to increase its stiffness and strength if deemed necessary. 
 
Design variables: 
Despite  the  constraints  stated  above  the  design  space  is  relatively  open.  It  can  be  characterized 
by looking at various design variables and configurations. The various lectures, interactions with 
faculty  and  staff  and  team  interactions  will  help  each  team  to  focus  or  expand  this  list  as 
appropriate: 
 

•  Aspect ratio, Wingspan, Wing chord 
•  Angle of attack 
•  Airfoil shape 
•  Camber 
•  Number of airfoil/sections 
•  Number of support struts 
•  Location of support struts 
•  Winglet (end plate) geometry and attachment 
•  Wing coating 
•  Wing/structure interface

Team Responsibilities 

Ultimately, we expect  those  teams  to be most successful who can  find  interesting configurations 
and  appropriate  settings  of  design  variables  that  will  maximize  the  objective  function,  while 
ensuring robustness of the overall assembly and minimization of manufacturing costs. 
 
IV. 
 
The  students  will  be  in  groups  of  two  per  design  team.    We  expect  that  one  student’s 
responsibilities  will  include  that  of  an  aerodynamics  engineer,  while  the  other  will  be  that  of  a 
structural engineer. Both engineers will work  together during  the entire design process  to ensure 
proper integration and function of the assembly:   
 
The aero engineer’s responsibilities include: 
1.  Developing a family of wing sections to meet the desired performance criteria 
2.  Predicting the aerodynamic loads at the wing supports 
3.  Predicting the performance of the wing over the desired operating range 
4.  Manufacturing the wing, costing the wing 
The structural engineer’s responsibilities include: 
1.  Developing a method of attaching the wing to the support brackets 
2.  Predicting  the  deflection  of  the wing,  and  natural  frequency,  and  the maximum  load.  
Suggesting manufacturing techniques.  
3.  Predicting the performance of the support structure. 
4.  Manufacturing the support structure, costing the structure. 
5.  Ensuring interface compatibility

VI.  Cost Estimation 
 
Each team will have to provide a completed cost estimate at the time of the CDR. 
 

1. 

2. 

Waterjet  –  the  manufacturing  of  the  aluminum  support  struts  can  be  modeled 
using the same OMAX time/quality model used in IAP 2004. 
a.  Use  $55/hour  labor  rate  to  cost  the  labor  of  cutting  out  the  parts  on  the 
waterjet. 
b.  Use a $75/hour rate for use of the Waterjet OMAX machine (overhead) itself. 
c.  The OMAX software provides an estimate of actual manufacturing cost on the 
screen after completion of each operation. 
Foam  cutter –  the manufacturing  cost of cutting  the  foam core  for  the air-foil can 
be  modeled  as  a  function  of  time.    That  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  foam  cutter 
operates using electric power, and thus costs the user $0.07 per watt-hour of use.  

7 

a.  Use  $40/hour  labor  rate  to  cost  the  labor  of  cutting  out  the  foam  wings.  
Assume  this  charge  includes  overhead  involved  in  acquiring  foam  and  other 
machine use.  
b.  The  foam  cutter  operates  at  1560 watts  (13  amps), when  in  use.   The  electric 
company charges $70 per kilowatt-hour.   Include electricity costs in your cost 
model.  
Fiberglass  –  the  manufacturing  of  adding  fiberglass  to  the  wing  sections  can  be 
modeled  based  on  typical  labor  rates,  as  this  requires  a  skilled worker.    Students 
will  be  asked  to  estimate  the  time  it  would  take  a  skilled  worker  to  fiberglass  a 
wing section, and introduce that into the final cost model. 
a.  The  labor  rate  for  fiberglass,  epoxying,  and  other miscellaneous  labor will  be 
$35/hour 
Material  costs  –  Material  costs  for  the  aluminum,  foam,  and  fiberglass  can  be 
modeled as functions of weight, and cuts involved.   
a.  The  sheet  Aluminum  costs  are  $50  for  the  1/8”  thick  sheet,  and  $125  for  the 
¼” thick sheet.   
b.  The cost for the Aluminum rod is $5 per 4-ft length. 
Design Work 
a.  Assume a $75/hour labor rate for each designer 
b.  Assume a $40/hour labor rate for use of a CAD/CAE/CAM workstation 
Assembly and Wind Tunnel Testing 
a.  Assume a $55/hour labor rate for assembly work 
b.  Assume  a  $300/hour  cost  for  use  of  the Wright  Brothers Wind  Tunnel  (incl. 
Operator)

A separate cost estimation form will be provided. 
 
 
VII.  Other Considerations 
 
1. 
The critical design  review will  focus not only on  the  final  results  (performance and cost) 
of  your  product,  but  also  on  how  this  product would  be  integrated  into  the  race  car  as  a whole.  
This  would  illustrate  other  factors  involved  in  designing  a  wing,  and  the  relationship  between 
other parts/subassemblies of a car.  
 
2. 
Specify strength.  Use a maximum deflection limit, or a safety factor for stress.  This will 
require  characterization  of  the  foam  used  for  the  wing  section  cores.    Our  top  priority  is  your 
safety. 
 

3.  Project  Design  Loop.    Below  is  a  diagram  illustrating  the  “spiral  development”  of  the 
example  project  design  loop  (Fig.  5).      During  the  CDR,  we  will  question  you  not  only  on 
the final outcome, but also on the design process you followed.
