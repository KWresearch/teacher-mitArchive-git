Team Number ____ 
 
Product Type:   
 
1. Market Description 
 
This bicycle is to be designed for the mass consumer market. The expected sales volume 
is 100,000 per year. Affordability, excellent performance/cost ratio and light weight are 
most important to be successful in this market. 
 
2. Requirements 
 
Manufacturing Cost (C): 
 
Performance (δ1, δ2, f1): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mass (m): 
 
Surface Quality (Q): 
 
Load Case (F):  
 
The part has to conform to the interface requirements and geometrical boundary 
conditions shown on page 2 of this document. This requirement cannot be waived. 
 
 
3. Priorities 
 
Low manufacturing cost is the first priority for this product. Next, the customer cares 
about light-weighting (low mass) and thirdly, structural performance should be as high as 
possible. These priorities are shown in the Ishii-matrix below: 
 

Displacement  δ1 ≤ 0.071 mm 
Displacement  δ2 ≤ 0.011 mm 
First natural frequency  f1 ≥ 245 Hz 

F1 = 50 lbs / F2 = 75 lbs / F3 = 75 lbs 

C ≤ 4.2 $ /part 

m ≤ 0.18 lbs 

Q ≥ 3
