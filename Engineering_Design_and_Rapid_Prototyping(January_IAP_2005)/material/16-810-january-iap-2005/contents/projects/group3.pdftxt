Introduction and Initial Design

F1

F2

(cid:153) Cross Over Bicycle designed for mass consumer market
• Constrain Mass
• Optimize Cost
• Accept Performance
(cid:153) Loading Cases
• F1 = 50 lbs
• F2 = 75 lbs
• F3 = 75 lbs
(cid:153) Requirements
• Delta 1 < 0.060 mm
• Delta 2 < 0.009 mm
• Natural Frequency > 505 Hz
• Mass < .27 lbs
• Cost < $5.20 per part
• Cutting Quality = 4

Version 1:  Manufactured and Tested

(cid:153) Manufactured part slightly different from original design
• Bar between bottom holes moved because it was not being stressed
• Design freedom used on the “fork” hole: moved diagonally upward
• Individual bar widths modified to redistribute mass

•All displacements were met with FEM
•Displacements were ~1/5 and 4/5 less than constraints
•Test Delta 1 is factor of 3 greater than FEM
•Test Delta 2 is factor of 15 greater than FEM

Version 2:  Manufactured and Tested

(cid:153) Goal to minimize cost while staying exactly at mass limit
• Fillet Radii increased to decrease cutting time
• Straight paths joining holes 
• Altered thickness of bars

Alternative “Boomerang” design

(cid:153) Goal to eliminate hole in middle to drastically cut cost
(cid:153) Optimized mass distribution through iterations to 
improve performance.
