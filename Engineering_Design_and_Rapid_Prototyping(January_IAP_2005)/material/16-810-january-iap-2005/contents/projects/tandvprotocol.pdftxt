Test and Verification Protocol 
 
Objective Function:  
 
Collect  all  force  data  (except  weight)  through  the  Lab  View  program  in  the  Wind  Tunnel  and 
export  that  data  to  an  excel  spreadsheet.   E-mail  this  spreadsheet  to  yourselves  from  the  control 
room. 
 
1.  Start lab view with only the rest rig (not your airfoil and endplates), and zero the readouts. 
 
2.  Once your apparatus is secured to the test rig, take data at zero speed conditions for at least a 
minute to benchmark the load cell voltage outputs.

3.  Gradually ramp up the wind tunnel speed from 0 to 60 mph in 5 mph increments.  Be sure to 
allow the readouts to stabilize at each speed so you have consistent voltage readings. 

 
4.  Once you have reached the operating speed (60 mph), take several minutes of data. 
 
5.  If time allows, back the speed down in 5 mph increments to verify your accuracy. 
 
 
Data Analysis 
Once you have the spreadsheet, you will want to “zero” your data based on the benchmark data 
collected at 0 mph.  Once the data has been corrected, you will need to convert the voltage 
outputs to forces and moments with the following conversions.

On  this  sheet,  record  the  components  of  the  optimization  function  to 
arrive  at  your  overall  score.    Use  a  large  continuous  section  of  your 
sample  to  determine  the  function  components  and  take  the  average.  
Make sure all measurements are in appropriate units.
