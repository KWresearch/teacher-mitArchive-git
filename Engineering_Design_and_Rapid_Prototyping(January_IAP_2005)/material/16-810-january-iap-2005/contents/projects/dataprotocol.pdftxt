Data Analysis Protocol 
 
This systematic walkthrough is accompanied by a sample excel spreadsheet available in the projects 
section. 
 
This is the correct calibration matrix equation (ignore the matrix given in the original protocol):

⎣
 
Copy the relevant raw data (velocity, side, drag, lift & yaw) into a new sheet in excel. 
 
Multiply each item through using the equation above to get calibrated pounds-force. 
 
To  check  your  math,  if  you  entered  the  following  sample  data  point  you  would  get  the  result

I  set  up  excel  to  show  the  calibrated  data  along  side  the  raw  data.   Note  that  you  do  not  need  to 
calculate Side & Yaw,  but  you DO  need  to  use  the  raw  values  of Side & Yaw  to  calculate  your 
calibrated Lift & Drag. 
 
Now  is a good  time  to determine  the weight of your apparatus.   First,  take  the average of  the  lift 
for  the data points before  the wind  tunnel was brought up  to  speed  (with your airfoil attached  to 
the load cell, this is labeled "Before" in the example).  Then do the same thing for the data points 
after  the  wind  tunnel  was  brought  down  to  zero  and  you  removed  the  airfoil  (this  is  labeled 
"after"  in  the example).   The difference between  these  two values  should give you  the weight of 
your apparatus in pounds force, which can be converted to Newtons (see the original protocol for 
this conversion). 
 

Next,  you must  re-center  your  data  about  the  nominal  values  of  lift  and  drag.    Find  the  average 
values  for drag and  lift  for  the period before  the wind  tunnel was brought up  to  speed  (hint: you 
should  have  found  the  nominal  lift  in  the  previous  step  when  you  calculated  the  “Before” 
variable). 
 
Take  these  nominal  values  and  subtract/add  them  to  your  calibrated  data.    This  should  result  in 
calibrated  lift  and  drag  measurements  starting  at  zero.    These  are  shown  in  the  example  under 
"English  Units  (lbs)".    This  can  then  be  converted  into  metric  units  much  the  same  way  the 
weight was converted. 
 
Now  that you have your data  in  a useful  form, you  can  take  the  average of  the data points  at 60 
mph  to  determine  operating  down  force  and  drag.    Plug  them  into  the  objective  equation  along 
with the weight you calculated above.  Make sure you do this final calculation in Newtons.
