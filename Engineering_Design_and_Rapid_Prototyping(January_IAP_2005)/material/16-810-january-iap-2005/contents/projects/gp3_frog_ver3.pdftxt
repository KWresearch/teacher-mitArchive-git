Cross Over Bike: Frogger 
 
 
A cross over bike is to be designed for the mass consumer market. The expected sales 
volume is 100,000 per year. Affordability, excellent performance/cost ratio and light weight are 
most important to be successful in this market. Below is an initial design for manufacturing. The 
table lists the design requirements and the FEM testing results for a load case of f1 = 50 lbs, f2 = 
75 lbs and f3 = 75 lbs.

The figure below shows our design. We arrived at this design through two major modifications 
on an initial sketch. Theses modifications were based on FEM results. The first modification was 
to move the bar, which had connected the two fixed holes, to a diagonal bar connected the two 
rightmost holes. The second major modification was to use the design freedom for the location of 
the leftmost hole. The hole was moved diagonally upward to the limit of the design freedom. 
Other minor modifications included the redistribution of mass through editing bar thickness.
