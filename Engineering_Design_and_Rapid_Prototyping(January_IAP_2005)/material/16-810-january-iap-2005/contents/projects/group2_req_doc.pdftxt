Product Type:   
 
1. Market Description 
 
This bicycle is to be designed for the mass consumer market. The expected sales volume 
is 100,000 per year. Affordability, excellent performance/cost ratio and light weight are 
most important to be successful in this market. 
 
2. Requirements 
 
Manufacturing Cost (C): 
 
Performance (δ1, δ2, f1): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mass (m): 
 
Surface Quality (Q): 
 
Load Case (F):  
 
The part has to conform to the interface requirements and geometrical boundary 
conditions shown on page 2 of this document. This requirement cannot be waived. 
 
 
3. Priorities 
 
Light-weighting (low mass) is the first priority for this product. Next, the customer cares 
about Low manufacturing cost and thirdly, structural performance should be as high as 
possible. These priorities are shown in the Ishii-matrix below: 
 

Displacement  δ1 ≤ 0.063 mm 
Displacement  δ2 ≤ 0.010 mm 
First natural frequency  f1 ≥ 270 Hz 

F1 = 50 lbs / F2 = 50 lbs / F3 = 100 lbs 

C ≤ 4.7 $ /part 

m ≤ 0.25 lbs 

Q ≥ 4
