Cross Over Bike: Boomerrang 
Version 1 
 
 
A cross over bike is to be designed for the mass consumer market. The expected sales 
volume is 100,000 per year. Affordability, excellent performance/cost ratio and light weight are 
most important to be successful in this market. Below is an initial design for manufacturing. The 
table lists the design requirements and the FEM testing results for a load case of f1 = 50 lbs, f2 = 
75 lbs and f3 = 75 lbs.

Figures 1 and 2 below show our initial design and final design for this model. This design 
concept was prompted by an effort to reduce the cost of manufacturing through the lack of a hole 
in the material, besides those holes required in the design requirements. The initial sketch for 
Boomerrang consisted mainly of a center circle from which arms extended and looped around 
required holes (see Figure 1). The final design (Figure 2) was reached through gradual 
modification of adding material to areas experiencing high stresses. There was a trade off 
between mass and performance. We feel that we optimized the design to minimize the 
displacement while constraining mass; additional modifications made increased the 
displacements.
