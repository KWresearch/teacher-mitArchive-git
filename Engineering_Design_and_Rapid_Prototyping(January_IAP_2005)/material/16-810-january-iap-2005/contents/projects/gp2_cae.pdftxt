The preliminary design for the Family Deluxe bicycle frame has been analyzed 
using the CAE tools.  The requirements specified for this frame are: 
•  Performance: δ1 ≤ 0.063mm, δ2 ≤ 0.010mm, f1 ≥ 270Hz 
•  Mass: m ≤ 0.25lbs 
•  Load Case: F1 = 50 lbs, F2 = 50 lbs, F3 = 100 lbs

Figure 1: Design of Family Deluxe bicycle frame 
Based upon the analysis of the current design, the following results were obtained: 
•  Performance:  
o  δ1x = .1038mm,  δ1y = .0668mm ⇒ δ1 = .1234mm 
o  δ2 = .0169mm  
o  f1 = 269.58 Hz 
•  Mass: 
o  m = 0.248lbs 
•  Safety: 
o  For a factor of safety of 1.2, the part did not show failure, using the von 
Mises stress criterion 

Although these results do not meet the requirements for the part, the current 
design is the results of many improvements to the original concept for the frame. This 
design was created in order to meet the most critical of the design requirements (mass), 
further improvements will be made to the design of this structure in order to optimize the 
structure for the less critical requirements.  Cost analysis could not be performed at this 
time, and will be considered later.
