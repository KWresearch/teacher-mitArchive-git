FEM Part Analysis 
 

Part Design: 
Due to the fairly aggressive design requirements for deflections under loading, out process 
focused first on meeting those requirements and focused on the mass requirements as a 
secondary concern.  As a result, the component in its current form is in keeping with the 
deflections, but is over mass.
