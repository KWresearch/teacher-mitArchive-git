Summary 
Undergraduate students are yearning for educational activities that combine theory and practice in 
the context of a real engineering challenge. We have developed an intense 6-unit IAP course that 
will take students through the conception, design and implementation of a single, complex 
structural component. This activity supports the learning objectives of the Conceive-Design-
Implement-Operate (CDIO) initiative and leverages the latest technologies in computer-assisted 
design, analysis, optimization and rapid prototyping. This will provide a satisfactory end-to-end 
learning experience, meeting an existing need and resulting in a deeper understanding of the 
interplay between the creative human mind and modern computer aided design processes. The 
novelty in this proposal is to combine rapid prototyping with optimization in order to demonstrate 
the complementary capabilities of humans and computers during the design process. 

1. Course Description 

a. Motivation (why are we offering this course?) 
A recent survey of undergraduate students in the Department of Aeronautics & 
Astronautics (in conjunction with the search for a new Department Head) has shown that 
there is a need for improved understanding and training in modern design methods using 
state-of-the-art CAD/CAE/CAM technology and design optimization. The specific 
reference from the search committee’s presentations is as follows: 

"CDIO has been well received by undergraduates, who have thoughtful suggestions for 
improvements. Some feeling of imbalance between fundamentals and other skills. 
Offerings in CAD/CAM, machining, fabrication desired." 

Individual students have suggested the addition of a short and intense course in rapid 
prototyping, combined with design optimization. The intent of this project is to respond 
to this perceived gap, while exploiting synergies with other engineering departments that 
have articulated similar needs.

b. Educational Objectives (what are we trying to accomplish?) 

The overall learning objective of this activity is for students to develop a holistic view of 
and initial competency in engineering design by applying a combination of human 
creativity and modern computational methods and tools to the synthesis of a complex 
structural component. 

This goal can be mapped into the following learning objectives of the CDIO syllabus [1]: 

1.2.2 Core Engineering Fundamental Knowledge: Solid Mechanics & Materials
1.3.6 Advanced Engineering Fundamental Knowledge: Computational Techniques
2.1.2 Engineering Reasoning and Problem Solving: Modeling
2.4.3 Personal Skills and Attitudes: Creative Thinking
4.3.3 Conceiving and Engineering Systems: Modeling of System and Ensuring Goals can be met 
4.4.1 The Design Process: Execute appropriate optimization in the presence of constraints
4.5.2 Implementing: Hardware Manufacturing Process1 
4.5.5 Implementing: Test, Verification, Validation and Certification

c. Pedagogy (how do we plan on achieving the objectives?) 

The goal of the class is to provide the students with an opportunity to conceive, design 
and implement products quickly as a single component, using the latest rapid prototyping 
methods and CAD/CAE/CAM technology. This is meant to be an intense and satisfying 
experience, emphasizing the chain of design steps as shown in Figure 1.

The idea of decomposing the course into two phases is rooted in the following cognitive 
progression. In the first phase the students are presented with solution neutral 
requirements and constraints for a structural component. A creative process of hand 
sketching is followed by computer assisted design (CAD) and analysis (CAE). This will 
help the students ascertain that their initial design will theoretically meet the requirements. 

After some manual iteration the part specification will be implemented on water jet 
cutting equipment2. The prototype is subjected to some simple testing in the lab to verify 
the validity of the student predictions. (The first offering of the course will focus on a 2D 
component to reduce part complexity). 

The second phase takes the initial manual design as an input and improves the solution 
via design optimization. The students will conduct design optimization using either 
commercial or faculty-provided software. The optimum solution obtained is modeled as a 
CAD model, and again the CNC equipment is used to fabricate the improved component. 

The optimized component is compared with the hand-designed one and conclusions are 
drawn. The course will conclude as a small “competition” with actual load-to-failure 
testing of the initial and optimized designs. This side by side comparison helps produce 
several educational insights: 

-
-

-

understand predictive accuracy of CAE modeling versus actual test results 
understand relative improvement that computer optimization can yield 
relative to an initial, manual solution 
illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the human mind and digital 
computer 

We will give a limited set of lectures on fundamental design theory and design 
optimization in parallel to the design development of the real artifact (hands-on activities) 
as described in the above schedule (page 2). 

d. Detailed Plan 

See schedule on page 2. 

This plan starts by exposing the students to the design process, its phases and the 
importance of properly formulated requirements. An introduction to state-of-the-art 
CAD/CAE/CAM environments will be given during the first week. Initial hands-on 
activities include hand sketching, engineering drawings and CAD Modeling. Due to the 
time limitations of this IAP course, compromises have to be made in terms of the breadth 
and depth of some of the topics that are covered. Emphasis is on successfully completing 
the various steps of the design process, rather than understanding all the details of the 
methods and tools used along the way. Two assumptions will deliberately limit the

complexity of this undertaking in order to not overwhelm the students and ensure focus 
on the learning objectives outlined in Section 1.b): 

Part Complexity: The project will be limited to a single structural component with 
medium complexity (some boundary conditions, one single load case, some functional 
surfaces and forbidden zones). The maximum part dimensions are governed by the 
limitations of the CNC machining equipment in Bldg. 33, but will be approximately 12” 
x 12” x 0.5”. No assemblies, machines or mechanisms will be produced. The part 
complexity might be modified in future years as we learn more about feasibility, student 
ability and time constraints. 

Dimensions: We will limit the design task to 2 dimensions. This will significantly 
simplify hand sketching and CAD modeling. The parts might still have to fulfill 3D 
requirements (e.g. out-of-plane bending of flexures), even if they are designed in 2D.

2. Target Student Population

The initial offering of the class will be limited to 16 students, broken down into 8 teams 
of two students each. Because the class is laboratory oriented, it is preferable not to have 
too many students. Also, the number of seats in the Design Studio, 33-218, and the 
capacity of the machine shop are inherently limited. The appropriate level would be 
seniors and juniors who have basic knowledge of mechanics, engineering mathematics 
and design. We would also admit sophomores with previous experience if there is extra 
capacity. Enrollment will be limited. The course is targeted primarily for undergraduate 
students in the MIT School of Engineering with emphasis on Aeronautics & Astronautics 
and Mechanical Engineering. 

3. Impacts of the Course 

This course will enable the students to: 

(1) Experience the conceive-design-implement-operate process for a single, complex

component using the latest CAD/CAE/CAM technology.


(2) Understand the subtleties of complementary human design abilities and computer 
strengths in optimization and number crunching. Quantify the relative improvement that 
computer optimization can yield relative to an initial, manual solution. 

(3) Understand the predictive accuracy of CAE modeling versus actual laboratory test 
results.


(4) Obtain 6 units of credit during IAP (with letter grade) in order to fulfill non-GIR 
requirements (electives) and meet their required credit limits for graduation. Many 
students are looking for opportunities to obtain such credits, without imposing additional 
scheduling constraints during the regular semesters. 

This course will enable the department to: 

(1)  Further implement the vision of CDIO. This is done without imposing additional 
burden on the students or the teaching infrastructure during the regular semesters. 

(2)  Offer an introductory course in Design (16.810), offered by the Systems Division, 
which is complementary to the current IAP offering of 16.900 in Computational 
tools. 

(3)  Improve our CAD/CAE/CAM infrastructure. Even though we have 
purchased expensive equipment and software during the last 5 years, it must be 
said that the CAD/CAE/CAM chain has not been fully integrated in the 

5


department. This course offers an opportunity to do so at low expense. This also 
has the potential to benefit other projects. 

(4)  Increase the effectiveness of students in downstream capstone courses. Both the 
experimental courses 16.621/2 as well as the aerospace vehicle design Capstone 
sequences 16.684-6 require an understanding of design and manufacture of 
components. In the first class components are used to build an experimental test 
apparatus. In the second class the components are assembled and integrated into a 
prototype aerospace vehicle (e.g. SPHERES, ARGOS…). Students that will have 
taken 16.810 are therefore likely to be more effective in designing and building 
components and would benefit more from 16.62x and 16.68x.

5. Evaluation and assessment of the class

The class is unique in that it integrates design theory, computational skills and 
fabrication/validation. It will enhance students’ understanding of engineering design 
theory and practical design skills. 

The course is 3-3-0, meaning that there will be two 90 minute lectures per week and 
about three hours of lab work expected (either in the Design Studio, machine shop or 
structural testing lab). There is no explicit homework, except for the team deliverables 
shown in Fig.2. 

Grading (A-F letter grade) would be based on the following components: 

Design Deliverables (see Figure 2)
