Second Version of Acrobatic Bike: Changes, Iterations, and Results: 
 
The changes from the first version to the second version can be summarized as adding more 
truss-like elements to the design.  We went from a 5-member truss design to a 32-member 
design.  Screen shots of the different models can be viewed below.

Modified Req.
 
s can be seen, Version 2, Iteration 12 meets the mass and displacement requirements.  However 
A
it falls short by 8% (or 50.70 Hz) of the minimum first mode frequency.  We would like to have 
a relaxation of this requirement, if possible, in order for this part to have meet all the modified 
requirements.  
 
A
llowed relaxations of requirements were given for mass and cost.  We have an unlimited cost 
requirement now, and a 0.40 lb mass requirement (formerly 0.16 lb).
