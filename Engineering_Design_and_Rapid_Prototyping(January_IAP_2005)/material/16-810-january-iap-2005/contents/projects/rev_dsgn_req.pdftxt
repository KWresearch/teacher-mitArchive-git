Updated Design Requirements as of 1/25/2004 @ 10:26am 

16.810 students, 

We announce two design requirement changes for your second version. The 
first is to improve the testing accuracy, and the second is to conform 
to the actual testing method. 

[1] Holes for fixed boundary condition (lower two holes)
- Diameter: 0.380"
- Cutting quality: 5 (The cutting quality of these two holes must be 5,
regardless of your cutting quality requirement. Other surfaces must 
comply with the constraint of your requirement sheet.) 

[2] Natural frequency requirement
Conduct a FEA with no boundary conditions. The new natural frequency 
requirement for each team is following: 

Team 1: 337.2 Hz 
Team 2: 463.6 Hz 
Team 3: 505.7 Hz 
Team 4: 421.5 Hz 
Team 5: 505.7 Hz 
Team 6: 547.9 Hz 
Team 7: 590.0 Hz 
Team 8: 632.2 Hz 
Team 9: 421.5 Hz
