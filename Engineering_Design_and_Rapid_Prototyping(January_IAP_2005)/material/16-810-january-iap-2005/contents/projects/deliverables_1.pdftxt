Deliverable A: 
 
Preliminary Sketch 
 
For deliverable A, submit a preliminary sketch of your final design. 
 
 
Deliverable B: 
 
Please submit a 2-page report (Word or pdf is ok), and the coordinate data (text) file. The 
report should go over the design, analysis, and optimization methodology; and also 
present the relevant performance data and specifications for the airfoil. It should also 
include some relevant plots (such as pressure distribution or CL/CD curves. 
 
 
Deliverable C: 
 
A 2 page report (Microsoft Word or .pdf file), with the relevant design and analysis 
information, including the CosmosWorks FEA analysis. Please report on mass, maximum 
deflection, stress levels, material properties used, mesh and boundary conditions, and 
natural frequency. 
 
Please include all relevant Solidworks CAD files (.sldprt's and .sldasm's). 
 
Only 1 submission per team is required. 
 
 
Deliverable D: 
 
Deliverable D includes the final CAD and FEA of your wing and supports that you plan 
on building. It also includes the supporting airfoil analysis, if you changed anything from 
Deliverable B. All required specifications from Deliverable B and C are due for D. 
 
 
Deliverable E: 
 
Final Assembly, Manufacturing Report 
 
Summary  
(1) Final Solidworks parts and assembly documents. These should be "as-built". (2) A 1-
pg memo describing the manufacturing and assembly process. Comment on time, effort, 
and any difficulties encountered during manufacturing.  
 
 
Deliverable F:  
 

Testing, Validation and Cost Estimate  
 
Summary  
Students need to upload two documents here (each 1 page). (1) Completed Testing and 
Verification Protocol. (2) Completed Cost Estimation report. 
 
 
Deliverable G: 
 
CDR Package  
 
Summary  
Two documents due: (1) CDR Package (Powerpoint slides package, annotated) - max 9 
slides per team. (2) 1 page reflective memo per person: "What am I taking away from this 
class?"  
 
 
Final Deliverable: 
 
Final Airfoil 
 
Summary  
Submit your final airfoil coordinate file for verification BEFORE working on the CNC 
foam cutter.
