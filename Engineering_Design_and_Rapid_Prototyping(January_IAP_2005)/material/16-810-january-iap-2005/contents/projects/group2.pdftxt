Original Concept

(cid:122) Brace both loaded holes 
to the fixed holes with 
multiple members
(cid:122) Attach the two fixed 
holes
(cid:122) When tested, results 
showed both 
displacement and mass 
above limits

Frame Design – Version 1

(cid:122) Got rid of superfluous 
members, braced two 
loaded holes instead
(cid:122) Costs were too high, 
hole 1 displacement 
requirement not met
(cid:122) Hole 2 displacement and 
mass were below the 
limits

Final Design

• Reduced cost by 
eliminating extra member 
and by filleting
• Eliminated extra curves at 
holes to reduce cost
• Shifted uppermost bar 
higher, increased mass 
near loaded holes in order 
to reduce deformation

• The frequency and mass testing displayed only 
approximately 2% error
• The displacements measured were approximately an 
order of magnitude greater than predicted
