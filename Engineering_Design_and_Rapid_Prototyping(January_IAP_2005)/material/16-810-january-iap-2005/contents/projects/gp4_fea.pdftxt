The VeloCITY (City Bike Design) 
Greg Mark & Chris Voekler (Group 4) 

 
The Group 4 design team’s challenge is to develop a mass-marketable consumer city 
bike that respects its market’s important product characteristics.  Foremost, the bike 
design should be optimized to meet a cost requirement of $4.2/part.  Once this threshold 
is met, the VeloCITY should be optimized to first better performance and second 
minimize mass.   
 
The VeloCITY’s frame is made out of 6061 Aluminum that is machined from a .25” plate 
stock.  The design is primarily a truss-structure, with 4 beams connecting 4 cylindrical 
axes (in 2-D, this is 4 solid rectangles connecting 4 hollowed circles – refer to Figure 1 
for the 2-D design).  The two bottom cylindrical axes (circles 3 & 4 in Figure 1) are fixed 
in translation (in the 2-D plane), and the two top cylindrical axes (circles 1 & 2) have 
loads exerted on them in the 2-D plane as shown in Figure 1.   
 
Beams 3 & 4 (seat tube and seat stay) must be designed to be relatively sturdy 
structurally (their width in 2-D is much wider than Beam 1, the top tube, and very close 
to Beam 2, the down tube) as they are the principal vertical supports for the load on axis 
2.  The vertical performance specification measured near axis 2 is very tight compared to 
the other displacement specification – so prioritizing to support this load is paramount to 
a successful design. 
 

Beam 1 (top tube) is designed much narrower than Beam 2 (down tube) since it 
principally supports only the horizontal load at axis 1, which is smaller than the vertical 
loads at axes 1 and 2; Beam 2, oriented roughly at a 45-degree angle must support both 
the horizontal and vertical loads at axis 1. 
 
A fifth beam could be added between axes 3 & 4 in order to complete the truss structure, 
but the design team determined this beam is not necessary since it would connect two 

 

axes which are both fixed in translation (in the 2-D plane), and rotation is not predicted to 
be a significant impact on the design structure. 
 
Two small laser displacement sensor tabs were placed above axes 1 & 2.  Since these tabs 
need to support no load, these tabs were designed with as little material as possible. 
 
An initial finite element analysis (using COSMOS) of the VeloCITY design determined 
that under the applied loads, displacement tab 1 is displaced .03mm in the negative x 
direction and .015 in the negative y directions, for a total diagonal displacement of 
0.032mm (<-.03, -.015>*<-.707, -.707>), meeting the requirement of under 0.071mm.  
Displacement tab 2 is displaced .010 mm in the negative y direction, meeting the 
requirement of under 0.011mm.  The first natural frequency of this design was 
determined to be 314 Hz, meeting the requirement of being greater than 245 Hz.  Finally, 
the mass is 0.15 lbs, also meeting the requirement of being under 0.18 lbs. 
 
Therefore, a finite element analysis predicts that the VeloCITY should meet all the 
necessary requirements for a city bike except possibly cost (so far unknown).
