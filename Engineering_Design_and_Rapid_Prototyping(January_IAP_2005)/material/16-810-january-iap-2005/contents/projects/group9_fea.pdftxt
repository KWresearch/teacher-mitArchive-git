We  modified  out  original  design  of  the  bike  frame  which  we  submitted  on  January  12th  in 
order to satisfy the requirements.  Several lines in our design consist of arches, which we believed 
distribute  the  stresses  and  reduce  displacement  accordingly.    In  the  process  of  modifying  the 
design, we noticed  the  fact  that an end of an arch  should be placed at  the  fixed point and  that  the 
direction of the force should point against the arch’s curve in order to make the most of the nature 
of  arches.    For  example,  the  two  loadings  at  the  measurement  point  2  are  supported  by  two 
arches.   The  loading of 75  lbs  in  the – y direction  is counteracted by  the arch horizontally places, 
and  the  other  loading  of  50  lbs  in  the  –  x  direction  is  supported  by  the  other  arch  to  reduce  the 
displacement  and  change  the  directions  of  the  forces  towards  the  left  fixed  point.  Two  curves 
right below the measurement point 2 have two main functions.  The first one is to minimize  the y 
direction  displacement  by  placing masses  just  below  the  loading  point.    The  second  one  is  again 
to transfer the forces towards the two fixed points. 

The  properties  of  the  bike  frame  loaded were  estimated with  the  Solidwork,  a  3-D modeling 
software,  and  the  COSMOWorks,  an  FEM  analysis  software.      The  following  table  shows  the 
results.    As  shown,  further  modification  are  required  to  meet  the  requirements  for  the 
displacement at the measurement point 2, the 1st mode, and the mass.
