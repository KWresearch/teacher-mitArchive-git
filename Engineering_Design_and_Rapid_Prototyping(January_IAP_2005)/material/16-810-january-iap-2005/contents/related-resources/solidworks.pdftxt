Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to provide a rough procedure of how to perform many of 
the  tasks  required  of  students  in  16.810  (temporary  class  number  16.682  in  IAP  2004).  
Basic procedures of how to model a part in SolidWorks, perform structural analysis using 
CosmosWorks,  and  how  to  use  the  computer-aided  manufacturing  (CAM)  tools  for 
manufacturing with a water jet cutter are detailed in this document.  This document is not 
meant  to  be  complete  and  questions  should  be  referred  to  the  instructors  or  to  another 
reference document.  A flow chart of the various tasks covered in this document is shown 
below in Figure 1.

9.  Once  the  “Change  Part  Setup”  dialog  box  is  filled-out  correctly  and  the  “OK” 
button  is  clicked,  Omax  Make  imports  the  cut  path  information  and  estimates 
manufacturing  time, manufacturing  cost,  and  amount  of  abrasive  required  for  the 
cutting operation (circled in the following figure). 
10. Omax Make can also display  the cutting  speed and cut direction along  the cutting 
curves.  
a.  To  display  cut  speed,  click  on 

the  “Preview

b.  Make  sure  water  level  in  water  jet  cutter  is  lowered  (below  the  metal 
grate) 
i.  If  it  is  too  high,  lower  the  water  level  by  using  the  lever  on  the 
computer terminal 
c.  Make  sure  the  water  jet  nozzle  is  raised  up  about  12  inches  above  the 
metal grate to allow room for placing manufacturing material in the cutter 
i.  Raise  nozzle  with  the  circular  knob  on  nozzle  shaft  and  tighten 
with black lever arm on upper part of shaft 
d.  Place material on metal grate (your aluminum sheet) 
e.  Locate  and  orient  material  so  as  to  make  the  cuts  as  they  appear  in  the 
Omax Make window 
f.  Use  lead  bricks  provided  to weigh-down  the  aluminum  plate  to  prevent  it 
from moving (IMPORTANT: wear protective gloves for this step)

j.  Place the plastic sponge on the end of the nozzle as shown in the figure 
k.  Lower  the  nozzle  to  within  approximately  0.030”  of  the  material  to  be 
machined 
i.  Use .030” shim stock as a guide to measure the offset
