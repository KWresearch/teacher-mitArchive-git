***** Course Highlights *****
This course features lecture_notes for a new MIT course that provides students
with an opportunity to design, optimize, manufacture, and validate a physical
system component. The projects from the course are also included here. This
course is offered during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a
special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the
end of the month.
***** Course Description *****
This course provides students with an opportunity to conceive, design and
implement a product, using rapid prototyping methods and computer-aid tools.
The first of two phases challenges each student team to meet a set of design
requirements and constraints for a structural component. A course of iteration,
fabrication, and validation completes this manual design cycle. During the
second phase, each team conducts design optimization using structural analysis
software, with their phase one prototype as a baseline.
***** Acknowledgements *****
This course is made possible thanks to a grant by the alumni sponsored Teaching
and Education Enhancement Program (Class of '51 Fund for Excellence in
Education, Class of '55 Fund for Excellence in Teaching, Class of '72 Fund for
Educational Innovation). The instructors gratefully acknowledge the financial
support.
The course was approved by the Undergraduate Committee of the MIT Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2003. The instructors thank Prof. Manuel
Martinez-Sanchez and the committee members for their support and suggestions.
