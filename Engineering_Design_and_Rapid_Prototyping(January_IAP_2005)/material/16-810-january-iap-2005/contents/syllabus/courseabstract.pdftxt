Abstract 
 
This  paper  presents  a  new  undergraduate  design  course  in  the  Department  of  Aeronautics  and 
Astronautics  at MIT.  This  course  combines  design  theory,  lectures  and  hands-on  activities  to  teach  the 
design  stages  from  conception  to  implementation. Activities  include  hand  sketching, CAD, CAE, CAM, 
design  optimization,  rapid  prototyping,  and  structural  testing.  The  learning  objectives,  pedagogy, 
required resources and instructional processes as well as results from a student assessment are discussed. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
A recent survey of undergraduate students in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at 
MIT has shown that there is a desire for training in modern design methods using state-of-the-art 
CAD/CAE/CAM technology and design optimization. Individual students have suggested the 
addition of a short and intense course in rapid prototyping, combined with design optimization. 
The specific reference from the student survey is paraphrased here: 
"The CDIO [conceive-design-implement-operate] initiative has been well received by 
undergraduates, who have thoughtful suggestions for improvements. Some feeling of imbalance 
between fundamentals and other skills. Offerings in CAD/CAM, machining, fabrication desired." 
 
The intent of this course is to respond to this perceived gap, while exploiting synergies with 
other engineering departments that have articulated similar needs. We have developed an intense 
6-credit-unit IAP (independent activities period)1 course that takes students through the 
conception, design, and implementation of a single, complex structural component. This activity 
supports the learning objectives of the Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) initiative 
[1,2,3] and leverages the latest technologies in computer-assisted design, analysis, optimization, 
and rapid prototyping. The novelty of this course lies in its combination of rapid prototyping 
with design optimization in order to demonstrate the complementary capabilities of humans and 
computers during the design process.  
 
The overall learning objective of this activity is for students to develop a holistic view of 
and initial competency in engineering design by applying a combination of human 

                                                 
1 IAP is a one-month alternative period during January of each academic year at MIT. The course was offered under 
the number 16.682 in 2004 and will carry the number 16.810 in the future.

creativity and modern computational methods and tools to the synthesis of a complex 
structural component.   
 
This goal can be mapped onto the following learning objectives of the CDIO syllabus [2]: 
     -  Core Engineering Fundamental Knowledge: solid mechanics & materials 
     -  Advanced Engineering Fundamental Knowledge: computational techniques 
     -  Engineering Reasoning and Problem Solving: modeling 
     -  Personal Skills and Attitudes: creative thinking 
     -  Conceiving and Engineering Systems: modeling systems and ensuring goals can be met 
     -  The Design Process: execute appropriate optimization in the presence of constraints 
     -  Implementing: hardware manufacturing process  
     -  Implementing: test, verification, validation, and certification 
 
This paper first offers a description of the course, focusing on its structure and flow (Section 2). 
Next, the target student population (Section 3) and required resources (Section 4) will be 
discussed. The design project, including the requirements levied on the students, is the subject of 
Section 5. In Section 6, we explain how design optimization can be incorporated in such design 
courses. An overview of the student deliverables (Section7), assessment results (Section 8) and 
conclusions (Section 9) round out the paper. 
 
 
2. Course description  
 
The goal of the course is to provide the students with an opportunity to conceive, design, and 
implement products quickly and effectively, using the latest rapid prototyping methods and 
CAD/CAE/CAM technology. This is meant to be an intense and satisfying experience that 
emphasizes the chain of design steps shown in Figure 1.

Course Pedagogy and Concept 
 
Fundamental engineering design principles and procedures are introduced and in some cases 
reviewed during the first week [4-6]. The idea of structuring the course in two phases is rooted in 
the following cognitive progression:  
 
In the first phase, the students are presented with solution neutral requirements and constraints 
for a structural component. Teams of two students are formed and each team receives slightly 
different requirements (see Section 5).  A creative process of hand sketching is followed by 
computer aided design (CAD) and analysis (CAE). This helps the students ascertain that their 
Phase 1 design will theoretically meet the requirements. After some manual iteration, the part 
specification is implemented on water jet cutting equipment. The prototype is subjected to 
structural testing in the laboratory to verify the validity of the predictions as well as requirements 
compliance. 
 
The second phase takes the Phase 1 manual design as an input and improves the solution via 
design optimization. In effect, the earlier manual solution is used as an initial condition for the 
design optimization step. This is what ties Phases 1 and 2 together. The students conduct design 
optimization using either commercial or faculty-provided software. The optimum solution 
obtained is modeled as a CAD model, and again computer numerically controlled (CNC) 
equipment is used to fabricate the improved component. The optimized component is compared 
with the hand-designed one, and conclusions are drawn.  
 
The course concludes with student presentations culminating in a “Critical Design Review”, and 
potentially a competition, which includes results from testing of the initial and optimized designs. 
This side-by-side comparison helps produce several educational insights: 
 

-  Understanding of the predictive accuracy of CAE modeling versus actual test results 
-  Understanding of the relative improvement that computer optimization can yield 
relative to an initial, manual solution 
Illustration of the capabilities and limitations of the human mind and digital 
computer during design and manufacturing 

- 

 
Course Flow 
 
The course plan starts by exposing the students to the design process, its phases, and the 
importance of properly formulated requirements. An introduction to state-of-the-art 
CAD/CAE/CAM environments is given during the first week. Initial hands-on activities include 
hand sketching, creating engineering drawings, and CAD Modeling. Due to the time limitations 
of this IAP course, compromises have to be made with respect to the breadth and depth of some 
of the topics that are covered. Emphasis is placed on successfully completing the various steps of 
the design process, rather than understanding all the details of the methods and tools used along 
the way. Assumptions outlined in Section 5 limit the complexity of this undertaking in order to 
avoid overwhelming the students and to ensure that they focus on the learning objectives. A 
flowchart of the class activities, which includes student deliverables, is shown in Figure 2.

Table 1 shows the detailed course schedule. Each class consists of a lecture on theory (1 hour 
and 30 minutes) directly followed by a hands-on activity (1 hour and 30 minutes). The first seven 
classes constitute Phase 1, and the remaining four classes make up Phase 2. Two sessions are 
devoted to design optimization because of its complexity. Other activities in Phase 2, such as 
CAD modeling, manufacturing, and testing, can be done quickly because students have already 
acquired most of these skills in Phase 1. Two guest lectures provide the students with 
opportunities to learn about current practices and challenges in industry.

3. Student target population  
 
The initial offering of the class was limited to 18 students, broken down into 9 teams of two 
students each. Because the class is laboratory oriented, such a small number of students is 
preferable. In addition, the number of seats in the Design Studio and the capacity of the machine 
shop are inherently limited. The target level were seniors (4th year) and juniors (3rd year) who 
already have basic knowledge of mechanics, engineering mathematics, and design. The course is 
targeted primarily to undergraduate students with special emphasis on Aerospace and 
Mechanical Engineering. 
 
This course is offered as an elective and seeks to attract students who want to: 
 
(1)   Experience the conceive-design-implement-operate process for a single, complex 
component using the latest CAD/CAE/CAM technology. 
(2)   Understand the subtleties of complementary human design abilities and computer strengths 
in optimization. 
(3)   Understand the predictive accuracy of CAE modeling versus actual laboratory test results. 
(4)   Obtain 6 units of credit without imposing additional scheduling constraints during the 
regular semesters. 

 
4. Resources 
 
We use Matlab as a general computing environment for this course. The SolidWorks and 
Cosmos package is used for CAD design and finite element analysis, respectively. All the 
lectures and computer-based hands-on activities are performed in a Design Studio (Fig. 3a). This 
concurrent engineering facility is comprised of 14 networked CAD/CAE workstations that are 
used for complex systems design and optimization. An abrasive waterjet cutter with OMAX 
CAM software is used for rapid prototyping in the department’s machine shop (Fig. 3a). We 
have manufactured a dedicated testing fixture to enable fast testing, as shown in Fig. 3 (c).

5. Project description 
 
This section describes the design project that was used during the initial offering (2004). The 
project is limited to a single structural component with medium complexity (some boundary 
conditions, one single-load case, some functional surfaces, and forbidden zones given). The 
maximum part dimensions are approximately 12” x 12” x 0.5”. No assemblies, machines, or 
mechanisms were produced. The part complexity might be modified in future years as we learn 
more about feasibility, student ability, and time constraints. We limited the design task to two 
dimensions. This significantly simplified hand sketching and CAD modeling. The parts still had 
to fulfill three-dimensional requirements (e.g. first natural frequency).

Figure 4: Configuration and dimensions of the design requirement 

 
Figure 4 shows the configuration and dimensions associated with the design requirement. The 
requirement is based on a simplified bicycle frame model. The lower two holes are fixed, and 
three loads F1, F2 and F3 are applied to the two upper holes (Fig. 4a). These forces represent the 
fork and saddle loads. A fixture with two laser sensors was fabricated and used for structural 
testing, see Figure 3 (c), in order to obtain measurements of the displacements, (cid:71)1 and (cid:71)2. 
 
The class had nine teams of two students each. Every team carried out a surrogate bicycle frame 
design for a different hypothetical market segment. The nine market segments were as follows: 
Consumer division: Family economy, Family deluxe, Cross over, City bike, Specialty division: 
Racing, Mountain, BMX, and Acrobatic, Motor division: Motor bike. During the last week of 
the course, the students visited a leading, local bicycle frame manufacturer [8], where they saw 
first hand that designing products based on the needs of differentiated market segments is very 
relevant in the real world. 
 
Load magnitude, design requirements, and design priorities vary according to the market 
segment.  
 
 
 
A sample requirement, which is handed to students in the first week, is given below.

(a) Market Description 
This bicycle is to be designed for the mass consumer market. The expected sales volume is 
100,000 per year. The requirements of affordability, excellent performance/cost ratio, and low 
weight are most important to be successful in this market.

The part has to conform to the interface requirements and geometrical boundary conditions 
shown in this document. This requirement cannot be waived. 
 
(c) Priorities 
Low manufacturing cost is the first priority for this product. Next, the customer prefers a low 
weight product, and thirdly, structural performance should be as high as possible.  These 
priorities are shown in the Ishii-matrix below:

6. Design Optimization 
 
The students conducted structural topology optimization, based on a pixel-like approach. We 
utilized web-based optimization that was developed by Tcherniak and Sigmund [7]. This 
optimization software can solve two-dimensional problems with rectangular design domains with 
a maximum number of 1000 design cells. If a cell has a density of one, it means material should 
be used in the cell. Compliance is used as the objective function, and the constraint is the volume 
fraction. This topology optimization is used to determine improved design layouts. Because the 
design requirements in Section 5 have other performance metrics, it is not possible to use this 
software for optimization considering all of our performance metrics of interest. For future years, 
we intend to develop an optimization environment that is easy to use and complements the web-
based tool. Optimum designs cannot (yet) automatically be imported to CAD software.  When

optimum solutions are obtained, students must interpret them and create CAD designs on their 
own. Figure 5 shows the graphical user interface (GUI) of the web-based optimization software 
and a sample optimization result.

7. Student Deliverables 
 
The entire set of deliverables produced by one of the student teams (Team 5: Racing) is shown in 
Figure 6. Note, that their hand sketch is different from their CAD model in Phase 1 because a 
design improvement occurred based on several FEM simulations. In Phase 2, topology 
optimization found a rough optimum design from which a more refined CAD design was created.

Figure 7 shows deliverables by all teams. The first four bicycle frames (T1-T4), which belong to 
the consumer division, feature rather simple, slender designs because low manufacturing cost 
and low mass were important design priorities for them. On the other hand, structural 
performance metrics were more important for bicycle frames in the specialty and motor divisions 
(T5-T9). This resulted in more complex, costlier and generally heavier designs obtained by this 
second group of teams. The variety of the proposed designs is noteworthy. 

Figure 7:  Hand-sketches and manufactured parts (versions 1 and 2) by all teams 

 
The performance of each student team’s design is shown in Figure 8. All designs in the 
consumer division (T1-T4) lie in the region where manufacturing cost is low. Bicycle frames in 
the specialty division (T5-T8) generally have larger mass and natural frequency, at the expense 
of higher manufacturing cost. These designs have lower displacements, which do not appear in 
this plot.  The Motor division (T9 student team) had to deal with a rectangular, forbidden zone as

shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 also shows the position of a baseline design, which was constructed 
by faculty and staff and revealed to the students only at the beginning of Phase 2. 

 

Figure 8:  Product attribute overview, T1-9 refers to the student teams 

This chart was debated extensively during the final design review. This gave the students a 
deeper appreciation for the relationship between their design decisions (part configuration and 
topology, design features, sizing) and the resulting attributes of their product: structural 
performance, mass and manufacturing cost. At the end of this course, the students were able to 
articulate the merits of one topology over the other, promote and defend the virtues of their own 
designs as well as debate the tradeoffs and necessary choices between design objectives. 
 
8. Course evaluation 
 
In the last week of the course, an anonymous course evaluation was conducted. The survey 
consisted of a brief introductory tutorial followed by 5 sections containing questions that needed 
to be answered by multiple choice as well as essay responses. Ten out of nineteen students 
participated in the survey. A sample of results from the survey follows: 
 
(1) Amount I have learned, compared to other Aero/Astro courses, has been: 
(1: little (cid:127) 3: medium (cid:127) 5: much)   Score: 3.7  
 
(2) My understanding of design processes has increased: 
(1: no (cid:127) 3: don't know (cid:127) 5: yes)   Score: 4.8 
 
(3) I think that I can apply this course to my work/career: 
(1: no (cid:127) 3: don't know (cid:127) 5: yes)   Score: 4.5 
 
(4) Overall, the subject is worthwhile: 
(1: no (cid:127) 3: don't know (cid:127) 5: yes)   Score: 5 
 
Some of the students’ comments were: 
 

Proceedings of the 2004 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference & Exposition 
Copyright (cid:148) 2004, American Society for Engineering Education 

“This course is an excellent idea, and fills a serious need in the undergraduate program, keep 
developing it, and keep up the good work.” 
 
“The course was great. I really enjoyed the fact that we manufactured the part and tested it.”  
 
“I think this was an extremely useful class, and I hope it continues because I think that I've 
learned how to use programs that I will continue to use in the department, and I've gotten some 
experience in the machine shop, which I could not have had otherwise.” 
 
Suggestions for improvement included among others: 
 
“Have each team tackle a more significantly different design challenge.” 
 
“Provide for more input from classmates on the design process (semi-formal design reviews 
before a board of your peers).” 
 
“Make the design slightly more challenging of a problem. If not more challenging, I would have 
liked to have had the ability to think of a more innovative solution.”  
 
“Changing the testing procedure slightly. The testing inaccuracies were frustrating, and it would 
also have been better to sign up in advance for a time to test the part Version 1.” 
 
9. Discussions and conclusions 
 
This paper presented a new design course for undergraduate students. The main learning 
objective of this course is for students to develop a holistic view of and initial competency in 
engineering design by applying a combination of human creativity and modern computational 
methods and tools to the synthesis of a structural component. Lectures and hands-on activities 
are integrated for each phase of the course. Activities include hand sketching, CAD design, 
Finite Element Analysis, CAM manufacturing, structural testing, and design optimization. Nine 
different design requirements were given according to each team’s hypothetical market segment.  
 
Overall responses from students were very positive. They benefited mainly from the fact that 
design activities were presented and executed as a coherent stream. Most students may not have 
experienced the design process in this way before. Allowing the students to carry their design 
through two iterations, rather than only one, was a crucial element of the pedagogy. Based on the 
results of the initial offering, it was decided to integrate this course into the permanent MIT 
course catalogue 
 
For most teams, the testing results did not agree well with static Finite Element simulation results. 
Likely error sources included the boundary conditions as well as relative compliance between 
fixture and test article. Improving testing accuracy is a primary task for future years. Improving 
interactions between teams and early peer review are other areas of improvement. Methods of 
quantitative assessments and benchmarking of these students against those without design 
experience would also be beneficial in fine tuning the learning objectives and course procedures.
