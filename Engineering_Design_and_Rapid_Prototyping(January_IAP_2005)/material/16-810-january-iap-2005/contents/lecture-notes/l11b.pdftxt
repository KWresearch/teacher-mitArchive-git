A Few Pareto-Optimization  

Techniques

• Reduce to a single objective: F = Σi  wi  fi 
where w’s are judgmental weighting factors 

• Optimize for f1; Get f*1;; 
•Set a floor f1 >= f*i  ; Optimize for f2; get f2  ; 
• Keep floor f1, add floor f2  ; Optimize for f3  ; 
• Repeat in this pattern to exhaust all f’s; 
• The order of f’s matters and is judgmental 

• Optimize for each f independently; Get n optimal designs;

i 
Find a compromise design equidistant from all the above. 

• Pareto-optimization intrinsically depends on judgmental 
preferences 

Imparting Attributes by 

Optimization

• Changing  	wi  in  F = Σi  wi  fi 
modifies the design within broad range 

• Example: Two objectives 
• setting w1  = 1; w2 = 0 produces design whose F = f1 
• setting w1  = 0; w2 = 1 produces design whose F = f2 
• setting w1  = 0.5; w2 = 0.5 produces design whose 
F is in between. 

• Using w as control, optimization serves as a tool

i 
to “steer” the design toward a desired behavior or

having pre-determined, desired attributes.

and variables directly 
related to it 
• E.g, range;	
wing aspect ratio 

• Focus on manufacturing 
process and its variables 
• E.g., cost; 
riveting head speed 

Two Loosely Connected Optimizations


• Seek process variables 
to reduce the fabrication cost. 

•Seek design variables 
to maximize performance 
under constraints of: 
Physics 
Cost 
Manufacturing difficulty 

The return on investment (ROI) is a unifying factor 
ROI = f(Performance, Cost of Fabrication) 

Integrated Optimization

• Required: Sensitivity analysis on both sides


∂Range/ ∂(AspectRatio) 

∂Cost/ ∂(Rivet head speed) 

∂(Rivet head speed)/ ∂(AspectRatio) 

ROI = f(Range, Cost of Fabrication)

Integrated Optimization Design < --- > Fabrication

•	 Response Surface Approximation for crash responses 
that enabled coarse grain parallel computing provided 
significant reduction in total elapsed time:

each over 24 hours (252 processors total).

has to become acquainted with the machine architecture.

• Optimization transformed frame into truss 
•A qualitative change
•Why:
•structural efficiency is ranked:

• If one did not know this, and would not know the concept of

a truss, this transformation would look as invention of truss.

• Drag minimized while holding 
constant lift by geometrically 
adding the base airfoils. 
• Each base airfoil had some 
aerodynamic merit 
• Result: a new type, flat-top 
“Whitcomb airfoil”. 

• If this was done before Whitcomb invented the flat-top airfoil 
(he use a file & wind tunnel), this would look like an invention. 

Continuous quantitative transformation 
vs. conceptual quantum jump 

•Common feature in both previous examples:

•Variable(s) existed whose continuous change
enabled transformation to qualitatively new design 
• Counter-example:

OK 
Second wing may 
wither away 
• Optimization may reduce but cannot grow what is not there, 
at least implicitly, in the initial design.
