Structural Considerations 

 
Center of Lift along chord:  (
)cpc
x
 is normally between 0.3 & 0.4 
Place the spar at this location to avoid twisting of the airfoil.  This is usually the thickest point. 
 
Apply fiberglass at 45° to the leading edge of the airfoil, (not 0° & 90°) for torsional stiffness.  If 
you are not using a spar then you need to apply fiberglass at 0° & 90°, allowing the fibers to act 
as a spar and bear the load. 
 
To transfer load out of the wing, you must add hard points to the foam wing. 
 
It is recommended to fiberglass and vacuum bag the wing for trailing edge strength, especially if 
you are using a thin trailing edge.
