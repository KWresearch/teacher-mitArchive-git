Waterjet - Brief history


- Industrial uses of ultra-high pressure waterjets began in the early 1970s. 
Pressures: 40,000 ~ 60,000 psi 
Nozzle diameter: 0.005" 

- Special production line machines were developed to solve 
manufacturing problems related to materials that had been previously 
been cut with knives or mechanical cutters. 

- Examples of early applications 
Cardboard 
Shapes from foam rubber 
Soft gasket material 

16.810 

17 

Waterjet - Brief history


- In the early 1990s, John Olsen (pioneer of the waterjet cutting industry) 
explored the concept of abrasive jet cutting. 

- The new system equipped with a computerized control system that 
eliminated the need for operator expertise and trial-and-error 
programming. 

- Olsen teamed up with Alex Slocum (MIT) 
Used cutting test results and a theoretical cutting model by Rhode Island 
University. Developed a unique abrasive waterjet cutter. 

16.810 

18 

Pumps


Intensifier Pump 
- Early ultra-high pressure cutting systems used hydraulic intensifier pumps. 
- At that time, the intensifier pump was the only pump for high pressure. 
- Engine or electric motor drives the pump. 

Pressure: ~ 60,000 psi 

16.810 

19 

Pumps


Crankshaft pump 
- Use mechanical crankshaft to move any number of individual pistons 
- Check valves in each cylinder allow water to enter the cylinder as the 
plunger retracts and then exit the cylinder into the outlet manifold as the 
plunger advances into the cylinder. 

Pressure: ~ 55,000 psi 
Reliability is higher. 

Actual operating range of most systems 
: 40,000 ~50,000 psi 

An increasing number of abrasivejet systems 
are being sold with the more efficient and 
easily maintained crankshaft-type pumps. 

16.810 

20 

Nozzles


Two-stage nozzle design 

[1] Water passes through a small-diameter jewel orifice to form a narrow jet. 
Then passes through a small chamber pulling abrasive material. 

[2] The abrasive particles and water pass into a long, hollow cylindrical 
ceramic mixing tube. The resulting mix of abrasive and water exits the 
mixing tube as a coherent stream and cuts the material. 

Alignment of the jewel orifice and the mixing 
tube is critical 
In the past, the operator adjusted the alignment 
often during operation.

X-Y Tables : Gantry vs. Cantilever


Adv: Well-adapted to the use of multiple 
nozzles for large production runs 

Dis: Loading material onto the table can be 
difficult because the gantry beam may interfere, 
unless the gantry can be moved completely out 
of the way 

Dis: Because the gantry beam is moved at both 
ends, a very high-quality electronic or 
mechanical system must be employed to 
ensure that both ends move precisely in unison 

Dis: Y-axis is limited in length to about 5 
feet because of structural considerations

X-Y Tables: Separate vs. Integrated


Integrated

Adv
: Less floor space is required for a given 
table size because the external support 
frame is eliminated 

Adv: Inherently better dynamic accuracy 
because relative unwanted motion or 
vibration between the table and X-Y 
structure is eliminated 

System accuracy can be built at the 
Adv: 
factory and does not require extensive on-
site set-up and alignment 

More expensive to build than the

Control Systems 


The OMAX control system computes exactly how the feed rate should vary for a 
given geometry in a given material to make a precise part. 

The algorithm actually determines desired variations in the feed rate every 0.0005" 
(0.012 mm) along the tool path

Best applications 


Materials and thickness 

- Aluminum, tool steel, stainless steel, mild steel and titanium 

- Thicknesses up to about 1" (2.5 cm) 

Shapes 

- An abrasivejet can make almost any two-dimensional shape imaginable— 
quickly and accurately—in material less than 1" (25 mm)  thick. 

- The only limitation comes from the fact that the minimum inside radius in 
a corner is equal to ½ the diameter of the jet, or about 0.015" (0.4 mm). 

16.810 

29 

Applications that are generally poor 


Low-cost applications where accuracy really has no value 

Using a precision abrasivejet as a cross-cut saw 
- Just buy a saw ! 

Applications involving wood 
- It's hard to beat a simple jigsaw. 

Parts that truly require a 5-axis machine 
- This is a much more specialized market. 

16.810

Material


Aluminum 

Aluminum is a light weight but strong metal used in a wide variety of 
applications. 

Generally speaking, it machines at about twice the speed as mild steel, 
making it an especially profitable application for the OMAX. 

Many precision abrasivejet machines are being purchased by laser shops 
specifically for machining aluminum. Aluminum is often called the "bread and 
butter" of the abrasivejet industry because it cuts so easily. 

A part machined from 3" (7.6 cm) 
aluminum; Intelli-MAX software lets you 
get sharp corners without wash-out

31 

Examples


An example of two 
aluminum parts done in 
½" (1.3 cm) thick 
aluminum, which took 
approximately five 
mintues to machine 

A prototype linkage arm for the Tilt-A-Jet. This part  

was first "roughed out" on the OMAX. The holes  

were then reamed out to tolerance, and some 

additional features (such as pockets) added with  

other machining processes.

16.810 

This piece was made from 8” 
(200mm) thick aluminum as a 
demonstration of what an 
abrasivejet can do
