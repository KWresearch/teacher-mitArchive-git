Force Transducers / Load Cells

Force Transducers/Load Cells are capable of measuring
Up to 6 DOF of force on three orthogonal axes, 
and the moment (torque) about each axis, to
completely define the loading at the sensor's location

The high stiffness also results in a high resonant frequency, 
allowing accurate sensor response to rapid force changes. 

Load cells are electro-mechanical transducers 
that translate force or weight into voltage. 
They usually contain strain gages internally.

When choosing a sensor for a
non-linear
particular application we must
specify the following requirements:

Sensor Performance Requirements:
Sensor Performance Requirements:

• Dynamic Range and Span
• Accuracy and Resolution
• Absolute or Relative  measurement
• Sensor Time Constant
• Bandwidth
• Linearity
• Impedance
• Reliability (MTBF)

X

Calibration is the process of
obtaining the S(X) relationship
for an actual sensor. In the physical
world S depends on things other than X.
Consider modifying input Y (e.g. Temp)

Constraints:
Power: 28VDC, 400 Hz AC, 60 Hz AC
Cost, Weight, Volume, EMI, Heat

E.g. Load cell calibration data:
X= mass (0.1 , 0.5 1.0 kg…)
S= voltage (111.3 , 563.2, 1043.2 mV)

PZT Excitation

Conclusion: Linearity is only
preserved for relatively small amplitude 
excitation (geometrical or material 
non-linearity, friction, stiction etc…)
Excitation amplitude selection is a tradeoff between introducing non-linearity 
(upper bound) and achieving  good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (lower bound).

Signal Conditioning and Noise

we introduce measurement

Time domain:

MATLAB coding
Given signal x and time vector t , N samples, dt=const.
dt=t(2)-t(1);    % sampling time interval dt 
fmax=(1/(2*dt));  % upper frequency bound [Hz] Nyquist
T=max(t);        % time sample size [sec]
N=length(t);      % length of time vector
(assume zero mean)
x_mean=mean(x);     % mean of signal
x_rms=std(x);     % standard deviation of signal
Amplitude Spectrum:
X_k = abs(fft(x)); % computes periodogram of x
AS_fft = (2/N)*X_k; % compute amplitude spectrum
k=[0:N-1];           % indices for FT frequency points
f_fft=k*(1/(N*dt));     % correct scaling for frequency vector
f_fft=f_fft(1:round(N/2)); % only left half of fft is retained
AS_fft=AS_fft(1:round(N/2)); % only left half of AS is retained

should match

Power Spectral Density:
PSD_fft=(2*dt/N)*X_k.^2; % computes one-sided PSD in Hertz
PSD_fft=PSD_fft(1:length(f_fft)); % set to length of freq vector
rms_psd=sqrt(abs(trapz(f_fft,PSD_fft))); % compute RMS of PSD

Summary
Upfront work before actual testing / data acquisition is considerable:
• What am I trying to measure and why ?
• Sensor selection and placement decisions need to be made
• Which bandwidth am I interested in ?
• How do I excite the system (caution for non-linearity) ?

The topic of signal conditioning is crucial and affects results :
• Do I need to amplify the native sensor signal ?
• What are the estimates for noise levels ?
• What is my sampling rate ∆ T and sample length T (Nyquist, Leakage) ?
• Need to consider Leakage, Aliasing and Averaging

Data processing techniques are powerful and diverse:
• FFT and DFT most important (try to have 2^N points for speed)
• Noise considerations (how good is my measurement ? -> coherence)
