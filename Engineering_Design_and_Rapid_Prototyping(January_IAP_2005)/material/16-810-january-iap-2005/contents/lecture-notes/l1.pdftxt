Happy New Year 2005 ! 


We won’t be designing White Knight or SpaceShipOne this IAP, but ... 

You will learn about “the design process” and fundamental 
building blocks of any complex (aerospace) system

Needs – from students 


A 2001 survey of undergraduate students 
(Aero/Astro) – in conjunction with new Dept. head 
search 
- There is a perceived lack of understanding and training in 
modern design methods using state-of-the-art CAD/CAE/CAM 
technology and design optimization. 

- Individual students have suggested the addition of a short and 
intense course of rapid prototyping, combined with design 
optimization.

Boeing List of “Desired Attributes of an Engineer”

¢  Good communication skills 
¢  Written

¢  Oral

¢	 Graphic 
Listening 
¢ 
¢  High ethical standards 
¢  An ability to think both critically 
and creatively - independently

and cooperatively

¢  Flexibility. The ability and self (cid:173)
confidence to adapt to rapid or 
major change 
¢  Curiosity and a desire to learn for  

life 
¢  A profound understanding of the 
importance of teamwork. 


¢	 A good understanding of 
engineering science 
fundamentals 
¢	 Mathematics (including statistics) 
Physical and life sciences 
Information technology (far more than 
“computer literacy”) 
¢	 A good understanding of design 
and manufacturing processes (i.e. 
understands engineering)	
¢	 A multi-disciplinary, systems 
perspective 	
¢	 A basic understanding of the 
context in which engineering is

practiced 
Economics (including business 
¢	
practice)

¢	 History 
The environment 
¢	
¢	 Customer and societal needs 

• This is a list, begun in 1994, of basic durable attributes 
into which can be mapped specific skills reflecting the 
diversity of the overall engineering environment in which 
we in professional practice operate. 
• This current version of the list can be viewed on the Boeing 
web site as a basic message to those seeking advice from 
the company on the topic.  Its contents are also included 
for  the most part in ABET EC 2000.

An engineer should be able to ...


• Determine quickly how things work 
• Determine what customers want 
• Create a concept 
• Use abstractions/math models to improve a concept 
prototype version 
• Build or create a prototype
robustly test a prototype to improve

• Quantitatively and robustly test
concept and to predict

• Determine whether customer value and enterprise 

value are aligned (business sense)

• Communicate all of the above to various audiences 

• Much of this requires “domain-specific knowledge” and experience 
• Several require systems thinking and statistical thinking 
• All require teamwork, leadership, and societal awareness

Course Objective


Develop a holistic view and initial 
competency in engineering design by 
applying a combination of human creativity 
and modern computational tools to the 
synthesis of a simple component or system. 

16.810 

11 

Mind Map

“
Holistic View” - of the 
whole. Think about: 
- requirements,

design, manufacturing,
testing, cost ... 

“Engineering Design” 
- what you will likely 
do after MIT 

16.810

“Human Creativity and 
Computational Tools”: 
design is a constant inter-
play of synthesis and analysis 

“Competency” - can not

only talk about it or

do calculations, but

actually carry out the

process end-to-end


“Rapid Prototyping”  (cid:173)
a hot concept in 
industry today. 

“Components / Systems”:
part of all aerospace systems,
But must be “easy” to
implement in a short time

Learning Objectives 

At the end of this class you should be able to … 

(1) Carry out a systematic design process from conception through 
design/implementation/verification of a simple component or system. 

(2) Quantify the predictive accuracy of CAE versus actual test results. 

(3) Explain the relative improvement that computer optimization can 

yield relative to an initial, manual solution.


(4) Discuss the complementary capabilities and limitations of the

human mind and  the digital computer (synthesis versus analysis).

Basic Trade-offs in Product Development


Performance 

Schedule 

Risk

Cost

•  Performance - ability to do primary mission 
•  Cost - development, operation life cycle cost

•  Schedule - time to first unit, production rate 
•  Risk - of technical and or financial failure 
Ref: Maier, Rechtin, “The Art of Systems Architecting”

Key Differences in PDP’s


¢  Number of phases (often a superficial difference) 
¢  Phase exit criteria (and degree of formality) 
¢  Requirement “enforcement” 
¢  Reviews 
¢  Prototyping 
¢  Testing and Validation 
¢  Timing for committing capital 
¢  Degree of “customer” selling and interference 
¢  Degree of explicit/implicit iteration (waterfall or not) 
¢  Timing of supplier involvement
