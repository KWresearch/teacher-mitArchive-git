Abstract 

Engineering  has,  in  recent  decades,  taken  on  the  development  of  systems  of 
larger and  larger scale and  increasing complexity. Many examples can be found 
in  transportation, defense  and power generation. Such  systems, because of  their 
size  and  complexity  often  have  human  or  social  considerations  that  must  be 
accounted  for,  in  their  design.    This  paper  will  treat  aircraft  as  exemplars  of 
Engineering  Systems  with  the  objective  of  providing  a  better  understanding  to 
the  theoretical  underpinnings  of  this  newly  developing  discipline.   The  analysis 
considers  a  framework  comprising  three  dimensions  -  Technical,  Social  and 
Lifecycle  -  each  composed  of  substructure  which  characterizes  aircraft.    An 
observation  is  put  forth  that  interrelationships  within  and  between  the 
substructures of these dimensions, and among the dimensions, are critical.  With 
the  engineering  systems  framework  in  mind,  consideration  is  given  to  the 
aircraft  product  development  process  for  creation  of  lifecycle  value.    A  value

Introduction. 
 
Engineering has, in recent decades, taken on the development of systems of larger and 
larger scale and increasing complexity. Many examples can be found in transportation, 
defense and power generation. Such systems, because of their size and complexity often 
have human or social considerations that must be accounted for, in their design. 
 
This human/social interface creates a set of boundary conditions that are not normally (or 
easily) considered by the engineering science approach that has dominated education for 
the past 50 years. This approach, while it has made and continues to make significant 
contributions to education and practice, is reductionist in nature and normally ignores or 
treats as constant the human/social boundary values of this engineering problem.  
 
This is an issue that has come increasingly to concern engineering educators and 
practitioners in recent years. In what has become the traditional manner in engineering, 
practice is leading education in this matter.  Engineers designing large scale systems have 
been forced to go beyond what they learned in school and  take account of these factors 
in their designs. Educators are now taking cognizance of this and introducing new 
courses and programs dealing with engineering systems. In order for these new programs 
to be effective, we must now develop an intellectual basis for understanding the nature of 
engineering systems. We are presently a long way from that goal.

In the present paper,  the authors hope to provide a small step toward understanding, by 
examining one type of complex system, an aircraft, and examining the nature of its 
human/social interfaces at different levels of social and technical complexity.   It will be 
seen how modern aircraft design must be centrally concerned with the human/social 
aspects, as these often present the most difficult parts of the design problem.  
 
Engineering Systems Framework 
 
By almost any measure one would choose to examine, e.g. part count, cost, number of 
subsystems, product lifetime, etc., aircraft are technically sophisticated, large scale 
products.  Large organizations comprising many functional areas develop and produce 
aircraft, and they have extended enterprises encompassing thousands of suppliers.  
Aircraft also have important societal impact, being central to the movement of people and 
goods and to national defense.  Arguably, they also have significant environmental 
impact at both the community level (noise, emissions) and the global level (emissions, 
resource consumption). With aircraft lifetimes measured in decades, decisions made early 
in their product lifecycle have impact for many years.  For these reasons, aircraft 
represent an informative example of an engineering system.  
 
Based on the authors' insights, a framework composed of Technical, Social and Lifecycle 
dimensions is proposed to characterize engineering systems within the context of aircraft.  
The dimension representing the technical realization of the system is comprised of six 
levels ranging from individual parts or lines of code to the global environment.  The  
social dimension embodies all the stakeholders - from individuals to society - again in six 
levels. The third dimension called lifecycle represents the time axis of the framework, 
from first concept to final disposal of the aircraft.  Lifecycle aspects of both the physical 
and the social dimensions are important.  One might suggest that a dimension 
representing economics is also needed.  However,  the technical dimension encompasses 
cost elements and the social dimension encompasses stakeholder value expectations.  
Together these represent the important drivers of engineering system economics.  It is 
therefore suggested that aircraft engineering systems can be mapped into this three 
dimensional Technical-Social-Lifecycle space for analysis. 
 
More important than the sheer scale of these dimensions are the interrelationships - the 
“inters” - that exist between the dimensions, or between levels within the dimensions. 
Interrelationships within the technical dimension are a well known aspect of systems 
engineering (e.g. see INCOSE 2000) and will not be dwelt upon in this paper. While it 
would be interesting to examine the interrelationships within the social dimension, that 
would be a more likely topic for a paper on organizational sociology, per se.  In this 
paper, we are beginning from a base of a complex technical system and examining the 
interrelationships of the technical and lifecycle aspects with the social world.

An interrelationship is a “mutual or reciprocal relation or relatedness”.1 Interrelationships 
are many and varied, and might be characterized by: 
• 
Interconnection: “a state of being connected reciprocally” or Interface: “a surface 
forming a common boundary between adjacent regions, bodies, substances, or 
phases” 
• 
Interaction: “mutual or reciprocal action or influence” 
• 
Interdependency: “mutual dependence”. 
The relationship implied by interdependence is stronger than that by an 
interaction/interface or interconnection. For this reason interdependencies will be our 
primary, but not sole, focus.  It is often suggested that the “inters” are the prime source of 
complexity in engineering systems2.  For interesting discussions of complexity, see 
Sussman (2002) and Mindell (2002). 
 
Another relevant consideration, is the relationship between engineering systems and 
systems engineering.  Mindell (2002) addresses this topic in depth.  Mindell’s paper 
contends that systems engineering addresses the internal organization and technical 
dynamics, while engineering systems include the broader societal and social contexts.  
INCOSE (2000) provides a good discussion of the origins and scope of systems 
engineering, noting that it is still evolving, and states: 
 

“Systems engineering is an overarching discipline, providing tradeoffs and 
integration between system elements to achieive the overall best product and/or 
service.  Although there are some important aspects of project management in the 
Systems Engineering process, it is still much more of an engineering discipline than a 
management discipline.  It is a very quantitative discipline, involving tradeoff, 
optimization, selection, and integration of the products of many engineering 
disciplines.”  

 
This characterization support Mindell’s distinction between engineering systems and 
systems engineering. However, it is worth noting that a systems engineering pioneer 
Simon Ramo  stated (Jackson 2000): 
 

“Systems engineering is a branch of engineering that concentrates on the design and 
application of the whole as distinct from the parts.....looking at a problem in its 
entirety, taking into account all the facets and all the variables and relating the social 
to the technical aspects.” 
 
 
The distinctions between systems engineering and engineering systems may be more in 
how they are practiced and less in how they are defined.  Towards the end of this paper

2 Integration is an important topic, as are interrelationships, but not considered further in this paper. 
Aircraft are highly integrated, both in technical and social metrics.  Integrated Product Teams, Integrated 
Flight Systems, Integrated Databases and other terms such as these abound in the aircraft field.

we address the topic of stakeholder value and lifecycle value creation.  Perhaps the 
consideration of the number of stakeholders and their value expectations helps to sharpen 
the distinction between system engineering and engineering systems. In this paper, the 
authors take the perspective that large scale engineering systems have significant 
interaction of the social with the technical and lifecycle dimensions, and this is an 
important aspect of engineering systems. 
 
Technical Dimension 
 
Aircraft are physical objects, existing in a physical world consisting of matter and 
information - properties that can be quantified, manipulated, and produced.  A typical 
aircraft has millions of parts and millions of lines of code.  Each of these is engineered to 
perform a needed function so that the aircraft as a whole can fulfill its expected mission - 
be it civil or military.  With several dozen subsystems (fuel, flight control, air data, 
payload, weapon, ....) aircraft could be characterized as a system of subsystems.  But each 
aircraft is only one engineered system within a larger transportation or defense system, 
which are often characterized as systems of systems.  The technologies embedded in an 
aircraft span the full range of those found in a major school of engineering.  Indeed, the 
majority of engineers in an aircraft company are not aerospace engineers.  Electrical, 
mechanical, material, computer, civil, chemical, industrial, manufacturing, and other 
engineering disciplines are all represented in the design, production, and support of 
aircraft. Aircraft certainly represent an interesting example of an engineering system 
from a technical viewpoint. 
 
With such a large scale system, it may be helpful to introduce a series of levels 
representing the scales of the technical dimension.   
 

Level 0  The physical environment of the world  
Level 1  The air transportation system (aircraft, airports, air traffic management ...) 
or the air defense system (aircraft, satellites, missiles, ground stations....) 
Level 2   The aircraft and/or related systems (trainers, manufacturing systems, 
maintenance systems,...) 
Level 3  Major aircraft subsystems or subassemblies (radar, flight control, propulsion 
hydraulic, power, flap, landing gear....) comprised of both hardware and 
software (e.g. Operational Flight Programs)  
Level 4  Components (pumps, nacelles, control surfaces, LRUs.....) and major 
software units  
Level 5   Parts (fittings, fasteners, turbine blades,.....) and lines of code.  
 
Although presented as a hierarchy in scale, the various levels have some analogy to 
layers found in software systems.  Elements within each level interface directly with the 
levels above and below.  Interface definitions between levels permit some degree of 
interchangeability of elements within the layer.  For example, different models of aircraft 
can all operate within the air transportation system.  An air traffic controller can handle a 
large jet or a small general aviation aircraft.  Or a given aircraft designer is able to choose 
between multiple engines or hydraulic subsystems.  However, the layer analogy may not 

Murman and Allen

hold rigorously and it is best to consider the levels as a hybrid hierarchical and layer 
structure. 
 
Although interrelationships within the technical dimension are not the focus of this paper, 
a few illustrations are offered for completeness. For example, within Level 3, the wing 
and engine are interdependent.  The engine is dependent upon the wing structure for 
staying aloft, while the wing is dependent upon the engine thrust for staying aloft.  And 
the performance of each is dependent upon the other through aerodynamic interaction.  
To continue, the electrical system is dependent upon the engine for generating power, 
while the engine is dependent upon the power system for operation.  There are also 
interdependencies between levels.  For example, the failure of a part at Level 5 can spell 
disaster at the aircraft Level 2. This was illustrated by loss of Alaska Airlines flight 261 
in January 2000 off the coast of Southern California. It is believed that stripped treads on 
a gimbal nut for a jackscrew in the tail of the MD 80 caused loss of elevator control.  A 
failure to properly lubricate the jackscrew, which was a failure of the interdependent 
“Maintenance System”, resulted in the catastrophe.  As another example of 
interdependence between levels, aircraft propulsion relies on petroleum extracted from 
the natural environment.  But emissions from individual aircraft engines at Level 3, when 
multiplied by the size of the air transportation system of Level 1 can make a measurable 
impact on the global environment at Level 0. 
 
Social Dimension 
 
Large, complex engineering systems almost inevitably interact with humans, individually 
or collectively.  Aircraft are certainly not an exception to this rule.    Aircraft are created 
through the genius of people and the capability of human organizations, and aircraft are 
operated by, and serve the needs of humans.  These human stakeholders play out their 
roles at different levels of social complexity. There are individual designers, operators 
and users.  There are design teams, flight crews and cabin crews.  There are organizations 
that develop, manufacture, operate and support the systems.  Finally, there is society 
which interacts with this type of system in many ways.  These stakeholders for aircraft 
systems are  many as shown in Figure 1, and their interests vary widely.  In particular, 
stakeholders have different expectations for the value they will receive from an aircraft - 
a consideration we will return to later in this paper 3.   
 
As with the physical dimension, it is useful to introduce levels of the social dimension 
along a scale of social complexity.4: 
 

Level 0 
Society, nations, communities, etc.  
Level 1  Extended multi-organization enterprises including partners and suppliers 
(could either be extended program enterprise or corporate level multi-
program enterprise with several different business units)  

                                                 
3 An interesting discussion of aerospace enterprises and stakeholders can be found in (Nightingale, 2002). 
4 The authors acknowledge Alexis Stanke for thoughtful comments on the social levels

Level 2 

Single organizations (could be a division or business unit - may have one 
or more programs, projects, etc.)  
Level 3  Organizational units (programs, projects)  
Level 4  Working groups (teams, etc.)  
Level 5 
Individuals  

 
Moses (2002) discusses the ways by which engineering system are organized, noting 
three basic forms: hierarchies, networks, and layers.  This scheme can be applied equally 
well to the organizations that produce aircraft systems.  In this sense, the levels of 
aerospace organizations are a hybrid of the first two.  A single aircraft program follows a 
basic hierarchy.  However the extended enterprise of suppliers is more of a network.  
Within a program, an Integrated Product Team is network-like, but the levels within a 
program represented by a Work Breakdown Structure are certainly hierarchical.  A single 
aircraft program involves thousands of suppliers, hundreds of Integrated Product Teams, 
tens of thousands of individuals, and many industrial and government organizations.  As 
with the technical dimension, the scale of the social dimensions for aircraft makes them 
interesting examples of engineering systems.  
 
 
 
 
Lifecycle Dimension 
 
Aircraft are characterized by long lifecycles that introduce additional factors adding to 
their interest as candidates for engineering systems studies.  The lifecycle begins with 
conceptual design, progresses through detailed design, and production, testing, into 
operation, maintenance and eventually to disposal.  Many aircraft models re-enter this 
cycle periodically, with upgrade programs.  Both commercial and military aircraft are 
typically designed for about a 30 year lifetime.  But experience shows their lifetimes 
exceed this design objective.  Military fighters such as the F-14, F-15, F-16 and F/A-18 
are being programmed for 40 to 50 year lifetimes.  Civilian jet transports are 
experiencing similar lifetimes.  85 percent of Boeing 707 models, first introduced in 
1957, are still in service as are 67 percent of DC-8 models, a comparable product (Rubel, 
2002).  On the extreme end, the B-52 is now in middle age. It reached its 50th Birthday on 
April 11, 2002 and is projected to be in service until it is 94!  Such long lifetimes point to 
a number of factors which must be considered when designing engineering aircraft 
systems.  Let us consider two of these: lifecycle costs and the “ilities”. 
 
A rough characterization is that the costs of operating and maintaining an aircraft are 
about twice the cost of purchase (including financing for civilian aircraft).  Civilian and 
military end users want to minimize total lifecycle costs to provide greater returns on 
investments. Figure 2 taken from Fabrycky and Blanchard (1991) illustrates that one has 
the greatest leverage to reduce lifecycle costs at the very beginning of a program.  By the 
end of conceptual design, two-thirds of the lifecycle costs have been determined, even 
though only a small fraction has yet been realized.  And by the time production starts, 80 
percent of the lifecycle costs are locked into the product. The ability to affect substantial

change in lifecycle costs quickly diminishes with time.  Such insights illustrate the 
important role of the system architect and preliminary designers who make the critical 
decisions determining lifecycle costs, such as number of engines, types of material, 
modularity of subsystems, ease of maintenance, etc..  Lifecycle cost represents an 
important area of research by those dedicated to the study of engineering systems and an 
important topic to include in engineering systems curriculum 
 
Maintainability, supportability, reliability, flexibility, upgradability are but some of the 
“ilities” that arise with long lifecycles. Such topics don’t appear in traditional engineering 
science subjects.  They are part of systems engineering and therefore part of engineering 
systems.  In fact, the ilities alone could justify considering the lifecycle dimension as 
central for engineering systems framework.  Consider just one example, the impact of 
flexibility and upgradeability on an aircraft such as a B-52.  It was originally designed as 
a long range, high flying bomber for delivering nuclear bombs.  In the Vietnam War, the 
B-52 was modified to deliver conventional bombs in controversial carpet bombing 
sorties.  In Afghanistan it provided close air support at the direction of ground troops 
using the smart Joint Direct Attack Munition.  What was originally designed to be the 
ultimate strategic weapon has now adapted to a very effective tactical role.  Such 
different missions use a B-52 with the same basic airframe and engines, but with totally 
new offensive and defensive electronics and weapons integration - a combination of 
flexibility and upgradeability.  The example also illustrates the concept of clockspeeds 
for different technologies (Fine 1999).  Airframe technology evolves much more slowly 
than electronics technology, and engines are somewhere in between.  Product design 
must take this into consideration.  Such examples are frequent in aircraft - both civilian 
and military.   
 
These two illustrations of lifecycle considerations primarily represent factors of the 
technical dimension which evolve with time.  Subsequent sections will provide some 
illustrations of interrelationships of social factors with the lifecycle dimension. 
 
Technical/Social Interrelationships 
 
Interrelationshipss between the physical and social dimensions are critically significant. 
In fact, these lie at the heart of what many, such as Mindell (2002) would hold out as a 
defining characteristic of engineering systems.  Consider for example the 
interdependence between the technical architecture and an individual architect such as 
Kelley Johnson who conceived of aircraft such as the U-2 and SR-71.  Rechtin (1991) 
points out in his book on Systems Architecting that the architect must interact with both 
the technical system and multiple levels of the social system.  The architect can only 
achieve what is possible given the state of technology within the technical dimension.  It 
is interesting that the product architecture itself can influence the social dimension.  In 
the military market, the choice of manufacturers for subsystems and components, largely 
determined by the modularity of the product, can influence the political support for the 
program.  The major contractors of the F-22 program (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Pratt & 
Whitney) outsource 60-70% of their product by value to thousands of suppliers in almost 
every state of the United States.  When the F-22 program funding was seriously

challenged in Congress, the political support generated through these suppliers was a 
major factor in the final vote.  Similarly, in the commercial arena, the choice of 
international suppliers can significantly influence the likelihood of aircraft purchases.  
Taking this to an extreme, we have the question of what are labeled “offsets” connected 
with export sales.  Aerospace companies, in order to sell their products, often have to 
engage in helping potential customers to develop, manufacture or export products that 
have absolutely nothing to do with aerospace.  Wayne (2003), in a New York Times 
report, describes these as simply bribes in a different guise.  But they are necessary to do 
business in some social systems. 
 
Examining the interrelationships across the technical and social dimensions can go a long 
way in helping us to understand and better develop complex systems. In Table I, we can 
see a selected set of interrelationships between the two dimensions.  This set is far from 
exhaustive.  It serves to illustrate and suggest of the number and kinds of 
interrelationships that can develop between a complex technical system such as an 
aircraft and the human/social context in which it operates.  It would be interesting to map 
out which are interactions and which are interdependencies. 
 
System Components/Individuals.  Consideration of interactions at the level of system 
components and individual humans is neither new nor proprietary to engineering systems 
research and analysis.  It is the territory of what has been labeled for many years the 
“man-machine interface” or human engineering.  Nevertheless, it is an important issue 
that must be accounted for in the design of engineering systems.  One need only consider 
the fatal crash of the A320 aircraft in Strasbourg in 1992 (Carhart, et. al., 1999) to realize 
this.  The crash is attributed to the misreading of a “Dual Mode” instrument in the 
aircraft’s glass cockpit instrument system.  The aircraft was in final approach to landing 
when the pilots apparently misread the instrument, which could be set to read either glide 
slope angle or vertical speed.  The two modes had very similar formats and the pilots 
apparently confused them.  While the cause of the crash was officially classified as “pilot 
error” it might better be attributed to a faulty design of the user interface. 
 
Subsystems/Flight Crews. Flight crew dynamics have long been known to be a cause of 
difficulty in operating aircraft.  Social psychologists have applied the principles of group 
dynamics to activities on the flight deck and have had substantial success in developing 
training programs based on the resultant increased understanding.  Richard Hackman 
(1993) did a very interesting series of studies, in which he flew on the flight deck of 
several commercial airliners, He, reports on his observations: 
 

“Anyone who has logged much time watching cockpit crews has experienced both 
uplifting and depressing feelings. The first officer, who is flying the leg, calls for 
retraction of the flaps even as the captain’s hand is moving toward the lever. The 
coordination is smooth and seamless. Or the captain, reflecting privately on the 
deteriorating weather at the destination muses “Probably we ought to take a look at 
the approach plates for the alternate,” and the first officer, without a moment of 
hesitation responds “Yes I’ve got them right here…” Watching a great crew operate 

Murman and Allen

can be as impressive as watching a superb dance company perform a well-rehearsed 
ballet. 
 
“Watching  other  crews  can  make  you  wish  you  were  somewhere  else.  The 
captain’s  hand  moves  towards  the  lever  and  then  stops  halfway,  waiting,  while 
the  first officer pointedly keeps his eyes outside and his mouth shut. After some 
seconds  of  awkward  silence,  the  first  officer  announces,  “When  I’m  ready  for 
flaps  I’ll  call  for  them.”  And  things  go  downhill  from  there.  Or  when  a  last-
minute  runway  change  results  in  both  pilots,  heads  down,  flipping  pages 
hurriedly  to  find  the  new  plate while  the  observer,  his  eyes  alternating  between 
the gauges and the traffic outside, hopes that one of them finds it soon”. 

 
 
These are examples of interaction between level 3 of the technical system and level 4 of 
the social dimension. These activities may seem to be independent of the technical design 
and to some degree they are.  That design should, to the degree possible, take account of 
these possibilities and try to create an environment supportive of effective teamwork.  
This is an instance in which an engineering system perspective and approach to design 
can potentially yield great benefit. Without a solid understanding of the social/behavioral 
effects, however, the technical designer is working under a handicap.  
 
Responding to human error and group relations on the flight deck, aircraft designers 
have incorporated more and more navigational decisions and even approach and 
landing decisions into the flight control software.  So, as flight control software 
becomes more capable, there develops a design tradeoff over how much of the 
decision process to automate and how much to leave to humans. 
 
Bowers, et. al., (1993), in an interesting experiment using high fidelity flight 
simulators, found that for truly critical decisions less automated systems still 
outperformed more automated ones.  These results and analyses of the causes of 
crashes such as the one in Strasbourg have brought criticism on the degree of 
automation incorporated into many modern aircraft.  Carhart, et. al. (1999) argue that 
 

“…the plane is so automated that the pilot is for the most part reduced to the role 
of system manager, programming in flight paths and such, while the computer 
actually flies the plane.  With little to do, pilots become complacent.”5

 
This  is  an  important  area  that  warrants  further  study  and  one  which  should  help  lay 
out guidelines for software improvement.  
 
Turning from commercial passenger aircraft to military, we find, for at least high 
performance fighter aircraft, an essential need for an extreme degree of automation.  
Flying these high performance aircraft is simply beyond the capability of human beings.  
                                                 
5 A close colleague, who has flown in the jump seat on transpacific flights, tells us that on such flights the 
flight crew has little to do but check in by Satcom once per hour.

The plane has to be flown by computer.  The human is along to provide computer inputs 
(functioning in other words as a type of complex sensor) and to perform the few 
remaining critical decisions.  Carried to its extreme, we have the unmanned aerospace 
vehicle or UAV such as the Predator which has recently captured the headlines in 
Afghanistan and Yemen.  Plans go far beyond what we have seen so far, however.  
Boeing is now testing a far more advanced unpiloted Reconnaissance/Attack Unmanned 
Combat Aircraft, the X-45, and talks of the eventual production of pilotless cargo 
aircraft, which would be able to deliver express parcels from New York to Frankfurt with 
no one aboard. 
 
Here is an effort to deal with a particularly troubling system interface by eliminating it.  
It would seem, however, that as we eliminate interfaces at higher levels (e.g., Levels 4 
and 5) of social complexity, we will not only retain those at lower levels but may indeed 
complicate them.  Eliminating human operators from cargo aircraft will certainly raise 
concerns at Level  1 (air traffic system) of the technical dimension over the safety of 
people on the ground and in other aircraft that may be flying at the same time.  It will 
also extend the limits of the engineering system to include an extended ground-based 
navigational system and ground-based Non-Pilot Operator personnel6.  The technical 
interface with Social Levels 4 and 5 may not be entirely eliminated but shifted to a new 
location and Level 3 difficulties may be increased.  It will be interesting to see how this 
develops. 
 
At a still lower level on both the technical and social dimensions, the Hub and Spoke 
System of scheduling and routing commercial airline flights (Technical Level 1) has 
converted many airports into shopping malls (Social Level 1).  Under this system,7 flights 
are scheduled to fly between hubs where passengers are discharged and enabled to board 
connecting to their eventual destinations.  Since there is often a time lapse between the 
arrival an departure times, passengers have to spend in the airport.  It wasn’t long before 
a few enterprising restaurateurs saw this a business opportunity.  They were soon 
followed by usually up-market shops that saw a good potential market in the swarms of 
bored affluent passengers, inhabiting hub airports.  This has proven to be a boon to both 
the businesses and to the airports that rent them space. 
 
Lifecycle/Social Interrelationships 
 
The elements of the social dimension evolve with time leading to lifecycle/social 
interrelationships. One interesting example is knowledge management, an area of high 
current interest due to loss of employees through retirements and downsizing. Capturing 
and retaining knowledge pertinent to a particular aircraft over a lifecycle span of several 
human generations is a major challenge.  For engineered products whose lifecycle is 
comparable to the design cycle (e.g. personal computers), knowledge is generated and 
refreshed in an ongoing fashion.  Most engineers look forward to working on a program 
                                                 
6 The potential payoff to this is huge.  It is estimated that total unit production cost of an Unmanned 
Combat Aerospace Vehicle (UCAV) could be 50 percent of a comparable piloted aircraft and the lifecycle 
cost could be reduced by 75 percent, since it is no longer required to train and maintain proficient pilots.

for several years and then advancing to their next career opportunity.  But when the 
product lives on beyond the original designers or manufacturers, critical knowledge may 
be lost.  With the wave of consolidations and mergers in the aerospace industry during 
the 1990s, a number of organizations started knowledge management activities.  Most of 
these rely on electronic information systems to capture and categorize the knowledge 
residing in higher levels of the social dimension.  The success of these is still to be 
determined.  
 
One approach which accomplishes the re-generation, capture and transfer of knowledge 
is the use of product upgrades.  The F-16 program began in the early 1970’s and went 
into production in 1977 with the A/B models.  Since then, there have been nine major 
upgrades, each incorporating many new features.  The knowledge embedded in the 
current F-16 team at Lockheed Martin is excellent (Stanke, 2002).  A similar process 
occurs with commercial aircraft products.  The Boeing 737 was designed in the 1960’s.  
There have been two major upgrades with the 737-300/400/500 and 737-
600/700/800/900 series.  Currently the 737 program is undergoing major production 
changes with the incorporation of lean practices, including transition to a moving 
production line. Whatever the strategy, capture and retention of engineering knowledge 
about a particular aircraft system becomes an important consideration when lifecycles are 
long.  
 
As another example representing an  interrelationship at the lower level of the social 
dimension, products with lifecycle of many generations need to be robust to changes in 
society's attitudes and values which generally evolve over time scales measured in 
generations.  A good example of this for aircraft falls in the environmental area.  The 
early generations of jet transports had low bypass ratio jet engines which by and large 
were very noisy by today’s standards.  Although such aircraft as the DC 9 and B-727 are 
still fit for operation, they simply don’t meet today’s Stage III noise regulations.  The fix 
has been to install after market hush-kits to quiet the engines.  However, these products 
are doomed to disappearance from many countries because society will no long accept 
the impact on their community environment. New generations of aircraft must meet 
increasingly stringent community noise standards which have led to a reduction of 10 dB 
since 1980 and will need to have an additional 6 dB reduction by 2020. 
 
As a final example, consider the effect of individuals hijackers or small groups of 
terrorists on aircraft design and operation. D.B. Cooper’s hi-jacking of a B-727 on 
November 24, 1971 made rear exit ramps obsolete.  Subsequent hijackings led to the 
need for the extensive and expensive airport security systems the traveling public is all 
too familiar with.  And the terrorist incidents of September 11, 2001 turned commercial 
airliners into cruise missiles. This is leading to design changes and upgrades to cockpit 
access and other features of commercial aircraft.  And it may well lead to a new balance 
between large scheduled carrier jet transport and smaller charter or fractional ownership 
business jets. The lessons learned from these examples indicate that engineering systems 
architects and designers need to understand the “expectations” of people who seek to 
undermine society as well as the intended users of the products.

Product Development 
 
Product design and development is certainly the aspect of engineering systems where the 
human/social interface is, in many ways, strongest.  At an individual level (Level 5) there 
are the issues of creativity, problem solving, personnel selection, motivation and rewards 
and many other aspects that are for the most part not peculiar to engineering systems.  It 
is much more at levels 2 and 3 of both the technical and social dimensions that 
engineering systems have a different effect on product development. As size and 
complexity grow so too does management difficulty and complexity in organizing. We 
are no longer dealing with individuals, as individuals.  The important social entity now is 
the group or the group of groups that we call an organization.  The needs of engineering 
system developments have stimulated innovation in organizational structure.  It was the 
development of an engineering system in aerospace that produced the first matrix 
organization, for example.  So what are the characteristics of engineering systems that 
have the greatest effect on organizational structure?  One is certainly the high degree of 
interdependence inherent in their architecture.  Another is the degree of interfunctional 
relations that are inherent in large scale aerospace system development.  A third is the 
difficulty that is often encountered in transferring large systems such as aircraft from 
product development and into manufacturing.  Let us first focus on two of these issues 
together, viz, architectural interdependence and interfunctional interdependence.  
 
The form of group that is most important in product development is the project team.  
Both of these lead to a requirement that development work be done in teams or groups.  
These are generally labeled “project teams”.  A project team is a group of individuals, 
mostly engineers, working together to develop a new product, in this case an airplane.  
The total project team can be very large and comprise many smaller groups or teams.  
The smaller groups are often projects, in themselves, each working to develop some 
element or subsystem in the aircraft.  Since interdependence among the subsystems 
(fuselage, wing, navigational subsystem, communication subsystem, flight deck, etc.) is 
very high, the work of the various subgroups is also very interdependent.  Therefore, if 
these groups are left to reside in separate departments, coordination among them becomes 
very difficult, leading to interface problems, errors in design and so on.  For this reason, 
the project team form of management was developed. It soon turned out that the project 
team presented a different set of difficulties.  Engineers became too focused on a 
particular product development and tended to lose sight of new developments in their 
specialty beyond their particular project.  They needed to have greater contact with their 
disciplinary colleagues back in their “home” department.  Thus was born the matrix 
organization. It first appeared in the aerospace industry, largely due to the complex 
nature of the engineering systems that industry develops (Cf. Allen, 1986).  
 
At the outset, a single individual, the project manager or program manager, managed the 
project side of matrix organizations.  This is where budget responsibility usually lay and 
where the responsibility for coordination across engineering departments also resided.  
While this could be made to work within the product development or system

development function, it contributed little to managing relations with other functions 
such as marketing and manufacturing.  To address this issue, companies began to create a 
joint program management function in which managers from more than one function 
shared project responsibility.  Motorola was one of the first to adopt this scheme by 
giving joint responsibility for developing a product to a pair of managers, one from 
product development, the other from marketing.  This later expanded to become what are 
now called “integrated product teams”, or IPTs, which include managers from 
engineering, manufacturing, tooling, marketing and other functions.  The next step in this 
development was to extend the IPT to include all of the design engineers and others who 
would be involved in the development and manufacture of the system.  Such teams were 
then created at both the system and subsystem levels, resulting in a layered hierarchy of 
Integrated Project Teams.  Browning (1996) provides data that makes a strong argument 
for the effectiveness of IPTs operating at different levels, e.g. subsystem project teams, 
system level teams and program level teams (corresponding to Levels 4 and 5 in our 
structure).  IPTs can perform an effective integrating function within the organization, 
provided there is a full commitment and participation on the part of all members.  The 
difficulty often sets in when team members are too distracted by or overly committed to 
activities within their specialized functions.    
 
It is very important to remember that it is the very nature of large, complex engineering 
systems that forced the creation of all of these organizational innovations for use in their 
development8.  Simpler developments, involving fewer technologies and smaller 
engineering teams just do not warrant or need the degree of organizational complexity 
described here.  It wasn’t until engineering encountered the difficulties of large scale 
architectural interdependencies and the resulting need for close coordination across many 
dynamic technologies that such organizations had to be created. 
 
Another organizational area that is affected by engineering systems development is that 
of supply chains.  While suppliers of parts, components and entire subsystems are needed 
for even the simplest of projects, the scale and complexity of engineering systems 
certainly increases the need for and dependence upon suppliers (Fine, 1999).  Vertical 
integration back along the supply chain is possible but with the diversity of requirements 
in a large complex system it becomes very difficult and possibly undesirable to attain.  
Ford Motor Company, in fact, recently devolved by spinning off their parts division as a 
separate company. (Henry Ford must have rolled over in his grave.)  With the growth in 
size and complexity and investment requirements, aircraft manufacturers have confronted 
a need for greatly increased reliance on suppliers for even very large subassemblies 
(fuselage sections, empennage, etc.) and entire subsystems (electrical system, hydraulic 
system, flight control system, etc.).  Suppliers are now being integrated into customer 
IPTs. This is to provide early information to both customer and supplier. Once again, we 
see the complex needs of engineering system development fostering creativity in 
organizational design.  
 
                                                 
8 Some of these, such as matrix have been applied much more broadly beyond system development, with at 
best mixede results.

Engineering System development, particularly in aerospace, is responsible for a host of 
other management innovations. PERT and the Critical Path Method of project scheduling 
and monitoring are obvious examples. The complex requirements of developing such 
large complex systems pushed beyond existing managerial knowledge and capabilities 
and forced innovation. Many of these innovations are now diffused widely, to the general 
benefit of other industries and firms. This is a contribution stemming from the 
development of engineering systems that is largely unrecognized.  
 
 
Value Creation Framework 
 
Given the wide span of the three dimensions introduced above and the interactions and 
interdependencies among them, one might ask what approach can be used to successfully 
conceive, design and develop such a complex engineering systems as an aircraft.  It is an 
understatement to say that aircraft and other engineering systems represent an enormous 
challenge to engineers.  Well established engineering design techniques used in products 
of lesser scale would simply fail to address the technical, social and lifecycle issues of an 
engineering system.  In a recently published book (Murman, Allen, et. al 2002), the value 
creation framework shown in Figure 3 was introduced. Although it is relatively new, it is  
offered as a useful starting point as a framework for the development and operation of 
engineering systems.  A short overview is given here, suggesting the interested reader 
refer to the book. 
 
The value creation framework has three conceptual phases - value identification, value 
proposition, and value delivery - which collectively aim at “doing the right job” and 
“doing the job right”.  A critical step, indicated earlier in the paper is identifying all the 
key stakeholders (Figure 1) and their value expectations. . For an engineering system of 
the scope of an aircraft, this is not easy.  But it is necessary for a successful system.   
 
Although the phases of Figure 3 are conceptually distinct, in practice they may be applied 
iteratively as indicated by the small looping arrows.  The value identification and value 
proposition phases may be closely coupled. They should definitely precede the value 
delivery phase.  For the engineering system to adapt to changes in the technical and 
social dimensions, the phases need to be periodically revisited throughout the lifecycle, 
as indicated by the larger looping arrows.  Value expectations of the key stakeholders 
may change and the engineering system needs to adapt.  A recent example of this is the 
post September 11 expectations for commercial air transportation.  The applicability of 
the value creation framework to programs, corporate or government enterprises, and the 
national level is considered in some depth in the Murman, Allen et. al. book.

Lifecycle Value Creation in Product Development 

15

The value creation framework emerged simultaneously with a research study by Stanke 
(2001) that focused on four aircraft programs which had, by some measure, been deemed 
successful at product development for lifecycle value creation: 
 

777-300 - a recent upgrade to a large Boeing commercial jet transport 
F/A-18E/F - the newest version of the Navy’s multi role tactical aircraft 
F-16 C/D - an evolutionary USAF fighter with many international customers 
JAS 39 Gripen - a clean sheet Swedish design for a multi-role tactical aircraft 
 
The objective of the research was to identify the practices used by these programs to 
achieve lifecycle value creation.  Findings showed that many practices were common 
among these four programs, and they could be grouped into six categories of value 
attributes that span the three phases of the Figure 3 value framework9  
 
•  Holistic Perspective - both in terms of the entire system and its entire lifecycle.  
•  Organizational Factors - including cross-functional teams, organizational structure, 
and enterprise culture. 
•  Requirements and Metrics - developing, allocating, managing, and tracking 
requirements. 
•  Tools and Methods - modeling and simulation tools, system engineering and risk 
management methods, and other process models for, among others, business practices 
and information systems. 
•  Enterprise Relationships - open and honest communication, mutual trust, and respect 
amongst the stakeholders. 
•  Leadership and Management - leading the program enterprise and interfacing with 
the multi-program and national enterprise, as well as managing program enterprise 
people and processes. 

 
 
 
These value attributes and practices which support them (Stanke 2002) span the three 
dimensions of the engineering systems framework we have been discussing.  Based upon 
four aircraft programs that have obtained some measure of lifecycle value, they offer 
evidence that all three dimensions are important.  
 
Summary 
 
A three-dimensional engineering systems framework based on technical, social and 
lifecycle factors has been introduced in this paper.  It seems clear that technical and 
social dimensions are important to engineering systems.  To the authors, it also seems 
clear that lifecycle issues are important. An important element of the proposed 
engineering systems framework centers on creation of lifecycle value.  The engineering 
systems framework introduced in this paper emerged from discussions of the need for 
greater understanding of the nature and essentials of engineering systems.
