***** Subject Description *****
Aircraft are complex products comprised of many subsystems which must meet
demanding customer and operational lifecycle value requirements. The subject
adopts a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic systems
engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance; safety and
reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and
management; and system realization. Small student teams "retrospectively
analyze" an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions;
aircraft attributes and subsystems; operational experience. Oral and written
versions of the case study are delivered.
***** Learning Objectives *****
At the completion of 16.885, students will have gained:
    * An appreciation of an aircraft as a system, operating within a larger air
      transportation or air defense system, and comprised of many subsystems
    * Understanding of, and ability to apply, basic concepts for:
          o Systems Engineering: Requirements, Interface mgmt, Verification and
            Validation
          o Cost and Weight Analysis and Estimation
          o Performance Analysis
          o Reliability and Safety
          o The Function, Architecture and Key Performance Issues of Major
            Subsystems
          o Risk Analysis and Management
          o Design Closure to Deliver Lifecycle Value
    * An ability to understand complex systems and design choices through the
      retrospective analysis of existing aircraft systems
***** Measurable Outcomes *****
    * Retrospective Analysis of an Existing Aircraft Design, Delivered in both
      Written and Oral Forms
    * Individual Contributions to Case Study Team Effort as Reported by Student
      and Teammates
    * Class Participation
    * End of Semester Interview with Course Faculty on Achievement of Learning
      Objectives
***** Subject Organization *****
    * The semester deliverable will be a written case study of an existing
      aircraft developed by a team of 4-5 students. There will be interim
      written and oral versions.
    * Lectures on Tuesday and Thursday will cover material that should be
      relevant to the case study. The format will be approximately 75 minutes
      of lecture and 15 minutes of questions and discussion.
    * Hardcopy of lecture notes/slides will be handed out. Available electronic
      versions can be found in the lecture_notes section.
    * The lab on Wednesday at 4 pm will be allocated to team meetings or team
      oral presentations.
    * A field trip to Sikorsky in Stratford, CT will be scheduled.
