–	 Systems engineering: requirements, interface mgmt, verification & 
validation 
–	 Cost and weight analysis and estimation. 

–	 Performance analysis 
–	 Reliability and safety 
–	 The function, architecture and key performance issues of major 
subsystems 
–	 Risk analysis and management 
–	 Design closure to deliver lifecycle value

•	 An ability to understand complex systems and design choices 
through the retrospective analysis of existing aircraft systems. 

16.885J/ESD.35J - Sep 4, 2003

21st Century Jet: The Building of 

the 777


Part I - 9:15-16:10 (6 min 50 sec) 

Covers the 777 “Value Proposition” struck  

between United Airlines and Boeing 


16.885J/ESD.35J - Sep 4, 2003 
Value Creation Framework

Value - how various stakeholders find particular 
worth, utility, benefit, or reward in exchange for 
their respective contributions to the enterprise. 
Value Phases 


Value 
Identification 

Value 
Proposition 

Value 
Delivery

Identify the

Stakeholders


A fundamental challenge 
of any program is to satisfy 
multiple stakeholders 
expectations for product 
–  Performance/quality

–  Schedule/availability

–  Cost/financial return 

with acceptable risk.

21st Century Jet: The Building of 

the 777


Part I - 17:12-20:32 (3 min 30 sec) 

Addresses the technical complexity of 
aircraft with its many components 
which interact, requiring the use of 
mockups, originally physical and now 
digital, to visualize the interactions.

Technical Dimension


6 Level Hierarchy 

0 - Physical environment of the world 

1 - The air transportation system or 
the air defense system 

2 - The aircraft and/or related systems 

3 - Major subsystems or subassemblies: 
both hardware and software 

4 - Components or major software units 

5 - Parts or lines of code 

16.885J/ESD.35J - Sep 4, 2003


The “Inters”


•	

•	

Interrelationship: “mutual or reciprocal relation or 
relatedness”. 
Interrelationships take various forms with increasing 
degrees of relatedness 
–  Interconnections (or interfaces): “a state of being 
connected reciprocally” 
–	 Interactions: “mutual or reciprocal action or influence”

–	 Interdependencies: “mutual dependence” 
•	 Large-scale systems are characterized by many elements 
which, through their interrelationships, deliver greater 
capability than the sum of the individual elements alone.

6 Level Hierarchy 

Examples of Technical Dimension Inters

•  Emissions from engines (3) 
multiplied by size of a/c fleet 
(1) impacts global 
environment (0). 

•	 Engine (3) provides thrust 
for wing (3) which provides 
lift for engine, both coupled 
through aerodynamics 
•  AA Flight 261 accident 
–  Stripped elevator lead 
screw (5) caused loss of a/c 
system (2) 
–  Maintenance system (2)

Working Together
Learning Community 

•	 Establish and maintain program credibility 
•	 Open and honest communication 
•	 Encourage and reward asking for help 
•	 Utilize knowledge regardless of where it originate

•	 Share responsibilities for decisions using a well-defined 
process 
•	 Maintain two way dialog in working relationships, do 
both listening and talking 
•  Value people for the skills they contribute to the 

program with mutual respect and appreciation

Lifecycle Issues 
•	 Lifecycle Costs 
–  ~1/3 of lifecycle cost is acquisition, 2/3 is operation 
•	 The “ilities” dominate the life cycle 
–	 Reliability, maintainability, supportability, 

upgradeability

•	 Product evolution

–	 E.G. B-52 was designed as a strategic bomber with 
predetermined missions, yet used in Afghanistan in 
a tactical delivering JDAMs directed by ground 
spotters. 
•	 Knowledge management
