1979.  He then joined Boeing at the beginning of the 757 and 767 programs in Flight Deck Integration 
assisting in the development and certification of the crew interfaces for EICAS (Engine Indication and 
Crew Alerting System) and other airplane systems.  Subsequent assignments involved development of 
guidance, alerting systems, and displays in support of the Boeing-led Windshear Task Force, development 
and testing of primary flight control interfaces and displays concepts on the 7J7 program, and participation 
on RTCA and ATA industry committees associated with the definition of crew interfaces and procedures 
for TCAS. 

As a manager in Flight Crew Operations Integration from 1991 to 1998, Mr. Kelly oversaw several aspects 
of the development and certification of the 777 flight deck and subsequently other models.  He is currently 
a Boeing Technical Fellow and represents Boeing on the ARAC committee for Flight Crew Error/Flight 
Crew Performance Considerations in the Flight Deck Certification Process and is developing certification 
and validation plans for 7E7 Flight Deck .
