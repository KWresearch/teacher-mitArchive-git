Design challenges
Landing gear dynamics
• Brake energy
K(e) = ½ W/g x (Vx,z)2  
= ½ (450,000 lb)/32.5 ft/sec2 x (220 ft/sec)2
~ 340,000,000 ft lbs.
• Vertical energy
= ½ (450,000 lb)/32.5ft/sec2 x (10ft/sec)2
~ 700,000 ft lbs.
• Dynamics – natural frequencies

Design Process and
Program Management systems
• Long cycle times – 48 months?

• Development cost vs. program ROI

• What is the purpose of engineering?

Impact of the design process
on company viability

• Aircraft production example

Ron Suiter

Results of airplane 
production analysis: 
• Strategic cost driver (1985 - 1990):
personnel experience dilution
• Policy contradiction (1987-1989):
increased build target + cap on hiring
• Parts count / design complexity
• Removal of hiring cap (1990):
– Throughput targets achieved
– Per-airplane cost declined 45% in one year

Aircraft System Design - MIT
Design drives company viability

• 80 + % of product cost determined early
• Company viability / ability to close the 
business case on new designs determines 
ability to launch new products
• Flow of new products develops engineering 
experience base critical to good design

Aircraft System Design - MIT
Airline systems
• Airline viability ~ ability to buy / launch 
airplanes 
– Driven by 7 to 10 year business cycle
– Sensitive to special events, Gulf, 9/11
– High capital, labor costs, very thin margins
– Long aircraft acquisition lead times
– Business model, network structure

ATM System (of systems)
• Challenge to expand capacity of National 
Airspace System (NAS) by 2X by 2025?
• Impact of aircraft economics on NAS
• Divide workload between cockpit and 
ground
• Value to airlines to equip?

Aircraft System Design - MIT
The critical issues
• SE / program management interface
– Ability to manage / trade the BIG risks
• Design cycle time
• Ability to close business case on new planes
• Personnel experience management
• Enterprise portfolio of technologies and 
programs to minimize risk
• Program management and corporate culture

Ron Suiter

28

Aircraft System Design - MIT
Direction of Solution
• Top-down design tools - architecture
• Model-based design - technical and organization 
performance
• Enterprise simulation based technology and 
program portfolio management decision support 
• Change the paradigm in concurrent engineering 
& engineering personnel management 
– JPL Project Design Center
– Drop pay-to-market HR policies

Aircraft System Design - MIT
The Future
• Ability to deal with complexity of systems of 
systems “top-down”
– The solution to your system problem can be found in 
the larger or adjacent systems

• Designing airplanes within the context 
of…organization, airline/ATC, economic systems

• The challenge – pick YOUR system and improve 
its viability
