Flight Control Systems

For Tactical Military Aircraft 

•  Other Factors Influencing Architecture 
–  Flight Control System Team (Government/Contractors/Suppliers) 
•  Experience of Team Leaders 
•  Lessons Learned 
•  Team Members Strongly Held Preferences 
•  Organization 
–  Total System Vs Subsystem/Component 
–  System Integration Responsibility 
–  Integration of Interfacing Systems/Subsystems 
–  System Testing 
–  Development Plan / Integrated Schedules

Brief History of F/A-18A


•  1974 Navy Fighter Study 
•  DOD Direction HI/LO Mix (F-14/F-15 & Low Cost Fighter) 
•  USAF and Navy Use Light Weight Fighter YF-16 or YF-17 
•  Contractor Teams 
–  General Dynamics - LTV 
–  Northrop - McDonnell Douglas 
•  Flight Controls 
–  YF-16 Fly-By-Wire 
–  YF-17 Hydro-Mechanical and CAS 
•  USAF Selected the YF-16 
•  Navy Selected Naval Version of YF-17 to Become F/A-18 
•  F/A-18 Required Changes to YF-17 Flight Control System

Navy Experience and Concerns  

That Drove Requirements 

•  Reliability History of Their Fleet 
–  Electrical Wiring, Connectors and Generators 
–  Electronic Systems (Autopilot, Autothrottle, etc.) 
•  Maintainability History - Needs Major Improvement 
•  Carrier Operations 
–  Approach Speed 
–  Catapult/Arresting Gear Loads 
–  Spotting Factor (Wing Fold) 

– Environment

•  Corrosion Due to Humidity and Salt Water 
•  Electromagnetic Interference 
–  “Blue Water Operations” - No Alternate Field in Range 
•  Survivability 
•  First Production Digital FBW Flight Control System 
–  Electromagnetic Interference 
–  Generic Software Failures

Design Approach: 

•	 Use Airframe As Electromagnetic Shield (Carbon/epoxy) 
•	 Antenna EM Radiation Control 
•	 Subsystem EM Control: Bonding, Twisted/Shielded Wiring, 
Filter Pin Connectors 
•	 Ground Plane Interface Requirements

F/A-18A Flight Control System

Redundancy Levels

•	 Redundancy Levels Driven By Reliability and Survivability 
•	 Control Functions Critical to Flying Qualities and/or Safety Must Have 
Two-Fail-Operate/Fail-Safe Capability 
–	 Primary Control Commands 
–	 Motion Sensors 
–	 Stabilator Actuators 
–	 Trailing Edge Flap Actuators (Needed for Carrier Landing) 
•	 Control Surfaces with Aerodynamic Redundancy and Less Critical 
Functions Must Have Fail-Operate/Fail-Safe Capability 
•	 Survivability Protection Dictated Separation of Control Functions 
–	 Flight Control Computers 
–	 Motion Sensors 
Interconnecting Wiring 
–
