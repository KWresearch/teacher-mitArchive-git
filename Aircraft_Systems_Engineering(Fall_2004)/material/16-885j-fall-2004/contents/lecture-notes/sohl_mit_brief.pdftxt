Purpose:


• To develop a system 
• Reduce program risk 
• Ensure operational supportability 

• Ensure design for producibility 
• Assure affordability 
• Demonstrate system integration, 
interoperability, and utility 

System Integration 
System Integration 

•	 Purpose: Integrate subsystems – reduce 
systems-level risk 
•	 Key Activities: 

í	 Demonstrate prototype articles

í  Conduct an Early Operational 

Assessment (EOA)

í  Prepare for Critical Design Review 
(CDR) 
í	 Prepare RFP for next effort/phase 


System Demonstration 
System Demonstration 

•	 Purpose: Demonstrate the ability of the 
system to operate in a useful way 
consistent with the validated KPPs. 
•	 Key Activities:

í	 Conduct extensive testing: developmental, 
operational, and survivability/lethality testing, 
as appropriate 
í  Conduct technical reviews, as appropriate 
í  Demonstrate system in its intended 
environment 
í  Prepare RFP for Low Rate Initial Production 
í  Prepare for Milestone C 
í  Update: Information requirements

Demonstration Phase 

•  May consist of System Integration and

System Demonstration depending on:


– technology maturity


– affordability 

•  System demonstrated in the intended 
environment; meets validated 
requirements; industrial capability 
available; meets exit criteria 

•  Manufacturing risk low 

Bottom Line:  System ready to begin LRIP? 

F/A-18A/B/C/D “Hornet” 

• Supersonic, Multi-role, Combat Aircraft 
– Introduced to fleet in 1983 
• Relevant Design Features 
– “Fly-by-wire” Flight Controls 
– Twin Vertical Stabilizers 
– Leading Edge Extension (LEX) 
– Two Turbofan Engines 
• SuperHornet (E/F Models) 
– Introduced to fleet in 2001 

Flight Control System 


• Two Digital Flight Control Computers (FCC)

– Four separate channels 
• Control Augmentation System 
– Augments basic airframe stability 
– Gains scheduled to enhance flying qualities 
– Provides departure resistance 
– Provides protection against overstress 
– Actively controls structural mode interaction 

Program Origin


•  Need to upgrade the FCC software

– Mishap  Prevention 
•  Suppress out of control flight modes

•  Improve departure resistance 
– Improve maneuverability at high AOA 
•  Improve roll performance above 30° AOA 
•  Implement “Pirouette” Feature

•  Post Departure Gyrations

Departure Resistance 


The Usual Cause of a Departure: 
Roll or yaw due to sideslip (E)

overcomes control surface authority 

E 

Key to Controlled Flight: 
Minimize E with control surfaces 
“Sideslip is the root of all evil” 

E  =  Sideslip  = 


Another Reason for Sideslip Control 

Roll (Coupled) Departure 

Program Overview


• $15 Million dollars 
• Program Timeline 
•  Improved control laws developed (1988-90) 
•  Baseline design used in SuperHornet (1993) 
•  SuperHornet Developmental Test (1995-99) 
•  “Heritage Hornet” upgrade proposed (2000) 
•  New Control Law Developmental Test (2001-02) 
•  Release to Fleet (June 2003) 

Major Design Goals


• Control sideslip buildup 
E
– Add sideslip rate (  ) feedback 
– Enhance sideslip (E) feedback 
• Generate additional yaw rate 
– Use Adverse Yaw to our advantage 

•  Command opposite differential-stabilator 

Sideslip Control at High AOA 

At low AOA… 

At high AOA…


Yawing motion produces sideslip 
Rudder deflection controls sideslip 

Rolling motion produces sideslip

Rolling surfaces control sideslip


Design Process


• Implement E/F High AOA Architecture 
• Adapt for A/B/C/D Architecture 
• Tailor Gains to A/B/C/D Aerodynamics 
• USN/Contractor Test Team Involvement

•  Integrated Test Team Philosophy 
•  Team Members able to review all documentation 

Program Constraints


•  No hardware changes 
– FCC software changes ONLY 
•  No software changes to Mission Computer

•  No changes to Air Data System 
– No modification to AOA Probes 
– No provision for Sideslip Probe 

Program Challenges 


•  High Risk Flight Test 
– Intentional Out of Control Flight Maneuvers 
•  Tailslides 
•  Spins 
•  Aggravated Inputs 
– Risk Mitigation 
•  Extensive Simulations and Bench Tests

•  Spin Chute Study 

Program Challenges 


•  No direct measurement of Sideslip 
– Must develop software to estimate Sideslip 

•  AOA Probe Range = -14° to 35° AOA 
– Need to estimate AOA above 35° degrees 
•  AOA estimate required to generate the new 
feedback signals (Sideslip and Sideslip Rate) 
•  Also needed to schedule gains at high AOA


Developmental Flight Test


• 70 flights for 100 hrs 
– Used both two-seat and single-seat aircraft 
• 8 external store loadings 
• Approximately 600 test points 
– 400 Rolls 
– 48 Spins 
– 63 Tailslides 
– 1v1 Operational Maneuvering 
– Aggravated Control Inputs 
– Failure Modes
