Structural Loads Control  


The Digital Flight Control is Very Effective in Controlling 
Structural Loads 

•  Control Wing/Pylon Loads With Heavy Stores 

•  Control Wing-Fold and Wing-Root Bending Loads 

•  Redistribute Loads by Scheduling Control Surfaces 

•  Limit Loads by Scheduling Maximum Control Deflection 

•  Limit Maximum Load Factor - Pilot Over-Ride

A Brief Discussion on Systems Engineering From the 
Integrated Product Development Team Perspective 

What is Systems Engineering ? 

“Systems Engineering integrates all the disciplines and specialty 
groups into a team effort forming a structured development process 
that proceeds from concept to production to operation.  Systems 
Engineering considers both the business and the technical needs 
of all customers with the goal of providing a quality product that meets 
the user needs”.

Management Processes to Support IPT


•  Requirements Flow Down 
•  Budget 
•  Allocated to IPT 
•  Management Reserve - Held at Program Manager Level 
•  Integrate Schedules 
•  Weekly Earned Value 
•  DOD Cost & Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC) 
•  Weekly Program Managers Meeting 
• Cost
 
•  Schedule 
• TPM  
•  Problems / Issues 
•  Risk Management

Risk Management Status

•  Assess Likelihood That Risk Will Happen (1=not Likely, 5=near Certainty) 
•  Assess Consequence of Risk Being Realized (1=min. Impact, 5=unacceptable) 
•  Determine Type of Risk: Schedule, Cost, or Technical

What is Earned Value Management ?  


BCWS = Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled 
ACWP = Actual Cost of Work Performed 
BCWP = Budgeted Cost of Work Performed 

Cost Variance = BCWP - ACWP 
Schedule Variance = BCWP - BCWS
