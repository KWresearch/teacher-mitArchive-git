NOTES ON CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS(cid:10)

•	 Burning a gallon of fuel at 11km has about double the radiative 
impact of burning a gallon of fuel at sea-level 

•	 Burning a gallon of fuel at 19km has about 5 times the impact 
at sea-level 

•	 CO2 is not the biggest global concern (potential impacts from 
contrails and cirrus clouds are greater). 

•	 Large imbalance between northern and southern hemisphere 

•	

Improving engine efficiency tends to make NOx and contrails 
worse 

•	 High uncertainty

THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY:(cid:10)
CHARACTERISTICS OF AVIATION SYSTEMS 

•  Safety critical 

•  Weight and volume limited 

•  Complex 

•  10-20 year development times 

•  $30M to $1B per unit capital costs 

•  25 to 100 year usage in fleet 

•  Slow technology development and uptake

COMMERCIAL vs. MILITARY FLEET TRENDS(cid:10)
• Demand growth for civil aviation (3.8%/year in US) 
• Military fleet contraction 
• Ops tempo (4.3/day commercial,  0.35/day military)

•	 Function of performance of entire system 

–	 Aircraft technology (structures, aerodynamics, engines) 

–	 Aircraft operations (stage length, fuel load, taxi/take-
off/landing time, flight altitude, delays, etc.) 

–	 Airline operations (load factor) 

•	 Each component of system can be examined independently 
for reduced fuel burn and impacts on local air quality and 
regional/global atmospheric effects

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ENERGY INTENSITY TRENDS(cid:10)

•	 New technology energy intensity has been reduced 60% over last 40 
years (jet age) 
–	 57% due to increases in engine efficiency 
–	 22% due to increases aerodynamic performance 
–	 17% due to load factor 
–	 4% due to other (structures, flight time efficiency, etc.) 
–	 Structural efficiency constant (but traded for aero, passenger 
comfort, noise and SFC) 
–	 Flight time efficiency constant (balance of capacity constraints and 
improved ATM) 
•	 Fleet average energy intensity has been reduced 60% since 1968 
–	 Lags new technology by 10-15 years

TECHNOLOGY AND EMISSIONS(cid:10)

•	

Improvements will not keep up with growth 

•	 Aircraft typically have greater impact per unit of fuel burned 

•	 “Solutions” for global climate will require unprecedented action 
(demand management/regulations, electric vehicles, contrail avoidance, 
etc.) 

•	 Current understanding is that hydrogen makes problem worse 

•	 High uncertainty relative to global impacts 

•	 Engine efficiency improvements exacerbate NOx and contrails 

•	 Significant improvements in structural efficiency, aero and operations 
are possible 

– Improvements in these areas do not exacerbate other problems 

© 2003 Waitz 

61 

SUMMARY(cid:10)

•	 Broad range of environmental impacts from aircraft 

–	 Social costs of same order as industry profits 

–	 Currently not internalized 

–	 Current technology path and regulations not aligned 
with social costs 

•	 Strong growth in demand 

•	

Increasing public concern/regulatory stringency 

•	 High uncertainty 

•	 Many competing trades 

–	 Environmental impacts 

–	 Design, operations
