September 18, 2003


Today’s Topics

•	 Specific fuel consumption and Breguet range 
equation 
•	 Transonic aerodynamic considerations

•	 Aircraft Performance 
–	 Aircraft turning 
–	 Energy analysis 
–	 Operating envelope 
–  Deep dive of other performance topics for jet transport 
aircraft in Lectures 6 and 7 
•	 Aircraft longitudinal static stability


•	 Definition:  TSFC  

•	

Thrust Specific Fuel Consumption (TSFC)

lb of fuel burned 
(lb of thrust delivered)(hour) 
•	 Measure of jet engine effectiveness at converting fuel to 
useable thrust 
Includes installation effects such as 
–	 bleed air for cabin, electric generator, etc.. 
–	 Inlet effects can be included (organizational dependent) 
•	 Typical numbers are in range of 0.3 to 0.9. Can be up to 1.5

•	 Terminology varies with time units used, and it is not all 
consistent. 
–	 TSFC uses hours 
–	 “c” is often used for TSFC 
ct 
–	 Another term used is 

lb of fuel burned 
(lb of thrust delivered)(sec)

Strategies for Mitigating Transonic Effects


•  Wing sweep 
–  Developed by Germans. Discovered after WWII by Boeing 
–  Incorporated in B-52
•  Area Ruling, aka “coke bottling” 
–  Developed by Dick Whitcomb at NASA Langley in 1954
•  Kucheman in Germany and Hayes at North American contributors 
–  Incorporated  in F-102
•  Supercritical airfoils 
–  Developed by Dick Whitcomb at NASA Langley in 1965
•  Percey at RAE had some early contributions 
–  Incorporated in modern military and commercial aircraft


Basic Sweep Concept

•	 Consider Mach Number normal to leading edge 
Mf  Mn
=Mfcos/
/ 

P 

sin	 P=1/ Mf
P = Mach angle, 
the direction 
disturbances 
travel in 
supersonic flow 

•	 For subsonic freestreams, Mn  < Mf - Lower effective “freestream” 
Mach number delays onset of transonic drag rise. 
•	 For supersonic freestreams 
– Mn < 1, / > P - Subsonic leading edge 
– Mn > 1, / < P - Supersonic leading edge 
•	 Extensive analysis available, but this is gist of the concept 

Wing Sweep Considerations Mf > 1

•  Subsonic leading edge 
– Can have rounded subsonic type wing section 
•  Thicker section 
•  Upper surface suction 
•  More lift and less drag 
•  Supersonic leading edge 
– Need supersonic type wing section 
•  Thin section 
•  Sharp leading edge 

Competing Needs 


•  Subsonic Mach number 
– High Aspect Ratio for low induced drag 

•  Supersonic Mach number 
– Want high sweep for subsonic leading edge 
•  Possible solutions 
– Variable sweep wing - B-1 
– Double delta - US SST 
– Blended - Concorde 
– Optimize for supersonic - B-58 

Supercritical Airfoil


C p 

V8
 

C p, cr 

x/c 

Supercritical 
airfoil shape 
keeps upper 
surface velocity 
from getting too 
large. 
Uses aft camber 
to generate lift. 
Gives nose 
down pitching 
moment. 

Today’s Performance Topics

•  Turning analysis 
–  Critical for high performance military a/c. Applicable to all. 
–  Horizontal, pull-up, pull-down, pull-over, vertical 
–  Universal M-Z turn rate chart , V-n diagram 
•  Energy analysis 
–  Critical for high performance military a/c. Applicable to all. 
–  Specific energy, specific excess power 
–  M-h diagram, min time to climb 
•  Operating envelope 
•	 Back up charts for fighter aircraft 
– M-Z diagram - “Doghouse” chart 
–  Maneuver limits and some example 
–  Extensive notes from Lockheed available. Ask me.


Horizontal Turn

W = L cosI, I = bank angle

Level turn, no loss of altitude 

Fr  = (L2  - W2)1/2  =W(n2-1)1/2 
Where n { L/W = 1/ cosI is the load 

factor measured in “g’s”.  

But Fr  = (W/g)(V2 
/R)

So radius of turn is 

R = V2 
/g(n2-1)1/2 
And turn rate  Z =  V/R is 
Z=  g(n2-1)1/2 / V 
Want high load factor, low velocity

Load factor, in 'g's

For large n, KZ » 1 and for all maneuvers Z #  gn/ V 
/gn. 
Similarly for turn radius, for large n, R # V2 
For large Z and small R, want large n and small V 

Z # gn/ V  = gn/aM  so Z ~ 1/ M  at const h (altitude) & n 
Using R # V2 
/gn, Z # V/R = aM/R. So Z ~ M  at const h & R 
For high Mach numbers, the turn radius gets large 

Rmin  and Zmax

Using V  = (2L/USCL)1/2  = (2nW/USCL)
1/2
R # V2 
/gn 
becomes  R = 2(W/S)/ gUCL 
W/S = wing loading, an important performance parameter 
And using n = L/W = UV2 
SCL/2W 
Z # gn/ V= g UV CL/2(W/S) 
For each airplane, W/S set by range, payload, Vmax. 
Then, for a given airplane 
Rmin  = 2(W/S)/ gUCL,max 
max   = g UV CL,max /2(W/S) 
Z
Higher CL,max  gives superior turning performance. 
But does n CL,max  = UV2 
 CL,max/2(W/S) exceed structural limits?

Summary on Turning

•	 Want large structural load factor n

•	 Want large CL,MAX 
•	 Want small V 
•	 Shortest turn radius, maximum turn rate is 
“Corner Velocity” 

•	 Question, does the aircraft have the power 
to execute these maneuvers? 

Specific Energy and Excess Power 

Total aircraft energy = PE + KE 
Etot  =  mgh + mV2/2 
Specific energy = (PE + KE)/W 
He  = h + V2/2g  “energy height” 
Excess Power = (T-D)V 
Specific excess power* 
= (TV-DV)/W 
= dHe/dt 
Ps  = dh/dt + V/g dV/dt 
Ps  may be used to change altitude, or accelerate, or both 
* Called specific power in Lockheed Martin notes.

PA  = TV  and Thrust is approximately 
constant with velocity, but varies 
linearly with density.

Excess power 
depends upon 
velocity, altitude 
and load factor 

Altitude Effects on Excess Power

PR  = DV  = (nW/L) DV 
= nWV  CD/CL 
From L= USV2 
  CL/2 = nW, get 
V  = (2nW/ USCL)

1/2
Substitute in PR  to get

PR  = (2n3W3C2
D/ USC3
L)
1/2
So can scale between sea level “0” and 
altitude “alt” assuming CD,CL  const. 
Valt  = V0(U0/Ualt)1/2, PR,alt  = PR,0(U0/Ualt)
1/2
Thrust scales with density, so 
PA,alt  = PA,0(Ualt/U0) 

Summary of Power Characteristics

• He  = specific energy represents “state” of aircraft. Units are in 
feet. 
–	 Curves are universal 
• Ps  = (T/W-D/W)V= specific excess power 
–	 Represents ability of aircraft to change energy state. 
–	 Curves depend upon aircraft (thrust and drag) 
–	 Maybe used to climb and/or accelerate 
–	 Function of altitude 
–	 Function of load factor

Stability and Control

•	 Performance topics 
deal with forces and 
translational motion 
needed to fulfill the 
aircraft mission 
•	 Stability and control 
topics deal with 
moments and 
rotational motion 
needed for the aircraft 
to remain controllable.

Aircraft Moments


•	 Aerodynamic center (ac): forces and moments can be completely 
specified by the lift and drag acting through the ac plus a moment about 
the ac 
– CM,ac  is the aircraft pitching moment at L = 0 around any point 
•	 Contributions to pitching moment about cg, CM,cg  come from 
–	 Lift and CM,ac 
–	 Thrust and drag - will neglect due to small vertical separation from cg 
–	 Lift on tail 
•	 Airplane is “trimmed” when CM,cg  = 0
