General Approach to FCS Actuation System


•	 Utilize Experience From F-4 SFCS Program and F15 
–	 Force Summing Single-Stage EHSV 
–	 Failure Monitoring 

•	 Thin Wing and Vertical Tail Limit Envelope for Aileron and Rudder 
Actuators 

•	 Analysis and Simulation Indicated No Carrier Landing Problems With 
One Aileron or Rudder Inoperative

Aileron and Rudder Actuator 

Design Rationale 


•  Redundancy Requirement Fail-Operate/Fail-Safe 

•  Fail-Safe Defined as Actuator in Flutter Damper Mode 

•  Envelope and Weight Penalty Precluded Dual Piston Actuator 

•  Study Select Actuator Configuration 
–  Single Piston/Cylinder 
–  Single Electrohydraulic Servovalve (EHSV) 
–  Dual Servo Electronics 
–  Electronic Channel Force Summing in Coils of EHSV Torque Motor 
–  Dual Hydraulic Supply via Upstream Switching Valve

F/A18A Stabilator and Trailing Edge Flap  

Actuator Design Rationale

•	 Redundancy for Both Actuators is Two-Fail-Operate/Fail-Safe 
•	 Fail-Safe for T.E. Flap is Retract to Neutral 
•	 Fail-Safe for Stabilator is Switch to Mechanical Mode 
•	 Design Issue - Interface of Quad Electronics With Dual Hydraulics 
•	 Electronic Channel Force Summing in Coils of EHSV Torque Motors 
•	 Normal Dual EHSV Coils Separate to Produce 4 Independent Coils 
•	 Force Fight of EHSV Pressures Needed to Minimize Failure Transients 
•	 Servo is Driven by Two Pair of Quad Coil Single-Stage EHSVs 
•	 EHSVs Arranged as “Siamese Pairs” With One Port of Each Valve 
Connected the Servo Ram and the Other to a Differential Pressure 
Sensor for Failure Monitoring

F/A-18 Leading Edge Flap System 

Design Rationale


•	 Thin Wing Cross-Section Was the Design Driver 
•	 Wing Fold Requirement Complicated the Installation Problem 
•	 Needed Actuation Device on Inboard and Outboard Panels 
•	 Rotary Mechanical Drive Was Selected Because It Fit Inside the Wing 
(also it worked well on the YF-16) 
•	 Planetary Gear Type Transmissions Power Inboard and Outboard 
Flaps 
•	 Transmissions are Connected to Hydraulic Drive Unit With Torque 
Shafts 
•	 Mechanical Torque Shaft Coupling/Swivel Solved the Wing Fold 
Problem

F/A-18 Leading Edge Flap System 


•	
Leading Flap System Redundancy is a Fail-Operate/Fail-Safe 
•	 Fail-Safe is Defined as Locked in Last Position 
•	 A Backup Hydraulic Supply is Provided by a Upstream Switching Valve 
•	 The System Provides Individual Control of the Flaps on Each Wing 
•	 The Servos Which Control Each Flap are Dual Coil Single-Stage EHSV 
Driving a Servo Ram With Electrical Position Feedback 
•	 The Servo Ram Controls Hydraulic Flow to the Hydraulic Motor that 
Power the Flap Drive Transmissions 
•	 Asymmetry Control Units are Installed on the OUTBD Transmissions 
•	 Asymmetry Monitor Compares Hydraulic Drive Unit with Asymmetry 
Control Unit

Interfacing Systems


The Design of Interfacing Systems Must Support the Flight 
Controls  Reliability and Survivability Requirements 

•	 The Hydraulic System Has Redundancy and Separation 
–	 Reservoir Level Sensing - Separate Branches 
–	 Switching Valve Provide Backup Supplies 

•	 The Electrical System Has Redundancy and Separation 
– Bus Switching  
–	 Battery Backup

F/A-18A Lessons Learned

Design Database 


•  Limited Aerodynamics, Loads and Dynamics Database 
–  Small Scale,  Low Fidelity Wind Tunnel Models 
–  Modified YF-17 Database 
–  No Loads Pressure Instrumentation on Model 
•  Problem Areas Encountered During Flight Testing 
–  LEF Loads 
–  Wing Flexibility 
–  Aileron Flex - Rigid Ratio 
–  Effect of Tip Missiles 
–  Approach AOA 

• Database - Risk Was Known But Not Quantified 
• Risk Management Not Widely Used During This Time
