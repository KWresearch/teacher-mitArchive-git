PAUL ALFRED LAGACE 

Margaret MacVicar Faculty Fellow 
Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Engineering Systems 
Co-Director, Leaders For Manufacturing and System Design and Management 
Programs 

Dr. Lagace received his Ph.D. from MIT.  Upon joining the faculty in 1982, he 
concentrated his work in the areas of mechanics, fracture, longevity, damage 
resistance, and damage tolerance of composite materials and their structures. 
He has published widely on these topics and on general topics related to 
composite materials and their structures.  In later years, he broadened his areas 
of engagement to include overall views of engineering systems with particular 
emphasis on effects of technology 

Dr. Lagace has taught courses in the areas of mechanics of materials and 
structures with special emphasis on composite materials and their structures and 
has developed courses dealing with manufacturing with composite materials and 
advanced topics in composite materials and structures. With James Mar, he 
developed the video course series "Composite Materials".  More recently he 
developed a course on “Systems Thinking”.  He currently is co-Director of the 
Leaders for Manufacturing and System Design and Management programs -- 
both joint between the School of Engineering and the Sloan School of 
Management.. 

Dr. Lagace has received departmental and Institute awards for excellence in 
undergraduate teaching, and is a MacVicar Faculty Fellow. He is a member of 
several societies, a fellow of the AIAA, an ICCM World Fellow of 
Composites,served for six years as the president of the International Committee 
on Composite Materials, and has received various awards. He also serves as a 
consultant to industry and as a participant on various governmental committees.
