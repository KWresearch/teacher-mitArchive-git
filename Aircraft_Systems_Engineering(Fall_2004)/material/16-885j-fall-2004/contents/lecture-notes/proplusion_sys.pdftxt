Basic engine relationships


Thrust  =  (Velocity of exhaust  - velocity of aircraft) 
Mass 

Overall engine efficiency = K thermal  X  K propulsive


Overall Engine Efficiency Includes Two Processes: 
Energy Conversion and Thrust Production

K overall  =  Kthermal  X  Kpropulsive  


Thermal efficiency measures the process of converting chemical 
energy of the fuel into energy available for propulsion
