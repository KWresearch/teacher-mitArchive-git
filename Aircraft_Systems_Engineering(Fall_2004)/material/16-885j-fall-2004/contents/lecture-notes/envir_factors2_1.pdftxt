CHARACTERISTICS OF(cid:10)
NOISE AND EMISSIONS ISSUES(cid:10)

• Noise 
– Local 
– Persistence = minutes 
– Well-established metrics 
– Impacts:  annoyance, sleep disturbance, domestic 
animals?, endangered species?, health impacts? 
• Emissions 
– Local, regional, global 
– Effluents: CO2, H2O, NOx, CO, VOC’s, soot, others 
– Persistence = 1 day -1000 years 
– Drastic change in public/scientific perception and 
regulatory frameworks 
– Impacts: human health, ecosystem health

AVIATION ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS(cid:10)

• “EXTERNALITIES”(cid:10)
– A large fraction of current aviation health and welfare 
impacts are real costs to society but are not accounted 
for by the providers or users of the service 

“The government’s objectives for aviation are that…the 
polluter should pay and aviation, like other industries, 
should meet its external costs, including environmental 
costs.” 

(From UK Department of Transport, Aviation and the 
Environment, Using Economic Instruments, March 2003)

DOD ENCROACHMENT(cid:10)

•	 External factors such as urbanization, increasing 
environmental restrictions, and competition with civilian 
demands on airspace, land, seaspace, and radio frequencies 
“The overall trends are adverse because the number of external inputs is 
increasing, and the readiness impacts are growing.  Future testing and 
training needs will only further exacerbate these issues, as the speed and 
range of test articles and training scenarios increase…” (DOD Sustainable 
Ranges Outreach Plan, SROC) 

Examples: JSF basing, Oceana operations, Navy in Japan 

•	 Senior Readiness Oversight Council (SROC) action plans: 
–	 Endangered species, ordnance, frequency encroachment, the 
maritime sustainability, airspace restrictions, air quality, airborne 
noise and urban growth 

•	 House of Representatives proposal (2002): National Security 
Impact Statement with all Environmental Impact Statements

REGULATIONS: BALANCING PUBLIC GOALS(cid:10)

•  Economy and Mobility vs. National Security vs. Environment 
•  State vs. National interests and control 

•  Federal Noise Control Act + local noise restrictions 
– Commercial yes 
– Military no (Nat. Sec. Exemption, but NEPA EIS) 

•  Federal Clean Air Act + State Implementation Plans 
– Military yes (General Conformity Rule) 
– Commercial “no” (Interstate Commerce & Trade exemption) 

•  Endangered Species and Marine Mammal Protection Acts 
– Military “yes” (Nat. Sec. Exemption, but never used) 
– Commercial yes

AIRCRAFT NOISE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS(cid:10)

© 2003 Waitz 

22 

AIRCRAFT NOISE SUMMARY(cid:10)

•	 Difficult connection between human annoyance and physics 
–	 Public becoming more sensitive to aviation noise 
–	 Relatively mature regulatory history 
•	 Step changes in fleet unlikely 
Increased commercial certification stringency likely but 
•	
probably within current technological capabilities 
•	 Growing problem for the military 
•	 Local restrictions make noise a product differentiator 
–	 For GE-90 powered B-777 (-6EPNdB cumulative relative 
to other engines) twice as many t/o and landings allowed 
at Heathrow 
–	 Manufacturers willing to trade 2% fuel burn for 2 dB

EMISSIONS IMPACTS(cid:10)

•	 Local air quality (NOx, CO, UHC, PM) 
– Focus of current regulations 

•	 Regional/global atmospheric effects 

1) Stratospheric ozone depletion (time-scale=10 years) 

– Largely a concern for supersonic aircraft (NOx) 

2) Climate change (time-scale = 100-1000 years) 

– Subsonic and supersonic aircraft 
– CO2 and H2O 
– NOx through ozone production 
– Particulates (SOx and soot) through heterogeneous 
chemistry and cloud nucleation

AIRCRAFT ENGINE EXHAUST(cid:10)
•	 Composition 
–	 Reservoir and primary combustion products(cid:10)
CO2, H2O, N2, O2: O(10000-100000) ppmv(cid:10)
–	 Secondary products and pollutant emissions(cid:10)
CO, NOx, HC, soot: O(1-100) ppmv(cid:10)
–	 Trace species constituents(cid:10)
NOy, SOx, HOx: O(0.0001-0.1) ppmv(cid:10)
•	 Most constituents play some role in atmospheric processes 
–	 e.g. If 100% of SO2 in engine oxidizes to SO3 it may double 
stratospheric ozone depletion 
–	 Primary and secondary species relatively well-understood 
–	 Relative magnitudes and engine/operations effects on trace 
species poorly characterized
