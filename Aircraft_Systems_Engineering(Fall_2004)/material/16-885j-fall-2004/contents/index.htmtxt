***** Course Description *****
Aircraft are complex products comprised of many subsystems which must meet
demanding customer and operational lifecycle value requirements. This course
adopts a holistic view of the aircraft as a system, covering: basic systems
engineering; cost and weight estimation; basic aircraft performance; safety and
reliability; lifecycle topics; aircraft subsystems; risk analysis and
management; and system realization. SmallÂ student teams "retrospectively
analyze" an existing aircraft covering: key design drivers and decisions;
aircraft attributes and subsystems; andÂ operational experience. Finally, the
student teamsÂ deliverÂ oral and written versions of the case study.
