***** Course Description *****
This course runs parallel to 8.02, but assumes that students have some
knowledge of vector calculus. The class introduces Maxwell's equations, in both
differential and integral form, along with electrostatic and magnetic vector
potential, and the properties of dielectrics and magnetic materials. The class
also touches on special relativity and the properties of electromagnetic waves.
