1  Readings 

Michael  Shaw 

Readings  are  in  the  syllabus.  Please  be  sure  to  understand  why  and  how  the  laws  work, 
and  not  just  plug  and  chug  to  solve  these  problems  !  I  keep  extra  8.022-style  books  in  my 
mailbox.  Use  them  as  an  alternative  to Griﬃths  if  you  are  confused. 

2  Problems
