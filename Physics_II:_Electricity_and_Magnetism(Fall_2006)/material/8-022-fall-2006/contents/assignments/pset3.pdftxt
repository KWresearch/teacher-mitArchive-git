10.	 The  English  Channel  tunnel  consists  of  a  series  of  tunnels,  each  with  a  set  of  railroad 
tracks.  As  an  order  of  magnitude  estimate,  calculate  the  capacitance  of  an  idealized 
tunnel,  cylindrical  in  shape  with  a  monorail  which  is  also  cylindrical  and  is  coaxial 
to  the  tunnel.  Both  the  outer  and  inner  cylinders  are  conducting.  The  length  of 
· 
tunnel  is  ,  the  diameter  of monorail  is  ,  and  the  diameter  of  tunnel  is  l = 5.0  101km,
d = 5.0  101cm,  a = 1.0 × 101m 
· 

(a)  Find  the  capacitance  of  this  idealized  tunnel. 
(b)  Does  the  capacitance  increase,  decrease,  or  stay  the  same when  a  train  enters  the 
tunnel?  Brieﬂy  explain  your  reasoning.
