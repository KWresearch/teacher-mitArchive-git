Michael  Shaw 

Read up on special relativity.  Two documents are  linked to from our website.  They are both 
useful.  See  syllabus  for  additional  reading  assignments. 

2  Problems 

1.  Thought  Problems: 

(a)  We  learned  in  class  that  no  information  can  travel  faster  than  the  speed  of  light. 
Describe  something  that  does  travel  faster  than  the  speed  of  light,  and  its  ok  by 
relativity  because  it  doesn’t  carry  any  information 
(b)  A sphere  is moving at 90% the speed of  light perpendicularly to your  line of sight. 
In  your  reference  frame  what  shape  does  it  have? 
(c)  Consider  that  same  sphere.	 What  shape  does  it  look  like  to  you?  (diﬀerent  from 
the  previous  answer  because  light  takes  a  ﬁnite  time  to  reach  your  eyes  as  well) 

2.  A person standing on a train moving with speed v  (with respect to the ground) releases 
a  ball  from  rest  at  a  height  h  above  the  ﬂoor.  The  ball  falls  straight  down  and  hits 
the  ﬂoor  at  a  time  t = (2h/g)1/2 ,  where  g  is  the  gravitational  acceleration.  Sketch  the 
tra jectory  that  an  observer  at  rest  on  the  ground measures.  (Assume  that  one  side  of 
the  train  is  made  of  transparent  material.)  How  do  you  reconcile,  quantitatively,  the 
diﬀerent  tra jectories  with  the  fact  that  Newton’s  second  law,  F� = m�a,  is  supposed  to 
work  equally  well  in  both  of  these  inertial  frames. 
3.  A bullet  is ﬁred with velocity u��  in  the x�y �  plane of a moving  frame S �  and at an angle 
θ �  with  respect  to  x� .  Frame  S �  moves  with  velocity  v  with  respect  to  the  laboratory 
frame  S  along  the  x  axis.  Find  the  angle  the  velocity  vector  of  the  bullet  makes  with 
the  x  axis  of  the  laboratory  frame.  What  if  the  bullet  is  a  photon? 

4.  A circus company advertises its arrival in Cambridge, Massachusetts with big headlines 
in  local  newspapers  describing  the  ﬁrst  show  ever  that  is  plausible  to  beat  the  speed 
of  light.  The  spectacle  is  described  as  follows.  First,  they  set  up  a  long  enough  train 
that  travels  at  a  velocity  v  (v < c)  with  respect  to  the  audience.  Then,  a  number  of 
small carts are added one on  top of  the other and on  top of  the  train.  Each cart moves 
at  velocity  v  wth  respect  to  the  previous  one  and  in  the  same  direction.  The  company 
claims  to  put  as  many  carts  as  it  takes  so  that  the  speed  of  the  ﬁnal  cart  (as  seen  by 
the  audience)  on  top  of  this  pyramid  to  exceed  the  speed  of  light. 
Will  they  be  able  to  succeed?  Explain.

Find  the  speed  of  the  nth  cart.

5.  Consider  the  admittedly  unrealistic  situation  of  a man  carrying  horizontally  a  20-foot 
pole  and  wanting  it  to  get  into  a  9-foot  garage.  Our  unrealistic  man  can  run  at 
v  = 0.866c  (or  γ  = 2).  There  is  a  massive  block  on  concrete  at  the  end  of  the  garage. 
In  the  rest  frame  of  the  garage,  the  pole  is  contracted  to  10  feet  long.  This  seems 
insuﬃcient  for  the  pole  to  ﬁt  into  the  garage.  However,  the  front  of  the  pole  does 
hit  the  concrete  block  and  never  leaves  the  garage.  Use  the  fact  that  no  information-
bearing  signal  can  travel  faster  than  c  to  answer  the  question  of  whether  the  back  of 
the  pole  enters  the  garage. 

6.  Can a person, in principle, travel from Earth to the galactic center in a normal lifetime? 
Explain,  using  either  time-dilation  or  length-contraction  arguments.  What  constant 
velocity  would  be  needed  to make  the  trip  in  30  years? 

7.  A  particle  of  rest  mass	 m1  and  velocity  v1  collides  with  a  stationary  particle  of  rest 
mass  m2  and  is  absorbed  by  it.  What  is  the  velocity  and  the  rest  mass  of  the  ﬁnal 
compound  system?
