We  are  a  few  days  behind  the  syllabus.  Finish  reading  Griﬃths  Chapter  6  if  you  haven’t 
yet.  This  week,  we  will  discuss  circuits,  which  are  not  covered  well  in  Griﬃths.  See  Purcell 
for  better  readings.  Then,  we  will  begin  Griﬃths  Chapter  7.  Read  sections  7.1  and  7.2  for 
later  this  week.
