1  Short  Answer  Questions 
a.	 Find  the magnetic  ﬁeld  whose  vector  potential  is  A� = A0 (x − y) ˆz 

b.	 How  is  it possible  that an observer on a moving  train  sees clocks on  the ground  ticking 
slowly,  and  an  observer  on  the  ground  see  clocks  on  the moving  train  tick  slowly? 

c.	 Two  straight  parallel  wires  carry  currents  2I  and  I  that  run  in  opposite  directions  in 
them.  What  is  the  direction  of  the magnetic  force  on  the  ﬁrst  wire? 
d.	 Explain  the meaning  of � · J  =  ∂ ρ .  Be  sure  to  distinguish  between  local  and  global. 
∂ t 

2  Field  of  a  Wire  with  non-uniform  current 

2 zˆ, where 
Consider a long wire of radius a centered on the z axis with current density J� = J0 a
r

r  is  the  distance  from  the  z  axis. 

a.	 Determine  the direction  of  the magnetic ﬁeld  inside  and  outside  of  the wire.  No  calcu­
lation  is  required. 

b.	 What  is  the  strength  of  the magnetic  ﬁeld  inside  the  wire? 

c.	 What  is  the  strength  of  the magnetic  ﬁeld  outside  the  wire? 

d.	 What  is  the  divergence  and  curl  of  B  inside  and  outside  the  wire? 

e.	 Consider a new wire with a total current I  equal to the current in the old wire, but with 
all the current constrained to the cylindrical wall of the wire.  Without any calculation, 
ﬁnd  B  inside  and  outside  this  wire.  Do  not  worry  about  B� (r = a)

3  Particle  Moving  in  Electric  and  Magnetic  Field 

The velocity selector pictured above is taken from the Physics Junior Lab.  Junior lab students 
study  relativistic  dynamics  with  this  apparatus.  We  will  investigate  a  simpler  (and  not 
dependant  on  relativity)  version  of  the  problem. 

a.	 The  Strontium  source  at  the  bottom  releases  electrons  at  high  velocities  into  a  region 
of constant magnetic ﬁeld into the page.  The plate in the middle is intended to “select” 
some  electron  velocities.  Why  does  that  work? 

b.	 The  constant  magnetic  ﬁeld  has  magnitude  B .  If  the  gap  in  that  middle  plate  is  of 
width  ΔR,  how  large  a  spread  in  velocities  (Δv)  can  get  through  the  gap?  You  may 
leave  your  answer  in  terms  of  B ,  the  electron mass, me ,  and  the  electron  charge  q . 

c.	 At  the  top  of  the  diagram  is  a  long  straight  region  between  two  parallel  plates.  These 
plates  are  charged,  creating  an  electric  ﬁeld  between  them.  Junior  lab  students  tune 
this  electric  ﬁeld  to  cancel  the  force  of  the  magnetic  ﬁeld,  allowing  particles  to  travel 
through  with  no  forces  acting  on  them.  If  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  of  magnitude  B  into 
the  page, what  is  the  necessary  electric  ﬁeld?  Leave  your  answer  in  terms  of B , R, me 
and  q . 

d.	 Extra Credit:  Using constant currents, how could one create a uniform magnetic ﬁeld?
