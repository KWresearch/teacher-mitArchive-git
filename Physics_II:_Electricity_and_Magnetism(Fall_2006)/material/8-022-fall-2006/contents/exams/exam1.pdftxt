2  A  Parallel  Plate  Capacitor  (35  points)


Two  ﬂat,  square  metal  plates  have  sides  of  length  L,  and  thickness  s/2,  are  arranged 
parallel  to  each  other with  a  separation  of  s, where  s << l  so you may  ignore  fringing ﬁelds. 
A  charge  Q  is  moved  from  the  upper  plate  to  the  lower  plate.  Now  a  force  is  applied  to  a 
third uncharged  conducting plate of  the  same  thickness  so  that  it  lies between  the other  two 
plates  to  a  depth  x,  maintaining  the  same  spacing  s/4  between  its  surface  and  the  surfaces 
of  the  other  two. 

a.  Find  the  electric  ﬁeld  Ew  in  the  wide  region. 

b.  Find  the  electric  ﬁeld  En  in  the  narrow  region. 

c.  Find  the  surface  charge  in  the  wide  region,  σw  and  in  the  narrow  region,  σn . 

d.  What  is  the  potential  diﬀerence  between  the  upper  and  lower  plates? 

e.  Find  the  capacitance  of  the  system. 

f.  What  is  the  energy  stored  in  the  electric  ﬁeld? 

g.  What  force  (magnitude  and  direction) must  be  exerted  on  the middle  plate  to  keep  it 
from moving? 

h.  If  the  force  is  no  longer  applied,  in  which  direction  does  the middle  plate move?

3  Multiple  Choice  Question  (10  points)


4  Electrostatic  Equilibrium  (20  points) 

When  can  a  point  charge  be  in  stable  mechanical  equilibrium  in  the  electric  ﬁeld  of  other 
charges?  That  is,  is  there  some  arrangement  of  point  charges  so  that  if  we  ﬁx  all  but  one 
of  them,  the  other  one  is  in  a  stable  equilibrium?  If  so,  what  conﬁgurations  are  possible? 
Please  show  suﬃcient  reasoning  for  your  answer. 
Note  1:  A mathematical  proof  is  suﬃcient  reasoning.  So  is  a  good  proof  by  example.  So 
is  a  sound  physical  argument.  So  is  any  other  technique  that  shows  you  have  a  good  grasp 
of  the  concept  at  hand. 
Note  2:  A  stable  equilibrium  is  one  where  if  we  move  the  charge  in  any  direction,  there 
is  a  restoring  force  directed  opposite  to  the  displacement. 
Hint:  Use Gauss’s  Law.
