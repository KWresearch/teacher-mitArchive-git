1  Short  Answer  Questions  (10  points  each) 

a.	 The  pyramid  at  Giz  has  a  square  base  of  side  a  and  four  faces  which  are  equilateral 
triangles.  The  Scarab  of Ra,  buried  at  the  very  center  of  the  base  of  the  pyramid,  has 
a  net  charge  of  Q.  Do  you  know  the  net  ﬂux  of  electric  ﬁeld  emerging  from  one  of 
the  triangular  faces  of  the  pyramid?  If  it  can  be  determined,  solve  for  the  ﬂux;  if  not, 
explain  why. 
b.	 A neutral particle decays into two charged particles with charge +q and −q respectively. 
They  have  the  same  mass  m  and  ﬂy  apart  in  opposite  directions  at  speed  v0 .  The 
velocities  are  perpendicular  to  a  uniform  magnetic  ﬁeld  B� which  ﬁlls  space.  At  what 
distance d  from  the  original decay will  the particles  collide?  Ignore  any  forces between 
the  two  particles.

2  Waving  with  Maxwell  (40  points) 

Suppose  that  in  the  absence  of  any matter  and  charges,  an  electric  ﬁeld  exists  of  the  form 
E� = E0xˆ cos(kz − ωt) + E0yˆ sin(kz − ωt) 

In  the  following  you  are  asked  to  show  that  E� satisﬁes Maxwell’s  equations  provided  that  a 
certain magnetic  ﬁeld  B� (x, y , z , t)  also  exists  and  a  relation  between  k  and  ω  is  satisﬁed. 

a.	 What  is  the  appropriate  relation  between  k  and  ω? 

b.	 What  is  B� (x, y , z , t)? 

c.	 Show  directly  that  this  E� and B� satisfy Maxwell’s  equations. 

d.	 Describe  what  the  electric  and  magnetic  ﬁeld  look  like  at  the  origin  as  a  function  of 
time. 

e.	 What  is  the  energy  ﬂow?  (Hint:  be  sure  to  ﬁnd magnitude  and  direction) 

3  A  Wave  in  a  Box  (40  points) 

Consider  the  following  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  with  km  = mπ/a  and  kn  = nπ/a: 

E� = E0  sin(kmx) cos(kny)cos(kz )sin(ω t) ˆy 
B� = Bz  cos(kmx) cos(kny) cos(kz ) cos(ω t) ˆz + Bx  sin(kmx) cos(kny) sin(kz ) cos(ω t) ˆx 

a.	 Find  the  coeﬃcients  Bx  and  Bz  and  the  relation  between  ω , k , km , kn  such  that  these 
ﬁelds satisfy Maxwell’s equations in free space.  This ﬁeld can exist in a metal box with 
square  cross  section  of  dimension  x  =  y  =  a  in  the  x  and  y  directions,  and  arbitrary 
length  in  the  z  direction. 

b.	 Consider  the mode m = 1  and  n = 0.  Draw  the magnetic  ﬁeld  lines  in  the  box. 

c.	 What  are  the  boundary  conditions  satisﬁed  by  the  electric  and magnetic  ﬁelds  on  the 
walls  of  the  box? 

d.	 Apply  the  boundary  conditions  for  electric  and  magnetic  ﬁelds  on  a  conductor  to 
determine  the  surface  charge  densities  and  surface  currents  on  the  walls  of  the  box.

4  A  Moving  Capacitor  (40  points) 

Two  identical  but  oppositely  charged  conducting  plates  have  been  placed  inside  a  magnet. 
The magnet  produces  a  uniform  ﬁeld  B�
0  = B0yˆ.  The  plates,  each  of  which  has mass M  are 
constrained  to  move  sideways  in  the  ˆz -direction  (with  no  friction).  Both  plates  are  in  the 
y − z  plane  (ie:  normals  to  their  surface  are  in  the  ˆx  direction.  The  top  plate  carries  charge 
Q0  and  the  bottom  plate  carries  charge  −Q0 .  The  plates  have  length  (in  the  ˆz  direction)  l 
and  width  (in  the  ˆy  direction)  w.  They  are  separated  by  a  distance  s  such  that  s � w  and 
s � l. 

a.	 At  t = 0,  the magnet  is  turned  down  so  that B� decreases  slowly  and  uniformly  to  zero 
at  time  T .  Do  the  charged  plates  feel  a  force?  Please  explain  the  origin  of  any  such 
force. 

b.	 If  there  is  a  force  on  the  plates,  calculate  its  magnitude  and  direction.  Feel  free  to 
assume  that  the motion  of  the  plates  is  negative  (ie:  M  is  suﬃciently  large) 

c.	 Calculate  the  total momentum  acquired  by  the  two  plates  for  t > T . 

d.	 The  static  electromagnetic  ﬁelds  carry  momentum  density.  Calculate  the  momentum 
stored  by  the  electromagnetic  ﬁelds  within  this  device  for  t <  0.  Show  that  this 
momentum  is  identical  to  that  which  appears  on  the  plates. 

e.	 Now  suppose  instead  that  B� is  kept  ﬁxed  and  equal  to  B�
0  at  all  times,  but  instead 
that a resistance  is connected across the two plates at t = 0 allowing them to discharge 
completely.  Once  again,  the  plates  will  feel  a  force.  Qualitatively  explain  what  causes 
this force, but do not calculate the force on the plates explicitly.  Instead, explain clearly 
and  brieﬂy  what  the momentum  of  the  plates must  be  when  they  have  discharged.

5  The  Yukawa  Potential  (40  points) 

In  Quantum  Mechanics,  it  is  useful  to  consider  the  Yukawa  Potential,  an  approximation  to 
→ 
the Coulomb potential  that  isn’t as nasty as r 
0.  More physically,  such a potential occurs 
in  a  ﬁeld  theory mediated  by  a massive  scalar  ﬁeld–ie:  that  of  the  pion.  We  treat  a Yukawa 
approximation  to  the  electric  potential–true  if  the  photon  had  a mass m: 
Q	 e−r/r0 
r 
4π�0 

V	 = 

� 
where  r0  =  mc  is  a  constant  with  units  of  distance. 

a.	 Find  the  electric  ﬁeld  as  a  function  of  radius.  (Hint:  Either  use  proper-like  spherical 
gradients  or  convert  to  cartesian  and  do  it  all  in  the  {x, y , z}  basis) 

b.	 Find  the  charge  density  as  a  function  of  radius. 
c.	 Find  the  total charge enclosed  in a  sphere of  radius a � r0 .  Call  this Q0 .  (This  should 
be  a  simple  answer.  Then  again, many  things  should  be  simple.) 

d.	 Find  the  space  charge  enclosed  in  a  sphere  of  radius  R,  where  space  charge  =  total 
charge  - Q0 .  Explain  this  result  physically  for  R � r0 .

Consider  a magnetic monopole  with magnetic  charge  g ,  creating  a magnetic  ﬁeld 

B  = 

µ0  rˆ
g
4π r2 

a.	 Write down Maxwell’s equations, including the eﬀect of the magnetic monopole.  Clearly 
deﬁne  any  terms  you  introduce. 

Suppose  such  a  magnetic  monopole  is  located  at  the  origin.  An  electrically  charged 
particle  with  charge  e  is  located  on  the  y-axis  at  y  =  b  at  t  =  0.  The  electric  charge 
travels with  a  velocity �v = vxˆ.  Make  the  approximation  that  the  particle  is  essentially 
not  deﬂected  although  there  is  a magnetic  force  acting  on  the  charge. 
b.	 Calculate  the  magnetic  force  on  the  electrically  charged  particle  as  a  function  of  time 
� ∞  Fmag dt  on  the  electri­
t. 
c.	 Calculate  the direction and magnitude of  the  impulse Δ�p = 
−∞ 
� ∞  r�0 × F dt of the charged particle 
cally  charged  particle.

e.	 Set  the  change  in  magnitude  of  the  angular  momentum  ΔL� =  n�,  where  n  is  an 
integer,  and  �  =  h/2π  is  Planck’s  constant.  Derive  a  relation  between  the  electric 
charge  e,  the magnetic  charge  g ,  the  integer n,and  fundamental  constants  that may  or 
may  not  include  �, c, µ0 , �0 .  This  condition  is  called  the  Dirac  quantization  condition 
for  the magnetic monopole. 

d.	 Calculate the change in angular momentum ΔL� = 
about  the  origin,  as  a  result  of  this  impulse.
