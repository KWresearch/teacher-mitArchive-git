2  Short  (and  Sweet)  Answer  Questions 

Do  four  of  the  following  ﬁve  problems. 

a.  Charges  are  ﬂowing  in  the  ˆy  direction  through  a  ﬂat  plate  of  a  conductor  in  the  x-y 

plane,  in  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  in  the  ˆz  direction.  The + ˆx  side of  the conductor is measured 

to  have  a  higher  potential  than  the  −xˆ side.  What  is  the  sign  of  the  charge  carriers? 

i: positive 

ii:  negative 

iii: both 

iv:  cannot  be  determined

b.  A  cylindrical  wire  made  of  imperfect  conductor  is  connected  to  the  two  terminals  of  a 

battery  so  that  current  ﬂows  through  the  wire.  Which  of  the  following  is  true? 

i:  There  is  a  Poynting  ﬂux  in  the  wire  and  its  direction  is  parallel  to  the  current. 

ii: There is a Poynting ﬂux in the wire and its direction is radially  outward (away from 

the  central  axis  of  the  wire) 

iii:  There  is  a  Poynting  ﬂux  in  the  wire  and  its  direction  is  radially  inward. 

iv:  There  is  no  Poynting  ﬂux  in  the  wire 

c.  Which  of  the  following  is  most  responsible  for  paramagnetism? 

i: Lenz’s law 

ii:  Alignment  of  permanent  dipoles 

iii:  The  Pauli  exclusion  principle 

iv: Superconductivity 

d.  The  Maxwell  stress   tensor  of  a  uniform  electric  ﬁeld  corresponds  to  which  case?  (Hint: 

Think  of  ﬁeld  lines–don’t  stress  about  the  tensor) 

i: Isotropic pressure (same in  every  direction) 

ii: Isotropic tension (negative pressure) 

iii:  Pressure  along  the  ﬁeld  lines  and  tension  perpendicular  to  them 

iv:  Tension  along  the  ﬁeld  lines  and  pressure  perpendicular  to  them 

e.  A  circular  disk   of  radius  R  has  uniform  surface  charge  density  σ  and  rotates  like  a 

wheel  about  its  central  axis  with  angular  velocity  �ω .  The  magnetic  ﬁeld  for  r  >> R 

is  given  by  which  of  the  following  expressions?  (HINT:  Do  not  solve  by  brute  force. 

There  is  a  shortcut.)  (HINT  2:  There  are  no  magnetic  monopoles  in  the  universe.)

ii: 

iii: 

iv:

3  Problem  with  Circuits 

Consider  the  situation  where  Vout  is  an  open  circuit (no  current goes through  there). 

a.  Given  an  input  voltage  Vin  =  V0cos(ω t),  what  current  passes  through the  resistor? 

b.  What  is  the  ratio  of  the  output  voltage  amplitude  to  the  input  voltage  amplitude? 

c.  What  frequency,  ω ,  should  you  drive  the  circuit  (as  input  voltage),  to  obtain  the 

maximum  output  voltage  amplitude? 

d.  Electrical  engineers  call  such  a  circuit  a  band  pass  ﬁlter.  Why  does  this  name  make 

sense  given  your  answers  to  the  previous  questions?

4  Displacing  the  Problem 

A  capacitor C  with  circular plates  of  radius b is  charged  to a  voltage  V0 .  The  space  between 

the  two  plates  is  small  compared  to  b  so  that  we  can  safely  ignore  any  fringing  eﬀects.   At 

t  =  0  the  switch  is  closed  and  the  capacitor  discharges  through  the  resistor  R.  In  all  the 

questions  below  give  your  answers  in  terms  of  C,  b,  V0 ,  R,  t  and  any  universal  constants.  

a.  Give  an  expression  for  the  charge  Q(t) as  a  function  of  time  of  the  positively  charged 

plate (upper one in the  ﬁgure)  of  the capacitor. 

b.  Find  the  electric  ﬁeld,  E� (t),  between  the  capacitor  plates. 

c.  Find  the Maxwell displacement  current density,  J�d (t) between the two capacitor plates.  

d.  Find  the  magnetic  ﬁeld,  B� (t),  between  the  capacitor  plates.  (Hint:  Do  not  assume  it 
is  uniform) 

e.  Find  the  Poynting  vector,  S� (t),  between  the  capacitor  plates. 

f.  Extra  Credit:  Calculate  the  time  rate  of  change  of  the  energy  stored  in  the  ﬁelds 

between the plates 

g.  :  Extra  Credit:  Find  a  relation  between  your  answers  from  the  two  previous  parts.  

Comment  on  why  this  relation  exists.
