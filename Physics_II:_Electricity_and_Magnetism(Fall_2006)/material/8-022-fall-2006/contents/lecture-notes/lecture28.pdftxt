Ferromagnetic  ←−  really  hard,  non  linear  (depends  on  entire  history

Force


• Forces  on  sloping  sides  cancel  out 
• 

Forces  on  other  side  also  cancel  out  No  net  force But  there  is  a 
torque.

Diamagnetism 

Examine  using  classical model- electron  around  proton;  it moves  fast 
enough  that  we  can  consider  it  constant  current.

What ?  Magnetic ﬁeld speeds up an electron?  No, actually B generates 
a  E  that  does  the  work

So,  charge  in  magnetization  is  opposite  of  magnetic  ﬁeld.  Change  of 
velocity  is  independent  of  orbit  direction!  (works  for  both  paired  and 
unpaired  ,  but  its  so  weak  that  it’s  noticeable  only  when  no  paramag­
netization)  Diamagnetization! 
M� = magnetization  = m  per  unit  vol.
