Well  ,  it  does  blow  up  because  mirror  charges  annihilate  each  other. 
Proceed  by  separation  of  variables. 

Special  Relativity 

• 
c  is  constant 
• all  inertial  reference  frames  (a = 0 = F )  are  equivalent 

Einstein  worked  as  a  clerk  in  a  patent  oﬃce!

•  How  fast  do  you  need  to  go  for  special  relativity  to  apply?  Look  at

This  cone  of  permitted  casuality 
tells  us  that  information  can  travel 
no  faster  than  the  speed  of  light 

In  our  frame,  0  and  0  are  at  diﬀerent  times 
In  space  shuttle,  0  and  0  are  at  the  same  time
