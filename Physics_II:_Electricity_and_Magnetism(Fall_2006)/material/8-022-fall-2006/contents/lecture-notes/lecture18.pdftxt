Magnetostatics 
What  is Magnetism? 

• attraction  of  the  opposite

• 
F� on moving  charges  F� ⊥ d� of  charges


• |F� |α|v�+ | 

⇒ F�B  = q(�v × B� ) 
In  fact,  FE ,B �  = q(E� + (�v × B� ))  (Lorentz  Force  Law  ) 
H  is  to  B  as  D  is  to  E 

• Find  capacitance 
• Find  energy 
• 
force  on
Find
