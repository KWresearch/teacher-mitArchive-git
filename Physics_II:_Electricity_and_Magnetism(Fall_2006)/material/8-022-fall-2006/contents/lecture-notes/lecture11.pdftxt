Can  the  electric  ﬁeld  be  parallel  to 
a  surface  jump? 
E||,a  − E||,b  = 0 
(Electric  ﬁeld  on  both  sides must 
be  the  same)

How  do  you  get  electric  ﬁeld  discontinuities? 

#  of  lines  indicate  strength  (  ﬁeld 
lines  begin &  end  on  charges  ) 

Conductors 
Perfect  conductors:  charges move  freely  and  instantaneously

• Conductor  will  let  you  know 
that there’s a charge inside, but 
nothing  else 
• How  a  faraday  cage  works
