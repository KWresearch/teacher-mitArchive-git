Complex  impedence  instead  of  diﬀ  eq! 
Use  fact  that  everything  in  RLC  circuit  has  same  frequency  as  driving 
frequency(?).

= χef f ective 

zef f  = Ref f  + iχef f 

First  term  decays,  second  term  oscillates. 

Power  Dissipation 

R  does  this!  (LC  circuit  just  oscillates,  even  w/o  driver  no  loss  of 
power).

LC

for  ω 2  <  LC  ,  there’s  a	 real  part  =  resistance!  But  from  only 
L  =  C ?  It’s  because  its  inﬁnite!  Energy  keeps  traveling  out  for 
certain  ω  ! 

Critical  Frequency  - if  you  are  under,  energy  will  just  keep  going 
oout.  Otherwise,  will  go  out  and  come  back.
