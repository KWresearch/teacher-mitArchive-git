First  Uniqueness  Theorem 

Given  V  on  boundary  S  of  volume  V  ,  Laplace’s  equation  gives  a 
unique  solution  for  V  in  V . (  V  does  not  need  to  be  ﬁnite  ) 

. 

0 = �2V2 
�2V1  = 
V1  − V2 
V3  = 
So �2V3  = 0,  and  V3  = 0  on  boundary 
Also  no  local min/max  ,  so  V3  = 0  in  V. 
Thus  V1  = V2 

Second  Uniqueness  Theorem 

3 

In  a  volume  surrounded  by  conductors,  the  total  charge  on  each 
conductor  determines  the  E-ﬁeld  uniquely. 
Will  charges  spread  out  ? 
Yes! 
Thus  case  below 

no  charges  - (total  on  each)  stable

solution


Still  no  charge  on  each  conductor,

so  by  Second Uniqueness Theorem,

same  solution  as  above
