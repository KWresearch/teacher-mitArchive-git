F� =  q(E� + �v × B� )  (Lorentz  Force  Law) 

Magnetostatics 

• Simplest  nontrivial  case:

A  particle  w/  charge  q  in  B� = B0zˆ


B� = q�v × B� = m�a = 

d�p 
dt 
Fz  = 0  since B� is in  ˆz  direction,  so vz  = constant particle moves  in 
xy-plane,  cross  product,  implies  cosines  and  sines,  circle 
• Static  ﬁeld  (doesn’t  change  overtime)  is  not  necessarily  constant 
(doesn’t  change  over  space  )

add  in  some  v2  = 0 

What  is  useful?  In  cyclotrons! 

⎧
⎨ω =  ω(v)

Can make  particles  go  fast! 
When  speeds  get  relativistic,  ω  no  longer  constant. 
Synchotron ⎩β  =  β (t)  (increase  B  to  keep  R  smaller) 
(Nonlinear  particle  accelerators  all  us  this  - curving  particles  to  ac­
celerate  with  them  - essentially  synchotron)  CERN  - Large  Hadron 
Collider 

• Can’t  do  this  with  uncharged  particles­

(Neutron  not  found  until  1930’s,  1940’s  - very  late  )

B� = B0zˆ and  E� = E0yˆ
