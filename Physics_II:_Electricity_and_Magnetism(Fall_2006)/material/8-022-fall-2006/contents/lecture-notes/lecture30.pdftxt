Long  copper  wire  of  radius  R,

uniform  current  I

Find:


1. Direction  of  bound  currents

2. H� inside 
3. H� outside 

What’s  a  bound  current?  One  way:  electrons  in  materials  moving 
Current  that  cannot  escape;  property  of material.

Jˆ B  is  down  because  little  circles  of 
current  cancel  out  inside  to  go 
down,  on  surface  k� B  goes  up

Ferromagnetism


• based  on  history 
• aligns  with  itself 
• rare  - requires  special  electronic  structure 
• 

nonlinear 

- Ferromagnetic  domains  align  to  external  ﬁelds

We  know  this  creates  an H� ,  which 
is  related  to M�
