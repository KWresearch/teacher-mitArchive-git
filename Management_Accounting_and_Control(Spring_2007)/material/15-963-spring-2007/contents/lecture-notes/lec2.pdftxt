Long run vs. short run cost behavior 
 
  Relevant range 
  Cost assignment: 
Direct vs. Indirect 
  Direct costs can be traced to cost object in 
a non-arbitrary and cost-effective manner. 
Indirect costs are also called overhead. 
These are non-traceable costs.

	 Consumer Focus is a marketing research firm that organizes focus
groups for consumer-product companies. 

	 Each focus group has eight individuals who are paid $50 per session to
provide comments on new products. 

	 These focus groups meet in hotels and are led by a trained, independent,
marketing specialist hired by Consumer Focus. 

	 Each specialist is paid a fixed retainer to conduct a minimum number of
sessions and a per session fee of $2,000. 

	 A Consumer Focus staff member attends each session to ensure that all the 
logistical aspects run smoothly.

  Direct or indirect costs with respect to each individual focus group. 

  Variable or fixed costs with respect to how the total costs of Consumer
Focus change as the number of focus groups conducted changes. 

  (If in doubt, select on the basis of whether the total costs will change 
substantially if there is a large change in the number of groups conducted.)

  Takeaways: 
  In classifying costs as direct or indirect, 
keep cost object in mind; 
  Immaterial (small) costs can be classified 
as indirect; 
  One rule of thumb for classification: ask 
who should pay (e.g., overtime premium, 
machine downtime)?

Cost Concepts 

  Contribution margin (CM) = total revenue – total variable cost 
  Contribution margin per unit (UCM) 
  Gross margin (GM) = total revenues (TR) – cost of goods sold 
(COGS) 
  Manufacturing costs are direct materials, direct labor and 
manufacturing overhead. 
  Marketing, selling and administrative costs are not
manufacturing costs.  These are operating costs. 
  Operating income (OI) = GM – operating costs = CM – fixed 
costs (FC) 
  Breakeven quantity or revenue is units sold, or revenues 
earned, such that OI = 0 = (UCM*q) – FC 
  q=FC/UCM

	 Foreman’s gross margin per unit is $5 ($1,000,000
/ 200,000 units). 

	 Sam Hogan, Foreman’s president, believes that if
production and sales had been 230,000 units, the
company would have covered the $1,150,000 of
marketing and distribution costs ($1,150,000 / $5
= 230,000) and enabled Foreman to break even for
the year.

	 Calculate Foreman’s operating income if production and sales equal 
230,000 units. 

	 Selling Price = $2,600,000 / 200,000 = $13 

  Contribution Margin per Unit =

= Selling Price – Variable Cost

= $13 - $5.50 - $4.00

= $3.50


  Operating Income =

= UCM x quantity – Fixed Costs

= $3.50 x 230,000 - $500,000 - $350,000

= -$45,000

Gross Margin and

Contribution Margin


  Why is Sam Hogan wrong? 
  He has interpreted gross margin as if it were all variable 
– in fact, GM per unit will increase to $5.33 (from $5) 
  He has interpreted marketing and distribution costs as
all fixed – in fact, total variable marketing costs will 
rise to $920k (from $800k) 
  Both the manufacturing costs and the marketing and
distribution costs contain fixed and variable 

components.

Gross Margin and 

Contribution Margin


  Takeaways from this example: 
  decompose costs into variable and fixed to 
conduct analysis – CM approach better 
than GM income statement; 
  Unit costs are misleading (because of FC 
and relevant range) – use total costs, not 
unit costs, in analysis.

units of A, 80,000 units of B and 100,000 units of

  Breakeven point increases because the new mix 
contains less of the higher contribution margin per unit 
product B and more of the lower contribution margin 
per unit product C.

C.

	 The Marketing Department indicates that decreasing the selling price 
to $99 would increase sales to 50,000 units.

	 Calculate the maximum increase in fixed marketing and distribution 
costs that will allow Tocchet to reduce the selling price to $99 and 
maintain its operating income. 

	 Let the fixed marketing and distribution costs be F.  We then calculate F 
when operating income is $600,000 and the selling price is $99. 

	

($99 x 50,000) – ($55 x 50,000) – F 
$4,950,000 – $2,750,000 – F 
$4,950,000 – $2,750,000 – $600,000 
$1,600,000 

= $600,000

= $600,000

= F

= F


	 Hence, the maximum increase in fixed marketing and distribution costs that 
will allow Tocchet to reduce the selling price and maintain $600,000 in 
operating income is $200,000 (= $1,600,000 – $1,400,000).
