15.963 Managerial Accounting and Control

  What is the external environment that 
Colorscope currently faces? 
  Cheaper technology is lowering entry barriers. 
  Better technology is eroding quality-based 
competitive advantage. 
Intense competition from 
small stand-alones, 
 
large national chains, and 
backward (vertical) integration by large printers.

 

Intense price pressures, and erosion of rents (high 
margins). 
  What has Colorscope’s competitive advantage 
been, and why? 
  Reputation for quality - poor quality is extremely 
costly because 
pre-press is the last stage at which an error can be detected,  
 
  mistakes in advertised price can be expensive for content 
provider to honor, and 
  merchandisers take great pride in their catalogs.

Fast turnaround – this is very valuable to the content 
provider because it gives them more time to decide, 
for example, how much to discount which items (i.e., 
it gives them more time to observe their competitors 
actions in a fluid environment). 
  Actual costing differs from normal costing in 
that overhead allocation rate = actual overhead / 
actual volume of base. 
  This is ex post allocation rate – if actual overhead 
will not be known till year-end, then cost can only be 
determined then.

For Colorscope, we have actual, as opposed to budgeted data, so this 
is an illustration of actual costing. 
How many overhead cost pools are appropriate for Colorscope? 
The five departments – prep, scanning, assembly, output, QC.  
These are the major stages in the production process, and hours are not
clocked in these departments in fixed proportions (Ex.9). 
How do we determine the amount of overhead in each overhead 
pool? 
In the California Bikes example, we were given the amount of overhead
in each cost pool (machining and finishing), and the only task was to
assign the overhead from the cost pools to the jobs. 
In this case, we have to first allocate overhead to the cost pools (the
five depts), and then allocate overhead from the pools to the jobs. 
This is called a two-stage allocation system.

  Let us begin with the first stage allocation. 
  Wages are already tracked by dept (Ex. 11) 
  Why is labor overhead here? 
  Equipment depreciation is also tracked by dept. 
  Rent has to be allocated to the depts. 
  Using floor space as the allocation base makes sense 
“other” overhead has to be allocated to the depts. 
  We could use labor hours as the allocation base, since this is 
available.

Second Stage Allocation


	 In the second stage, we allocate from the 
overhead cost pools to each job. 

  Using labor hours seems reasonable.

  Equipment depreciation is another possibility,  

since it is similar to machine hours. 
  Which is a better choice? 
  Cost of labor far exceeds depreciation, so labor hours will 
be a more important cost driver of overhead in this case. 
	 We have to calculate allocation rates for each 
dept.

  Now we can calculate job profitability. 
  This is just revenues - total costs = revenues – direct costs – 
allocated overhead. 
  Examine job profitability whale curve. 
  What is the cost of rework? 
  What should Colorscope do about the cost/quality 
tradeoff? 
  Price customer initiated reworks. 
  Restructure production sequence: prep -> scanning -> QC 
-> assembly -> output -> QC
