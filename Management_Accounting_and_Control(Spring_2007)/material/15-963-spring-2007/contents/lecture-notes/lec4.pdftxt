Decision Making –

Insource or Outsource 


	 Another common decision is whether to make parts in-
house or to outsource. 

  Oxford Engineering manufactures small engines. 
  The engines are sold to manufacturers who install them in such 
products as lawn mowers. 
  The company currently manufactures all the parts used in these 
engines but is considering a proposal from an external supplier 
who wishes to supply the starter assemblies used in these engines. 
  The starter assemblies are currently manufactured in Division 3 of 
Oxford Engineering.

Decision Making –

Insource or Outsource 

	 The costs relating to the starter assemblies for the past 12
months were as follows: 

  Direct materials 
  Direct manufacturing labor 
  Manufacturing overhead 
  Total 

$200,000

$150,000

$400,000

$750,000


  Over the past year, Division 3 manufactured 150,000
starter assemblies. 
  The average cost for each starter assembly is $5 (= $750,000 / 
150,000).

  Further analysis of manufacturing overhead
revealed the following information. 
  Of the total manufacturing overhead, only 25% is
considered variable. 
  Of the fixed portion, $150,000 is an allocation of
general overhead that will remain unchanged for the
company as a whole if production of the starter
assemblies is discontinued. 
  A further $100,000 of the fixed overhead is avoidable if
production of the starter assemblies is discontinued. 
  The balance of the current fixed overhead, $50,000, is
the division manager’s salary.

Decision Making –

  If production of the starter assemblies is discontinued, the 
manager of Division 3 will be transferred to Division 2 at 
the same salary. 
  This move will allow the company to save the $40,000 salary that 
would otherwise be paid to attract an outsider to this position.

  Direct Manufacturing Labor 
  Variable Manufacturing Overhead  $100,000

Decision Making –

Insource or Outsource 

	 Tidnish Electronics, a reliable supplier, has 
offered to supply starter-assembly units at $4 per
unit. 
	 Because this price is less than the current average
cost of $5 per unit, the vice president of
manufacturing is eager to accept this offer. 
	 However, the general manager points out that this
price is much higher than the variable cost per unit
of $3 with insourcing, so she recommends against
buying from Tidnish. 
	 Who is correct?

Decision Making –

Insource or Outsource 

  On the basis of financial considerations alone, 
  If production is expected to be less than 140,000 units,
it is preferable to buy units from Tidnish. 
  If production is expected to exceed 140,000 units, it is
preferable to manufacture internally (make) the units. 
  If production is expected to be 140,000 units, Oxford
should be indifferent between buying units from
Tidnish and manufacturing (making) the units 
internally.

Decision Making –

Insource or Outsource 


  How, if at all, would the answer change if the 
company could use the vacated plant space for 
storage and, in so doing, avoid $50,000 of outside 
storage charges currently incurred? 
  The information on the avoidable storage cost is 
relevant.  It is an opportunity cost if insourcing is 
chosen. 
  The indifference point is now X=190k units 
  $240k + 3x = $50k + 4x

  The justification provided by the V.P. of 
manufacturing is wrong because 
  she implicitly considered all fixed costs 
avoidable. 
  The justification provided by the G.M. is 
wrong because

Decision Making –

  Takeaways from this example: 
  Since some fixed costs are avoidable with 
outsourcing, this is a long run decision. 
  For long run decisions, fixed costs are relevant. 
  The decision rule for long run decisions is to 
maximize total profits (as opposed to CM). 
  Fixed costs make more sense when production 
volume is expected to be high.

Strategic Considerations in 

Outsourcing


  Managing the cost structure, e.g., Porsche 
  Where, in the value chain, are the rents? 
  E.g., Nike, Sulzer 
  Transaction costs and holdup problems? 
  E.g., GM and Fisher Body 
  Transaction costs are high when the transaction involves 
durability, asset specificity, uncertainty and high frequency. 
  Under these circumstances, activity is internalized. 
  Agency and governance costs, congestion costs. 
  These are costs of insourcing, and have to be balanced 
against the benefits.

Relevant Costs under Uncertainty


  When uncertainty is involved, cash flows that do not 
differ between alternatives may be relevant because of: 
Risk effects 
Suppose you have a preference function for money of U 
= ln(X).

Relevant Costs under Uncertainty


  Risk effect: 
	 You are offered two alternatives - a sure payoff of 
$5k, or a lottery of $10k (state 1) or -$1k (state 2)
with equal probability. 
Is your income from other sources, that does not
differ between the alternatives, relevant? 
Suppose your income from other sources will be
$15k, regardless of whether you choose the sure
payoff or the lottery. 
In this case, you prefer the sure payoff of $5k 
ln(20k) = 9.903 
 
0.5*ln(25k) + 0.5*ln(14k)= 9.837

	

Suppose your income from other sources will be
$10k in state 1 and $20k in state 2, regardless of
whether you choose the sure payoff or the lottery. 
  The values you assign your alternatives now are: 
0.5*ln(15k) + 0.5*ln(25k) = 9.871 
 
0.5*ln(20k) + 0.5*ln(19k) = 9.879 
 
	 Now you prefer the lottery. 
This happens because it smoothes out your total
	
income, and reduces the risk you are exposed to. 
Cash flows that did not vary between the two choices
changed your decision, and so were relevant.  This is 
the risk effect.

  Takeaways from this example: 
  When choosing between alternatives 
where cash flows are uncertain, 
incremental analysis is not appropriate. 
  You have to consider the risk of the 
alternatives.

Decision Making –

Product Mix under Constraints


	 Multi-product firms are commonly faced with optimal
product mix decisions. 
	 St. Lawrence Boat Yard produces a line of small
recreational boats. 
	 Production is machine intensive, and each boat 
passes through a series of machines operated by
skilled personnel. 
	 Variable costs are direct materials (DM), variable
machining, variable manufacturing overhead (VOH)
and sales commissions. 
	 Fixed costs are $9m, and annual capacity is 60k
machine hours.

	 Variable machining costs are $200 per 
hour, and VOH is $50 per machine 
hour. 
	 Commission costs are 5% per boat and 
cruiser, and 10% per canoe.

  St. Lawrence should satisfy the demand for Cruisers 
1 and 2, Boat 2 and the Canoe. 
  The remaining machine hours, 1200, should be used 
to produce 480 units of Boat 1. 
	 Suppose they can lease additional machining capacity 
as needed.  What is the maximum they can pay per 
machine hour of leased capacity? 
	 What is the UCM per machine hour of Boat 1 before variable 
machining costs (which become avoidable)? 
  ($870 + $500)/2.5 = $1370/2.5 = $548 
  This is the maximum St. Lawrence should pay per hour of leased 
capacity.

Product Mix under Constraints


  Takeaways from this example: 
  Decisions involving capacity constraints are usually 
short run decisions, because the constraint can be 
relaxed in the long run. 
  The decision rule therefore involves maximizing 
the contribution margin, modified to 
  Maximize CM per unit of the constrained resource. 
  This is a version of the short run decision rule we saw 
earlier.

Managing Constraints


  Bottleneck operations are a typical production
constraint, possibly due to factor lumpiness and cost. 
  Such constraints can also arise in other settings 
  e.g., the internet, where remote caching and mirroring help 
manage bottlenecks. 
  In retail, where linear feet of display space is a constraint. 
  To manage bottlenecks, 
improve the quality of parts passing through the bottleneck– 
 
  Cost of defective parts going through bottleneck is not just 
wasted material, but lost CM. 
  Reduce idle time and setup time at the bottleneck 
  Keep the bottleneck busy, and let it dictate the production 
schedule.

  relevant costs under uncertainty; 
  decision rule in the presence of 
constraints;

  managing constraints.
