  Agency problems arise in all organizations. 
  For-profits, not-for-profits, government agencies…. 
  They are due to asymmetries in payoffs, information, 
liability and horizon. 
  They can occur between owners (e.g., shareholders) and 
managers, 
  because of the separation of the decision making and risk bearing 
functions. 
i.e., managers make decisions, but don’t fully bear the 
consequences.  The residual risk is borne by the residual claimants 
– the shareholders.

  Examples of agency problems between shareholders and managers 
include: 
  Managers will attempt to consume expensive perks, such as corporate jets, 
club memberships, parties, etc. 
  E.g., suppose the manager’s compensation is 0.1% of net income.  Further 
suppose that the perks reduce net income by $1000.  The reduction in the 
managers compensation is $1, but she consumes $1000 of perks. 
  Managers are myopic – they are averse to taking on positive NPV projects 
with large negative cash flows early in the life of the project. 
	 On the other hand, they may take on negative NPV projects with large 
positive cash flows early in the life of the project, if they are retiring or 
otherwise leaving soon – this is the horizon problem. 
	 The horizon problem is exacerbated by ex-post settling-up costs.

  Agency problems can occur between employees and supervisors, e.g., 
  Employees have a moral hazard problem, or an incentive to shirk work. 
  This is especially problematic when outcomes are very uncertain, i.e., 
when the mapping between effort and outcome is weak over short time 
intervals. 
Is a good outcome due to effort or chance (a rising tide)?  What about a 
poor outcome? 
  The employee likely has more information than the supervisor, and is able 
to game the circumstances. 
  Another type of agency problem is the adverse selection problem. 
  This can occur between employers and potential employees, or between 
current and potential shareholders.

  Problems also occur within teams in the organization. 
  A free rider problem occurs when one member of the group shirks. 
  All of these problems are more likely in large decentralized
organizations, where decision rights are dispersed. 
	 Allocating decision rights is one aspect of the
organization’s architecture.  Who should have what 
decision rights? 
Ideally, decision rights should rest where the knowledge 
resides, for

informed decision making,

 
timeliness, and 

 
  employee motivation.

  However, agency problems may make it optimal to detach 
decision rights from knowledge, and to have some 
knowledge flow to where decision rights reside. 
  E.g., a department may have better knowledge of its costs for next 
year, than the home office.  However, the home office, not the 
individual department, will set the budget for that department. 
  Or a salesperson may have better knowledge of a customer’s 
demand curve for a differentiated product, but allowing the 
salesperson to negotiate prices may induce the salesperson to 
divert some resources.

  If the costs of coupling decision rights with knowledge are 
high, then decoupling may be optimal if: 
the knowledge is not specialized, or is easily transmitted from 
 
where it resides to where decision rights reside; 
if the environment is stable and decision timeliness is not critical; 
 
  E.g., fighter pilots in wartime vs. peacetime, paramedics. 
  How decision rights are allocated will depend on the 
relative importance of decision making vs. control. 
  This will depend on the particular firm, its circumstances, and its 
internal and external environments.

  One way to control agency problems is by separating 
decision management from decision control. 
  Decision management consists of initiation and 
implementation. 
  Decision control consist of ratification and monitoring. 
  E.g., hiring a new employee, or launching a new marketing effort. 
  When this separation fails, the costs to the firm can be 
dramatic.  E.g.,

  Nick Leeson at Barings Bank,

  Yasuo Hamanaka at Sumitomo

  This is an indication of the magnitude of agency costs.

  How does accounting help control agency problems?

  Accounting numbers are used to align incentives.

  They are used to specify benchmarks used in performance evaluation 

and compensation. 
  E.g., managers are paid a base salary, plus bonus from a bonus pool.
The size of the pool depends on accounting earnings. 
  The pool has a lower bound, below which no funds are available for
distribution as bonus, 
  and also an upper bound beyond which the pool does not grow. 
  The upper bound 
reduces costs associated with severe horizon problems, and 
 
  prevents managers from being rewarded for extreme good fortune rather
than effort.

  While paying managers based on firm performance achieves greater
incentive alignment, it also imposes some risk on the manager. 
  The manager, being risk averse, will receive a higher compensation to 
take on this risk.  This higher compensation is an agency cost 
  Also, notice that managers and shareholders incentives are still not 
fully aligned. 
  E.g., managers now have incentives to be myopic (forego positive NPV 
projects with large early cash outflows); 
  They have incentives to take a “big bath” if earnings are below the bogey, 
  And to undertake income-reducing activities if earnings are above the cap. 
  To increase alignment, managers are also given stock options, which 
reduces myopia. 
  The managerial labor market, and the market for corporate control, 
further serve to reduce agency problems. 
  However, labor markets are also subject to the adverse selection problem.

	 The implication is that agency problems can only be attenuated, not 
eliminated. 
	 Agency problems also arise in a variety of other settings. 
	 For example, in contracts of oil and gas limited partnerships. 
	 General partner provides technical expertise in drilling, while limited 
partners provide most of the capital. There is uncertainty regarding the 
size of oil and gas reserves. 
	 Once a well is drilled, the general partner acquires private information 
about the size of the reserves, say R. 
	 The well needs to be completed to realize R.  For tax reasons, the 
general partner has the pay the completion costs, C. 
	 The contract specifies that the general partner receives a certain 
percentage of R, say 20%.  The remainder goes to the limited partners.

	 From the general partner’s perspective, it pays to incur 
completion costs only if 0.2R > C.  Otherwise, she does 
not complete the well, and the limited partners payoff is 0. 
	 This is an agency problem between general and limited 
partners.  If the problem is severe, general partners will not 
be able to raise any money. 
	 This problem can be mitigated through reputation-building 
by the general partner, and also through pre-commitment 
(placing completion costs in escrow).

  A number of agency problems also arise in debt contracts, for 
example: 
  excessive dividend distributions.  Accounting numbers are used in this 
case to delimit the pool of funds available for distribution; 
  asset substitution, or playing the lottery with borrowed money. 
  E.g., Fred Smith of Fedex went to Vegas when prospects were poor at one 
point in the 70’s. 
  In this case, lenders may secure their loan, and may impose tight covenants in 
order to transfer decision rights in a timely manner. 
  underinvestment, which is similar to the non-completion problem in the 
oil and gas example.  In this case, it may not be possible to raise much 
debt, as with growth firms. 
	 claim dilution, or borrowing more money from subsequent lenders.  In this 
case, lenders may provide shorter maturity loans.

  Accounting numbers are extensively used in debt 
covenants to control a variety of agency problems. 
  Another way to control agency problems in organizations 
is through accounting control systems, such as

  responsibility centers,

  standard costing,

  budgeting,

transfer pricing, etc.

 
	 We will look at some of these systems over the next few 
weeks.

	 Responsibility accounting assigns decision rights to sub-
units within the organization, based on the knowledge 
residing in the sub-unit. 
	 A cost center is responsible for managing costs only, not 
for revenues, profits or investments.  The cost center 
manager is evaluated based on, for example, minimizing 
costs for a fixed level of output. 
	 A profit center may consist of several cost centers.  In 
addition to costs, profit center managers are responsible for 
deciding the product mix, and selling prices and quantities.

	 An investment center may consist of several profit centers.  
Its manager has decision rights for capital investment 
decisions, in addition to the decision rights of profit center 
managers. 
  Investment center managers may be evaluated based on: 
  Net Income (NI). 
  However, this creates an incentive to over-invest.  Taking on low or 
negative NPV projects with large future cash outflows will increase 
NI today. 
  Return on Investment (ROI).  This control the overinvestment 
problem, but creates other problems. 
  The manager may forego positive NPV projects (return > cost of 
capital) that dilute high ROI.

  Residual income or Economic value Added (EVA) could be used.  We will study 
these next week. 
  The controllability principle suggests that managers should be evaluated only 
for decisions within their control (i.e., over which they have decision rights). 
  This seems sensible, 
  but also leads to some problems. 
  For example, a particular adverse outcome may be a chance occurrence, and 
the manager should not be penalized for its consequences (or costs). 
  E.g., if there is a storm that causes a large loss this year, the managers bonus should 
not be penalized for this particular loss. 
  However, managers may then avoid costs ex ante (insurance?) that may minimize 
losses ex post. 
  Another example is evaluating managers on after-tax / before-tax profits.  If the 
latter, then there is no incentive to minimize taxes.

	 Another problem in applying the controllability principle is that it 
seems to go against the notion of Relative Performance Evaluation 
(RPE). 
	 Benchmarking against the performance of peers may penalize 
managers for the (uncontrollable) good performance of peers. 
	 So is RPE justified? 
	 Yes, from an information perspective.  Adjusting for peer group 
performance extracts the common effects (rising tide?) and “cleans up” 
the performance measure such as earnings (increases the signal-to-
noise ratio). 
	 The purpose of including uncontrollable factors is to remove their 
effects.

  However, RPE is not commonly observed in executive 
compensation contracts, possibly because of:

  difficulty in specifying the peer group;

  political costs in rewarding managers for good relative 

performance in bad times; 
  manager’s incentive to choose avoid risk and choose safer rather 
than more profitable projects.

  Takeaways: 
  Agency problems are pervasive in all organizations. 
  These problems can not be eliminated. 
  Accounting numbers and accounting systems can be used to 
control these problems, thereby raising firm value.
