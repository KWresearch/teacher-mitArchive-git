Product Costing


  Cost of any cost object = direct costs + allocated
indirect costs. 
  Indirect costs are also called overhead, or common 
costs. 
  There is an arbitrarinessintroduced by the allocation
(or assignment) of common costs. 
  A product costing system is essentially an overhead
allocation system. 
  Costs are allocated to 
  products, 
  customers, and 
  departments within (or subunits of) the firm.

Product Costing 

  Reasons for allocating common costs: 
long run pricing and decision making; 
 
insource / outsource? 
 
  add an airline route? 
  motivation and control 
  e.g., product designers at Hitachi 
  preventing overconsumption; 
  cost-plus contracts; 
  financial reporting and tax purposes 
inventory values have to be calculated at full cost; 
 
  for damage claims from insurance providers; 
  might be used in rate regulation (e.g., natural gas); 
  needed in calculating claims during litigation.

Product Costing


  Manufacturing overhead (MOH) includes 
  machine setup costs, 
  wages of forklift operator, 
  plant supervisor salaries, 
  manufacturing equipment depreciation, etc. 
  Non-manufacturing overhead (NMOH) includes indirect 
  marketing costs, 
  non-manufacturing administrative costs. 
  The costs allocated to a product will depend on the reason for 
the allocation: 
  under GAAP, only MOH is allocated in calculating inventory costs; 
  U.S. govt. cost-plus contracts explicitly exclude marketing 
overhead; 
  All overhead may be allocated for decision making (including 
pricing) and control.

Calculating Manufacturing 

Costs 


  There are two basic costing systems: job costing and 
process costing. 
  A job is a distinct product or service: 
in the service sector - audit and consulting engagements, ad 
 
campaigns, legal cases; 
in merchandising – individual mail orders at L.L. Bean; 
in manufacturing – ship and aircraft manufacture, e.g., for 
Joint Strike Fighter project. 
  Process costing is used for masses of 
indistinguishable products or services, e.g.: 
  Oil refining, chemical processing, beverage production.

Job Costing 


  Cost allocation begins with collecting all overhead in one (or 
more) cost pool(s). 
  All costs in this pool are then assigned to the job at a rate of, 
for example, $40 per direct labor hour (DLH) used on the job. 
  DLH is called the cost allocation base. 
  $40 / DLH is the allocation rate. 
	 For example, if Job 83 uses $15k of direct materials, and 200
DLH at $20 per hour, then the total manufacturing cost of Job 
83 is: 
  direct materials of $15k +

  direct labor of 200x20 = $4k + 

  allocated or applied MOH of 200x40 = $8k

  For a total of $27k

Cost Allocation


  Examples of allocation rates and bases: 
  200% of direct labor dollars; 
  This may be preferred over DLH if employee skill levels, and therefore 
cost, differ significantly. 
  $30 per machine hour; 
  e.g., if product is machine, rather than labor, intensive. 
  $10 per order; 
  e.g., costs of order taking and processing, if orders are homogeneous. 
  How is the allocation rate calculated? 
  Under normal costing, this is calculated at the beginning of some
period, by dividing budgeted overhead by the budgeted volume 
of the allocation base. 
  Applied overhead = budgeted rate x actual volume of 
allocation base.

Cost Allocation Example


	 California Bikes (CB) uses a job costing 
system at its Venice Beach plant. 
	 The plant has a machining department and a 
finishing department. 
	 Each department is an overhead cost pool. 
	 Machining department overhead is allocated 
based on machine hours, while finishing 
department overhead is allocated based on 
direct labor dollars.

Cost Allocation Example


	 The budgeted overhead rate in the machining dept is 10m/200k = $50 
per machine hour. 
	 The budgeted overhead rate in the finishing dept is 8m/4m = 200% of 
direct labor dollars. 
  The cost record for Job 431 in May is: 
Machining 
14000

Cost Allocation Example 

  Total overhead allocated to Job 431 is: 
  machining - $50 x 130 = $6500 + 
  finishing – 200% of $1250 = $2500 
  total = $9000 
  Direct material cost for Job 431 is: 
  $14k in machining + $3k in finishing = $17k 
  Direct labor cost for Job 431 is: 
  $600 in machining + $1250 in finishing = $1850 
  Total manufacturing cost of Job 431 is: 
  9000 + 17000 + 1850 = $27,850

Cost Allocation Example


  This example: 
  illustrates the mechanics of cost allocation 
and calculation; 
  illustrates the use of multiple overhead 
cost pools.

Cost Allocation Example


  Continuing with the previous example, suppose CB has only one 
overhead cost pool, and allocates based on direct labor dollars. 
  What is the new overhead allocation rate? 
  Total MOH / Total DL$ = $18m/4.9m = 367% of direct labor 
dollars. 
  How much overhead is allocated to Job 431 now? 
  367% of $1250 = $6796 
this is $2204 less than previously allocated, so the cost of Job 431
 
is now over $2000 lower! 
  This example illustrates that: 
  Overhead cost pools should be homogeneous – this will determine 
the number of cost pools; 
  There should be a strong cause and effect relation between the
costs in a given pool and the allocation base for that pool.

Cost Allocation 

	 Returning to the previous example, suppose CB prepares a 
budget monthly.  The budget for May (prepared in April) is as 
follows: 

MOH ($) 
Direct labor ($) 
Direct labor hours 
Machine hours 

Machining 
833333 
240000 
8000 
50000 

Finishing 
666667 
1200000 
48000 
9000 

15.963 [Spring 2007]

Job Costing 

  The new allocation rates are: 
  machining dept – 833333/50k = $16.67 per machine hour 
finishing dept – 666667/1.2m = 56% of direct labor dollars. 
 
  The overhead allocated to Job 431 would now be: 
  machining – 16.67 x 130 = $2167 + 
finishing – 56% of $1250 = $694 
 
total of $2861! 
 
	 The cost of Job 431 is now $6139 lower than previously
calculated. 
	 This occurs because MOH consumption is smooth across
months, but productive activity is substantially higher in May 
(both labor costs and machine hours are disproportionately
higher in May) due to seasonality in, e.g., demand.

Job Costing 


  Smooth overhead consumption, when activity varies, 
suggests that it is mainly fixed overhead. 
  We could also have allowed MOH to vary 
disproportionately in this case, e.g., 
  air conditioning costs may be higher in summer months, 
heating costs higher in winter, employee vacation pay will 
be higher in summer months, etc. 
  Takeaway: overhead rates should be calculated using 
longer period (e.g., annual) budgets, to reduce 
arbitrariness. 
  Identical jobs performed in different months should not 
differ in cost due to erratic costs or seasonal effects.

Manufacturing Cost Flows


	 There are three inventory accounts through which 
manufacturing costs flow. 
  The first is direct materials (DM) inventory: 
  materials purchases increase it; 
  materials requisitioned for manufacturing decrease it. 
  The second is work in process (WIP) inventory: 
  outflows from DM increase WIP; direct labor costs from time 
cards increase it; applied overhead (based on direct labor or 
machine hours, for example) increases it; 
it is reduced by the cost of finished or completed goods, 
since these are no longer a work in process. 

 

15.963 [Spring 2007]

Manufacturing Cost Flows


  The third is finished goods (FG) inventory: 
  outflows from WIP increase it; 
  it is decreased by the cost of goods sold (COGS). 
  Finally, the COGS account (not an inventory 

account) is increased by outflows from FG.

  The ending balance of an inventory account  

is: beginning balance + inflows – outflows.

Job Costing 


  Returning to CB example, applied overhead = 
budgeted rate x actual volume of base. 
  Overhead rate is $50 / mach hr in machining, based on 
$200k budgeted machine hours. 
  Assume machining is the only overhead cost pool.  If exactly 
200k machine hours are actually used in 2007, then applied 
overhead = 200k x 50 = $10m = budgeted (or actual) 
overhead. 
  If 210k machine hours are actually used, then applied 
overhead = $10.5m > actual overhead cost. 
  In this case, $500k is over-applied overhead.  We could 
similarly have under-applied overhead (if actual base usage 
is less than budgeted base usage).

Job Costing 


  Over- or under-applied overhead requires an end-of-year 
adjustment. 
  Typically, it is “written off” to COGS. 
In this case where $500k is over-applied, COGS is reduced by 
 
this amount. 
  If it were under-applied, COGS would be increased by the amount.
