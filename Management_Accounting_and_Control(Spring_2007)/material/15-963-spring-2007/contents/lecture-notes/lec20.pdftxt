Firms use standards as benchmarks, or expectations, for 
input prices and quantities, among other things. 
Standards are used in decision making, e.g., in 
budgeting, setting transfer prices, and product costing 
and pricing. 
Standards are also used for control, e.g., to set employee 
performance benchmarks. 
Standards are prevalent, especially in manufacturing 
firms where over 75% of firms use them in most 
countries.

  How are standards determined? 
Bottom-up methods: time and motion engineering 
studies; surveying managers and other employees; 
industry benchmarks. 
Top-down methods: e.g., target costing at IKEA and 
Nissan. 
The beginning of the value chain is guided by the standards, 
which are subsequently ‘built-in’ to the product.

Deviations from expected (or standard) results are called 
variances. 
Variances are examined for control: examine reasons for 
the variances, and take corrective action. 
Variances can also be used for decision making: if the 
system cannot be brought under control, should it be 
abandoned or redesigned (e.g., drop product line or 
redesign product?). 
Clearly, it is important to identify why variances have 
occurred in order to take the right corrective action and 
to affix responsibility.

Let us examine the different types of variances, 
and consider some reasons why they occur. 
Start with a budget, which contains forecasted 
prices and quantities of outputs and inputs.  The 
top line (revenue) uses the forecasted output 
volume.  This is called a static budget, and is 
prepared at the beginning of the budget period.

Zimmerman 12 – 1 (Rust Belt) 

	 At the end of the period, actual results are
observed.  The difference between actual 
operating income and the static budget operating
income is called the static budget variance.  We 
would like to understand the reasons for this 
variance. 
First, remove the effects of volume by preparing 
a flexible budget at the end of the period. 
In our example, the static budget variance is ­
$185k.

	 A portion of this, the sales volume variance of  ­
$120k (flexible budget – static budget operating
income), is due purely to lower selling volume
than expected. 
Examine why the lower volume occurred and
who was responsible. 
The flexible budget variance is the difference 
between the actual and flexible budget operating
incomes.  If this were zero, the entire deviation
from the static budget would be explained by
lower volume.

In our example, the flexible budget variance is ­
$65k. 
The flexible budget variance is the sum of (or is
due to) the selling-price variance and input price
and quantity variances. 
The selling price variance in our example is the
difference between actual and flexible budget
revenues = -$50k. 
This leaves input price and quantity variances to
explain the remaining $15k variance.

Let us return to the Rust Belt case. 
Since no specific quantity figures are provided 
for installations, the total materials variance 
cannot be decomposed into its price and quantity 
components. 
Total materials variance equals the actual price 
paid for the materials used in installations minus 
the standard cost per installation times the 
number of installations performed.

Total variance for chosen input is the sum of the price 
and quantity variances. 
Input price variance is (actual price-standard 
price)*actual quantity. 
Input quantity variance is (actual quantity-standard 
quantity)*standard price. 
  Material variances are called price and usage variances, 
while labor variances are called wage and efficiency 
variances. 
Favorable and unfavorable variances are denoted as F 
and U, respectively.

How would you interpret the materials variances above? 
The State manager is spending much less on materials 
relative to both the standards and the other Buffalo 
shops. 
Since the standard costing system was implemented to 
encourage cost containment, State's favorable variance 
seems encouraging.

However, since the Dewey and Mt. Hope variances tend 
to confirm that the standards are accurate or even 
somewhat low, an actual cost figure in the State Street 
store that is 18.3% [159,500 ÷ (60 × 14,500)] below 
standard should arouse some suspicion. 
Dewey's unfavorable variance is only 0.8% [$11,125 ÷ 
($60 × $22,250)] above standard and probably 
negligible.

At 10 percent [$69,000 ÷ ($60 × $11,500)] over 
standard, there should be some concern over Mt. Hope's 
commitment to meeting cost containment objectives with 
regard to materials purchases. 
The interpretation of the total direct labor variance yields 
conclusions similar to those drawn from the materials 
variances.

State has spent suspiciously little on direct labor, Dewey 
is roughly in line with standards and Mt.  Hope is again 
the big spender. 
State is spending less than the standard per direct labor 
hour and using far fewer hours of direct labor per 
installation than expected by the standard.

Zimmerman 12 – 1 (Rust Belt) 

	 Mt. Hope has both an unfavorable price variance and an 
unfavorable quantity variance; in comparison with the 
established standards, it is spending too much per hour 
of direct labor and using too many hours of direct labor 
per installation.

	 Dewey pays direct labor 1.7% [($12.00 - $11.80) ÷ 
$11.80] above the standard rate. 
	 Dewey's direct labor quantity varies favorably from 
standard by 5% [(21,138 - 22,250) × 22,250], a 
number that, when considered within the context of 
Dewey's other variances, should probably be viewed 
as good cost containment rather than an indicator of 
trouble.

State has been able to produce for an incredibly low cost, 
Dewey has been at or near the established standards, and 
Mt. Hope has continued to be a big spender.

	 What would you do about the variances at Dewey? 
These variances look ‘small’ and are likely due to 
chance. 
Attempting to correct the variances might lead to over­
correction, so nothing should be done at the moment. 
The warranty information suggests that the system 
provides some distorted incentives to managers.

The Buffalo data indicate that there is a correlation 
between spending and quality of work. 
Care must be taken to interpret variances.  What 
questions can we ask when variances are observed? 
First, are the standards appropriate?  Conditional on 
appropriate standards:

	

	 Why is the materials price variance favorable? 
Perhaps materials have been purchased in bulk to take 
advantage of price discounts, but then this increases the 
firm’s storage costs. 
One way to mitigate this problem is to charge storage 
costs to manager responsible for purchasing materials. 
Perhaps low quality materials have been purchased.

them). 
Purchasing agents need better training.

Perhaps less of the material is being used

Important control features in standard costing systems 
include: 
The materials price variance is isolated at purchase and 
recorded in a separate account.  Materials inventory is 
debited at (actual quantity x standard cost per unit). 
This serves two purposes: (i) it makes the variance 
salient in a timely fashion, and (ii) it insulates 
downstream users (production) from this variance which 
they lack control over.

The materials quantity variance is isolated and recorded 
in a separate account at the time materials are 
requisitioned by production.  Work-in-process inventory 
(WIP) is debited at standard price per material unit x 
standard quantity per output unit x actual number of 
output units. 
Similarly, labor price and quantity variances are isolated 
and recorded in a separate account when labor is used. 
WIP is debited at standard wage x standard hours per 
output unit x actual number of output units.
