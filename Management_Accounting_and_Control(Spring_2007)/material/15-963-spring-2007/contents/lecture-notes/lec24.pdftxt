15.963 Managerial Accounting and Control


Spring 2007


Prof. Mozaffar Khan 

MIT Sloan School of Management 

Wrap-up


•	 Management accounting provides information for a 
firm’s internal users.  The information can be 
customized to meet the user’s needs. 
•	 This information is used for decision making and 
control. 
•	 Control is necessary because of agency problems, 
whereby the self-interests of individual employees 
diverge from the interests of the firm. 
•	 Control becomes more important in larger, more 
decentralized firms.

Wrap-up 


•	 Decentralized organizations have to partition decision 
rights. 
•	 If agency problems were non-existent, decision rights
would be based on the locus of knowledge: 
–	 where the knowledge resides in the organization would entirely 
determine how decision rights are partitioned. 
–	 This would increase the quality and timeliness of decision 
making. 
•	 For control, however, it may be necessary to detach
knowledge and decision rights. 
•  A choice with regard to this matter will depend on the

relative importance of decision making vs. control.

Wrap-up


•	 This choice will depend on the context: the user, the 
time, the internal environment and the external or 
competitive environment. 
•	 Once decision rights have been partitioned, it becomes 
important to evaluate performance (for control). 
•	 Performance measures should be determined by 
desired behavior, which in turn should be determined 
by the firm’s goal. 
•	 Rewards motivate performance.  Do not reward “A 
while hoping for B” (Kerr, case packet).

Wrap-up


•	 Good controls will mitigate, but never eliminate, 
agency problems. 
•	 Controls are costly.  Ensure that their benefits 
outweigh their costs. 
•	 Different performance measurement systems will 
distort behaviors under different circumstances.  No 
system is perfect.  Remember the cost/benefit tradeoff. 
•	 If subjective information is solicited for decision 
making, and the provider suspects that it may 
potentially be used for control, this information will not 
be unbiased.  Beware.

Wrap-up


•	 This problem is pervasive.  It arises during budgeting, 
when determining standards, and in myriad other 
circumstances. 
•	 The controllability principle suggests that a valid 
performance measure is one that is sensitive to the 
employee’s effort / actions. 
•	 Non-insulating performance measurement and reward 
mechanisms introduce uncontrollability, but are useful 
for risk sharing and mutual monitoring.

Wrap-up 


•	 Cost behavior can be variable, fixed or some 
combination thereof. 
•	 Cost assignment is either direct or indirect. 
•	 The fundamental problem in costing is assignment (or
allocation) of indirect or common costs. 
•	 A costing system describes how indirect costs are 
allocated. 
•	 Since refining costing systems is costly, there is some
residual and inescapable arbitrariness in product
costing.  Beware when using allocated costs in decision 
making and control.

Wrap-up 


•	 ALL costs are variable in the long run.  Therefore, 
fully-allocated costs should be used for long-run 
decisions. 
•	 Fixed costs are unavoidable in the short run.  For 
short-run decisions such as accepting / rejecting one-
time special orders, only variable costs should be 
considered. 
•	 The contribution margin is the difference between 
selling price and variable costs.  Contribution margin 
analysis is appropriate for short run decisions.

Wrap-up 


•  Operating leverage is the sensitivity of the bottom line  

(operating income) to changes in the top line (sales).

•	 Firms with high fixed costs and low unit variable costs 
have high operating leverage. 
•	 Firms with high fixed cost structures are more 
vulnerable during economic downturns. 
•	 Firms with high fixed cost structures can also be more 
aggressive in short run price wars.

Wrap-up 


•	 If fixed indirect costs are allocated based on volume 
measures that vary with market conditions, changes in
the reported unit product cost are not necessarily
indicators of changes in efficiency.  Beware of unit 
product costs. 
•	 Be aware of the cost of excess capacity that is
discretionary or avoidable.  Non-discretionary excess
capacity is: 
inherent in the production process; 
–	
–	 required by a customer; or 
–	 optimal in the sense of minimizing total cost (tradeoff between 
fixed and variable costs).

Wrap-up 


•	 Beware of the death spiral, and other costing problems,
when excess capacity is charged to products. 
•	 A cost is sunk if it is irrecoverable at a given point
regardless of the decision made at that point. 
–	 Sunk costs are irrelevant, except for the guy who sunk them. 
i.e., sunk costs are irrelevant for decision making, but not for 
–	
control. 
•	 Despite some arbitrariness in indirect cost allocation, it 
is required for a variety of purposes. 
•	 Activity-based costing systems are more refined but
more costly.

•	 A more refined costing system, such as ABC, is
likely to be of value: 
–  When overhead costs are a large proportion of total 
costs; 
–  When multiple products are produced, and they
place asymmetric demand on resources, e.g., when
there are 
•  commodity and specialized products, or 
•  Low volume and high volume products; 
–	 When competitive and profit pressures are intense; 
–  When the product market is mature, with low

prospects for innovation or differentiation;

Wrap-up


•	

•	 The theory of constraints (TOC) suggests that, in the presence of 
binding constraints (bottlenecks), it is optimal to maximize 
throughput per unit of the constrained resource. 
•	 TOC is a short run decision rule, since all constraints can be
relaxed in the long run. 
In decentralized organizations, transfer prices between business
units can promote 
–	 goal congruence, 
–	 mutual monitoring, and 
–	 proper resource allocation (i.e., mitigate under- or over
-
consumption).  

•	 Transfer prices also help preserve subunit autonomy, are useful in 
measuring subunit performance, and are important for tax
purposes in international settings.

•	 A budget is a formal and quantitative expression of
future plans. 
•	 Budgets are important for transferring knowledge both
horizontally and vertically throughout the firm. 
•	 Since this knowledge is used to coordinate plans for the
future, the budget forms an internal contract or
commitment. 
•	 To induce commitment to the plans, budgets are also
used for performance evaluation at the end of the
period. 
•	 This in turn induces a bias in the transferred 
knowledge that forms the basis of the budget.

Wrap-up


•	 When deviations from budgets, or variances, are used 
for control, it becomes important to understand the 
reasons for the variances. 
•  Variance analysis decomposes the static budget 

variance into progressively finer components.

•	 The controllability principle suggests that it is 
important to insulate downstream units from variances 
occurring upstream.  This is one control feature of 
standard costing systems. 
•	 Isolating and separately recording variances as soon as 
they occur facilitates timely control.

•  The balanced scorecard broadens the managerial  

perspective and links specific actions to goals.

•	 However, the balanced scorecard can be confusing / 
distracting if it does not specify the tradeoffs between 
the various performance measures. 
•	 Not specifying the tradeoffs between the multiple 
measures could also lead to value-consuming, instead of 
value-adding, behavior.
