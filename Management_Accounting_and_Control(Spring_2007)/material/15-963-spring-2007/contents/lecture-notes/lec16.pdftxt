15.963 Managerial Accounting and Control


Spring 2007


Prof. Mozaffar Khan 

MIT Sloan School of Management 

Vyaderm

  Three companies, A, B and C have net income of $100m, $120m and 
$80m, respectively. 
  Rank them on performance. 
  What is the benchmark? 
  Problem is differences in size or invested capital. 
  Now suppose they have Return on Investment (ROI) of 8%, 6% and 
10% respectively. 
  Now rank them on performance. 
  Again, this is difficult.  We do not know how risky these firms are. 
  Risk will determine the required return. 
  We have to compare the ROI with the required return for each firm – 
suppose it is 4%, 8% and 10%, respectively. 
  Now we can say that A (B) [C] performed better than (worse than) [as] 
expected. 

Vyaderm


  To maximize firm value, the firm must earn more than its 
cost of capital. 
  The third performance metric is in %, but captures the 
spirit of two important (and essentially similar) metrics: 
  Residual income, and 
  Economic Value Added (EVA). 
  These differ only in certain details. 
  EVA is, broadly speaking, = Income – (Expected income) 
= Income – (Cost of Capital*Invested Capital). 
  This is a dollar amount, not percentage, so larger firms will 
generally have higher EVA. 

Vyaderm


  Why did Vedrine introduce  EVA? 
  Prior CEO focused on earnings per share, without regard to 
invested capital. 
  Prior system also had a large subjective component. 
  How will EVA help? 
  Forces balance sheet accountability. 
  Will help identify, and therefore manage, EVA drivers, and 
thereby increase firm value. 

Vyaderm


  What are the features of the EVA system at Vyaderm? 
  EVA centers 
  EVA drivers 
  EVA incentive program, i.e., compensation tied directly to EVA. 
	 The first two features use EVA to measure business unit performance. 
The third uses EVA to measure managers’ performance. Should these 
be linked? 
  Consider EVA centers, and the definition of EVA.

  How do you determine the cost of capital for, e.g., the Dermatology 

division?

  The division does not issue its own debt.

It does not have its own separately traded equity.

 
  Does this introduce subjectivity and distrust?


Vyaderm

  How do you the determine the investment base for the dermatology
division?

  Can we construct a balance sheet for separate divisions?

  Are there shared resources?

  This will be very difficult and subjective.

  So, determining divisional EVA is problematic. 
  Vedrine would like to establish a single, global EVA center.  Is this a 
good idea? 
  The company as a whole has a clearly defined balance sheet, and cost of 
capital may be easier to estimate. 
  The main problem with this is that it weakens the link between an
individual manager’s effort (say, manager in Singapore) and her
compensation. 
  This will foster mistrust, and will reduce employee motivation. 
  This weaker link will also promote free-riding and therefore decrease
efficiency. 

Vyaderm


	 This may be one reason to use EVA for measuring 
business performance but not compensation. 
	 Let’s consider the accounting adjustments to “Income” or 
“Net Operating Income After Taxes” (NOPAT), at 
Vyaderm. 
  In calculating ‘Economic’ Value Added, we need 
‘Economic’ income. 
i.e., accounting income has to be adjusted to better approximate 
 
economic income. 
  Accounting income has to conform to GAAP, which tends 
to be conservative.  For example……. 

Vyaderm


  R&D is expensed, not capitalized, under GAAP. 
  For R&D to qualify as an asset, and therefore be capitalized, the 
timing and extent of future benefits would have to be verifiable. 
  GAAP takes the position that this is not the case, and therefore 
does not allow R&D capitalization. 
  However, an economic asset does not have to satisfy the 
verifiability (of timing and extent) criteria of GAAP.  
  It simply needs to have some value in expectation, to be considered an 
economic asset. 
  The expected value (or full value in this case) of R&D is 
considered an economic asset and therefore capitalized for EVA 
calculation. 

Vyaderm 

  However, this asset also has a finite life, and should therefore be 
amortized over this period. 
  Vyaderm amortizes R&D over five years, straight line. 
  The same logic applies to marketing expenses. 
  Since these will yield benefits over a shorter period, they are amortized by
Vyaderm over three years, straight line. 
  Goodwill from an acquisition is the excess of purchase price over the 
fair market value of the separable net assets. 
  This is a measure of such things as reputation, client base and other
intangible assets. 
  This capitalized by Vyaderm for EVA purposes, and not amortized. 
	 These are by no means all the adjustments.  Consultants offer a litany
of adjustments (the idea of diminishing marginal benefits probably 
applies). 

Vyaderm


  How does the bonus calculation work?

  There is a bonus bank, or a stock of funds from which a bonus can be 

distributed.  This bank has to be calculated first. 
  Second, a formula determines the bonus paid out from this bank. 
  The formula is based on improvements over the prior year. 
Improvement is the value added. 
 
  This motivates continuous growth, but ratchets might introduce other 
behavioral distortions. 
  In good years, some sales may be deferred at year-end. 
It is not as good after a windfall year and better after a poor year. 
It does not penalize good managers who take over poorly performing 
divisions.

Note:  	

The EVA interval is the shortfall from target that eliminates the bonus. 
An EVA center’s performance (%) = 1 + [actual improvement – improvement goal) / EVA interval]. 

Vyaderm 
  What is the role of the EVA interval? 
It allows risk taking, by allowing positive additions to the bonus bank 
 
even for shortfalls from target. 
  Allowing managers to take calculated risks, or preventing them from 
being overly risk averse, is important. 
  The shorter the interval, the greater the risk imposed on managers, and the 
more risk-averse they might generally be when the bank balance is 
positive. 
  On the other hand, they might also engage in excessive risk taking when 
the balance is hopelessly negative. 
It acts as a lever for bonus payments. 
  The bonus payment per dollar of improvement beyond the bottom of the 
interval is (target bonus / interval). 
  The shorter the interval, the higher the payment per dollar of EVA 
improvement, and the greater the risk imposed on managers. 
  This is the risk/reward tradeoff. 

 

Vyaderm


 

  What is the role of the bonus bank? 
It smoothes intertemporal fluctuations in managers’ income, and therefore 
reduces the risk imposed on them. 
In expectation, this will reduce the firm’s compensation costs. 
 
  Let us calculate the 2000 EVA for the Dermatology Division. 
  The divisional cost of capital is given as 11% in exhibit 8. 
  We need the economic NOPAT, and the economic capital base. 
  For economic NOPAT, start with the adjustments, e.g., R&D. 
  For each year, on the income statement: 
  add this back to income before taxes, and  

  subtract the amortization charge for this and past years.


Vyaderm


  For each year, on the balance sheet, 
  add R&D, and 
  subtract the amortization expense for this and previous years.

  The projections for 2001 and 2002 are based on assumed 
growth rates of: 
  18% for net income before tax (as between 1995 and 1999); 
  17% for R&D (as between 1995 and 1999); 
  10% for advertising (as between 1995 and 1999); 
  18% for net operating assets (as between 1995 and 1999). 
  Why is the projected EVA negative for 2001 and 2002? 
  The growth rate of (capitalized) R&D expense is over 30% per 
year, outstripping the income growth rate. 

Manager’s Bonus Calculation


	 The target bonus is salary x fixed rate = 200k x 60% = 
$120k 
	 Addition to bonus bank = 120k x (1+(unexpected EVA 
improvement) / interval)) 
	 = 120k x (1+ (28440/12000) = $382,897 
	 Opening balance of bonus bank in 2000 = $0. 
	 2000 bonus payout = $120k + half of remaining balance = 
120k + 131,449 = $251,449

  Why is the bonus payout so low immediately after 2000? 
  Because the bonus formula is based on improvements over the 
prior year.

  It is hard to improve over a windfall year.

  It will take a few years to build the bank back up.

	 Consider spillover effects of this bonus scheme.  If the 
company wishes to hire new managers in 2001 or 2002, 
will it be successful? 
  Should it make exceptions to the formula for new hires in these 
years? 
  Will this affect the credibility of the system, or foster resentment 
from existing employees? 

Vyaderm


  Another feature of the bonus system is that, for individual 
managers, the bonus bank is portable within the company. 
  Rotating managers between divisions for development 
purposes is a an important HR tool at companies. 
  How will this system affect rotation? 
  Those being rotated out of Dermatology will generally be better off 
than those staying another couple of years. 
  Who would want to rotate in to Dermatology in 2001? 
  What should Vyaderm do? 

Vyaderm 

  The essential problem is that excessive risk is being 
imposed on managers. 
  The bonus payout is very volatile. 
  Manager’s compensation will therefore be higher on average, 
which is more costly for the firm. 
  Risk is controlled through the interval in the bonus 
formula. 
  Widening the interval will reduce risk. 
  It will reduce the bonus payout this year (reward will be 
commensurate with risk). 
  The advantage is that it will also penalize the bank less in 2001, 
per dollar of unexpected EVA improvement. 

Vyaderm 

  Other takeaways: 
  EVA is better at measuring business performance than managerial 
performance. 
  Consider delinking the two roles of EVA at Vyaderm. 
  Managerial performance may be better measured through key EVA 
drivers within the manager’s control. 
If the link between managerial effort (or performance) and the 
performance measure is weak, a host of problems arise, including: 
  demotivation; 
  free-riding; 
  difficulty in recruitment and retention; 
  possibly excessive risk and therefore compensation cost, etc. 
  Consider using multiple performance measures, e.g., Citibank case 
next week.
