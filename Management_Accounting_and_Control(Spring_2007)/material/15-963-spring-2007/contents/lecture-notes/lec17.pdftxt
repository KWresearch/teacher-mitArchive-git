  Return on Investment (ROI) is commonly used for 
divisional performance evaluation 
  and implicitly compared to cost of capital, so that the EVA concept 
is implictly used. 
  To prevent underinvestment, the formula can be modified. 
  E.g., Mars (the candy company) uses replacement value, rather than 
book value, of invested capital in the denominator. 
  At Vyaderm, there was one metric used to evaluate 
performance and determine the bonus – EVA. 
  Companies (e.g., Citibank) often use multiple metrics, both 
financial and non-financial. 

Citibank 
  These metrics are used to capture: 
  Financial performance, 
  customer satisfaction, 
internal business processes, and 
 
learning and growth. 
 
  Some advantages of this performance scorecard include: 
  redistributing managerial attention toward broader value drivers; 
  balancing long-term and short-term orientations; 
  communicating value drivers and thereby increasing goal 
alignment; 
  e.g., having EVA as the sole performance measure does not tell
employees how to achieve high EVA (or what its drivers are). 
  and mapping a path for implementing strategy. 

Citibank 


  What is Citibank’s competitive strategy in California? 
  They are niche players here.  They have a relationship banking / 
high service strategy. 
  Frits wants employees to have a broader view and long-term focus, 
hence the performance scorecard. 
  What problems do you see with the performance 
scorecard? 
  Will managers over-invest in the easiest, rather than most value-
adding, goals? 
  Could some measures (e.g., learning and growth) become value-
consuming rather than value-adding? 
  Can multiple goals be distracting? 

Citibank 


 

 

  Does the performance scorecard specify the  tradeoffs between the 
different goals? 
  Can you maximize on more than one dimension without knowing the 
tradeoffs? 
i.e., what is the aggregation rule for the scores on different dimensions? 
In the end, we need a single score to judge performance, and will use an 
implicit aggregation rule in the absence of an explicit one.

  So it may be better to have an explicit one.

  What do you think of the customer satisfaction measure? 
Is it a leading indicator of future financial performance? 
 
  Should uncontrollable aspects of service, such as ATM’s and 24 hour 
phone banking be included in the survey? 
  Are 25 surveys representative of the customer population for the branch? 

Citibank 


  How is McGaran’s branch different from others in L.A.? 
  It has a diverse customer base. 
  It is in the financial district, and so has many demanding 
customers. 
  Competitors are less than a block away. 
  It is not in a residential area, so it likely has a higher-churn 
customer base. 

Citibank 


  What is an important agency problem in this setting 
(geographically dispersed branches)? 
  The free-rider problem. 
  A given branch can free-ride on the brand reputation by lowering 
(service or product) quality. 
  The branch receives the full benefit from the cost-of-quality 
savings, and bears only a fraction of the cost. 
  This free-rider problem is accentuated by the managerial horizon 
problem. 
  The manager can skimp on quality and save costs, get promoted in a 
couple of years, and pass the cost of reduced quality on to the next 
manager. 

Citibank 


  The free-rider problem is more of an issue when the cost of 
reduced quality is revealed more slowly. 
  How does this relate to the customer base of the branch? 
  If the customer base is low-churn, i.e., lots of repeat customers, 
then cost of reducing quality is very high for the branch. 
  E.g., if the branch is in a residential area.  Customers are lost and 
word of mouth spreads. 
  Effect of low quality shows up quickly in revenues. 
  If customer base is transient, i.e., lots of one-time customers, cost 
of reducing quality is very low for the branch. 
  Effect of low quality is unlikely to show for a few years or several 
years (depending on composition of customer base). 

Citibank 


  Do you think this is a problem at McGaran’s branch?  
Why? 
  Likely.  Profits exceed plan by about 19%.  
  Of course, the target may have been too low, but this is usually not 
the case.  Area manager thinks target is aggressive (Exhibit 2). 
  Perhaps not.  Revenues have grown, and there is growth in all 
business segments. 
  But again, if the business is generally growing, and if customer base 
is highly transient, will the effect of poor quality show up in 
revenues? 

Citibank 


 

  Why does the area manager appear to underweight the poor customer 
satisfaction scores? 
  Perhaps customers are rating support services, such as ATM’s, that are not 
controllable at the branch level. 
  However, this should be the case at every branch then. 
Is the answer in her performance measurement scheme? 
  Most likely, though the case provides no evidence on this. 
If McGaran’s scheme does not specify the tradeoffs between the 
dimensions, is it likely that hers does? 
  She has 31 branches, which will help dampen the effect of poor customer 
satisfaction stores at one branch. 
  To align goals, there must be congruence along the reporting chain. 

 

Citibank 


  What is the effect of a discrete performance scale (below-, at- or 
above- par)? 
Increasing the rigidity of the system induces behavioral distortions. 
 
  A manager may manage numbers to reach a higher category, 
  or abandon the goal altogether if the higher category is unreachable in a 
given year. 
  Manager’s may be forced to break rules, which undermines those rules. 
E.g., 
  why did Johnson give McGaran a “par” rating on customer satisfaction in two 
quarters? 
  Why is Frits faced with a dilemma whereby he might have to break the rule for 
giving an “above par” rating? 
  There is a loss of information – comparisons across managers and over 
time are coarse. 

Citibank 


  Reinforcing this problem is a discrete bonus payoff scheme – 0, 15%, 30%. 
  This can be seen as imposing high risk, and it will provide further incentive for 
behavioral distortions. 
  Does the scorecard help balance long term and short term incentives, as
intended? 
  The way to do this is to reward a long term orientation. 
  Would a bonus bank, as at Vyaderm, be useful? 
  This could be used to smooth bonus payments.  If beating plan by a wide margin 
does not pay off as much today, it might reduce divergent behavior. 
  Customer satisfaction scores could be used to determine contributions to the bonus 
bank. 
  Poor customer satisfaction scores in a single quarter will not affect the bonus 
payout from the bank as much. 
If gains from customer satisfaction will show up in a few years, manager is assured 
that these gains eventually will show up as bonus payments.  McGaran can tradeoff 
some profit today, for much higher returns from customer satisfaction in a couple 
of years. 
  Make the bonus bank portable, to control the horizon problem. 

 

Citibank 


	 What would you do with McGaran now? 
	 One solution is to override the system and give him an overall above-
par, but then to limit his bonus to 20% (instead of 30%). 
	 As an aside, what does McGaran’s “willingness to work weekends, 
holidays and during his vacation to ensure customer satisfaction, 
operational control and financial growth” tell you about him as a 
manager? 
	 A manager should be able to effectively delegate, and should be able 
to build a system (well-developed employees and procedures, etc.) to 
preclude the need for this. 
In emergencies however, his willingness is admirable.

Citibank 


  How effective is McGaran’s performance scorecard? 
  Customer service is vital to Citibank California’s strategy, but the 
scorecard is not communicating this. 
  The scorecard is not aligning goals along the reporting chain. 
  It does not provide long-term incentives. 
  How would you redesign the performance measurement 
system? 
  Specify the weights for the different performance dimensions. 
  Have a continuous performance scale and bonus payoff scheme. 
  Ensure goal congruence along the reporting chain. 
  Introduce a bonus bank to limit large single-period gains from 
well-above-plan profitability and to provide long term incentives.
