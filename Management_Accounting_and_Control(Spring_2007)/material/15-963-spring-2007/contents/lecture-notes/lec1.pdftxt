Financial and Management 

Accounting: Basic Features


	 Some key differences between financial and management 
accounting are as follows: 

  Audience 
  Financial – External (and Internal): Stockholders, creditors, tax 
authorities…. 
  Management – Internal: managers 

	 Purpose 
  Financial – valuation and stewardship assessment. 
  Management – to make decisions, communicate strategy, evaluate 
performance, control/align behavior.

Financial and Management 

Accounting: Basic Features


	 Some key differences between financial and management accounting
are as follows: 

  Timeliness 
  Financial –historical or ex post; at regular intervals; relatively long reporting 
periods 
  Management – Current, and future oriented, but also historical for control; 
reporting periods depend on need 

  Regulation 
  Financial – regulated; rules driven by generally accepted accounting principles 
and government authorities 
  Management – no regulations; systems and information determined by 
management to meet strategic and operational needs; not required by law

Accounting: Basic Features


	 Some key differences between financial and management 
accounting are as follows: 

	 Type of Information 
  Financial – financial measurements only 
  Management – financial plus operational and physical measurements 
on processes, technologies, suppliers, customers, and competitors 

	 Qualitative Characteristics of Information 
  Financial – auditable, reliable 
  Management – not subject to audit, could be more subjective

Accounting: Basic Features


	 Some key differences between financial and management 
accounting are as follows: 

  Scope 
  Financial – highly aggregated; report on entire organization 
  Management – not aggregated; informs local decisions and actions 

  Behavioral distortions 
  Financial – primarily reports economic events but also influences 
behavior because, e.g., manager’s compensation is often based on
reported financial results 
  Management –could distort the behavior of managers and other
employees, because of link to performance evaluation and reward 
system

Managerial Accounting


  Managerial accounting is broad. 
  It straddles competitive strategy, organizational 
economics, finance, operations management and 
organizational behavior. 
  It also provides useful knowledge for all organizational 
settings: 
  for-profits, 
  non-profits, 
  government agencies, 
  etc.

Managerial Accounting

  Here are some topics we will cover. 
  As they will illustrate, the demand for managerial accounting info 
stems from its use in: 

  Decision Making and Planning 

  Cost Management 

  Strategic Cost Management 

  Management Control

Decision Making and Planning

  Managers make decisions, and therefore need information.
Some common decisions we will study are: 
  suppose your company makes medical probes. 
  In July, you receive a call from a company that is not a regular 
customer. 
  They would like to purchase 5000 probes this month only, and
the price they offer is below your production cost. 
  Should you  accept this one-time special order, and under what
circumstances? 
  What information do you need to make this decision? 
  suppose each probe costs $10 to produce, and 70% of this cost is due 
to one part, a fibre optic wire, that you also manufacture. 
  Should you continue to make this costly part, or should you buy it from 
an outside vendor, and under what circumstances? 
  What information do you need?

Decision Making and Planning


	 Managers make decisions, and therefore need
information. 
Some common decisions we will study are: 
  suppose you manufacture five other types of medical devices. 
  Should you add another product line, or drop a line, and under
what circumstances? 
  What information do you need? 
	 suppose you are planning for the upcoming year, and you need
to determine how many units to sell to breakeven, or to make a 
target profit figure. 
	 What information do you need?

Decision Making and Planning


  In public policy debates, an example of a decision might
be: 
  palliative care or not for cancer patients – what is the cost; 
  what is the objective, to minimize cost or something else?

Cost Management


	 We used cost estimates to make the decisions 
illustrated above. 
	 But how are these costs determined or measured. 
  Understanding cost measurement helps us manage costs. 
  Managing cost is especially important today because of: 
  global competition, that requires better knowledge of costs. 
  Some companies choose a low cost leadership strategy. 
  Measuring and managing costs is the lynchpin of this 
strategy; 

15.963 [Spring 2007]

Cost Management


  global competition also requires focus on quality. 
  Improved quality can result from process improvements 
made during the course of identifying cost drivers, since 
streamlined process generally improves quality; 
  It can also come from reduction of waste, which comes 
from better measurement of waste; 

  some companies choose a product differentiation strategy, which 
requires analysis of costs from customers viewpoint. 
  What features are worthwhile to customers? 
  This requires looking at cost from customers’ viewpoint, 
and eliminating costs that are not valued;

Cost Management


  Managing cost is especially important today because 
of: 
  shorter – 2 to 3 years – product life cycles, which require 
more accurate up-front projections about profitability of 
proposed investment, and leave less room for error in 
production planning and product costing; 
  increasing automation, which means that labor is no 
longer the only major overhead cost driver. 
  This requires more care in identifying, measuring and 
managing cost drivers.

Cost Management


  In product costing, we will shed light on some of the 
following issues: 
  What is the true cost of a product? 
  This is not as straightforward as it seems. 
  For example, Roberts vs. GSA and cost of federal courts – why the half 
billion dollar discrepancy? 
  Reported cost is malleable, and can be exploited. 
  E.g., Stanford yacht. 
  Cost-plus contracts vulnerable, therefore carefully specify which costs 
qualify. 
  How can we refine cost estimates? 
  What is the cost of excess capacity? 
  How much is optimal? 
  Who should bear this cost?

Strategic Cost Management


	 This requires finding and eliminating non-value-
added activities, structures, etc. in the business 
ecosystem, rather than just within the business 
itself. 
	 It requires understanding of ecosystem, the value chain and 
supply chain. 
	 The supply chain is the sequence activities that transform the 
raw materials into finished goods delivered to the consumer. 
	 The value chain is the portion of the supply chain within the 
company.

Strategic Cost Management

	 Strategic cost management requires going beyond
providing information demanded by specific
decisions, to proactively identifying, measuring
and managing key cost drivers within the entire
supply chain. 

	 Examples of strategic cost management initiatives include 
measuring customer profitability, and working with suppliers
to implement JIT. 
	 Incorporate cost into product design : controlling parts
proliferation; target costing

Management Control 

	 This refers to performance evaluation, incentive 
alignment and minimizing divergence of actual 
results from desired results. 
In the discussion above, we assumed neutrality of 
	
information (i.e., freedom from bias). 
	 Now we introduce bias, by recognizing the presence of 
agency issues. 
	 These arise because the interests of the business owners are not 
perfectly aligned with the self interest of the owners’ agents – 
firm managers and employees. 
	 Decentralized organizations require the assignment of decision 
rights to points (people) further away from the owner. 

15.963 [Spring 2007]

18 

Management Control 

	 To control, or minimize, agency issues requires 
measuring or evaluating performance and 
rewarding agents appropriately. 
	 How do we measure both organizational and individual 
performance – which metrics should we use and what are their 
implications? 
	 Measure should be ‘hard’ or verifiable.  E.g., RAF bomber 
command. 
	 Performance metrics determine rewards, and therefore behavior, 
which in turn influences profits. 
	 Inappropriate metrics can have costly consequences.  E.g., CMS 
uses timing of pneumonia-related antibiotic therapy as 
performance measure.

Management Control 


  One of the concepts we will highlight is that 

using a piece of information for control 
impairs its use for decision making. 
  For example, getting projected sales from 
salespeople when preparing the budget. 
  This problem is especially salient in large, decentralized 
organizations, in organizations where specialized 
knowledge is required for decision making and where 
decision timeliness is critical.

Management Control 

	 We will study some of the following management 
control tools and concepts: 
  (a) budgets (aid in control not just planning); 
  (b) transfer prices, or internal prices which aid in control of 
resource usage; 
  (c) the controllability principle and relative performance 
evaluation (RPE may be older than suspected – Hammurabi’s 
code) 
  (d) responsibility accounting and responsibility centers; 
  (e) variance analysis; 
  (f) multiple performance measures and non-financial 
performance measures.

External Environment and 

Management Accounting 


  Shocks in the external environment feed 
through and affect management accounting, 
e.g., 
  manufacturers using just-in-time inventories

Summary

  The role of managerial accountants is 
  identification, 
  measurement, and 
  management 
	 of key operational and financial value drivers (Institute
of Management Accountants, 1999). 
	 Managerial accountants are 
	 problem solvers (e.g., providing information for decision 
making), 
	 scorekeepers (e.g., measuring performance of individuals, 
groups and processes), and 
	 attention directors (e.g., strategic cost management).
