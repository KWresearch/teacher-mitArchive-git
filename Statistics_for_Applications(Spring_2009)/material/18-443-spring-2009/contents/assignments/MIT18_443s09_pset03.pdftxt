18.443 problems  

1. 
In  the  Olympics  in  the   given  years,  the  men’s  long  jump   gold   me
dalist  jumped  the 
following  distances  (in  cm.): 
year   distance  (cm.) 
1952  758.3 
1956  784.4 
1960  813.6 
1964  808.5 
1968  891.9 

year  distance   (cm.) 
1972  825.7 
1976  835.9 
1980  855.6 
1984  855.6 

(a)  Taking  x  as  the  year  and  y  as  the  winning  distance,  what  kind  of 
suitable here:   y -on-x,   x-on-y ,  or  bfsd? 

regression  seems 

(b) Do the regression and  

evaluate the residuals.

(c) Is   there  anything  remarkable  about  the  residuals?  If  anything,  what? 

2.  The  following  data  were  reported  on  windmill  power  output  at  various  wind  speeds. 
The units of  the (DC) power output  are not given by  the source where the data were found. 
For  this  problem  data  are  selected  so  that  the  speeds  look  more  like  design  points  than 
they  would  have  in  the  full  data. 
output  speed (mph) 
0.123 2.45 
0.558 3.05 
1.194 4.10 
1.582 5.00 
1.822 6.00 
1.800 7.00 
2.166 8.15 
2.303 9.10 
2.386 9.70 
2.236 10.00 

(a)  Letting  y  be  power  output  and  x  wind  speed,  what  kind  of  linear  regression,  if  any, 
y -on-x,  x-on-y , bfsd, seems appropriate for these data?  Hints: for  y -on-x, and perhaps also 
for bfsd, what  values of power output  would linear  regression predict for windspeeds below, 
or  above,  the  range  shown,  and  would  these  be  realistic?  Would  anyone  be  interested  in 
“predicting”  wind  speed  from  power  output? 

(b) Consider the  range of wind  speeds from 3  to 9.1 mph, which  contains 7  of  the 10 given 
observations.  Find  the  correlation  of  wind  speed  and  power  output  for  these  7,  and  also 
do  the  y -on-x  regression  for  them.  Also  ﬁnd  the  correlation  for  all  10  observations  and 
compare it. 

3.  Data about average air pressure at given elevations from  “The Engineering Toolbox” are 
given  in  a  handout,  which  on  the  course  website,  subdirectory  Airpressure,  is  a  sequence 
of  seven  1-page  text  ﬁles  “airps1,...,airps7.”

Since  the  elevations  in  feet  are  round  numbers  it  seems  that  they  are  design  points. 
The  last  ﬁve  columns  are  pressures  in  various  units,  linearly  related  to  each  other  except 
for  rounding  error.  So  we  can  concentrate  on  the  two  columns  “feet”  of  elevation  and 
“mmHg”  which  is  pressure,  measured  in  millimeters  of  mercury,  averaged  over  weather 
conditions,  and  set  at  760.0  at  sea  level  for  standardization.  Regressions  for  all  rows  are 
described in the handout. 
For  this  problem  set,  consider  only  those  rows  where  the  elevation  in  feet  is  5,  000k 
for  k  = 0,  1, ...,  8,  i.e.  from  sea  level  up  to  40,000  feet  in  intervals  of  5,000  feet.  Do  the 
following  carefully,  as  the  results  will  be  used  in  the  next  problem. 

(a) For the given  nine  elevations, do  a  simple linear  regression  of pressure (in  mmHg)  on 
elevation (in feet).  Give the  slope  and intercept,  and  the  correlation. 
(b)  Find  the  residuals.  Do  they  show  a  pattern  indicating  whether  linear  regression  ﬁts

the  data  well?


4. 
If  one  were  to  do  a  simple  linear  regression  of  the  residuals  on  elevation,  both  the

intercept  and  slope  should  be  0  if  the  regression  was  done  correctly.

(a)  Do  a  simple  linear  regression  of  the  residuals  on  the  square  of  elevation.  Give  the

intercept  and the  coeﬃcient (of  elevation  squared,  which is  not  a  slope per  se).  Also give

the  correlation  coeﬃcient. 
(This  together  with  Problem  3  is  not  the  same  as  doing  a

quadratic  regression  of pressure  on height (feet)  and its  square.)

(b) Find  the  residuals in this new  regression.  Now is there  any pattern indicating  whether

a  quadratic  model  ﬁts  the  data?

(c)  If  p  is  pressure  and  h  is  elevation,  consider  general  polynomial  models  of  the  form

pj  =  Q(hj ) + ǫj  where  Q  is  a polynomial  of given degree (such  as 1 in problem 3  and 2 in

parts (a)  and (b)  of this problem),  and  ǫj  are i.i.d.  N (0, σ 2).  Can  any  such  model  work

well  for  all  positive  values  of  h?  Hint:  consider  very  large  values  of  h  (say  beyond  the

stratosphere).


5.  For  the  same  data  again:

(a)  Do  a  simple  linear  regression  of  the  (natural)  logarithm  of  the  pressure  ln p  on  the

elevation  h.  Give  the  intercept  ˆa  and  the  slope  ˆb.  Also  give  the  correlation.  How  does  it

compare to those in the previous two problems?

(b) From (a),  solving  for  p  gives  pj  =  ea+bhj  +  ǫj .  As  in  problem  4(c),  does  such  a  model

give  absurd  values  of  p  for  very  large  values  of  h,  in  terms  of  the  expected  value  of  p  given

h?

(c) Suppose that the  residuals in part (a)  show  a pattern  similar to that for the full data

set,  shown in the last page  of  the handout.  Find  the  residuals for part (b).  What pattern

if  any  do  they  show?

(d)  Does  the  variance  of  the  measurements  of  air  pressure,  in  the  range  from  5,000  to

40,000  feet,  seem  to  depend  on  the  elevation?  What  about  the  variance  in  the  log  of  p?

Hint:  do  the  residuals  seem  to  be  on  a  fairly  smooth  curve  as  opposed  to  being  random?

If  so,  then  the  measurements  themselves  would  be  on  a  smooth  curve.  There  is  at  least

rounding  error  in  them,  so  concentrate  on  that.  Does  that  seem  to  change  with  elevation?

What  about  the  resulting  errors  in  log  p?
