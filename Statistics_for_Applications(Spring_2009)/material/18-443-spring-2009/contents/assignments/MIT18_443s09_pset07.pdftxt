18.443 Problem Set 7 

1.  Rice,  §13.8,  Problem  2,  but  omit  week  +2,  leaving  a  3  ×  2 table. 

2.  A  small  preliminary  study  is  done  of  a  new  medication  intended  to  prevent  further 
heart attacks in patients who  recently  survived  a ﬁrst one of  a particular type.  Suppose 9 
such patients are given the new  medication and  another 9  are given a placebo (blank pills). 
After  a  year,  8  of  the  18  patients  have  had  another  heart   attack.  Let  j  be  the  number 
of  patients  having  a  second  attack  who  got  the  new  medication.  Diﬀerent  possible  tests 
could  be  done  of  the  hypothesis  H0  that  the  new  drug  is  equivalent  to  a  placebo. 
(a) Suppose the study was on the issue  of  safety,  using  a 1-sided  test  at level 0.1.  For  what 
values  of  j  would  one  decide  that  the  new  drug  appears   to  be  unsafe  and  should  not  be 
tested further (unless some adjustment is  made)? 
(b) For eﬀectiveness,  at level 0.05, for  what  values of  j would  one decide in a one-sided  test 
that there is signiﬁcant  evidence  of  eﬀectiveness (relative to placebo)  and go on to test the 
new  medication  against  other  eﬀective  ones  to  see  which  may  be  more  eﬀective? 

3.  Rice,  §13.8, problem 24, parts a and b  only.  (But you  may consider part c as providing 
a hint.) 

4.  For the  same data  as in the previous problem, if  we focus  on the boxing  data, the bino­
mial probability  E (148, 268, 1/2),  the  probability  of  148  or  more  wins  in  268  independent 
trials  with  probability  1/2  of  winning  on  each  trial,  is  0.04945. 
(a) If we had only  the boxing  data and  were testing  at the 0.05 level  H0 :  πR  = 1/2 against 
the  composite  alternative  H1 :  πR  >  1/2,  what  would  we  conclude? 
(b) What  about  the  two-sided  alternative  πR  6= 1/2? 
(c) Suppose  we  were  considering the 1-sided  alternative  πR  >  1/2 but  with  the data for all 
four  sports,  where  πR  can  be  diﬀerent  for  diﬀerent  sports  but  larger  than  1/2  in  each  case. 
The  p-values for the  other three  sports,  using  the binomial distribution  as in part (a),  are 
.
all  larger,  for  example  E (45, 80, 1/2)  = 0.157  for  Tae  Kwon  Do,  and  still  larger  for  the  two 
forms   of  wrestling.  What  would  be  the  conclusion(s)? 

5.  In  a  study  of  hospitalized  Medicare  beneﬁciaries,  150119  had  alcohol-related  disease 
(ARD) and  of  these,  6973  had  hip  fractures  and  21467  had  diabetes.  Of  726218  patients 
who did  not have ARD in the same study, 13647 had hip fractures and 159042 had diabetes. 
(a) Estimate the odds  ratio Δ where D  = hip fracture and X  =ARD (Rice’s notation). 
(b) Is this odds  ratio (statistically)  signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 1?  Hint:  You  may  not 
need  to  do  a  very  precise  or  long  calculation  to  decide  this. 
(c) Estimate  the  odds  ratio  Δ  where  D  =  diabetes  and  X  =ARD (Rice’s  notation). 
(d)  Is   the  latter  odds  ratio  (statistically)  signiﬁcantly  diﬀerent  from  1? 
In  what 
direction? 
(e)  In  part  (a)  we  would  like  to  estimate  the  odds  ratio  in  the  general  population. 
Could  there  be  a  problem  with  an  estimate  based  on  the  hospitalized  population  in  the 
study?  Hint:  consider parts (c)-(d).  [Actually, the authors of the study  didn’t just accept 
the estimate in (a), they  made various adjustments for  “confounding”  to try to isolate the 
direct  eﬀect  of  ARD  on  hip  fracture.]
