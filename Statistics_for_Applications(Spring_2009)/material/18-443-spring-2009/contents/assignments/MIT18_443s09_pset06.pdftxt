18.443 Problem Set 6 

or 

1.  In this problem, please save all  the parameter values and  expected  values you estimate, 
not  only  to  those  digits  displayed,  but  to  all  the  digits  your  calculator  computes,  by 
storing 
them in your calculator memory. One reason is that there can be cancellation in 
subtractions  resulting   in  loss  of  signiﬁcant  digits.   Also,  some  estimates  found  in  Prob
lem 
1  will  be  used  again  in  Problem  2.  
In  a  random   sample  of  10,  000  people,  the   following  probabilities  were  observed 
would be predicted for blood  types:  
Theory   II 
Theory   I 
Observed 
Type 
p 2  +  2pr 
u(1 − v) 
0.4541  
A 
 
q 2 +  2qr 
(1 − u)v 
B 
0.0774 
r 2 
(1 − u)(1 − v) 
0.4384  
O 
2pq 
AB 
0.0301 
uv 
two 
According to   Theory I, there are two forms   (alleles)  of  one gene, C and c, and
forms of another gene, D and d. Here C has probability , so c has probability 1
, and 
− u
u
D has probability  v ,  so  d  has  probability  1  −  v .  Combinations  of  genes  would  give  the 
following  blood  types:  CD  =  AB,  Cd  =  A,  cD  =  B,  cd  =  O.  Having  C  is  independent 
of having D. (A person gets  one  allele from  each parent;  we  assume  one is dominant  over 
another,  as  in  CC   or  Cc  both  giving  “C,”  and  DD  or  Dd  both  giving  “D.”) 
Estimate the probability  u  from the observed  relative frequency  of A’s plus AB’s, and 
v  from B’s plus AB’s. 
In  Theory  II,  there  are  three  forms  of  one  gene,  C,  c  and  t.  The  probabilities  are  p 
for  C,  q  for  c,  and  r  for  t,  so  p +  q  +  r  =  1.  Each  person  has  two  of  the  alleles,  one  from 
each parent.  Since Cc  =  cC, Ct  =  tC  and  ct  = tc (we assume here it doesn’t  matter which 
parent  each  came from), there  are 6 possible diﬀerent  combinations  of  two  alleles  a person 
can  have.  Blood  groups  would  be  determined  as  follows:  CC  or  Ct  is  A,  cc  or  ct  is  B,  Cc 
is AB,  and tt is O. 
Estimate (p + r)2  from the observed  relative frequencies of A’s plus O’s, then take the 
square   root  to  estimate  p + r . Estimate  q  as 1 − p − r . Likewise  estimate (q + r)2  from the 
observed  relative  frequencies  of  B’s  plus  O’s,  take  the  square  root  to  estimate  q  +  r  and 
then  p  as 1  − q  − r .  Then  estimate  r  as 1  − p − q . 
Test both theories by chi-squared.  Which ﬁts the data better?  Is either theory rejected 
by  the  data,  at  the  0.05 level? 

2.  For the  same data  as in the previous problem,   again test the  same two hypotheses, but 
instead  of  a  χ2  test,  use  the  Wilks  likelihood  ratio  test.  Since  the  maximum  likelihood  is 
hard  to  compute  for  Theory  II,  don’t  compute  it,  but  again  use  the  estimates  as  for  the 
χ2  test.  We  know  that  the  likelihood,  maximized  at  the  unknown  MLEs,  will  be  at  least 
as  large  as  it  is  at  the  estimated  parameters   used.  By  Wilks’s  theorem,   if  a  d-dimensional 
hypothesis  H0  is  true,  then  for  n  large  (which  it  is),  his  likelihood  ratio  statistic  has  a 
distribution  approximately  χ2 
k−1−d ,  since  the  dimension  of  the  full  multinomial  model  is 
k  − 1. 
Beside  doing  the  tests,  see  if  the  values  of  the  statistics  are  similar,  for  a  non-rejected 
hypothesis.

3.  Consider Problem 21 in Section 11.6, pp. 462-463  of Rice, but  changed  as follows.  Omit 
the  smallest  and  largest  measurements  for  each  of  the  two  types  of  bearings,  leaving  8  for 
each.  Then,  for  the  data  on  Type  I,  normality  is  not  rejected,  but  for  Type  II  it  is. 
(a) In  what  way(s)  can  one  see  that  the  Type  II  data  may  be  non-normal? 
(b) The  non-normality indicates that the  analysis in part (a)  of Rice’s problem  would be 
inappropriate,  so  we don’t  need to do it,  and this  also  answers his part (c).  So,  compare 
the two  samples by  a  nonparametric  method  as in Rice’s part (b). 

4.  Problem  38  in  §11.6  pp.  466-467  of  Rice,  but  only  for  Pyrazolone-T  and  omitting  the 
observations (0,0), leaving  9 pairs  of  observations. 

5.  An  example  on  pp.  477-478  of  Rice  has  a  table  with  data  from  7  diﬀerent  labs.  The 
Shapiro-Wilk  test  was  applied  to  the  four  separate  data  sets  from  Labs  1,  2,  3,  and  7,  and 
none  of  the  four  tests  rejected  normality,  where  the  mean  and  variance  could  depend  on 
the  lab  (even  though  as  the  box  plot  shows,  the  observation  3.81  from  Lab  7  might  be 
suspected  of  being  an  outlier). 
(a) Find  the  sample  variance  of  the  10  observations  from  Lab  2. 
(b) Find  the  sample  variance  of  the  10  observations  from  Lab  3. 
(c) Test  whether  these  two  variances  are  the  same,  using  an  F-test  at  level  0.05.  It  should 
be  a  two-sided  test,  but  the  tables  of  the  F  distribution  in  Rice  are  for  one-sided  tests.  So, 
see  if  the  ratio  of  the  larger  to  the  smaller  of  the  two  sample  variances  is  larger  than  the 
0.975 quantile  of  the F distribution  with  the  appropriate degrees  of freedom in  numerator 
and denominator. 
(d) Find  also  the  p-value  of  the test, in  other  words the probability  of  observing  a  value  of 
the  F  statistic  as  large  or  larger  than  the  one  Fobs  actually  observed.  You  can  do  this  in  R 
by ﬁnding  the probability  that  F  ≤  Fobs  as pf(Fobs , n1 , n2 ) where  n1  and  n2  are the degrees 
of freedom in the  numerator  and denominator  respectively, then  subtracting  from 1  to get 
P (F > Fobs ).  (If  R  isn’t  conveniently  available  to  you  there  is  a  p-value  calculator  for 
F  distributions  provided  on  the  Web  at  http://davidmlane.com/hyperstat/F  table.html. 
Or,  when  I  Google  “F  distribution”  I  ﬁnd  the  site  as  the  third  listed  one  after  Wikipedia 
and  Wolfram.)  Then  multiply  by  2  to  get  a  p-value for the 2-sided test. 
 
7  =  21  possible  comparisons  of  two  diﬀerent  labs.  The  p-value from part 
� �
(e) There  are 
2
(d) is  not  really  valid  because  the  speciﬁc  comparison  was  chosen  after  noticing  from  the 
box  plots  that  the  Lab  2  seemed  to  have  a  high  variance  and  the  Lab  3  data  a  small  one. 
So multiply  the  p-value from part (d) by 21  as a  “Bonferroni”  correction for multiple tests. 
Is  the  result  still  less  than  0.05?  If  so,  one  can  decide  that  there  are  signiﬁcant  diﬀerences 
in  the  variances  between  labs,  and  the  basic  assumption  of  the  Analysis  of  Variance  that 
the  variances  should  be  equal  would  be  violated. 
If  the  result  is  larger  than  0.05,  one 
might  conclude  that  a  purportedly  signiﬁcant  ratio  found  in  parts  (c)  and  (d)  was  not 
really  signiﬁcant.
