Fact.  If  X  and  Y  are  independent  random  variables,  X  is  N (µ, � 2)  and  Y  is  N (�, ν 2 ), 
then  X + Y  is  N (µ + �, � 2 + ν 2 ). 
Note.  For  any  two  random  variables  X  and  Y  with  ﬁnite  means  (independent  or  not), 
E (X + Y ) = EX + E Y .  And,  for  any  two  random  variables  X  and  Y  with  E (X 2) < �, 
E (Y 2 )  <  �,  and  Cov(X, Y )  =  0,  for  example,  if  X  and  Y  are  independent,  we  have 
Var(X + Y )  = Var(X )+Var(Y ).  So,  if X + Y  has  a normal  distribution,  it must  have  the 
given mean  and  variance. 
Proof.  Clearly,  X  −  µ  has  a  N (0, � 2)  distribution  and  likewise  Y  −  �  has  a  N (0, ν 2) 
distribution.  If  we  can  show  that  X + Y  − µ − �  has  a  N (0, � 2  + ν 2 )  distribution,  it  will 
follow  that X + Y  has  a N (µ + �, � 2 + ν 2 )  distribution.  So we  can  assume  that µ = �  = 0. 
Recall  that  exp(u) means  e .  The  convolution  of  the N (0, � 2)  and N (0, ν 2 ) densities,

We  can  bring  a  factor  exp(−t2 /(2� 2 ))  not  depending  on  y  outside  the  integral.  The  re­
maining  expression  inside  the  integral,  whose  exponential  is  taken,  if  put  over  a  common 
denominator, becomes −((� 2  + ν 2 )y 2 
− 2tν 2y )/(2� 2ν 2 ). Completing  the  square,  then  sub­
tracting  a  term  to  compensate,  this  becomes 
−(� 2  + ν 2 )[(y − v )2

and  we  can  bring  this  factor  outside  the  integral  because  it  doesn’t  depend  on  y .  Then, 
the  value  of  the  remaining  integral  doesn’t  depend  on  v  and  so  doesn’t  depend  on  t;  it’s  a 
constant  B  depending  on  �  and  ν ,  speciﬁcally,  B  =  �2��ν /�� 2  + ν 2 .  The  function  of  t 
we  wind  up  with,  leaving  aside  such  constant multiples,  is
