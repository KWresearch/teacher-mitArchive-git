Remarks on PS2

 The material for PS2 is entirely from the handout on binomial
 confidence intervals (a .pdf file in this subdirectory). The
 material from Rice, Sections 7.1-7.3, on the same problem when
 sampling without replacement from a finite population, is not
 being covered this semester.

 Rice mentions the notion of "standard error" which is the
 standard deviation of an estimate of a parameter. The standard 
error usually itself has to be estimated from the data. "Standard 
error" is a buzz phrase in statistics (3.6 million Google hits).
 It only makes sense in the present case when using the
 plug-in interval, when the estimate is at the center of
 the confidence interval. We've seen though that there are
 a lot of drawbacks to the plug-in interval unless n and
 X(n-X)/n are large enough.
