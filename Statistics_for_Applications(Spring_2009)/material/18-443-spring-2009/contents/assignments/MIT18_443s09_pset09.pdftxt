18.443 Problem Set 9 

1.  Rice,  §13.8,  Problem  18,  but  replace  each  number  in  the  table  by  itself  minus  4.  So

replace  39  by  35,  113  by  109,  15  by  11,  and  150  by  146,  so  we  would  now  have  301  pairs

instead  of  317.  Test  if  among  the  301  controls,  the  probability  of  having  taken  estrogen

is the same  as the probability that the  matched case patient had taken it.  (That’s just

a  restatement  of  the  problem,  not  an  additional  part.)  Omit  the  question  in  the  last

sentence.


2.  (a) Rice, Sec. 10.9, problem 16, but give formulas for the Q-Q  plots.  You don’t  need  to

graph  them. 

(b) Let Φ be the N (0, 1) distribution function and G another distribution function.  Suppose

that  the  Q-Q  plot  for  G  vs.  Φ  is  a  straight  line  y  =  ax  +  b.  (What  are  the  possibilities

among  a <  0,  a  =  0,  or  a >  0?)  Show  that  G  is  the  distribution  function  of  some  normal

N (µ, σ 2)  distribution  and  evaluate  µ  and  σ  in  terms  of  a  and  b.  Hint:  Part   (a)  gives

examples.


3.  Rice,  §10.9,  Problem  27,  but  only  from  days  15n  to 15n  + 1,  n  = 0, 1, . . . ,  8.  Data  for

this  are   provided  in  the  ﬁle  “medﬂies.txt”  on  the  course  website.


4.  A  Pareto  distribution  for  each  p >  1  has  the  density  fp (t) =  cp/tp  for  t  ≥  1  and

fp (t) = 0 for  t <  1.

(a) Evaluate  the  constant  cp  as  a  function  of  p.

(b) For  the  Pareto  distribution  for  each  p,  evaluate  the  survival  function  S (t) = 1 − F (t).

(c) Evaluate the hazard function.

(d) Answer Problem 14,  §10.9  of  Rice.


5.  The  Cauchy  distribution  is  one  having  density  f (x) = 1/(π (1 + x2 )) for  all  real  x.  This

is  the  same  as  the  t  distribution  with  1  degree  of  freedom. 

(a) Show that the distribution function is F (x) =  a + b arctan x  for some constants  a  and  b

and  evaluate  the  constants.  Hint:  the derivative of  the distribution function  must give the

density,  so  evaluate  b  from  that.  Then  ﬁnd  a  from  the  properties  of  distribution  functions

when  x  goes to  ±∞.

(b)  Recall  that  g (x) ∼  h(x)  means  g (x)/h(x) →  1,  in  this  case  as  x  →  +∞.  Show  that

for  the  Cauchy  distribution,  the  survival  function  S (x)  satisﬁes  S (x)  ∼  1/(πx).  For  the

t1−α  quantiles  with  df  =  1  given  in  the  t  table,  check  how  accurate  the  approximation  is

for  α  = 0.05,  0.025,  0.01,  and  0.005.

(c) For  any  i.i.d.  random  variables  X1 , ..., Xn  with distribution function  F ,  show  that  the

distribution function of the  maximum observation (i.e. the largest order statistic  X(n) ) is

nF .

(d) Show that an approximate  median of  the distribution of  X(n)  for a  Cauchy distribution

as  n  becomes large is  cn  for  a  constant  c >  0  and  evaluate  the  constant.  Hint:  for  any  real

number  a,
