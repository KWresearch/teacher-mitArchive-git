Remarks on PS3 

The main material for the week is about simple linear
 regression, as defined in Rice and given in lectures. 

A main message for the week is, not just to do such
 regression, but to examine residuals for a possible pattern.
 One way to do that quantitatively is the turning point test,
 described in a handout. (As usual in the course, proofs may
 be given in the handout but don't need to be learned.)

 The handout on best fit by squared (perpendicular) distance
 from points to a line is being pretty much de-emphasized
 this semester. That kind of regression can make sense when
 both X_i and Y_i are random variables, neither are design
 points, and we don't particularly want to predict one from
 the other.

 The subsubdirectory "Airpressure" contains one handout,
 where (not so conveniently, sorry) each page of the handout is 
a separate 1-page text file.
 2-sided printed copies of the 7 pages have been given out.
 Some problems in ps3 are based on a subset of the air pressure
 data given on the first page. Also the handout describes
 behavior of residuals for the full data, which may be related
 to behavior for the subset of the data we're looking at in PS3.
