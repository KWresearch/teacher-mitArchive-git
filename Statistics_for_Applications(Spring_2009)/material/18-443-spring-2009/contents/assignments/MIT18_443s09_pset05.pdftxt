18.443 Problem Set 5


Here   are   some  comments  on  “p-values,”  a  common  notion  in  statistics  that  Rice  mentions, 
and  which  we’ve  already  seen  in  the  output  of  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test.  If  a  hypothesis  H0 
will  be  rejected  for  large  values  of  a  statistic  V  such  as  X 2  or  W ,  and  a  value  Vobs  is 
observed, then the  p-value is the probability  that  V  is greater  or  equal  Vobs ,  assuming  H0 . 
If  V  has  approximately  a  chi-squared  distribution,  then  you  can  determine  whether 
the  p-value  is  less  than  α,  or  larger  than  1  −  α,  for  a  few  usual  values  of  α,  from  the 
chi-squared tables. 
By  the  same  computational  methods  that  have  been  used  to  compute  the  numbers  in 
the  tables  (which  was  done  some  decades  before  computers   were  invented,  on  very  slow 
desk  calculator  machines)  it  is  also  possible  to  compute  p-values  for  any  Vobs ,  and  Rice 
mentions some such  p-values.  But you aren’t asked  to do such  computations, just to answer 
questions  about  α  and 1  − α  comparisons,  and  the  tables  are  enough  for  that.

(This  relates  to  the  handout  “Mean-square  errors   of  estimators...”.)  For  the  three

possible  choices  of  cn  in  estimating  sample  variance,  namely  1/(n − 1), 1/n, and  the newer

Yatracos  choice  c ′ 
n  = (n  + 2)/[n(n  + 1)],

′  ﬁt  into  the  ordering?

(a) clearly  1/n < 1/(n  − 1).  Where  does  c n 
Recall that  an  ∼  bn  means that  an/bn  →  1  as  n  → ∞.  For  each  of  the  following  Dn , 
ﬁnd  a  constant  C  and power  k  such that  Dn  ∼  C/nk  as  n  → ∞.

(d)  Let  the  true  variance  of  the  distribution  of  Xj  be  σ 2  and  Dn  the  bias  of  Yatracos’ 
n 
=1 (Xj  − X )2  as  an  estimator  of  σ 2 .

2.  Some  random  numbers  were  generated  in  R  as  follows.  They  are  independent  and 
normally  distributed,  all  with  mean  3.3,  but  with  a  variance  chosen  at  random:   with 
probability 0.9  the  variance  is  1,  and  with  probability  0.1  it  is  25,  so  that  the  standard 
deviation  is  5.  Let’s  consider  some  numbers   actually  output  by  R  and  see  if  we  can 
determine  which  variance  they  were  generated  from.   For  each  of  the  following  numbers, 
ﬁnd  the  likelihood  ratio  that  they  came  from  N (3.3, 1)  relative  to  coming  from  N (3.3, 25). 
Also  ﬁnd  the  posterior  probability  in  each  case.  If  answers   are  very   large  or  small,  give 
them  in  scientiﬁc  notation  r  ·  10m  where  m  is  an  integer  that  may  be  positive,  negative  or 
0  and  1  ≤  r <  10, giving  r  to  three  signiﬁcant  digits. 

(a) X  = 2.95 

(b) X  =  −1.147 

(c) X  = 4.764. 

3.  In  Buﬀon’s  needle  problem,  a  needle  of  length  L  is  thrown  at  random  onto  ruled  paper 
with  lines  at  distance  D  apart.  If  L < D,  the  probability  that  the  needle  hits  a  line  is 
2L/(πD).  Lazzarini  in  1901  reported  on  an  experiment  with  L/D  = 5/6,  where  the  needle 
was  thrown  3408  times  and  it  hit  the  line  1808  times. 
Usually  χ2  tests  are  one-sided,  and  the  hypothesis  is  rejected  for  large  values  of  the 
statistic  X 2 .  But,  in  this  case,  do  a  two-sided  test  for  random  sampling  with  the  given 
hitting  probability,  where  we’d  reject  the  hypothesis  if  X 2  is too large (the hitting prob­
ability  is  wrong)  or  if  X 2  is too small (the sampling  may have been non-random), at the 
α  = 0.05 level.

4.  Consider  the  class  of  all  normal  distributions  N (µ, 1),  so  that  H1  is the  set  of  all (µ, 1) 
for  any  real  µ  and  σ  =  σ 2  =  1.  Let  H0  be  the  subset  of  H1  where  µ  has  a  ﬁxed  value 
µ  =  µ0 .  Show  that  in  this  case  the  Wilks  statistic  W  =  −2 log Λ (deﬁned in the handout 
in general,  as  opposed  to the  multinomial  case  as in Rice)  has  exactly  a  χ2 (1) distribution 
for  all  n,  not  only  asymptotically  as  n  → ∞.
