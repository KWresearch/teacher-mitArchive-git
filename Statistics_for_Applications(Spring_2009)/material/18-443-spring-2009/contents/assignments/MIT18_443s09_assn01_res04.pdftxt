 18.443, February 4, 2009  The R environment; gravitational constant


 In Athena, you can get into the statistical computing environment 

 R by typing "add r"  and then "R"  (without quotes). 

 I entered the data on 7 observations of the Newtonian gravitational

 constant in 1998 and 1999 by this command: 


 x <- c(6.6729,6.6735,6.6873,6.6699,6.6742,6.6830,6.6754) 


 "c" can be interpreted as "concatenate." It takes the numbers to

 be components of a vector, and "<-" is the assignment symbol, 

 defining the left side to equal the right, like "=" in many 

 computer languages. I created a further data vector y to include  

also the 1981 observation with the command


 y <- c(6.1,x)


 which gives a vector with 8 components. 


sink("filename") which causes output 

 
 There is a command in R, 
 to be written to a file called filename rather than displayed on 

 the screen. When you're finished creating the file you then 

to return to displaying output on the screen. 

 type 
 
  
sink() 
 There is a test of whether data could have reasonably come from 

 a normal distribution (we haven't defined the notion of hypothesis

 test yet, but we will later in the course). The test is called

 the Shapiro-Wilk test. I created a file by starting writing to it, 

then giving the following sequence of commands: 


 x

 shapiro.test(x) 

 y

 shapiro.test(y) 


sink() and got out 

 
 Then I stopped writing to the file with 
 of R by  q()  [quit]. Here is the file. R has treated the

 vector x as a 1 by 7 matrix, and y as a 1 by 8 matrix, 

 so the [1] denotes first row in each case.

The quantity W ("Shapiro-Wilk test statistic," I guess W is Wilk's
 initial) is between 0 and 1. Values closer 
to 1 indicate a better fit to a normal distribution (which could 
have any mean and variance). As the number n of observations gets

 larger, W needs to be closer to 1 to be consistent with normality. 
The p-value is the probability, if the data are i.i.d. normal, of
 observing a W as far from 1 as is observed, for the given number
 of data points (7 or 8 in this case). You can see that for
 x, the p-value is about 0.185, quite substantial, so we wouldn't
 reject the hypothesis that the data in x are normally distributed.
 However, for y, the p-value is about 2.2 times 10^{-6}, very 
small. So for y, we reject the hypothesis of normality. The 
components of x are grouped rather closely together,
 whereas the observation 6.1 is far from them, it's what's called
 an outlier. In a normal distribution, outliers shouldn't occur.
 The observation 6.1 could have come from a normal distribution
 with the same mean as the others, but a larger variance.
