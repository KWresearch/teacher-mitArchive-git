Remarks on PS1

 The file "normalsamples.pdf" is the one most crucial for the 
material of the week: finding confidence intervals for the
 mean and variance from an i.i.d. normal sample. It's parallel
 to some sections of Rice mentioned in the syllabus. Some
 facts from other handouts (addnormals.pdf, convol-gamma-...)
 are used.

 The text file gravconstandR says something about the R system
 and relates to some of the specific problems on PS1.

 The file "addnormals.pdf" is probability material, in which it's
 shown that the sum of two independent normal variables is also
 normal, with the means and variances adding. That's part of
 the prerequisite material (18.440) but is given here for reference.

 The file on convolution, gamma and chi-squared variables might well
 have been partially covered in a probability course, namely that
 when independent gamma random variables with the same scale parameter
 are added, the resulting random variable is also gamma  with the
 same scale parameter, and the shape parameters add. Chi-squared
 variables are of special interest in statistics and turn out to
 have gamma distributions. In applications, the chi-squared distribution
 is used mainly by way of a table (or computed quantiles) for it,
 so the relationship with gamma distributions is in the background.
