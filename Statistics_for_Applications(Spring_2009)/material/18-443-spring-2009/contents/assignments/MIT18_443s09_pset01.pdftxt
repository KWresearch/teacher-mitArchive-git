18.443  problems  based  on  Chapter  6  and  Section  8.5.3  of  Rice 

1.  (a)  Rice,  p.  198,  Problem  3,  but  with  49  instead  of  16  and  0.8  instead  of  0.5.  More 
explicitly: 
Let  X  be  the  average  of  a  sample  of  49  independent  normal  random  variables  with 
mean  0  and  variance  1.  Determine  c  such that  P (|X | < c) = 0.8. 
(b) Rice, p. 198, Problem 4, but for  t4  instead  of  t7 .  More  explicitly: 
If  T  follows  a  t4  distribution,  ﬁnd  t0  such  that (a)  P (|T | < t0 ) =  .9  and (b)  P (T > 
t0 ) = 0.05.

2.  Small  measurement  errors  are  believed  to  follow   a  normal  distribution.  The  foll
measurements of  the constant were published, one in 1981, and   the  rest in 1998-9, in
units 
of 10−11N·m2/kg2  (N=Newtons,  m=meters,  kg=kilograms).

In this problem, ignore the error bars such as ±0.0007 given by the experimenters and 
just  consider  the  numbers  in  the  leftmost  column   as  data  points.  According  to  the  results 
from  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test  handed  out,  the  8  observations  are  not  normally  distributed. 
Just  consider  the  7  from  1998-99,  for  which  normality  was  not  rejected. 
(a) Find  the  sample  mean 

X  of  these  7  observations. 
(b)  Find  their  sample  variance  S 2  ≡  s2 
X  and  standard   deviation  sX .  Hint:  scientiﬁc 
2  . 
calculators   often  give  s  =  sX ;  square  it  to  get  sX 
(c) Find (X  − 6.1)/sX  to  see,  in  terms  of  sample  standard   deviations  for  the  7  obser­
vations,  how  far  6.1  is  away  from  their  mean.  (This  indicates  how  much  of  an  outlier  it 
is.) 

(d) Find a 95%  conﬁdence interval for the gravitational  constant (the true  mean of  the 
observations),  based  on  the  7  data  points  from  1998-99,  assuming  a  normal  distribution. 

3.  For  this  problem,  we’ll  study  the  errors,  in  other  words  the  variances.  Again  omit  the 
1981  Page  and  Geilker  numbers.  For  the  7  observations  from  1998-1999,  assuming  that 
they  are   i.i.d.  normal  with  the  same  but  unknown  mean  µ  and  variance  σ 2 , 
(a) Give  a  95%  conﬁdence  interval  for  σ 2 .  Take  the  square  roots  of  the  endpoints  to 
get  a  95%  conﬁdence  interval  for  σ . 
(b) In  this  part  only,  consider  the  estimated  experimental  errors   for  the  seven  obser­
vations,  given  after  ±.  Which  of  them  are  within  the  conﬁdence  interval  for  σ? 

4.  In an experiment, 26  women in good health had temperatures (taken by  an oral ther­
mometer)  with 

 
 
 
X  = 98.41◦  F.  and  sample  standard   deviation  sX  = 0.77◦  F.  For  122  men, 
the  sample  mean  was  Y  = 98.10◦  F.,  and  sY  = 0.72◦  F.  Assume  that  the  temperature 
distributions  for  men,  and  for  women,  are  normal,  although  they  might  be  diﬀerent,  with 
diﬀerent  means  and/or  variances  for  the  two  genders.  From  this  information  give  95% 
conﬁdence intervals for 
(a) µX ,  women’s  average  temperature,  and 
(b) µY  ,  men’s  average  temperature. 
(c) Do  these  intervals  overlap?  Does  either  contain  98.6◦  F.? 

5.  Submit  your  answer  to  this  problem  as  a  printout  on  a  separate  page,  with  your  name 
on  it,  not  fastened  to  the  rest  of  your  problem  set. 

In  problem  2  and  the  related  handout,  we  saw  that  a  data  set  with  as  few  as  9 
points  can  be  clearly  non-normal  because  of  an  outlier.   But  there  are  many  other  ways  a 
distribution  can  depart  from  being  normal.  In  fact  if  the  observations  are  i.i.d.  with  any 
distribution  other  than  a  normal  one,  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test  can  detect  that  for  a  large 
enough  sample. 
Get into R (in Athena, by  “add r” then  “R”, without quotes).  (Also, by the way, R 
is freely  available public software, available on websites called CRAN.) When you’re  ready 
to generate your  ﬁle for printed  output, give the command  sink(”myﬁle”)  or  whatever you 
want to call your  ﬁle, then  when you’re done type sink()  and  then q()  to get out of R.  The 
ﬁle  will  have  materialized  in  whatever  directory   you’re  in  and  you  can  print  it.  The  “>” 
at  the  beginning  of  each  line  with  R  code  is  a  system  prompt  which  could  be  diﬀerent  in 
diﬀerent  systems. 
You  may  want  to  try  the  following  commands  in  R  and  see  results  on  the  screen  to 
ﬁnd  how  things  work,  before  you  produce  your  ﬁle  to  turn   in. 

(a) generate  some  i.i.d.  standard  exponential  variables  as  follows.  (Recall that  a  standard 
exponential distribution has density  e−x  for  x  ≥  0  and  0  for  x <  0.) 

>  x  <- rexp(25) 

Then  x  will  be  a  data  vector  consisting  of  25  i.i.d.  standard   exponential  variables.  Here 
“exp” tells the system to use the exponential distribution, the  “r” before it  says to generate 
random variables i.i.d. with  that distribution, and  the 25 (which  could be  replaced by  any 
positive  integer)  gives  how  many  to  generate.  Apply  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test: 

>  shapiro.test(x) 

The  deviation  of  a  data  set  from  normality  is  by  default  “signiﬁcant”  if  the  p-value is 
≤  0.05,  or  “highly  signiﬁcant”  if  it’s  ≤  0.001.  What  do  you  ﬁnd? 
The exponential distribution is very diﬀerent from a normal in that it’s an asymmetric, 
skewed distribution  with  a sharp cutoﬀ on the left  at 0 but  extending  arbitrarily far out to 
the  right.  Its  mean  is  1,  but  its  median,  having  equal  probability  1/2  to  the  left  or  right 
of it, is 
ln 2  <  1. 

(b) Next  let’s  try  the  same  thing but  for  the  uniform   U [0, 1] distribution.  This has density 
f (x)  = 1 for 0  ≤  x  ≤  1  and  0  elsewhere.  Unlike  the  exponential,  this  distribution  is 
symmetric  around  its  mean,  which  equals  its  median,  both  being  1/2.  Experiment  for 
yourself  if  you  like,  but  I  found  indications  that  a  sample  size  of  n  = 25  isn’t  large  enough 
to distinguish  this distribution from a normal  very well.  The assigned problem in this part 
is to take 

>  y  <- runif(200) 

and  then test  y  for normality  by  the Shapiro-Wilk  test.  Here  “unif ”  stands for the  U [0, 1] 
distribution  and  the  rest  is  as  before. 

(c) Now  let’s  generate  i.i.d.  standard   normal  variables,  and  apply  the  test  to  them:  

>  z  <- rnorm(500) 

Here  the  variables  are  normal,  so  the  test  for  normality  shouldn’t  reject  them,   but  since  a 
“signiﬁcant”  deviation  will  happen  on  average  once  in  20  tries,  and  there  are  more  than 
20 people in this class, it  wouldn’t be surprising  at  all if  a few  of you  ﬁnd  such  a deviation. 
A  “highly  signiﬁcant”  deviation  would  suggest  something  may  be  wrong,  although  even 
that  could  happen.  Your  ﬁle  will  show  what  W  and  p-value  you  get,  and  you  don’t  need 
to  comment  on  them  unless  you  see  a  reason  to. 

WARNING: for  most problems on problem sets, there is no penalty for collaborating in this 
course (although  collaborating  on  exams   is very   much  a  no-no),  and there  is  a  uniquely 
determined  answer.  However,  in  this  problem  both  situations  are  reversed.  Each  time 
someone  generates  a  set  of  random  variables,  the  system  uses  a  diﬀerent  initialization,  so 
you  should  all  generate  diﬀerent  sets  of  variables  and  get  diﬀerent  p-values  in  each  part. 
If  two  or  more  people  submit  printouts  with  identical  p-values,  they  will  get  0  on  this 
problem.  Also, in part (c), it isn’t  wrong  to get a p-value less than 0.05.
