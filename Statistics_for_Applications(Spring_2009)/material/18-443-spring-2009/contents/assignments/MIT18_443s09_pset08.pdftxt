18.443 Problem Set 8 

1.  Here  are  the  estimated  “genome  sizes”  (amount  of  DNA  in  a  haploid  cell,  or  half 
the  amount  in  a  diploid  cell)  for  various  non-primate  mammals,  given  in  T.  R.  Gregory 
(2005),  “Animal  Genome  Size  Database,”  http://www.genomesize.com.   The  units  are  in 
picograms.  In parts (a)-(h), ﬁnd the sample  median of the numbers for the given species 
or  genus.  If  you  notice  any  numbers  that  would  tend  to  make  the  sample  mean  diﬀerent 
from  the  sample  median,  or  make  the  sample  standard   deviation  large,  do  comment  on 
that, but you need  not compute the sample  mean or standard deviation until part (i). 
Note  that  within  each  species,  the  genome  sizes  are  already  arranged  in  order,  but 
starting  over  with  a  new  species. 

(a) Bos taurus (domestic  cattle): 3.15,  3.43,  3.57,  3.60,  3.65,  3.70,  3.73,  3.79,  3.93. 
(b) Ovis  aries (sheep):  2.34, 2.57, 3.30, 3.33, 3.50. 
(c) Canis familiaris (domestic dog): 2.80, 2.85, 2.88, 2.96, 3.09, 3.19, 3.26, 3.43, 3.54. 
(d)  Genus Felis (domestic, then some  wild cats): 2.86, 2.91, 3.10, 3.22, 3.45, 2.92, 2.92,

3.00.

(e) Oryctolagus cuniculus (common  rabbit): 2.50, 2.88, 3.09, 3.26, 3.42, 3.52, 3.57.

(f ) Equus  caballus (horse):  2.95, 3.15, 3.15, 3.21, 3.38, 3.48.

(g) Mus musculus (house  mouse): 2.45, 2.92, 3.25, 3.26, 3.26, 3.28, 3.31, 3.35, 3.38, 3.45,

3.52, 4.03.

(h) Rattus norvegicus (Norway  rat, brown  rat): 2.98, 3.05, 3.14, 3.27, 3.36, 3.82, 3.90.


(i)  For  the  eight  sample  medians  you’ve  found  so  far,   ﬁnd  their  sample  mean,  sample

median, and  sample standard deviation.  Does it  seem that the diﬀerences in  measurements

are  more   due  to  variation  within  species  (measurement  errors)  or  to  actual  diﬀerences

between  mammal  species?


(j) There are a great many  species of bats and  measurements for them, so let’s just  consider 
fruit  bats  of  three  genera,  Artibeus,  Carollia  and  Dermanura.  Find  the  sample  median  of 
the following genome  sizes:  2.56, 2.74, 2.70, 2.93, 2.67, 3.06, 2.85, 2.71, 2.73.  For (fruit) 
bats,  does  it  seem  there  is  an  actual  diﬀerence  with  other  mammal  species? 

2.  Would  the  sample  median,  or  mean,  of  observations  be  more  useful  as  a  summary  for

the following  kinds  of data (give  short   explanations for your  answers):

(a) daily precipitation (rain,  snow,   etc.),  say for Boston  on  each day  of 2008?

(b) family  income  in  a  region,  for  purposes  of  a  large  bakery   distributing  loaves  of  bread

through  supermarkets;

(c) family  income  in  a  region,  but  for  purposes  of  a  manufacturer  of  private  aircraft?


3.  Rice,  §12.5,  Problem  26,  but  only  for  dogs  3  through  8,  and  use  only  a  nonparametric

method.


4.  Let  F  be  a  continuous,  strictly  increasing  distribution  function,  so  there  is  a  unique

median  x0  for  which  F (x0 )  = 1/2.  Suppose  x0  =  0.  Then  for  any  real  m  we  can  form

another distribution function  Fm  such  that  Fm (x) ≡ F (x − m).  Then  Fm  will have  median

m.

It’s  known  (and  will  be  seen  during  the  week)  that  if  V1 , ..., Vn  are  a  sample  i.i.d. 
U [0, 1], the  j th  order  statistic  V(j )  will  have  a  beta(j, n − j + 1)  distribution.  In particular 
for  n  = 2k + 1  odd,  the  sample  median  V(k+1)  has  a  beta(k + 1, k  + 1)  distribution. 
The  variables  F −1 (V(j ) ) will have the joint distribution  of  the  order  statistics  X(1)  < 
< X(n)  from  a  sample  X1 , ..., Xn  i.i.d.  (F ).  Thus  F −1 (V(k+1) )  will  have  the 
X(2)  < 
· · · 
distribution  of  the  sample  median  X(k+1) . 
Let’s  say  that  an  estimator  T  =  Tn  of  a  parameter  θ  is  asymptotically  normal  with 
asymptotic variance  σ 2 /n if the distribution of √n(Tn −θ) converges as  n  → ∞ to  N (0, σ 2). 
(a) If  Xj  are i.i.d.  N (µ, σ 2) then  what  is  the  asymptotic  variance  of  the  sample  mean  X 
as  an  estimator  of  µ?  (This  is  easy  and  involves  no  approximation.) 
(b) As n  → ∞ through  odd  values  only,  ﬁnd  the  asymptotic  variance  of  the  sample  median 
as  an  estimator  of  µ  for  normal  distributions. 
(Use  the  above  considerations  and  the 
delta-method.)  How  does  it  compare  with  that  of  the  sample  mean?

(c)  Consider  the  standard  Cauchy  density  f (x) =  π (1+x2 )  for  all  real  x  and  for  any  real 
m  and 0  < σ <  ∞ the Cauchy (m, σ ) density  fm,σ (x) =  σ−1 f ((x  − m)/σ ).  A  variable 
with  this  density  has  median  m.  If  Xj  are  i.i.d.  with  a  Cauchy  density,  then  the  sample 
mean  X  actually  has  the  same  distribution  as  Xj  for  each  n,  so  one  may  say  it  has  inﬁnite 
asymptotic  variance  as  an  estimator  of  the  true  median  m.  Find  the  asymptotic  variance 
of  the  sample  median by  the  same  method  as in part (b). 
5.  Consider the data on heat of  sublimation of iridium in Rice,  §10.9, Problem 26, but don’t 
do  any  part  of  the  problem  stated  in  Rice.  Instead  consider  each  row  of  9  observations  as 
a  separate  sample.  Here  are  the  rows,  rearranged  in  order: 
First  row  ordered:  136.6  145.2  151.5  159.1  159.8  160.1  160.8  162.7  173.9

Second  row  ordered:  159.2  159.3  159.5  159.6  160.2  160.3  160.4  160.6  161.1

Third  row  ordered:  159.5  159.5  159.5  159.6  159.7  160.0  160.0  160.1  160.2

(a) Find the sample mean, median and  variance for each  of  the three rows of 9  observations 
each. 
(b) Each row was tested for whether the 9  observations in it  are i.i.d. normal by the Shapiro-
Wilk  test  and  none  was rejected  at the 0.05 level.  But for the whole set  of 27  observations, 
the  hypothesis  that  they  are  i.i.d.  normal  was  strongly  rejected,  with  a  p-value  less  than 
4 10−7 .  This  suggests  that  either  the  means  or  the  variances  diﬀer  signiﬁcantly  between 
· samples.  Which  seem  to  diﬀer  more  strongly?  Do  a  test  for  that.  Hint:  the  answer  may 
not be the same as if  one were asked in advance to test for whether the means are diﬀerent, 
or  the  variances  are  diﬀerent;  the  choice  aﬀects  the  Bonferroni  correction. 
(c) For  each  row,  ﬁnd  the  M AD  (median  absolute  deviation) and  the  I QR  (interquartile 
range).  The  I QR/1.35  and  the  M AD/0.675  are  normalized  to  estimate  the  sample  stan­
dard deviation (square  root  of  sample  variance)  for  normally distributed data.  How  well 
do  the  three  quantities  agree? 
(d) Would  the  Kruskal-Wallis  nonparametric  test  be  a  good  one  to  use  to  detect  possible 
diﬀerences  between  the  distributions  of  the  three  rows?  Why,  or  why  not?  There  is  no 
need  to  do  the  test,  but  take  account  of  what  kind  of  diﬀerences  the  Kruskal-Wallis  test 
detects.
