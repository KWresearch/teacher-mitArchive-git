18.443 Problem Set 10 

1.  A  statistic  X  is  measured  in  a  medical  test.  Suppose  that  for  a  certain  disease,  D, 
the hypothesis  H0  is  that  the  person  being  tested  does  not  have  D  and  in  that  case  the 
distribution  of  X  is  N (3, 1).  The  alternative  hypothesis  H1  is that the person does have 
D, although  they  may  not have any  symptoms yet.  Under  H1 ,  X  has distribution  N (5, 1). 
(a) Show  that  for  any  c,  X  ≥  c  is  a  best  critical  region  for  testing  H0  vs.  H1 , in the 
sense that it has largest power for given  size (recall  the Neyman-Pearson lemma). 
(b) Suppose  it  costs  $40  each  time  X  is  measured  for  one  patient.  Suppose  this  will 
be done for people in a  “risk group”  in which  a  priori, the probability  of having  D  is 0.08. 
If  the  test is positive (H0  is  rejected),  a  test  based  on  a  diﬀerent  statistic  costing  $1000 
will be done which will give a correct  result in essentially  all  cases.  If the original $40  test 
is  negative  (H0  is  not  rejected)  then  no  further  test  or  treatment  will  be  done.  In  that 
case,  if  a  patient  has  D,  assume  a  loss  of  $1,000,000.  How  should  c  be  chosen  to  minimize 
the  expected  loss? 
(c)  In  a  general  population  where  the  a  priori  probability  of  having  D  is 10−5 , is it 
cost-eﬀective  to  do  any  such  test  procedure  (for  any  c)?  Hint:  would  it  be,  even  if  an 
initial  $40  test  always  gave  the  correct  result? 

2.  Suppose  Xj  are  i.i.d.  with  distribution  U [0, 1]  under  H0  and  U [0.2, 1.2]  under  H1 . Each 
observation  costs  $4  to  make.  The  prior  probabilities  are  p0  =  p1  = 1/2.  Choosing  the 
wrong  Hj  will  cost  $50. 
(a) Is   it  better  to  ﬂip  a  coin  to  choose  an  Hj  without  observations  or  to  take  observa­
tions  until  H0  or  H1  can  be  conﬁrmed  as  correct? 
(b) What is the probability, under H0  or  H1 , that  after 20  observations, we still  cannot 
conﬁrm  which  hypothesis  is  true? 

3.  If  a  binomial  probability  p  has  a  beta(a, b)  prior  and  X  successes  are  observed  in  n

trials,  what  is  the  Bayes  estimate  of  the  function  g (p) =  p2 ?  Recall  that  for  n  =  2,  we

found  early  on that  unbiased  estimation gave a strange answer  when  X  = 1.  For the  U [0, 1]

prior  and  n  = 2,  what  are  the  Bayes  estimates  of  p2  for  X  = 0, 1,  and  2?


4.  It  was  stated  without  proof  in  PS9  that  a  standard   Cauchy  distribution  is  the  same  as

a  t1  distribution (t  distribution  with  one  degree  of  freedom).  Show  this  in  two  stages:

(a) If Y  and  Z  are i.i.d.  N (0, 1), show that  Y /Z  has  a  standard   Cauchy  distribution.  Hint:

Y /Z  ≤  x  is  equivalent  to  Y  ≤  xZ  if  Z >  0  but  not  if  Z <  0.  Consider  two  cases.

(b) Do the same for Y /|Z | (as a corollary of part (a)) and  relate this to the  t1  distribution.


5.  Show  that  each  of  the  following  parametric  families  is  exponential,  and  give  explicit

representations  for  each.

(a) Gamma  family  Γ(a, λ), a >  0,  λ >  0;

(b) Beta  family  beta(a, b), a >  0,  b >  0;

(c) Geometric family, geometric (p), 0 < p  <  1.
