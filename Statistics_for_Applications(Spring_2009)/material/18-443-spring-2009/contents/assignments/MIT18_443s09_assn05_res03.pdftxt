A  LIKELIHOOD  RATIO  TEST  FOR  NESTED  COMPOSITE  HYPOTHESES: 

WILKS’S  THEOREM 

Suppose we have a family  of probability density  or  mass functions  f (x, θ) >  0 depend­
ing  on  a  d-dimensional parameter  θ .  It  will  be  assumed  that  there  are  partial  derivatives 
through  second  order,  ∂ log f (x, θ)/∂ θi  and  ∂ 2  log f (x, θ)/∂ θi∂ θj  for  i, j  = 1, ..., d,  such 
that  the  d ×  d  matrix of  second partials (“Hessian”)  is a non-singular  matrix for almost 
all  x.  This  will  assure  that  the  parameter  vector  is  truly  d-dimensional.  For  example,  we 
could  have  the  family  of  all  normal  distributions  N (µ, σ 2 ),  with  d  =  2.  Let  H1  be  the 
set  of  possible  parameters  θ .  In  the  normal  case,  µ  can  be  any  real  number,  and  σ  or  σ 2 
any  number  >  0.  Let  H0  be  an  m-dimensional  subset  of  H1  for  some  m < d.  It  will  be 
assumed  that  H0  is  “smooth”  in  the  sense  that  at  any  point  of  H0 ,  we  can  select  m  of 
the parameters,  say  for  example  θ1 , ..., θm,  for  which  the  other  d − m  parameters   are  twice 
diﬀerentiable  functions  of  θ1 , ..., θm.  For  example,  H0  could  be  the  intersection  with  H1  of 
an  m-dimensional  ﬂat  hyperplane. 
Assume  that  observations  X1 , . . . , Xn  are  i.i.d.  with  density  f (x, θ) for  some  θ  ∈  Θ. 
We  want  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  θ  ∈  H0 .  Let  L(θ) = Πn
j=1f (Xj , θ) be  the  likelihood 
function.  Let  M Ld  be  the  maximum  of  the  likelihood  for  θ  in  H1 ,  in  other  words  M Ld  = 
L(θˆd )  where  θˆd  is  the  MLE  of  θ  in  H1 ,  provided  it  exists.  Let  M Lm  be,  likewise,  the 
maximum  of  the  likelihood  for  θ  in  H0 .  Then  M Lm  ≤  M Ld  because  H0  ⊂  H1 .  Let  Λ  be 
the  likelihood  ratio, Λ  =  M Lm/M Ld ,  so  that  0  <  Λ  ≤  1. 
S. S. Wilks in 1938 proposed the following  test: let  W  =  −2 log Λ, so that 0  ≤  W <  ∞. 
Wilks  found  that  if  the  hypothesis  H0  is  true,  then  the  distribution  of  W  converges  as 
n  → ∞  to  a  χ2  distribution  with  d  −  m  degrees  of  freedom,   not  depending  on  the  true 
2 
θ  =  θ0  ∈  H0 .  Thus,  H0  would  be  rejected  if  W  is too large in terms  of  the tabulated  χd
−m 
distribution. 
The  likelihood  ratio  test  of  a  multinomial  hypothesis  for  k  categories (Rice, Section 
9.6)  is  a  special  case  of  Wilks’s  test  with  d  =  k − 1. 
The  fact  that  Wilks’s  statistic  has  the  given  asymptotic  distribution  if  H0  is  true  is 
called Wilks’s theorem.  It holds under some hypotheses, not  all  of which have been stated, 
but  which  are  given  in  references  as  indicated  in  the  Notes. 

NOTES 

Wilks  ﬁrst published his theorem in a paper, Wilks (1938), then gave an exposition 
of it in his book, Wilks (1962,  §13.8).  Chernoﬀ (1954)  gave another proof.  Van der Vaart 
(1998,  Chapter 16)  gives  a  more  recent  exposition.  The Notes by  van der Vaart (1998, 
p.  240)  suggest  that  Wilks’s  original  proof  was  not  rigorous.  The  proof  in  the  1962  book 
seems  rather long.  A proof is given in Dudley (2003), Section 3.9.
