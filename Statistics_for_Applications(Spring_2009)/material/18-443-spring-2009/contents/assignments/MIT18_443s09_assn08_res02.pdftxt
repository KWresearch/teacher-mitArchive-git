QUANTILES AND SAMPLE QUANTILES 

Let  X  be a  real  random variable with distribution function  F ,  so  that  F (x) =  P (X  ≤ 
x)  for  all  x.  Let  0  < p  <  1.  Then  a  number  x  is  called  a  pth  quantile  of  F ,  or  of  X , if 
F (x) =  p,  or  more  generally  if  F (x)  ≥  p  and  P (X  ≥  x)  ≥  1  −  p.  The  deﬁnition  with 
F (x) =  p  applies to all  continuous distributions.  The  more general deﬁnition is needed for 
discrete  distributions  where  there  may  be  no  x  with  F (x) =  p. 
If  a  pth quantile  x  is  uniquely  determined,  as  it  is  if  F 
is  strictly  increasing  in  a 
neighborhood  of  x,  it  is  called  the  pth  quantile  of  F  or  X  and  can  be  written  as  xp .  For 
a  lot  of  distributions  used  in  statistics  such  as  χ2  and  F  distributions,  speciﬁc  quantiles 
are   tabulated  such  as  the  0.95, 0.975,  and  0.99 quantiles.  If  F  is  continuous  and  is  strictly 
increasing  on  the  interval  J  (possibly  a  half-line  or  the  whole  line)  of  x  for  which  0  < 
F (x)  <  1,  then  F  has  an  inverse  F −1  from (0, 1)  onto  J ,  such  that  F −1 (p) =  xp  for 
0  < p  <  1. 
A  median  is  a  1/2 quantile.  If  it  is  not  unique,  there  is  an  interval  of  medians  and  the 
median  is  deﬁned  as  the  midpoint  of  this  interval. 
Now  let’s  consider  how  to  deﬁne  pth quantiles  ξp  of  a  ﬁnite  sample  X1 , ..., Xn. A 
rough  deﬁnition  is  that  a  fraction  p  of  the  observations  should be less than (or  equal)  ξp 
and  a  fraction  1  −  p  should be larger  than (or  equal  to)  ξp .  If  np  is  not  an  integer  then 
we  seem  to  be  talking  about  a  non-integer  count  of  number  of  observations  which  is  not 
well-deﬁned. 
There  is  a  generally  agreed-on  deﬁnition  of  the  1/2  sample  quantile,  the  sample  me­
dian,  namely  if  n  = 2k + 1  odd,  it’s  the  middle  order  statistic  X(k+1) .  If  n  = 2k  even, then 
it’s (X(k) +X(k+1) )/2.  But it seems that for  p 6
1/2 there is no such  agreed deﬁnition.  The 
= 
next  most  often  mentioned  quantiles  for  ﬁnite  samples  are  the  quartiles,  where  p  = 1/4 
(lower  quartile)  and  p  = 3/4 (upper  quartile).  Possible  summary   statistics  for  a  class’s 
exam  scores  are  to  give  the  median  and  the  upper  and  lower  quartiles. 
Other  quantiles  sometimes  mentioned  are  percentiles,  often  used  about  scores  for  an 
individual  on  a  standardized  exam.  The  pth quantile is the  same  as the 100pth percentile. 
I looked at  several  statistics books searching for precise deﬁnitions of  sample quantiles. 
Many books have no words beginning with q in their sub ject indices.  Other books including 
the Randles and Wolfe nonparametrics book (now out of print)  mention quantiles only  for 
probability  distributions,  not  for  samples. 
= 
1/2  in  four  books.  The 
I  found  precise  deﬁnitions  of  sample  pth quantiles for  p 
four  deﬁnitions  were  all  diﬀerent.  I  will  list  them.   Notice  that  from  the  rough  deﬁnition, 
we’d  expect  ξp  to  be  something  like  X(np) , but  np  is  often  not  an  integer.   To  formulate 
the  deﬁnitions,  here  is  some  notation.  Let  ⌊x⌋, the integer part   of  x, be the largest integer 
≤  x.  Let  {x},  the  fractional  part  of  x, be  x  − ⌊x⌋.  Let  ⌈x⌉  be  the  smallest  integer  ≥  x. 
Let  r(x) be  x  rounded  to  the  nearest  integer,  rounded  up  if  {x} = 1/2. 
Here  are  the  deﬁnitions  in  alphabetical  order  by  ﬁrst  author  of  the  textbook.  The  pth 
quantile  of  a  sample  of  n  numbers  with  order  statistics  X(1)  ≤  ...  ≤  X(n)  is: 

1.  X(r(np))  if  p <  1/2,  X(n+1−r(n(1−p)))  if  p >  1/2,  the  sample  median  if  p = 1/2 (Casella 
and Berger,  Statistical  Inference, 1990).

2.  X(⌊(n+1)p⌋) + {(n + 1)p}  X(⌈(n+1)p⌉)  − X(⌊(n+1)p⌋)  :  R.  Hogg  and  E.  Tanis,  Probability 
�

and  Statistical  Inference, Sixth Ed. 

3.  X(⌈np⌉)  if  np  is  not  an integer,  or if it is, (X(np)  +  X(np+1) )/2:  R.  A.  Johnson,  Mil ler 
and  Freund’s  Probability  and  Statistics  for  Engineers  5th  ed.,  1994. 

4.  X(r((n+1)p)) ,  given  for  p  = 1/4  or 3/4  (would  be  undeﬁned  if  (n  + 1)p <  1/2  or  ≥ 
n+(1/2)); if (n+1)p is a half-integer, “round  up;”  j th percentile, deﬁned  as  X(r((n+1)j/100)) , 
presumably for j = 1, ...,  99 (would be undeﬁned if (n + 1)j /100  <  1/2, speciﬁcally if  j = 1, 
n  ≤  48,  or if (n  + 1)j /100  ≥  n  + (1/2),  speciﬁcally  if  n  ≤  49,  j  =  99):  Mendenhall  and 
Sincich,  Statistics  for  Engineering  and  the  Sciences  5th  ed.,  2007,  p.  39. 

Some  of  the  apparent  complexity  of  some  deﬁnitions  is  motivated  by  a  consideration 
of  symmetry: if  all  Xi  are replaced by  −Xi , reversing  the order of  the order statistics while 
also  changing  their  signs,  one  would  like  ξp  for  the  −Xi  to be  −ξ1−p  for  the  Xi .  This  is 
not  true  for  all  deﬁnitions,  however. 
As there  seems to be  no generally  agreed deﬁnition  of  sample quantiles  except for the 
sample  median,  none  will  be  proposed  in  this  course  other  than  for  the  sample  median.
