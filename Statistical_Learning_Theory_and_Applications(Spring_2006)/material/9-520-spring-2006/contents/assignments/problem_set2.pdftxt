Pr.  2.1  Consider the following one dimensional RBF interpolation (ie λ = 0 in the regularization 
network  formulation)  scheme:

ciK (x − xi ), 
i=1 

f (x) =

with K (x) =  |x|  and  (cid:2) = 3. 

1.  Compute  the  coeﬃcients  ci ,  i = 1, 2, 3,  in  such  a  way  that  the  following  interpolation 
conditions  are  satisﬁed: 

f (0) = 1  , f (3) = 4  , f (4) = 3 

and  draw  the  corresponding  curve. 
2.	 Show  that, on the  interval  [0, 4], the Radial Basis Functions  expansion  (1) can be also

written  in  the  form 
yibi (x) 
i=1 
where  the  yi  are  the  values  to  be  interpolated  (y1  = 1,  y2  = 4,  and  y3  =  3).  Derive 
and  draw  the  explicit  form  for  the  dual  kernels  bi(x).

Pr.  2.3  Prove  that  the  solution  to  equation  (2)  has  stability  of  order  1 
(cid:1) .  Is  this  always  the  case

1. 	 Show that S2  separates any three points not lying on the same line in IR2  in all possible 
ways; 
2.  Show  that  S2  cannot  separate  any  four  points  of  IR2  in  all  possible  ways. 
3.	 What  is  the  minimal  number  of  points  in  IR100000  that  cannot  be  separated  in  all 
possible  ways  by  S100000 ? 

Pr  2.5  Find  the  VC  dimension  of  conics  for  points  in  the  plane.  Is  there  any  diﬀerence  if  you 
restrict  the  set  to  one  type  of  conics  only  (ellipses,  parabolae,  and  hyperbolae)?  What 
happens  in  the  case  of  degenerate  conics?
