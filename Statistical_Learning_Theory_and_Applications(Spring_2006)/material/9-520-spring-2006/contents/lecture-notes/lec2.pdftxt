Lecture 2: The Learning Problem In 
Perspective  
Tomaso Poggio  

Description 
We introduce the problem of learning from sparse examples. We introduce key terms and 
concepts such as loss functions, empirical risk, true risk, generalization error, hypothesis 
spaces, approximation error and sample error. We introduce two key requirements on 
learning algorithms: stability and consistency. We then describe Tikhonov regularization 
-- which in our course is the algorithm with the magic.
