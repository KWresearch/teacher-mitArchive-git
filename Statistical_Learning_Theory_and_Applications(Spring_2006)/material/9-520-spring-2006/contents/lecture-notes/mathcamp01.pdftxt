Function   space


A  function  space 
is  a   space  made  of  functions.   Each 
function  in  the   space  can  be  thought  of   as  a   point.  Ex(cid:173)
amples: 

1.  C [a,  b],  the  set  of  all   real-valued  continuous  functions 
in  the   interval  [a,  b]; 

2.  L1[a,  b],  the  set  of  all  real-valued  functions  whose  ab(cid:173)
solute  value  is  integrable   in  the   interval  [a,  b]; 

3.  L2[a,  b],  the  set  of  all  real-valued  functions  square  inte(cid:173)
grable  in  the  interval   [a,  b] 

Note   that  the  functions 
continuous! 

in  2  and  3   are  not  necessarily 

Metric  space


By  a  metric  space  is  meant  a   pair  (X, ρ)  consisting  of  a 
space  X  and  a  distance  ρ,  a  single-valued,  nonnegative, 
real  function  ρ(x,   y)  deﬁned   for  all  x,  y  ∈  X  which  has  the 
following  three  properties: 

1.  ρ(x,  y)  = 0  iﬀ   x  =  y ; 

2.  ρ(x,  y) =  ρ(y , x); 

3.  Triangle   inequality:  ρ(x,  z)  ≤  ρ(x,  y) +  ρ(y , z)


Examples


1.  The  set  of  all  real  numbers  with  distance


ρ(x,  y) =  |x  −  y |


is  the  metric  space  IR1.


2.  The  set  of  all   ordered  n-tuples


x  = (x1, ...,   xn)


of  real  numbers  with  distance

with  distance 

ρ(f1(x), f2(x)) =

is  the  metric  space   L2(IR).

ρ(p1(x), p2(x)) 

�=  ρ(p2(x), p1(x)). 

Dense


A  point  x  ∈  IR  is   called  a   contact   point  of  a  set  A  ∈  IR  if 
every  ball  centered  at  x  contains  at  least   one  point  of  A.  
The  set  of  all  contact  points  of  a  set  A  denoted  by  ¯A  is 
called  the  closure  of  A. 

Let  A  and  B  be  subspaces  of  a  metric  space  IR.   A  is  said 
to  be  dense  in  B  if  B  ⊂  ¯A. 
In  particular  A  is  said   to  be 
everywhere  dense   in  IR  if  ¯ =  R.
A


Examples


1.  The  set  of  all   rational  points   is   dense  in  the   real  line.


2.  The  set  of  all   polynomials  with   rational  coeﬃcients  is 
dense  in   C [a,  b]. 

3.  The  RKHS  induced   by  the  gaussian  kernel  on  [a,  b]  in 
dense  in  L2[a,  b] 

Note:  A  hypothesis  space  that   is  dense  in  L2  is  a  desired 
property   of  any  approximation  scheme.  

Linear  space


A  set  L  of  elements  x,  y , z , ...  is  a  linear  space  if  the  fol(cid:173)
lowing  three   axioms  are  satisﬁed: 

1.  Any  two  elements  x,  y  ∈  L  uniquely  determine   a   third 
element  in  x  +  y  ∈  L  called  the  sum  of  x  and  y  such 
that 
(a)  x  +  y  =  y  +  x  (commutativity)  
(b)  (x  +  y) +  z  =  x  +  (y  +  z)  (associativity) 

(c) An  element  0  ∈  L  exists  for  which  x  +  0  =  x  for  all 
x  ∈  L 
(d)  For  every  x  ∈  L  there  exists  an   element   −x  ∈  L 
with   the  property  x  +  (−x)  = 0 

2.  Any  number  α  and  any   element  x  ∈  L  uniquely  deter(cid:173)
mine  an  element  αx  ∈  L  called  the  product  such  that 
(a)  α(βx) =  β (αx)

(b) 1x  =  x 

3.  Addition  and  multiplication  follow  two  distributive  laws 
(a)(α  +  β )x  =  αx  +  βx 
(b)α(x   +  y) =  αx  +  αy 

Linear  functional


A  functional,  F ,  is  a  function  that  maps  another  function 
to  a  real-value  

F  :  f  →  IR. 


A  linear  functional   deﬁned   on  a  linear  space  L,  satisﬁes  the  
following  two   properties 

1.  Additive:  F (f  +  g) =  F (f ) +  F (g) for  all  f , g  ∈  L


2.  Homogeneous:  F (αf ) =  αF (f ) 

Examples


1.  Let  IRn  be  a  real   n-space  with  elements  x  = (x1, ...,  xn),  
and  a  = (a1, ...,  an) be  a  ﬁxed  element  in   IRn .  Then 
n 
 
�
i=1 

F (x) =

is   a  linear  functional 

2.  The  integral  

F [f (x)]  = 

is   a  linear  functional  

  b 

�
a 

f (x)p(x)dx 

3.  Evaluation  functional:  another  linear  functional  is  the


Dirac   delta  function


δt[f (·)]  =  f (t).


Which  can  be  written


δt[f (·)]  = 

  b 

�
a 

f (x)δ(x   −  t)dx. 

4.  Evaluation  functional:  a  positive  deﬁnite   kernel 
RKHS 

in  a  

Ft[f (·)]  = (Kt,  f ) =  f (t). 

This   is  simply  the  reproducing  property   of  the  RKHS.  

Normed  space


A  normed   space  is  a   linear   (vector)   space  N 
in   which  a 
norm  is  deﬁned.  A  nonnegative  function  � · � is  a  norm  iﬀ 
∀f , g  ∈ N  and  α  ∈ IR 

1.  �f � ≥ 0  and   �f � = 0  iﬀ   f  = 0;


2.  �f  +  g� ≤ �f � +  �g�; 

3.  �αf � =  |α| �f �. 

Note,  if  all  conditions  are  satisﬁed  except   �f � = 0  iﬀ  f  = 0 
then  the  space  has   a  seminorm  instead  of  a  norm.  

Measuring  distances  in  a  normed  space


In  a  normed   space  N ,  the  distance  ρ  between  f  and  g ,  or 
a  metric,  can  be  deﬁned  as  

ρ(f , g) =  �g −  f �.


Note   that  ∀f , g , h  ∈  N 

1.  ρ(f , g)  = 0  iﬀ   f  =  g . 

2.  ρ(f , g) =   ρ(g , f ). 

3.  ρ(f , h)  ≤  ρ(f , g) +  ρ(g , h).


Example:  continuous  functions


A  norm  in  C [a, b]  can  be   established  by  deﬁning 

�f �  =  max   |f (t)|. 
a≤t≤b 

The  distance   between  two   functions  is  then  measured  as


ρ(f , g)  =  max  |g(t) −  f (t)|.

a≤t≤b 

With  this   metric,   C [a, b] is  denoted  as  C .

and  L2  respectively.

Euclidean  space


A  Euclidean  space  is  a  linear  (vector)  space  E  in  which  a 
dot  product  is  deﬁned.  A  real  valued  function   (·, ·) is  a  dot 
product  iﬀ  ∀f , g , h  ∈  E  and  α  ∈  IR 

1. (f , g )  = (g , f ); 

2. (f  +  g , h)  = (f , h∗) +   (g , h)  and  (αf , g ) =  α(f , g ); 

3. (f , f )  ≥  0  and  (f , f )  = 0  iﬀ  f  = 0. 

A  Euclidean  space   becomes  a  normed  linear  space   when 
equipped  with  the  norm  

 
�
�f �  = (f , f ).


Orthogonal  systems  and   bases


A  set  of  nonzero  vectors  {xα}  in  a  Euclidean  space  E 
said   to  be  an  orthogonal  system  if 

is 

(xα,  xβ )  = 0 

for  α 

�=  β 

and  an  orthonormal  system  if 

(xα,  xβ )  = 0 
(xα,  xβ )  = 1 

for  α 

�=  β 

for  α  =  β . 

An  orthogonal   system  {xα}  is  called  an   orthogonal  basis 
if  it  is  complete   (the  smallest   closed  subspace  containing 
{xα}  is   the  whole  space  E ).  A  complete  orthonormal   sys(cid:173)
tem  is  called  an  orthonormal   basis. 

Examples

y  = (y1, ...,   yn).  If  we  deﬁne  the  dot  product  as

Cauchy-Schwartz  inequality


Let  H  be  an  Euclidean  space.  Then  ∀f , g  ∈ H ,  it  holds 

|(f , g)| ≤ �f � �g� 

Sketch  of  the  proof.  The   case   f  ∝ g  is  trivial,   hence  let 
us  assume   the  opposite  is  true.  For  all  x  ∈ IR,  

0  <  (f  +  xg , f  +  xg) =  x 2  �g�2 +  2x  (f , g) +  �f � ,

since  the  quadratic   polynomial   of  x  above  has  no  zeroes, 
the  discriminant  Δ   must  be  negative 

0  >  Δ/4  = (f , g)2  − �f �2  �g� .

Separable


A  metric  space  is  said   to   be  separable  if  it  has  a  countable 
everywhere  dense   subset. 

Examples:


1.  The  spaces  IR1,  IRn ,  L2[a,  b],  and  C [a,  b]  are  all  separa(cid:173)
ble. 

2.  The  set   of  real  numbers  is  separable   since   the   set  of 
rational  numbers   is  a  countable  subset   of  the   reals  and 
the  set   of  rationals  is  is  everywhere  dense. 

Completeness


A  sequence  of  functions   fn  is  fundamental  if  ∀�  >  0  ∃N� 
such  that 

∀n  and  m  >  N�,  ρ(fn,  fm)  <  �. 

A  metric  space   is  complete  if  all  fundamental  sequences 
converge  to  a  point   in  the  space. 

C ,  L1,  and   L2  are  complete.  That   C2 
is  not   complete, 
instead,  can  be  seen  through  a  counterexample.

Completion   of  a   metric  space


Given  a  metric  space   IR   with  closure  ¯IR,   a   complete  metric 
∗
∗ 
space  IR is  called  a   completion   of  IR  
if  IR  ⊂  IR and 
∗
¯
IR  = IR .


Examples


1.  The  space  of  real  numbers 
space  of  rational   numbers. 

is  the   completion  of  the 

2.  L2 is   the   completion   of  the  functional  space  C2. 

Hilbert  space


A  Hilbert  space  is  a  Euclidean  space  that  is  complete,

separable,  and   generally  inﬁnite-dimensional.


A  Hilbert  space  is  a   set   H  of  elements  f , g , ...  for  which


1.  H  is   a  Euclidean  space   equipped  with  a  scalar  product 


2.  H  is   complete  with  respect   to  metric  ρ(f , g) =  �f  −  g�


3.  H  is   separable  (contains  a  countable  everywhere  dense  
subset) 

4. (generally)  H  is  inﬁnite-dimensional.  

l2  and  L2  are   examples  of  Hilbert   spaces. 

Evaluation  functionals


A  linear  evaluation   functional  is  a  linear  functional  Ft  that 
evaluates  each  function  in  the  space   at   the   point   t,  or 

Ft[f ] =  f (t) 

Ft[f  +  g ] =  f (t) +  g(t). 

The  functional   is  bounded   if  there   exists  a  M  s.t.  

|Ft[f ]|  =  |f (t)| ≤  M �f �H il  ∀t 

for  all  f  where   �  · �H il  is  the  norm  in  the  Hilbert  space.  

Evaluation  functionals  in  Hilbert  space


The  evaluation  functional  is  not   bounded  in  the  familiar 
Hilbert  space   L2([0,  1]),  no  such  M  exists  and  in  fact  ele(cid:173)
ments   of  L2([0,  1])  are  not  even   deﬁned  pointwise.

Riesz  Representation  Theorem


For   every   bounded  linear  functional  F  on  a  Hilbert  space 
H,  there  is  a  unique  v  ∈ H such   that 

F [x]  = (x,  v)H, 

∀x  ∈ H 

Convex   sets


A  set  X  ∈  IRn  is  convex  if 

∀x1,  x2  ∈  X,  ∀λ   ∈  [0,  1],  λx1 +  (1  −  λ)x2  ∈  X. 

A  set  is  convex  if,  given   any  two   points  in  the  set,   the   line  
segment  connecting  them  lies   entirely  inside  the  set.

A  function  f  :  IRn  →  IR  is   convex   if:  

For  any  x1  and  x2 in  the  domain  of  f ,  for  any  λ  ∈  [0,  1],  

f (λx1 +  (1  −  λ)x2)  ≤  λf (x1) +  (1   −  λ)f (x2).

Why  We   Like  Convex  Functions


Unconstrained  convex  functions   (convex   functions  where 
is  all  of  IRn)  are   easy   to  minimize.   Convex 
the  domain 
functions   are   diﬀerentiable  almost  everywhere.  Directional 
derivatives  always  exist.  If  we   cannot  improve  our  solution  
by  moving  locally,  we  are   at  the   optimum.  
If  we  cannot  
ﬁnd   a  direction  that   improves  our   solution,  we  are  at   the  
optimum. 

Why  We  Like   Convex   Sets


Convex   functions  over   convex  sets  (a  convex  domain)   are 
also   easy  to  minimize.  If  the  set   and  the  functions  are  both 
convex,  if  we  cannot  ﬁnd  a  direction  which  we   are  able  to

Existence   and   uniqueness  of  minimum


Let  f  :  IRn  →  IR  be  a  strictly   convex  function.  

The  function   f  is  said  to  be  coercive  if 

lim 
�x�→+∞  

f (x)  = +∞. 

Strictly  convex  and  coercive  functions  have  exactly   one  
local  (global)  minimum. 

Local  condition  on   the  minimum


If  the  convex   function  f  is  diﬀerentiable,  its  gradient  �f  is 
null  on  the  minimum  x0. 

Even 
if  the  gradient  does  not  exist,   the  subgradient  ∂ f 
always   exists. 

The  subgradient   of  f  in  x  is  deﬁned  by


∂ f (x) =  {w  ∈ IRn|∀x � ∈ IRn,  f (x  )  ≥ f (x) +  w  · (x  � − x)}, 
�

On  the  minimum  x0,  it  holds  

0  ∈ ∂ f (x0), 

Lagrange  multiplier’s   technique


Lagrange  multiplier’s  technique  allows  the  reduction  of the 
constrained  minimization  problem 

I (x)

Minimize 
subject  to  Φ(x)  ≤  m 

(for   some  m) 


to  the  unconstrained  minimization  problem 

Minimize  J (x) =  I (x) +  λΦ(x)  

(for  some  λ  ≥  0)  

Geometric   intuition


The  fact  that  �I  does  not  vanish  in  the  interior  of  the

domain  implies  that  the  constrained  minimum   ¯x
 must  lie  
on  the  domain’s   boundary  (the  
level  curve   Φ(x) =  m).

Therefore,  at  the   point   ¯x
 the   component  of  �I  along   the

tangent  to  the  curve   Φ  =  m  vanishes. 


But  since  the   tangent  to   Φ  =  m  is  orthogonal  to  �Φ,   we 

have   that  at  the  point  
,  �Φ  and  �I  are  parallel,   or

Geometric  intuition  (Cont) 


We  thus   introduce   a  parameter   λ  ≥  0,   called   Lagrange 
multiplier,  and  consider  the  problem   of  ﬁnding  the  uncon(cid:173)
strained  minimum  xλ  of 

J (x) =  I (x) +  λΦ(x)  

as  a  function  of  λ. 

By  setting  �J  =  0,  we  actually   look  for  the  points  where 
�I  and  �Φ  are   parallel.   The  idea  is  to   ﬁnd   all  such  points 
and  then  check  which  of  them  lie  on   the  curve  Φ  =  m.
