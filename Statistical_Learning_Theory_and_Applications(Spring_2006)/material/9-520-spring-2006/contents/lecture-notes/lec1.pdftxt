Lecture 1: The Course at a Glance 
Tomaso Poggio 

Description 
We introduce and motivate the main theme of the course, setting the problem of learning 
from examples as the problem of approximating a multivariate function from sparse data. 
We present an overview of the theoretical part of the course and sketch the connection 
between classical Regularization Theory and its algorithms -- including Support Vector 
Machines -- and Learning Theory, the two cornerstones of the course. We mention 
theoretical developments during the last few months that provide a new perspective on 
the foundations of the theory. We briefly describe several different applications ranging 
from vision to computer graphics, to finance and neuroscience.
