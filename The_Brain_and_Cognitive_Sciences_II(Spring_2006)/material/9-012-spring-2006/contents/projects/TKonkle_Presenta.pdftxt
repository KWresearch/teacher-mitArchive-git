Visual Image

what you get when you recall a vision-related 
experience from long term memory

Visual Imagery

the processes involved in generating, examining, 
and manipulating recalled visual images

(Palmer, Vision Science)
the representation of perceptual information in the 
absence of visual input

(Laeng, 2002)

resembles perceptual experience, but which occurs in the 
absence of the appropriate stimuli for the relevant 
perception 
(Plessinger)

Your intuitions…

is it the same as daydreaming?

guided imagery = directed daydreaming

is it the same as visual memory?

process/product distinction ?

can it be concurrent with vision?
some studies show people have 
BETTER imagery when their eyes are 
open and getting light. But, now how 
do we define it?

Why is Visual Imagery important to study?

intuitive appeals:

cognitive insights:

- imagery a pervasive phenomena

- we use it to reason and solve 
problems, especially when 
things are no longer present in 
our visual environment

- it can tell us something about 
the format of our representation
of the world

Mental Rotation

Shepard and Metzler, 1971

Shepherd and Cooper, 
1982
-different stimuli (letters, 
polygons), 
-continuous path of 
internal representations 
(not just a longer time to 
compute a larger 
transformations)

Bundesen and Larson 
(1975)
- zooming also is 
continuous

General Methods

Usually the tests are in the form…

Recall

Probe

something from memory with which you’re already familiar
something you just saw immediately before
something you saw a previous from amongst a bunch of things

detect something in your mental image
manipulate your mental image (rotation, zoom)

Measure

speed of response
accuracy of memory

Image Size

Kosslyn, 1975

Imagine: an elephant next to a duck
Ask:
“is there a beak?”

The Logic: if there is a pictorial representation in your head and you 
are using the image, than it should take you longer to answer if the 
part is small vs if it is large.

The result: Reaction times when a goose was with elephant than 
when goose was with a fly.

Proof of the Logic: Imagine a fly as big as an elephant. 
The RT effect goes away.

Great Debate 2:

What is the Relationship between Perception and 
Imagery in the Brain?

Operative Definition: What’s left when you close your eyes…

But: Introspectively, it seems that we can have imagery with our eyes open…

The question:

When you imagine a scene, do you 
activate the same neural circuitry as 
when you regard that scene with your 
eyes?

The answer:
(as you expected)

Yes and No.

Some evidence that says YES…

Adaptation and Imagery

Gilden and Hurst, 1995

Insights from the Clinical Neuropsychology

Color:

Patient has selective deficits to perceiving AND imagining color. 
Farah (1988)  Interestingly, she can sort objects according to color but cannot name colors or point 
to a named color.  She also cannot answer questions about the colors of objects (she knew that a banana 
was a fruit but not that it was yellow).

Mr. I – an artist who suffered achromatopsia after a stroke. After 1 year his 
memory for colors started to “slip away”

What-Where 
Deficits parallel the 
perceptual streams:

bilateral temporal lobe and 
left-occipital lesions

elephant has a long neck

can draw a floor plan 
of his house

what

where

bilateral parietal-occipital 
lesions

can describe an elephant

can’t describe how to 
navigate through his 
neighborhood

Insights from the Clinical Neuropsychology

Hemispatial neglect 
extends to mental 
imagery

Bisiach and Luzzati (1978)

Some evidence that says NO…

Dissociations between Perception and Imagery

Usually these patients have specific deficits to the kind of visual entity 
being probed:

Shapes:

can’t answer: “does the letter P have a curved 
segment?”, but can see letters just fine. no agnosia. 

Color:

achromatopsia, but can say which is redder, plum or 
eggplant

Faces:

prosopagnosic Bri can evoke from memory the faces of 
his family members; M.X. can not imagine faces, colors, 
forms, letters, and topographical relationships, but could 
recognize his wife and sons 

Spatial 
Imagery:

visual neglect in the absence of imaginal neglect
(Anderson, 1993; Coslett, 1997),
imaginal neglect without visual neglect
(Beschin et al., 1997; Coslett, 1997; Guariglia et al., 1993).

Reconciling the Perception/Imagery Debate:

- some of the neural implementation for imagery is the same as perception 
(adaptation nicely shows this in a neuron specific way, assuming you buy 
adaptation paradigms.)

- some of the neural implementation for imagery is different than for 
perception (clinical dissociation of someone with representational neglect
and normal perception)

some implications:

- imagery is at least constructed through perceptual experience, and 
requires perceptual experience to remain intact (Mr. I.) 

-memory for perceptual information is NOT independent of perceptual 
processing, because some of the hardware is shared (Spivey 2000)

Great Debate 3: Imagery in the Primary Sensory Areas?

Why is this question important?

If imagery can alter activation in early visual cortex, this 
indicates that our beliefs and expectations can modulate 
what we actually see during perception. (Kosslyn, 2000)

Kosslyn’s Meta-Analysis

DOES VISUAL IMAGERY ACTIVATE V1?

Yes: 
No: 

21 fmri, 11 pet, 2 SPECT 
3 frmi, 13 pet, 7 SPECT 

34
23

But…

A Problem for any fmri study: it’s unclear whether v1 activity is necessary 
for visual imagery, or mental images are represented in extra-straiate areas 
and back-activate v1.

Direct V1 manipulations suggest…

rTMS over v1 slows imagery judgments compared to sham stimulation.  The 
magnitide of this effect was similar when making perceptual judgements. 
(kosslyn 2001) 

Removal of Primary Visual Cortex leads to…

Reduced visual angle 
of mental imagery 
workspace

(Farah 2000)

Kosslyn’s Meta-Analysis.

Observation:

Mostly find activation if the task involved a high-resolution detail 
(shape of animal’s ears, comparing two stripe lengths). 

The Insight:

The activations caused by imagery goes down the stream as far as the 
task demands (based on, e.g. receptive field sizes).  

My summary:

When people say ‘visual imagery’, the kind of imagery, not just the sensory 
modality but the kind of information being queried, really matters.  

No clear answer about lesions to v1 and capacity for minute detail in visual 
imagery in that part of the field. 

Neural basis of lesions is so overlapped that it’s difficult to predict or isolate 
when you’ll have a dissociation between perceptual and imagery deficits or not. 

Other Types of Imagery…

auditory imagery:

Temporal Lobe Lesions can impair perception and imagery of melody.
(Zatorre and Halpern)Test: hear song and read lyrics and judge which 
pitch is higher for word a or word b. Or, imagine song and make same 
judgement.  The patients who were impaired with perceptual pitch 
discrimination were also impaired in the imagined pitch discrimination 
condition.  

Maintained Auditory Imagery activates auditory areas…
Listen to notes of a familiar song and then keep it going in your head. 
compare ‘keep it going’ to ‘listen’ and find similar activation in superior and 
inferior temporal cortex). Auditory imagery recruited STS and frontal lobe 
and SMA above and beyond.

Imaging during Auditory Hallucinations
(Griffiths) Auditory hallucinations also activate these same auditory 
cortex, plus basal ganglia cerebellum and inferior frontal. No evidence 
that A1 itself is activated during auditory imagery

Other Types of Imagery…

motor imagery:

Imagined movement activates same areas as actual movement:
You can compare activation from imagining that you are using your hand to 
rotate an shepard shape, or just rotating it ‘externally’, and see activation in 
contralateral M1.  

The primary motor cortex is functionally involved in imagery:
TMS over M1 650 ms after presentation of hand stimulus (to be rotated) 
delayes the response.  This doesn’t happen at other SOAs (temporally 
specific) and doesn’t happen with stimulus of feet (object –representation 
specific).  (Ganis et al.)

Generally accepted that visualization helps performance, 
(but not as much as actual practice)

though…

Putting Imagery: (Tayler and Shaw, 2002)
- golfers imagine made or missed puts
- missed-putt imagers did worse than no imagery at all!

Since then there’s been a hunt for the underlying  neural mechanisms …

Imagery, Perception, and Action

The last two studies demonstrate that:

Mental Images (Visual Represenations) include motor information 
from eye movements.  These are not ‘additional’ or ‘supplemental’
information but rather play a functional role in recall.

Motor commands are spontaneously generated even in the absence of 
explicitly requested imagery or required responses.

Some Conclusions …

1. Cognitive Architecture

Imagery experiments allows us to probe the 
forms of underlying mental representation.

(e.g. are objects represented as a collection 
of 2d images or as a 3d representation?)

Do you believe that the experiments of this 
kind can be conclusive? 

2. Neural Representation

There is a challenge to reconcile the existing data:

Much evidence shows the neural circuitry is largely 
shared, but there are many clinical cases where the 
perception-imagery equivalence fails.

Lesions are usually too crude and confounded to 
understand when and how imagery has selective deficits 
from perception and visa versa. Another method is 
needed.

3. Applications

Imagery can improve memory

Imagery can improve performance

Thus, exploring the capacities and limitations of 
imagery will be helpful for educational purposes

There is much to be researched regarding the effects of 
of non-visual imagery modalities and especially cross-
modal imagery

4.  Embodied Cognition

Imagery is nicely situated in the perception-action 
dynamic and, when taken within this framework, has the 
potential to illuminate new ways of thinking about visual 
perception (eye movements matter!)
