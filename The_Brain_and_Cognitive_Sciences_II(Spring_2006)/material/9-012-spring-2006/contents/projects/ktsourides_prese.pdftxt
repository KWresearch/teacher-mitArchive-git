Social cognition (cid:198) Moral 
judgment 
•Virtue (Latin virtus; Greek ἀρετή) is moral excellence of 
a man or a woman. 

A virtue is a character trait valued as being good. 
The conceptual opposite of virtue is vice.

………..What is good then?… Perhaps something  that 
leads to a ‘good result’ or at least beneficial for the one 
that possesses the virtue.
ie: Something that from an overall aspect will not lead to 
chaos, destruction, loss, sadness, lack of justice, death 
etc…
The idea of ‘beautiful’

According to Plato

Virtues are :
• Modesty :  {σωφροσύνη (sōphrosynē)}

•

•

Prudence (precaution) : {φρόνησις (phronēsis)}

Valiance : {ἀνδρεία (andreia)}

• (cid:198)Justice:  {δικαιοσύνη (dikaiosynē)} 

• Can be achieved only all together-not separate.
• There is not much talk about happiness as a self-sufficient state of the 
active individual; the emphasis is, rather, on problems and difficulties that 
need to be solved.
• Plato's moral ideals : the soul is to remain aloof from the pleasures of the 
body; communal life demands the subordination of individual wishes and 
aims. 

And Aristotle:

• Aristotle's ethics
• Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge, 
like epistemology or metaphysics but general knowledge.
It is a practical discipline rather than a theoretical one,
•
• He thought that in order to become "good," one could not simply 
study what virtue is; 
(cid:198)one must actually do virtuous deeds.
• Thus, a human's function is to do what makes it human, to be good 
at what sets it apart from everything else: the ability to reason. 
• Depending on how well people reason, Aristotle classified people as
Virtuous, Continent, Incontinent and Vicious.
• emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour 
(cid:198) what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another-
(cid:198) ( not a ‘rigid’ ethics code)

Evolution of morality during history

• Maybe not be considered always as “for the better ”
.(was never optimized rather was down/upgraded during 
times).
• Let’s see what people have said so far chronologically:
• Hebrew (Tanakh) containing (“Law”, “Prophets” and 
“Writings” rather than direct definitions of morality.
• Socrates(cid:198) Plato/Aristotle (~400 BC)
• Far East & Western Christianity, (~300 AC -1700+)
• Hume,Kant (1700+) 
• Russel,Wittgenstein, Moore.
• Today’s : Kohlberg,Gilligan,Chomsky, 
• Greene, Mckhail…

500 years after Plato…Evolution of virtues/morality 
through religion and civilization

• Western world example: 
Up to and medieval ages, virtues got ‘mutated’, took different forms according to the 
respective religion frame.
• Christian virtues: faith, hope, love
•
Later 7 virtues:
• Chastity (courage, opposes lust) —
•
Liberality (will, opposes greed) -Willingness to give. 
•
Abstinence (Latin, frenum) (self-control, opposes gluttony) 
• Diligence (ethics, opposes sloth) 
•
Patience
•
Kindness
• Humility (form of modesty)

•

Lots of the above interconnected variations dominate after 300 AC.

(cid:198)Philosophy was pretty much NOT a good sport…up to the 18th century (Renaissance)

Far East example

• Virtue in Chinese philosophies such as Confucianism and Taoism.
Chinese virtues include 
humanity,
filial piety, (religiousness/spirituality)
loyalty.
One’s social status should be the result of the amount of virtue that
one could demonstrate rather than by one's birth. 
Confucius stated that perfect virtue consists of the global practice of 
five things: 
gravity (credibility), 
generosity of soul, 
honesty, 
willingness, 
kindness.

Hume's  (empirical approach). 

•

Instead of telling us how morality ought to operate, 
he tells how we do actually make moral judgments.
• After various examples, he comes to the conclusion that 
most if not all of the behaviors we approve of increase 
public utility.
• Does this then mean that we make moral judgments on 
self-interest alone? –he says No.
• we are swayed by our sympathies for our fellow men
(emotions govern us)
• claims that we could never make moral judgments based 
on reason alone.
• only our natural sentiments can do this. 

Kant

• The first formulation (Formula of Universal Law) says: 
"Act as if the maxim of thy action were to become by thy 
will a universal law of nature." 
• The second formulation (Formula of Humanity) says: 
"Act that you use humanity, whether in your own person 
or in the person of any other, always at the same time as 
an end, never merely as a means." 
• The third formulation (Formula of Autonomy) is a 
synthesis of the first two. It says that we should so act 
that we may think of ourselves as legislating universal 
laws through our maxims, in a possible Kingdom of 
Ends. We may think of ourselves as such autonomous 
legislators only insofar as we follow our own laws.

Kant’s argument

we can assume three things:
•
Free will – We must have the free will to act 

•

Immortality – happiness will eventually reward us (in the afterlife) 

• God – there is a regulating being that will reward virtue with happiness. 

His argument is :
1) “If it is our unconditional duty to follow these moral laws, it must be our unconditional 
duty to aim for the goal of these laws, and so we seek to bring about the highest 
good. 
2)  Humans do not have enough power to bring about the highest good. Even with perfect 
morality, we cannot ensure the perfect happiness that should follow. 
3)  However, if we aim for the highest good, it must be possible to achieve it. If we are 
unable to attain this goal in our present life, there must be someone else to ensure 
we can attain it in a future life. 
4)  God has this necessary power, therefore we can assume the existence of God. “
Kant believes that this does not prove the existence of God, but our sense of morality 
•
implies the world is ordered in a moral way.

Moore’s (indefinability of “good”) / 
Russel
• Moore considered goodness to be a “simple undefinable, nonnatural property”
• Cannot be represented in terms of human desires (comfort, security, pleasure etc).

• Russel in his earlier years, along with Moore, he then believed that moral facts were 
objective, but only known through intuition, and that they were simple properties of 
objects.

•

•

•

These simple, undefinable moral properties cannot be analyzed using the non-moral 
properties with which they are associated. 

In time Russel agreed with Hume, who believed that ethical terms dealt with 
subjective values that cannot be verified in the same way that matters of fact are. 

This influenced the ‘logical positivists’: they said that ethical propositions, were 
essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of 
attidues and preferences. 

• Russell also writes that punishment is important only in an instrumental sense. Thus 
we should not punish someone solely for the sake of punishment.

Wittgenstein

• Wittgenstein argued that "problems“ such as Plato’s  were in fact 
pseudo-problems that arose from philosophers' misuse of language.
• Language has evolved as a way to cope with everyday problems, 
and it functions well within the context in which it has arisen,
"What time is it?"  vs "What is time?" 

•

• everyday language functions for the most part unproblematically and 
does not require correction by philosophers. 

•

In this manner, he aimed to demonstrate that the great questions
posed by philosophers had arisen because they were operating on a 
mistaken view of language and its relation to reality. 

• So the true philosopher becomes more like a therapist removing 
distress and confusion than someone who creates or discusses 
philosophical theories or positions.

Today’s idea of  Morality

• Moral reasoning is a study in psychology that overlaps 
with moral philosophy. Prominent figures include 
Lawrence Kohlberg, Carol Gilligan and John Reed.

• Although all moral choices can be seen as personal 
choice, some choices can be seen as an economic 
choice, or an ethical choice described by some ethical 
code or regulated by ethical relationships with others.

• This branch of psychology is concerned with how these 
issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the 
foundation of descriptive ethics.

Piaget(cid:198)Kohlberg-Giligan&Haidt (Chomsky)

• Kohlberg:Social intuitionism
Moral reasoning-Is the basis for ethical 
behavior-has developmental stages

• More sophisticated reasoning, should lead 
one to more consistent moral action, 
because one realizes that moral principles 
are prescriptive in nature and so demand 
action from the self

Kohlberg's six stages

• Were grouped into three levels: 
• pre-conventional, conventional, and post-
conventional. 
• {Following Piaget's constructivist requirements 
for a stage model, it is not possible to regress 
backward in stages (although none function at 
their highest stage at all times). It is also not 
possible to 'jump' stages; each stage provides a 
new yet necessary perspective, and is more 
comprehensive, differentiated, and integrated 
than its predecessors.}

Level 1 (Pre-Conventional)

–

Reasoners in the pre-conventional level judge the 
morality of an action by its direct  consequences.

– Common in children, although adults can also exhibit  this 
level of reasoning.

– Consists of two stages of moral development, and are 
purely concerned with the self (egocentric)
– 1. Obedience and punishment orientation 
– 2. Self-interest orientation

Level 2 (Conventional)

– Typical of adolescents and adults. 
– Persons who reason in a conventional way judge the morality of actions 
by comparing these actions to societal views and expectations. 

– 3. Interpersonal accord and conformity 
» (a.k.a. The good boy/good girl attitude)

– The self enters society by filling social roles.

– Individuals are receptive of approval or disapproval from other people 
as it reflects society's accordance with the perceived role. 
– may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in 
terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like 
respect, gratitude and the 'golden rule'. 
– Desire to maintain rules and authority exists only to further support 
these stereotypical social roles. 

Level 2

• 4. Authority and social-order maintaining orientation 
» (a.k.a. Law and order morality)
• In Stage four, it is important to obey actual laws, dictums
and social conventions in order to maintain a functioning 
society. 
• Moral reasoning in stage four is thus beyond the need for 
individual approval exhibited in stage three.
• Society must learn to transcend individual needs. 
• If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would - thus 
there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. 
When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; ***
• Culpability is a big factor in this stage and separates good 
from bad.

Level 3 (Post-Conventional)

– 5. Social contract orientation 
– 6. Universal ethical principles 
» (a.k.a. Principled conscience)

– Realization that individuals are separate entities from 
society now becomes salient. One's own perspective should 
be viewed before the society's is considered. (sometimes 
mistaken for pre-conventional behaviors.)
• In Stage five, realization of the individual’s uniqueness.
• Expectation of  respect and honor in an impartiall way.
• Issues that are not regarded as relative like life and choice should 
never be withheld or inhibited.
• No single choice is considered correct or absolute 
– 'who are you to judge if they are or not'?
• Laws are regarded as social contracts rather than rigid dictums. 
• Idea of ‘democracy’
is ostensibly based on stage five reasoning. 

Level 3

•

In Stage six, moral reasoning is based on abstract reasoning using 
universal ethical principles.
• Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice.
• Commitment to justice obligates us to disobey unjust laws.
• Rights are unnecessary as social contracts are not esential for deontic
moral action. 
• Decisions are met categorically in an absolute way rather than hypothetically
in a conditional way. 
• (cid:198)Imagine what one would do being in anyone's shoes, who imagined what 
anyone would do thinking the same.
• Action is never a means but always an end in itself;
• One acts because it is right, and not because it is instrumental, expected, 
legal or previously agreed upon. 
• People rarely if ever reach stage six of Kohlberg's model. 
• Later, Kohlberg saw the final stage as the manifestation of personal integrity 
in reasonable discourse. 
• Kohlberg speculated that a seventh stage may exist :
(Transcendental Morality or Morality of Cosmic Orientation) (religion etc..)

Critisism from Gilligan

• Kohlberg's theory emphasizes justice to the exclusion of other 
values.
• As a consequence of this, it may not adequately address the 
arguments of people who value other moral aspects of actions. ??
• Gilligan argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric.
• He used only male participants. He did not adequately describe the 
concerns of women. 
• She developed an alternative theory based on the ethics of caring.

The important value of Gilligan's theory is :
(cid:198)she ‘illustrates’ that theories on moral development do not need to 
solely focus on the value of justice.

•

(You think Gilligan is a bank teller?☺)

…

• Social intuitionists have challenged the 
assumption that moral action is primarily 
reached by formal reasoning. 
• They assume people often make moral 
judgments without weighing concerns such as 
fairness, law, human rights and abstract ethical 
values.
• If  true, Kohlberg’s and other rationalists 
arguments, indicate that moral reasoning is less 
relevant to moral action than it seems.

Haidt (2001)

• Was based on studies of "moral dumbfounding" where 
people have strong moral reactions but fail to establish 
any kind of rational principle to explain their reaction.
• He then disagrees that reasoning gives rise to moral 
action. Instead, he suggests, reasoning happens post 
hoc--after the moral decision has been made. 
•
‘brother and sister slept together’ example.
• Haidt suggests that we have unconsious, affective, 
moral heuristics that guide our reactions to morally 
charged situations and our moral behaviour, and that if 
we are asked to reason we do so only after we have 
made the decision.

Mikhail
• Proposes how to empirically investigate :

• Where do our moral intuitions come from? 
• Are they innate? 

• Does the brain contain a module specialized for 
moral judgment?

• Does the human genetic program contain 
instructions for the acquisition of a sense of 
justice or moral sense?

Mikhail-Theoretical Framework

• A central empirical question that divided 
the 17th and 18th century natural lawyers
from their critics: 
‘the nature and source of our intuitions of 
right and wrong’
• “Social norms” –explosion of interest

Mikhail-Theoretical Framework

• Existence of systematic neglect of theoretical 
linguistics by norms theorists.
• However:
comparison between rules of justice and rules of 
grammar is a traditional and plausible analogy.
• Chomsky’s revolution in linguistics has
transformed our understanding of human 
language and the workings of the human mind

Mikhail-Theoretical Framework

• (a) What constitutes moral knowledge?

{“A particular generative moral grammar or theory of moral 
competence: 
a theory of the mind/brain of a person who possesses a system of 
moral knowledge, or what we might refer to informally as a “sense of 
justice,” “moral sense,” or “conscience.”}
• Chomsky’s general answer:
A speaker’s knowledge of language consists in 
her possession of a grammar: A complex system 
of unconscious principles.
(Chomsky, 1980:51). 

More specifically:

•

(b) How is moral knowledge acquired?

“Answer is given by Universal Moral Grammar (UMG): 
a theory of the initial state of the human moral faculty—we
provisionally assume to be a distinct subsystem of the mind/brain—
along with an account of how the properties UMG postulates interact 
with
experience to yield a mature system of moral knowledge.”

• Chomsky’s general answer:
The system is acquired through the unfolding of a 
specific genetic program, under the modest triggering 
and shaping effects of the environment 
(Chomsky, 1980:31).

Mikhail-Theoretical Framework

•

(c) How is moral knowledge put to use?

“Answer is given by a theory of moral performance: 
a theory of how moral knowledge enters into the actual
representation and evaluation of human acts and institutional 
arrangements, as well as other forms of actual conduct.”

• His general answer to the linguistic version of (c) 
begins by distinguishing two aspects of that problem , a 
production problem and a perception problem. 
• The former is the problem of how people manage to 
succeed in appropriately and creatively in linguistic 
behavior and performance.

More general questions…

• (d) How is moral knowledge physically 
realized in the brain?

• (e) How did moral knowledge evolve in the 
species?

Mikhail-Theoretical Framework

• Since (a)-(c) are empirical questions, about which we have little scientific
understanding at present, 
anything said about them is highly speculative. 
• Assumption of Individuals  possession of what we call a moral grammar: 
a system of largely unconscious moral principles.

•

•

b) Tentatively hypothesizes that this grammar is acquired through the 
unfolding of a specific genetic
program, under the modest triggering and shaping effects of the 
environment. 

•

c) A similar division between production and perception is useful as a 
method of clarifying the problem of how moral knowledge is put to use. 
• (cid:198)The production problem in the theory of moral performance is the problem 
of determining how individuals succeed in applying their moral knowledge in 
their actual, day-to-day conduct. (involves free will –mysterious)

Mikhail, 2000

• Perception problem appears more tractable. 
• How moral observers are able to recognize the 
moral properties of the acts and institutional
arrangements they encounter?

• The case of language or vision: 
When a person encounters or imagines a 
particular action, performed under a particular 
set of circumstances, her rule-system assigns it 
a structural description which in some manner 
specifies those properties

Mikhail, 2000

• (cid:198)Makes no assumptions that we are aware of 
the operative principles constituting our moral 
knowledge…

• Hypothesizes that just as normal persons are 
typically unaware of the principles guiding their
linguistic or visual intuitions, so too are they 
often unaware of the principles guiding their 
moral intuitions…..
• What are the properties of moral competence?...

Objection your honor☺

their moral intuitions…..”

Mikhail-experiments
143 adults and 32 children

• Investigating how adults and children
reconstruct and utilize information about 
intentions and effects when evaluating 
“morally complex acts”.
i.e. acts and omissions which are 
comprised of multiple intentions and which
generate both good and bad effects.

•

Foot (1967) and Thomson(1985)

Mkhail claims these are captured by the 
so-called: “trolley problem” and related thought-
experiments:

•

(a) Charlie is driving a train when the brakes fail. Ahead 
five people are working on the track with their backs 
turned. Fortunately, Charlie can switch to a side track, if 
he acts at once. Unfortunately, there is also someone on 
that track with his back turned. If Charlie switches his 
train to the side track, he will kill one person. If Charlie 
does not switch his train, he will kill five people.
Is it morally permissible for Charlie to switch his train to
the side track?

Related thought experiments

(b) Dr. Brown has five patients in the hospital who are dying. Each patient needs a
new organ in order to survive. One patient needs a new heart. Two patients need
a new kidney. And two more patients need a new lung. Dr. Brown can save all
Five patients if he takes a single healthy person and removes her heart, kidneys,
and lungs to give to these five patients. Just such a healthy person is in Room
306. She is in the hospital for routine tests. Having seen her test results, Dr.
Brown knows that she is perfectly healthy and of the right tissue compatibility. If
Dr. Brown cuts up the person in Room 306 and gives her organs to the other five
patients, he will save the other five patients, but kill the person in Room 306 in
The process. If Dr. Brown does not cut up the person in Room 306, the other five
patients will die.

Is it morally permissible for Dr. Brown to cut up the person in Room 306?

Related thought experiments

•

(c) Denise is a passenger on a train whose driver has 
just shouted that the train’s brakes have failed, and who 
then fainted of the shock. On the track ahead are five
people; the banks are so steep that they will not be able 
to get off the track in time. The track has a side track 
leading off to the right, and Denise can turn the train onto 
it. Unfortunately, there is one person on the right hand 
track. Denise can turn the train, killing the one; or she 
can refrain from turning the train, letting the five die.

Is it morally permissible for Denise to switch the train to the 
side track?

Related thought experiments

•

(d) Nancy is taking her daily walk near the train tracks 
when she notices that the train that is approaching is out 
of control. Five men are walking across the tracks. The
train is moving so fast that they will not be able to get off 
the track in time. Nancy is standing next to a man, whom 
she can throw in front of the train, thereby preventing it 
from killing the men. Nancy can throw the man, killing 
him but saving the five men; or she can refrain from 
doing this, letting the five die.

Is it morally permissible for Nancy to throw the man?

Experiment results

• When both adult and child subjects were 
presented with these fact patterns, they judged:
1) Charlie’s turning the train to be permissible, 
2) Dr. Brown’s cutting up the patient to be 
impermissible
3) Denise’s throwing the switch to be permissible
4) Nancy’s throwing the man to be impermissible.

• Mikhail says:
’ These responses confront us with a potentially 
•
surprising contrast between’ the problems…

…

• what are the operative principles of moral 
competence that are responsible for these 
divergent responses?
• On the one hand experiment’s a) and c)
judgments seem to ignore whether or not 
‘killing’ is an action that requires intervention 
in order to be performed.  Killing might be 
considered ‘passive’ observation as well.
Therefore 5 killings override 1….

…

• On the other hand, b)  and d) judgments
Suggest either:
1)Simply observing -while intervention is 
possible is considered as ‘killing’

OR
2) Moral judgment is not about whether or 
not intension accommodates killing but 
actually a matter of ‘avoiding’ a ‘heavier’
moral error than killing.

…

• Such a ‘heavier’ moral error, is either 
factual or ‘artificial’
• Artificial to be considered as a 
consequence of intervention with a ‘higher’
un-violated principle that is either 
‘consious’ or 
unconsious…(feelings..emotions etc..)
• Free Will? ( subconscious) ( fuzzy)

Mikhail says…

“any attempt to explain the moral intuitions elicited 
by examples like (above) by means of a simple 
stimulus-response model is doomed at the start.”
• “Instead, an intervening step between stimulus 
and response must be postulated: a pattern of 
organization of some sort that is imposed by the 
stimulus by the mind itself. Hence a simple 
perceptual model must at a minimum look:
look more like:”

•

(3b) implies that, like grammaticality judgments, permissibility
judgments do not necessarily depend on the surface properties of 
an action-description, but on more fundamental properties of how 
that action is mentally represented. 

• Further, it suggests that the problem of descriptive adequacy is 
divided into at least two parts: 

•

•

(a) the problem of determining the nature of the computational 
principles operative in the exercise of moral judgment, and

(b) the problem of determining the representational structures over 
which those computational operations are defined.

Mikhail

• Moral intuitions generated by these examples 
can be most adequately explained by assuming 
the possession
of the following moral intuitions:

• Rescue principle,
• Prohibition of intentional battery
• The first principal of practical reason
• Principle of double effect. 

The rescue principle

• Familiar principle of common morality—but 
not the common law.
• Forbids one from failing to prevent an 
easily preventable death, where this can 
be accomplished without risking one’s own 
life or safety, or without violating other 
fundamental moral principles

Prohibition of intentional battery

• Familiar principle of both common morality 
and the common law

The principle of double effect

• Is a traditional moral and legal principle, 
according to which otherwise prohibited 
acts may be justified if the harm
they cause is not intentional and the act’s 
foreseeable and intended good effects 
outweigh its foreseeable bad effects.

Principle of double effect

• In short, the principle appears to enter 
directly or indirectly into the analysis of
a wide variety of legal problems, all of 
which are potentially controversial.
• (Pandora’s box)
• The principle is very sensitive to 
variations….

1+1>1 was never taught…

• An ordinary person was never taught the 
principle of double effect,” Harman 
observes, and 
• “it is unclear how such a principle might 
have been acquired by
the examples available to the ordinary 
person. This suggests that [it] is built into . 
. . Morality ahead of time” (Harman, 
2000:225).

Poverty of the stimulus even in the 
moral domain?

• According to Mikhail’s experiments, even 
young children appear to utilize the
rescue principle and the principle of 
double effect when making moral 
judgments.

Mikhail
• The key insight of Mikhail’s paper is that these intuitions 
can be adequately explained only by drawing on 
complex moral and legal concepts—primarily the 
prohibition of intentional battery
and the principle of double effect.
• Agrees with Kohlberg’s critiques. 

• Mikhail brings us in a better position to determine 
whether children are explicitly taught these principles or 
whether they may be innate.

• Results pave the way for future investigations of the 
nature and origin of moral knowledge.

…in the experiments

• eleven year-old boy, said:
•
“I said no because it never said that she gave permission 
to kill her; to give away her body parts…I did not feel 
good about it because I would not like somebody to take 
my body parts.”
(cid:198)The principle: ‘You shall treat others as you 
expect to be treated’
(cid:198) seems higher on the moral scale than  other 
principles’ ( ie double effect). 
( has the capacity to ‘override’ certain principles)

Greene: An fMRI Investigation
of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment

• The authors’ central thesis is that 
“the crucial difference between the trolley dilemma and
•
the footbridge dilemma lies in the latter’s tendency to 
engage people’s emotions in a way that the former does 
not. The thought of pushing someone to his death is, we 
propose, more emotionally salient than the thought of 
hitting a switch that will cause a trolley to produce similar
consequences, and it is this emotional response that 
accounts for people’s tendency to treat these
cases differently”

Greene: An fMRI Investigation
of Emotional Engagement in Moral Judgment

• Mikhail says:
• “However, the authors’ conclusion that the moral 
judgments they examine are caused by 
differences in emotional engagement strikes us 
as premature. 
• They have given insufficient consideration to the 
competing hypothesis that their moral dilemmas
elicit mental representations which differ in their 
structural properties. 
• Put simply, a computational theory of moral 
cognition has been ruled out too soon.”

Open questions

•

• Can moral judgment behavior and  intuition be considered innate and if yes, 
how much or in what sense?? (Chomsky approach etc..)
• This translates to: 
• Can a part of set of (ethical code) instructions or a generative frame of 
instructions be innate?
Is there any structure in a set of moral commands, that will span any 
possible ethics code?
If yes the ‘computational cognitive’ problem could be the following: 
Whether or not  a set of universal constraints/instructions exists  regardless 
what the actual ethics code is. And if it exists is it build-in the brain/DNA or 
is it built?
ie: Or it can be created in the brain as a consequence of collection of 
experiences/ learning?
• Possibility of morality being strictly non-innate but only a part of learning still 
open…

• Finding possible areas in the brain that can be assigned and be considered 
responsible for moral judjement, could be easily reduced to usual basic 
problems in the field that are still unsolved…

MAIN QUESTION: IS THERE ANY STRUCTURE THERE 
ABOUT MORALITY?

-- that will allow us to infer and span certain ethics 
codes without actually using any constraints from 
already given axioms or codes? or emotional inputs etc?
(cid:198)How do we realize this problem?
(cid:198)possible plan of attack:
• Two  questions  shall be asked and try to be answered: 
1) about structure and 
2) about axiom permissibility
Ie proof that morals are necessary, then address  issue 
of  innatism,  
If possible, independently of the companion of the effort 
for  the designation of laws.

questions:

• Deep question here: what kind of momentum makes us override any ethics 
code existent? ( during war times) or during (sexual search—passion etc…).

•

•

2 types are obvious: ‘sexual momentum’ and ‘ distribution of death’
momentum… (during war times, crimes, etc)

Identifying these types in a formal manner, might help in the understanding 
of the nature of any possible area in the brain were that code (morals) could 
exist.

• Trying to classify moral construction elements ( such as ethical dilemmas), 
the same way we do with the ‘illusions’ is a fascinating idea, however it is 
not widely accepted that the nature of moral elements are purely
unconscious processes such as with the visual system…

Trolleys..

•

• Dillema’s such as the trolley’s have certain ‘local’
solutions for personal benefit and satisfaction.
• The question on whether always general solutions will 
exist is open 
I.e.: For the example of trolley dilemmas there are 
‘logical’ solutions that can be realized more intensively  
when we perform sensitivity analysis on the numbers.
( contrast 5 -1 people with 200-1) and you have your 
answer…
the more repetitive-(less rare) is the problem/question 
the more annoying it becomes if something is wrong with 
it.

Property of order exists in a moral set

• It is obvious that moral values can override 
each other (principle of double effect etc..)
• Therefore there is order of importance in 
any set of moral rules.
• This is extremely useful information as a 
property of the set can be used to find 
more ‘structure’ and determine what is 
innate.

Make it a habit…then study it

• Then…Is moral behavior (or the seek for 
morality) a subset of a set of habit rules?/ 
habituations? Or vice versa?....
• If yes, habituation will be easier or not 
depending on the nature of the rules. This 
is an opportunity to look for moral ‘areas’
near the habituation areas…in the brain..

Morals as a model

• The model has to reflect reality for most of 
the mass.
• Since models are imperfect in a 
deterministic way, exceptions may not be 
avoided and these will be judged more 
analytically. As a function of all the utilities 
+ morals+ sentiment etc.–
• The inverse does NOT seem to be true…

Axiomatic approach

• axiom permissibility
• how do you feel/think a machine shall be 
programmed as opposed to a human for 
the same problem?
• emotions input.

Vision analogy

• Would it be right to steal the drug?-(cid:198) order of moral importance. 
First things first…
• Maybe there is local solution but not global for an exception 
problem.
• HOW do we realize a problem like that?
•
----> by trying to compare it with another "parallel" problem...
like for example in our vision system...
•
•
If we had seen before a square ( like the Vision field approach..) and 
we see parallelogram is ok
• but if we never show a square, then a parallelogram looks strange or 
unrecognized..
so the prior recognition of the square plays a huge role on the 
realization of parallelogram
if no parallel then new type of problem...but have to prove that there 
is no parallel...

General observation…

• Morals consist of a set of rules for ‘good’.
• These rules appear in our society through 
religion and justice systems ( state tools ).
• They used to be behavioral rules pointing 
to perfection and it seems they have 
evolved to some very implicit and fuzzy 
principles or functions taking as input 
sentimental and other utilitarian processes 
and mapping back a behavior…
