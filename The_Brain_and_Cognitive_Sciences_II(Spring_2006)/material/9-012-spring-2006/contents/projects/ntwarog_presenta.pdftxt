●	 According to Wikipedia, “Social cognition is 
the study of how people process social 
information, especially its encoding, storage, 
retrieval, and application to social situations.”

●	 According to Wikipedia, “Social cognition is

−  In simple terms, it's the study of how the 
mind deals with other members of the 
same species 

Who cares?

●	 What about this problem warrants a full hour-
and-a-half lecture, much less it's own two-word 
phrase?

“Man is a Social Creature”


●	 Interaction with other minds, most commonly 
other people, is an ENORMOUS part of
human life 
●	 This fact stretches back through and
beyond hominid evolutionary history 
●	 Because in our evolutionary setting,
cooperation with other humans was integral
to survival, our mind has to be very capable
of processing and dealing with other minds

−	 Without these, the 
connections between 
observed behavior

the face as analogous to the baby's own, and

setting characterizing the vast-majority of hominid 
history

–  What is the goal of the computation, and what is the logic by 
which it is carried out? 
•  Level 2: Representation and algorithm

–  How is information represented and processed to achieve the 
computational goal? 
•  Level 3: Hardware implementation

–  How is the computation realized in physical or biological 
hardware?

them out

be integrated with higher-level social
information, like knowledge about the beliefs
and desires of others

Autism


●	 Affects about 0.1% of children 
●	 Causes still poorly understood 
●	 Some researchers have suggested that many
problems in autism can be traced to an inability
to recognized or think about other minds
(Baron-Cohen, Frith, Leslie) 
●	 Autistic children perform on numerous tasks
which require social cognition 
−	 But they perform often above average on other
logical tasks
