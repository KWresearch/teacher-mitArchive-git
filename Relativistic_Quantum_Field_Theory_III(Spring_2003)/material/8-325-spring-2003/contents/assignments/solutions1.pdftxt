Therefore,   topology  of   SU (2) is  S 3. 
Topology  of  SU (3) is  an  S 3  bundle  over   S 5  (see  hep  − th  9812006).  
(c) For  any  representation  of  a  Lie  algebra [T a ,  T b ] =  if abcT c  one  can  get  a 
conjugate  representation  by  T˜a  =  −T a  because  taking   complex  conjugate 
of the  commutation  relations  give [−T a∗ ,  −T b∗ ] =  if abc (−T c∗ ) for  f abc   real. 
Since  T a  are  Hermitian  complex  conjugate  of a   covariant vector   transforms 
as  contervariant  vector. 
A  general  tenser  with  n  upper,   m  lower   indices  can  be  used  to  denote  a 
general  (might  be  reducible)  representation:  ρj1 ···jn  transfers  as

From  this  transformation  law,  it   is  clear  that  one  can  impose  symme­
try  among  (j1  · · · jn )  and  (i1 
· · ·
im )  and  also  one  can   impose  tracelessness: 
ρj1 ···jn  = 0
δ i1 
i1 ···
j1 
im
In  fact every tenser   with  n  symmetric  upper  and  m  symmetric  lower  index 
with  the  additional restriction  of  tracelessness   corresponds   to   an  irreducible 
representations.

so  �  is  invariant. 
You  can  raise indices  with  �ij  so   suﬃcient   to  consider   only  upper   index 
tenser  in  SU (2).  For   a  tenser   τ i1 i2 ···in  applying   �ir is  on  the  antisymmetric 
components  give  invariant  subspaces.  Hence  totally  symmetric  require­
ments  are  irreducible.  Dimension  of   ρj1 ···jn  (with  i1
