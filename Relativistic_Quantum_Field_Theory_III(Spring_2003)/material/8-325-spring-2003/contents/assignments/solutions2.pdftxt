•	 This  is  an  example  of   the  “see–saw”   mechanism.  Although  one  can  not 
right   down  relevant  (dimension  ≤  4)  Ma jorana  mess   term  in  standard 
model,  one  can  in  some  GUT’s,  e.g.  SO(10). Therefore,  the  natural   Ma jo­
rana  mass  ∼ O(1015  Gev),  which  is  the  GUT  scale  in  typical theories.Then 
above  mechanism  would  give  a  LH  fermion  with  a   tiny  mass

µ  ∼  1015  Gev 

∼ 10−2  eV 	
which  is  consistent  with   observation  of  scalar  neutrinos.  Note  that  for  the 
typical  Dirac  mass  µ,  I  take  ∼ 100  Gev  since  they  are  obtained  by  Higgs 
much  at  weak  scale. 
•	 Same  mechanism  works  for  N  >   1  ﬂavors   in  which  case  one  diagonalizes 
the  general  mass  make  it  with  a  unitary  transformation.

We  want  to  ﬁnd  a  term  with  B  =  0.  Clearly  this   term  should  involve 
quarks. The  restrictions  are:  SU (3) color,  SU (2) weak,  U (1)Y  and  Lorentz 
invariance. (l,  ρ,  τ  separately  are  not  fundamental).  SU (3)   requires  three 
combinations: 

(12.64) 

(12.65) 
(12.66)  
(12.67) 

3  ⊗ 3  ⊗ 3  =   1   +   8  +  8  +  10  
3∗  ⊗ 3∗  ⊗ 3∗  =  1  +   8∗  +  8∗  +  10∗ 
3  ⊗ 3∗  =  1  +   8  
Last  one  can   not  violate  B  hence  discarded. First  two  are  ρρρ  (or   ρcρcρc ) 
and  ρρρ  (or  ρcρcρc )  which  are  not  Lorentz  invariant  unless  we  include 
another  fermion  which  should  be  a   lepton   in   order  not  to  spoil  SU (3)color . 
Hence  the  lowest   dimensional  operators  which  has   B  = 0   are  ∼ ρρρl  with 
dimension   6. 
(b)  There  are  four  types:  ρρρl,  ρ∗ρ∗ρ∗ l∗ ,  ρρρl∗ ,  ρ∗ρ∗ρ∗ l.  First  two  does  not 
violate  B  − L,  last   two  does.  This  problem   amounts  to  see  that  last  two 
are  in  violation  of  at   last  one  of  the  after  mentioned  symmetries  of  Sµ. 
Consideration  of  ρρρl∗  is  suﬃcient: 
•	 To  have  SU (2) invariance  we  need even  number  of   left  handed:   ρLρLρL l∗L , 
ρLρu  ρu  l∗
R R l∗
R R l∗
R R R l∗
R R R l∗
R R R l∗
R ,  ρd  ρd  ρd  l∗
L ,  ρLρu  ρd
L ,  ρLρd  ρd
L ,  ρu  ρu  ρu
R ,  ρu  ρu  ρd
R ,  ρu  ρd  ρd
R R R R . 
R	 R
•	 Note  that   ρ  is  either  ρ  or  ρc  .  l∗  can  only  be  a  l. 
•	 None  of  the  above  can   be  Lorentz  invariant   hence  it   is  impossible  to 
violate  B  − L  with  a  dimension  6  operator. 
Actually   a  generalization  of  above  reasoning  glons  that  B  − L  can  not  be 
involved  in  Sµ  neither   perturbatively  nor  non-perturbatively.  However   B −
L  violation  would  after  a  nice  explanation  for  observed  baryon  asymmetry 
in  the  universe.   One  nice  feature  of  GUT’s  is  that  there  are  consistent 
GUT’s  with   relevant  B  − L  violating terms   (e.g.  SO(10)). 
(c)  To  violate  L  we  need at   least  are  lepton. If we  insist  to  have  only one  lepton 
than  we  need  to  contract   it  with  at  least   one  quark.  This  would  violate 
SU (3)  hence  we  need three  quarks,   but  this  term  (lρρρ)  is  dimension  6,  no  
way.  Consider  two  leptons,  in  order   to  violate  L  these  should  have  same 
lepton  number,  hence  Ma jorana  type  contraction:   lc  lL  or  lc  lR .  But  these

have  total  hypercharge  −1  and  −2  each.  To   cancel  this  we  are  only  left 
with  φ’s  to  add.  Therefore,  we  get   lc  lLφ2  with  dimension  5  or  lc  lRφ4  with

dimension  7.  As  φ  gets   a   VEV  by  Higgs

Rey  and  P.  Rey  world  scientiﬁc,   1989  (this  is  in  library:  QC793.W66

On  the  other  hand  for  a   general   Higgs  content   one  can  express  ρ  in

This  shows  that  adding   a  new   type  of   Higgs  ﬁeld  to  the  usual   doublet 
is  highly  constrained  by  experiments.  However,  one  can  clearly  add 
any  number   of  doublets  without  violating  ρ = 1   − � constraint.  This 
possibly is  explored  in  the  next   problem.

(d)   We  now  have  the  possibility  of  a   Higgs  ﬁeld  with  Y  =  ±1.  Recall  from 
Problem  2 that  the  biggest  constraint  for  a  L–violating term  was  imposed  
by   preserving  hypercharge.  Now  we  can  write  down  lL lLφ3 ,  which  is
