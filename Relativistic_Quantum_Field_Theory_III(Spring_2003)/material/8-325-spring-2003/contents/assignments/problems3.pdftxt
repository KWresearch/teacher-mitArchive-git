Problems  3

April  9,  2003 

These  problems  are  simply directed  toward  calculating  the QCD β  function  at  one 
loop using Feynman graphs.  By doing it in several diﬀerent ways, you will check gauge 
independence and universality, as well as getting practice  in a sort of calculation that 
is  central  to  many  –  I  think  it’s  fair  to  say  most  –  of  the  deeper  applications  of 
quantum  ﬁeld  theory. 
In  this  problem  “Fermi  gauge” means  the  sort  of  gauge  in  which  the  gluon  propa­
gator  is  proportional  to 
gµν  − α 
kµkν

1.  Gluon  wave  function  renormalization 
a.  Calculate  the  logarithmically  divergent  part  of  the  wave  function  renormal­
ization  for  gluons,  due  to  gluons,  in  an  arbitrary  Fermi  gauge,  using  the  brutal 
cutoﬀ  procedure  described  in  class.  You will  have  to  include  the  Fadeev-Popov 
ghost  contribution,  of  course.  Pay  attention  to  the  issue  of  longitudinal  versus 
transverse  polarizations! 
b.  How  is  the  answer modiﬁed  by  charged  fermions  and  scalars? 
c.  Give  arguments  that  the  quadratic  and  linear  divergences  can  be  ignored, 
as  can  the  renormalization  of  longitudinal  polarizations,  in  calculating  the  β 
function. 

2.  Beta  function  from  gluons 
a.  Calculate  the  log  divergent  parts  of  the  “proper”  gluon  3-point  function  – 
the  part  that  matches  the  tree  graph  structure,  including  glue,  fermions,  and 
scalars.  Use  this,  together  with  earlier  results,  to  calculate  the  β  function. 
Check  that  the  α  dependence  cancels. 
b.  Do  the  same  thing  using  the  4-point  function. 

3.  Beta  function  universality 
a.  Calculate the β  function from renormalization of the gluon-fermion coupling. 
b.  Calculate  the  β  function  from  renormalization  of  the  gluon-scalar  coupling. 
c.  Calculate  the  β  function  from  renormalization  of  the  gluon-ghost  coupling.

4.  Looking  back 
Now  that  you’ve  done  all  this,  and  (presumably)  acquired  some  faith  in  the 
framework,  design  a  shortcut.  If  you  take  it  for  granted  that  you  can  work  in 
an  arbitrary  gauge  and  calculate  charge  renormalization  using  any  appearance 
of  the  charge,  what  is  the  most  eﬃcient  way  to  calculate?  Can  you  ﬁnd  a  way 
to  do  it  on  one  not-too-cluttered  page?
