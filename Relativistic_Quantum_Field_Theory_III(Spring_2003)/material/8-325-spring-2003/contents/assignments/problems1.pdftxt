1.  Aharonov-Bohm  eﬀect 
Consider  the  vector  potential  deﬁned  by

a.  Show  that  the  curl  of  A  is  zero,  apart  possibly  from  the  z -axis  where  it  is 
ill-deﬁned. 
b.  Use  Stoke’s  theorem  to  deﬁne  the  curl  on  the  z -axis.

Since  Ai  =  ∂iφ,  where  φ  is  the  angle  in  cylindrical  coordinates,  you  have  now 
derived  the  charming  formula 

�z ij ∂i∂j φ = 2πδ(x)δ(y).

Can  you  think  of  a  simple  way  to  realize  this  set-up  physically? 
c.  Now  suppose  there  is  a  repulsive  barrier  around  the  z -axis,  so we  don’t  have 
to worry about the singular nature of the vector potential there.  Write down the 
Hamiltonian  for  a  particle  of  charge  q .  Show  that  if  the wave-function  depends 
on  the  angle  as  einφ ,  then  the  repulsive  centrifugal  barrier  is  proportional  to 
(n + q)2 .  If the charge q  is not an  integer1  the spectrum will have changed, even 
though  the  particle  never  sees  a  non-zero  ﬁeld  strength.  This  is  the  Aharonov-
Bohm  eﬀect,  which  dramatically  illustrates  the  unavoidable  signiﬁcance  of  the 
vector  potential  in  quantum mechanics. 
Eﬀectively,  the  particle  has  acquired  fractional  angular momentum. 
d.  If  you  have  been  putting  ¯h  =  1,  now  restore  it.  Discuss  in  two  sentences 
what is classical and what is quantum mechanical in the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. 
e.  [This part is Profound.]  The vector potential appears to be axially symmetric. 
How  is  this  consistent  with  its  perturbing  the  angular momentum? 
1 If  you  prefer  unit  charge,  let  the  vector  potential  be  q  times  what  we  originally  assumed.

2.  Theory  of  the  3-index  antisymmetric  tensor  ﬁeld 
Consider  a  3-index  antisymmetric  tensor  ﬁeld  Aµν ρ  with  the  gauge  symmetry 
Aµν ρ  → Aµν ρ  + ∂µΛν ρ 
where,  in  the  last  term,  antisymmetrizaton  over  the  indices  is  assumed. 
a.  By  analogy  with  electromagnetism,  construct  an  invariant  ﬁeld-strength 
Fµν ρσ  and a kinetic energy term.  What  is the  free equation of motion (analogue 
of  the Maxwell  equations)?  How many  degrees  of  freedom  does  this  ﬁeld  have? 
� 
b.  We  saw  how  to  couple  the  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  to  paticles  in  a  gauge-
invariant  way  by  adding  a  world-line  term  Aµdxµ .  What  is  the  natural  kind 
of ob ject for Aµν ρ  to couple to?  What does it take for this to be gauge-invariant? 
(If you don’t have a comfortable grip on diﬀerential geometry, do a special case, 
analogous  to  a  straight  world-line.) 
c.  What  is  the  equation  of motion  for  F  now?

d.  There  is  a  natural  vector-ﬁeld  B α  = 
�αµν ρAµν ρ

associated  with  the  three-
index  tensor  ﬁeld.  What  are  the  salient  features  of  B ? 

3.  Spin  and  statistics  with  free  ﬁelds 
a.  Quantize the free scalar ﬁeld using anticommutators (Fermi statistics).  Show 
that  ﬁelds  at  spacelike  separations  do  not  commute. 
b.  Quantize  the  free Dirac  equation using  commutators  (Bose  statistics).  Show 
that  the  bottom  falls  out  of  the  Hamiltonian. 

4.  Some  non-abelian  group  theory 
The  theory  of  non-abelian  groups  and  their  representations  is  a  big  sub ject  in 
itself,  especially  if  explicit  algorithms  for  classifying  invariants  and  labelling 
and  reducing  representations  are  required.  Fortunately  in  the  Standard Model 
we  need  only  to  deal  with  the  groups  SU (2)  and  SU (3),  and  for  these  we 
can  do  everything  we  need  using  ad  hoc  “bare  hands”  methods.  If  any  of  the 
speciﬁc  group-theoretic  manipulations  used  in  class  are  completely  unfamiliar, 
you  should  ask  me,  but  it  might  also  be  a  good  idea  to  review  the  basic  ideas, 
to make  sure  you’re  comfortable with  them.  As  a  reference,  see  for  example M. 
Hamermesh, Group Theory  and  its Application  to Physical Problems2 .  Here are 
some  simple  exercises  to  focus  your  attention. 
a.  The  inﬁnitesimal  versions  of  group  elements  near  the  identity  deﬁne  the  Lie 
algebra  of  the  group.  Thus  we  write 

Ωa  = δa  + iωb
a 
b 
b

with  ω  small.  Show  that  the  condition  that  Ω  is  unitary  translates  (dropping 
quadratic terms!)  into the condition that ω is Hermitean, and that the condition 
that Ω has unit determinant translates  into the condition that ω  has zero trace. 
2This  is  a  really  excellent  book  and  reference  that  every  theoretical  physicist  should  own,  espe­
cially  since  it  is  available  in  a  cheap  Dover  edition.

Since  these  conditions  are  linear,  the  Lie  algebra  forms  a  vector  space.  Find 
nice  bases  for  the  SU (2)  and  SU (3)  cases.  (A  nice  basis  is  one  for  which 
Trωaω b  =  1 δab .  )  What  are  their  dimensions?  Given  a  basis,  we  deﬁne  the 
2 
structure  constants  by 

[ωa , ω b ] = if abω c . 
c 
Compute  the  structure  constants  for  your  bases. 
b.  Show  that  the  group  of  2 × 2  unitary  transformations  can  be  parametrized

in  the  form

with  α  and  β  being  complex  numbers  sub ject  to  |α|2  +  β 2  =  1.  (So  what  is 
|
|
the  topology  of  SU (2)?) 
Work  out  a  similar  parametrization  for  SU (3).  [Hint:  The  ﬁrst  row  is  an  abi­
trary  vector  of  unit  magnitude;  the  second  is  orthogonal  to  it;  the  third  is 
proportional  to  the  cross-product.]  How  many  real  parameters  are  required? 
Optional:  What  does  this  construction  suggest  about  the  topology  of  SU (3)? 
c.  Upper-index  (covariant) vectors  transform as columns  that get multiplied on 
the  left;  lower-index  (contravariant)  vectors  transform  as  rows  that  get  multi­
plied  on  the  right  by  the  inverse matrix.  Thus

Show  that  the  complex  conjugate  of  a  covariant  vector  transforms  like  a  con­
travariant  vector. 
¿From these we can construct tensors, which transform like products of vectors. 
Convince  yourself  that  we  can  apply  symmetry  restrictions  on  tensors  (e.g., 
requiring them to be symmetric or antisymmetric) and still have representations 
of  the  groups. 
Show by explicit calculation that the Kronecker delta δa  and the antisymmetric 
b 
symbol  �ab  are  invariant  under  SU (2)  transformations.  Use  this  to  argue  that 
any  tensor  can be decomposed  into  a  sum  of  symmetric  tensors with up  indices 
only.  What  are  the  dimensions  of  these  representations?  How  does  the  group 
τ
transformation  Ω = ei 3 
act  on  these?  Does  this  ring  any  bells?

d.  We deﬁne Lie-algebra  representations  in  general by matrices  that  satisfy  the 
commutation  relations 

[ρa , ρb ] = if abρc 
(10)
c 
where  the  f ab  are  the  structure  constants  of  the  group.  Convince  yourself  that 
c 
this  “works”,  in  the  sense  that  the  representation  matrices  you  get  by  taking 
inﬁnitesimal  versions  of  how  the  group  elements  work  on  the  tensor  product 
obey  this  rule. 
For  physics  purposes  we  are  often  interested  in  the  so-called  Casimir  number 
C2 (ρ)  and  trace  Tr(ρ)  associated  with  a  representation.  These  are  deﬁned  by 

C2 (ρ)δµ  = (ρa )µ
σ (ρa )σ
ν , 
ν

with  summation  over  a  and  σ  assumed,  and  by 

T (ρ)δab  = Trρaρb	

(12) 

using  a  nice  basis3 .  Thus  T (fundamental)  for  the  fundamental  vector  represen­
tation  is,  by  deﬁnition,  1 .2 
Prove  the  general  relationship 

dρC2 (ρ) = dGT (ρ), 	

(13) 

where  dρ  is  the  dimension  of  the  representation  and  dG  is  the  dimension  of  the 
group. 
Evaluate  C2 (ρ)  for  the  representations  of  SU (2)  discussed  above. 
Evaluate  C2 (ρ)  for  the  fundamental  vector  3  representation  of  SU (3),  and  for 
the  following: 
•	 the  6  representation,  using  a  two-index  symmetric  tensor 
•	 the  10  representation,  using  a  three-index  symmetric 
•	 the  adjoint  8  representation,  using  a  traceless  tensor  with  one  upper  and 
one  lower  index 

[Hint:  Compute  T  by  picking  a  convenient  Lie  algebra  element.] 
For a grand ﬁnale, compute C2 (27) for the representation of SU (3) that has two 
symmetric  upper  indices,  two  symmetric  lower  indices,  and  vanishing  trace. 

3These  “deﬁnitions”  assume  that  the  forms  on  the  two  sides  match.  That  will  be  true  for  irre­
ducible  representations.
