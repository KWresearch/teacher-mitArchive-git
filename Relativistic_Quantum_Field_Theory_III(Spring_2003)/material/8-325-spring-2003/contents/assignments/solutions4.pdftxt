12.4  Problem  Set   4  Solutions 

1.  A  nice  derivation  on  the  theoretical  lower  bound  on  Higgs  mass (note  exper­
imental  lower  bound  is  µH  ≥ 120GeV  by  now)   can  be  found  in  G.  Attarelli, 
G.  Isideri,  Phys.  Lett.  B337  p141   (’94)  (available  on  the  SPIRES).  This  uses 
two–loop  corrections  and   the  result  for  (µt  � 174GeV )  as  a  function  of   cut-oﬀ 
scale  Λ   is  as  follows:

These  one–loop  eﬀects  can  turn  the  tail  of   Vtree (∅) in  downwards   for   large  ∅
hence  VRen (∅)  may  become  unstable.

From  Equation  12.165 the  condition  for   stability is  clearly

Therefore,  we  see  that   λ  can  become  negative,  hence  VRen  unstable  for  partic­

Excitation  get   lower   and   lower   energy  (straightforward) since  ω <  0  (for  classical 
unstable  potential). 

This  reasoning  is   easily  generalized to   more  non-trivial  potentials  which exhibit  
non-stable  behavior   classically  and   to  4D  QFT,  in  which   case

weak  scale. One  can  ignore  Yukawa  couplings  of other   matter  except   top-quark:

This  is  easily   done  by  looking  at  one–loop  running  of  MSSM  and  SM  couplings  
and   their   uniﬁcation  at   µGU T ,  see  for   instance  R.  Mohapatra  hep-th  9801235
