1.  Calculate  the  renormalization  of  the  Higgs  ﬁeld  self-coupling  due  to  its  inter­
actions  with  gauge  bosons,  fermions,  and  itself.  Find  the  algebraic  condition  that 
insures  the  eﬀective  stays  positive  at  large  scales.  Then  put  in  numerical  values,  and 
express  your  result  as  a  condition  on  the  Higgs mass. 
2.  One  might  expect  that  if  this  coupling  goes  negative  there  is  no  stable  ground 
state,  since  it  parametrizes  the  leading  behavior  for  large  ﬁeld  strengths.  See  if  you 
can make this argument rigorous.  Speciﬁcally, how are the states with arbitrarily  low 
energy  constructed,  concretely  ? 
3.  Compare the predictions  for renormalization of mb/mτ  in minimal versus super-
symmetric  uniﬁed  gauge  theories.  Which  works  better?
