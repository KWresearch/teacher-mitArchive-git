Abelian  Gauge   Symmetry


As   I  have  already  mentioned,   local  gauge  symmetry   is  the  ma jor  new  principle,  beyond 
the  generic  implementation  of  special  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  in  quantum  
ﬁeld  theory,   which   arises  in  formulating  the  standard  model.  It  is,  however,  a  rather 
abstract  concept,   and  one   whose   relevance  to  the  description   of  Nature  emerges  only 
after  considerable  analysis.  One  could  simply  introduce   local  gauge  symmetry  as  
a  mathematical   postulate,   but  that  would  make  its  signiﬁcance  seem  obscure  and 
its   discovery  miraculous.  Since  our   goal  is  to  construct  a  rational  understanding   of 
Nature,  it  is  appropriate   to  proceed  diﬀerently.  Accordingly  I  will  work  up  to  the 
general  abstract  concept  through  enlightening  special  cases,  and  say  a  few  words 
about  the  historical   roots  o  f  the  ideas. 
Physicists  ﬁrst  encountered  gauge  symmetry as  an  esoteric  feature  of the  Maxwell 
equations  of   electrodynamics.  It  was  found   that  these  equations  took  on  a   simpler 
mathematical  form,  and   could  be   more  easily  solved,  if  one  introduced  potentials. 
The  electric  and magnetic  ﬁelds,  which  form  the   observable  content of the  theory,  are 
constructed as  certain  combinations  of  the  time  and  space  derivatives  of  the  potentials. 
The  correspondence  between  ﬁelds  and  potentials  is  not  unique,  in  that  diﬀerent 
potentials  can   correspond   to  the  same   ﬁelds. Gauge  symmetry  is  a  family of  functional 
transformations  among  the  potentials   that   leaves  the  ﬁeld  strength  unchanged.  The 
charge  and   current  distributions,  which   provide  the  source  terms  in  the   Maxwell 
equations,  are  under  gauge  transformations. 
In  the  general,   classical continuum  form  the  Maxwell equations  the  physical mean­
ing  of  gauge  symmetry  is  quite  obscure.  It   becomes  somewhat  clearer  if  we   work  in 
a  manifestly  (special)  relativistic   formulations. 
The  only  simple  relativistic  invariant associated with a   structure-less   point   particle 
is   the  interval  of   proper  time  dτ ,  where

are  satisﬁed  identically.  Historically,  this  was   one  main  motivation  for  introducing 
the  potentials  A0  and  Aj .  Another  was  their  appearance  in  the  expressions  for  the 
conserved  energy   and  momentum,  respectively,  of  charged  particles.  Here  we  have 
seen  how  naturally   potentials  arise  in  the  quasi-geometric  framework  of   relativistic 
point  particle  kinematics. 
The  transformation 

A� =  Aµ  +  ∂µχ 
µ 

(2.15) 

where  χ is  a  smooth   function  of   space  and  time  that vanishes  at   inﬁnity,  manifestly 
leaves  the  action  Sint.   invariant,  as  long  as  the  world-line  has  no  ends.  Indeed,  one 
can  simply   integrate  by  parts  in   �  dxµ∂µχ.  Equation  2.15   is  the  transformation   that 
deﬁnes  local  gauge  symmetry.  Since  local  gauge  symmetry  leaves  the  equation  of 
motion  unchanged,   it  must  leave  �
E  and  �
B  unchanged,  as   of   course  one  can  verify 
directly. 
Clearly,  the  requirement  that  the  world-line  of   a  charged  particle  should  have  no 
ends  is  closely   related   to  the  conservation  of  charge.  More  generally,  the  necessary  
and   suﬃcient   condition  for  an  action

The  appearance  of  square  root   here  leads  to  diﬃculties  in  quantization. In  order  to  
implement  the  commutation  relations,  or  (more  heuristically)  wave-particle   duality, 
p  → −i∂� and  implement   the  Schr¨
one  would   like  to  make  the  substitution  �
odinger 
wave  equation  H ψ  =  i ∂ψ  .  But   that  substitution  renders   the  Hamiltonian,  with  its 
∂ t 
square  root,  into  a  nasty,   nonlocal operator. One  could try to  work with the  square   of  
the  Hamiltonian,   but  then  there  would  be  negative  as  well  as  positive  energy   solution. 
It  was   considerations  like  these  that  lead  Dirac  to  Dirac  equation. 
Since  an  adequate  treatment  of  relativistic  quantum   theory  in  any  case  seems  to  
require  that we  pass  from   a  point   particle  to  a  quantized  ﬁeld  description  of the  charge  
matter,  for  present  purposes  it  is  preferable  to  retreat   to  the  non-relativistic  limit  of

on  the  charged  ﬁelds.   Note  that  the   value   of  charge   q  appears  explicitly   in  this 
transformation  law.  Note  also  that  the   complex  nature  of  the   ﬁeld  is  essential,  since 
the  transformation  involves  multiplication  by  a  phase   factor.

2.1  Gauge  Symmetry  for  Quantum  Fields 

Since  quantum  ﬁelds  associated   with  charged  particles   can   create  one-particle   states 
whose  wave-functions  obey the  single-particle  Schr¨odinger  equation,  we   should expect 
that  under   a  gauge  transformation   such   ﬁelds  transform  as  in  Equation  2.15. 
It  is  possible  and  proves  fruitful  to  consider   reversing  the   logic,  by  taking  the

symmetry  law  as  primary.

ψ1 ,  ψ2 , 
with charges  q1 ,  q2 , 
. Then  the  condition   that an  interaction  term  of the 
general  form 

· · · 
which  may  also  contain  derivations,  should  conserve  charge  is  that 

ΔL  =

(2.25) 

· · · 
for   the  term  destroys  p1  particles  charge  q1 ,  p2  particles  charge   q2 ,  and  so  forth   (or  
creates  an  equivalent  number  of  anti-particles).  Putting  it  diﬀerently,  the  necessary  
and  suﬃcient  condition  for  charge  conservation  is  invariance  under  the  symmetry  

p1q1  +  p2q2  + 

(2.26)

ψ � =

(2.27) 

where  χ  is  a  real   number  variable.  (Complex  numbers   are  not   allowed.  They 
would  resale  the  magnitude  of   the   ﬁelds.  While  they  might  leave  the  classical  action 
invariant,  they  generally  spoil  the   commutation  relations.) 
If  there  are  derivative  
terms,  we  cannot  allow  χ  to  be  a  ﬁeld  depending  on  space   and  time,  because  the  
derivatives   ∂µψn  transform  as 

(2.28) 

∂µψ � =  e−iqnχ (∂µχn  − iqn∂µχψn ). 
n 
The  complicated   inhomogeneous  form  of  this  transformation  law  makes  it  diﬃ­
cult   to  form  invariant  interaction  terms  containing  derivatives. But  in   order  to  obtain 
sensible  equations  of   motion  it  is  necessary  to  have  derivative   terms  in  the   action. 
So  if  we  want  to  promote  charge  conservation  to ]it   local  gauge  symmetry,  permit­
ting  transformations  in  which  χ  depends   on  space  and  time,  we   must   modify   the  
derivatives. 
A  suitable  modiﬁcation  is  suggested   by  our  earlier  discussion   of  the   point   particle  
Hamiltonian.  We  deﬁne   the   covariant   derivative  operate  Dµ  to  act  on  a  ﬁeld  ψn  of 
charge  qn  according to 

Then  if  Aµ  transforms  as  in   Equation  2.15,  we   have 

Dµψn  = (∂µ  +  iqnAµ )ψn .

(2.30) 

Thus  the  covariant  derivative   of  ψn  transforms  in   the  same   way  as   ψn  itself,  and 
there  is  no  diﬃculty in   using it   to   form  invariant   interaction  terms.
