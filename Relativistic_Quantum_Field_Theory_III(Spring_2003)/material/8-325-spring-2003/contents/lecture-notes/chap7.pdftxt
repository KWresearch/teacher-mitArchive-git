Chiral  Symmetry


Chiral  symmetry   in  the  strong  interaction  (and  speciﬁcally  in  QCD).  Exploiting   an 
approximate,   hidden  symmetry  to  simply  description  of  πi ’s  and  their   interaction 
weak  processes  involving  hadrons  (recently)   some   modern   processes. 
Leading ideas  (predicting  QCD) : 

1.  There   is  a  good  approximate  symmetry  of  the  strong  interaction  under  algebra  
SU (2)L  × SU (2)R  (or  SU (3)L  × SU (3)R )  with  SU (2)L+R  =  isospin.  Small 
instincs  breaking.  

2.  This  symmetry  is  spontaneously  violated  in  the  ground  state.  Pseudoscalar 
mesons  (π ,  κ,  ν ) are  collective  modes  (Nambu-Goldstone   bosons)  associated with 
broken  symmetry direction. 

3.  The  generators  of  these  symmetries   appear  in   the  electroweak  interactions.  In 
the  standard   model,   these   hypotheses  are   consequences  of

in  massless  limit. 

N.B.   :  It  is  very  important  that  turning  of  the  masses  is  a  soft   perturbation   so 
that  we  can  do  perturbation  theory  around   the   massless  limit.
