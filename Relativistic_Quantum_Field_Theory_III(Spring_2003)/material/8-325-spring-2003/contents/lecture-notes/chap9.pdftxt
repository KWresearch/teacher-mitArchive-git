Resolution  of  UA(1) 

Resolution  of the  UA (1) problem:  We  have  apparently,

so  that   symmetry   is  removed.  However,  for  the  Abelian   case  we  saw   that   the 
right-hand   side  is  a  total   derivative,  and  this  continues  to   be  true  in  the  non-Abelian 
case. Indeed

So  there  is  a  modiﬁed  current   that  generates  a  legitimate  symmetry.  
This  is   not   necessary  a  disacter,  because  the  current   is  not  gauge-invariant.   So 
the  massless   states  it   produces   might  not  be  physical  (that’s  what  happens   in  the 
Meissner-Higgs  eﬀect),  but  this  is   not  convincing  unless  we  have  a  mechanism. 
Here  is   the  basic  story-line:

1.  Since  K α  is  not   gauge-invariant,  it   does   not  appear   directly  in  the  action,  and 
it  may   ﬂuctuate  more  wildly.  This  could  prevent  the  surface  terms  in

mechanism  is  essentially nonperturbative. Of course,  this  had to  be  so  in  QCD,

This  can  be  solved  fairly  simply  for   the  minimal  charges,   and  using   very  elabo­

value  for   practical  QCD,   basically,   because  the  coupling  is  just  uniformly  small.

CHAPTER  9.  RESOLUTION  OF  UA (1)  

7.  The  detailed  way   in  which  UA (1)   violation  shows  up  –  in  terms  of  changes  in  
fermion  quantum  numbers   or  occurance  of   otherwise  forbidden  processes,  is  
quite  interesting  and  important  in  other   contexts. 

When  calculating  a  transition  amplitude  using  path  integrals,  one  must   calcu­
late  the  fermion  determinant.  The  integrated  anomaly  equation 

ΔQ5  = (Δwinding) × (#  doublets) 
suggests  that  this   determinant  will  vanish  when  Δwinding  is  evaluated  between 
states  in  which  the  ΔQ5  is  not  appropriate.  This   signals   zero-energy  solution, 
a  zero-modes  of  the  Dirac  equation.  There  is  a  corresponding  mathematical 
theorem,  the  Atiyah-Singer  index  theorem. 

(9.8) 

8.  To  evaluate  processes  in  the  nonvanishing  sector,  we  must  allow  for  creation 
and   destruction  of   fermions.  This  is   done  by  coupling  in  source  and  taking  
derivatives,   e.g.,  

¯ ¯

¯
�  e−(Sgauge+ψ�ψ+ ¯
ηψ+ψη) 
�  e−(Sgauge+ψ�ψ) 
¯
The  zero-modes  give  �ψ0  ∼  ηψ0  and  so   directly  a   prove  of  η  (or   ¯η)  in  the 
δ
determinant.  We  get   a  nonzero  answer   by  solving  them  up  with  δη  factor. This 
enforces  the  anomaly  equation  (for  more  algebraic  details   see  Coleman).

Scholium: 

In  the   context  of  electroweak  theory,   the  SU (2)L  anomaly  equation  suggests  a 
mechanism  of  baryon  number   violation.  I  have  asked  you  to  spell  this  out  as   a  
problem.
