Root  Concepts  of  the  Standard 
Model 

The  standard model of   particle   physics  accurately  describes  a  vast  range   of  phenomena 
using  a  small  number  of  parameters.  Much  of  the  power   of  the   standard  model 
arises  from  the  fact  that  it   embodies  a  few  deep   physical  and   mathematical  concepts  
which  are  diﬃcult,  but  not   quite  impossible,  to  make  consistent   with  one  another. 
These  principles  include,  ﬁrst  of  all,  the  general  principles  of  special  relativity  and 
quantum  mechanics.   Those  lead  us   to  local  quantum  ﬁeld  theory.  To  these   general 
principles,   the   standard  model  adds  one  more  speciﬁc  ingredient: 
local,  or  gauge, 
symmetry. Gauge  symmetry  is  a  vast  generalization   of the   principle  of electric   charge 
conservation. 
Formulating  equations  that  embody  these  concepts   is   only  half  the  job,  because 
it  is  not  at  all  straightforward   to  see   that   the   resulting  equations  describe   Nature. 
Specially,  apart  from   the   special  case  of  quantum  electrodynamics,  which   forms  only 
a  small   sub-theory  of  the  standard   model,  local  gauge   symmetry  is  not   manifest  in 
the  superﬁcial  appearance  of  phenomena. 
In  applying   the  basic   highly  symmetri­
cal  equations  to  describe  observed   reality,  which  appears   much  less  symmetric,  two  
profound  dynamical  eﬀects  must   be  taken  into  considerations. 
The  ﬁrst  of  these   dynamical  eﬀects  is  the  spontaneous  breaking  of  local  gauge 
symmetry. 
It  is  a  form   of  super-conductivity,  but  operating   in  (what  we  perceive 
as)  empty  space.  In  conventional  super-conductivity,  roughly  speaking,  the  electrons  
in  a  metal,  which   normally  behave  as  a  gas  of  independent   particles,  condense  into  
a  liquid   of   overlapping  Cooper  pairs.  The  dynamical  response   of  this  liquid  screens  
the  electromagnetic  interactions,  and  renders  magnetic   ﬁelds  short-ranged.  That  is 
the  essence  of  the  Meissner  eﬀect. 
In  the  context   of  the  standard   model,  the  role 
of  Cooper  pairs  is  played  by  a  new  form  of  matter,  the  so-called   Higgs   ﬁeld,  or 
more  accurately   the   Higgs  multiplet  of  ﬁelds.  The   Higgs  multiplet  is  a  theoretical

construct  that  was  invented  specially  to   fulﬁll  this  mission.  According  to  the   theory, 
a  condensate  of   Higgs  particles  ﬁlls  empty  space,  and   its  dynamical  response   screens  
the  weak  interactions,   rendering them  short-ranged. 
There  is  weighty indirect   evidence   for  the  existence  of the   Higgs  multiplet,  but   at  
present  direct  observation  of  its  quanta,  the  Higgs  particles,  remains  a  ma jor   unmet 
challenge,  as  we  shall  discuss  in  detail  later. 
The  second  of   these   dynamical   eﬀects  is   conﬁnement   of  quarks.  Conﬁnement  
should  be  considered  together  with  the  closely  related  property  of  asymptotic   free­
dom,  which  is  in   a  sense  its  inverse.  Conﬁnement  and  asymptotic  freedom  occur  in 
the  sector  of  the  standard  model   dealing  with  the  strong  interaction,  quantum   chro­
modynamics  or  QCD.   In  this  context,  local  gauge   symmetry  takes  a  most  peculiar 
form.   The  fundamental   building-blocks   of  the  theory  –  quarks  and   gluons   –  trans­
form  non-trivially  under  an  SU (3)  local  gauge  symmetry.  Indeed,  the   so-called  color  
charges   of  these  particles,  which  specify  their   transformation  properties,  are   entirely  
responsible  for  their  QCD  interactions.  But   the  physical  particles  in   QCD   are   all 
singlets,   which   do  not  transform   under   the  gauge  symmetry.  They  are  formed   out   of 
combinations  of  quarks,   anti-quarks,  and   gluons  in  which   the   color   charges   all  cancel. 
Although  the  colored  building  blocks   are   real  and   tangible,  and  reveal  their  exis­
tence  quite  directly  to  suitable  probes,  they  cannot   be   separated   out  and  examined 
individually.  Attempts  to  pull  them  apart  call  ever-growing  forces  into  play,  and 
are  inevitably  frustrated.   This  is   conﬁnement.  Yet  when  the  color   charges  are   close 
together,  or  when  we  consider   processes  that   involve  large  changes  in   energy and mo­
mentum,  the  forces  are   feeble  an  d  the  radiation  is  rare.  This   is  asymptotic  freedom. 
These  unusual  behaviors  – fundamental  forces  that   grow  with  distance,  radiators   that 
become  quiescent  as  they  are  shaken  violently  –  were   once  thought   to  be  paradoxi­
cal  or  even  problematic.  They  are  now  understood  to  be  a  general  feature   of  many  
model  theories  with  local  gauge   symmetry.  They  are  deeply  related,  respectively,  to 
the  most  basic  formulation  of  local  gauge   symmetry,  and to  the  ultimate  consistency  
of  quantum  ﬁeld  theory.  
In  QCD  itself,  asymptotic   freedom  is  born  out   of  a  interplay  among  our  three  
basic  concepts  of  relativity,   quantum  mechanics,  and  gauge  symmetry.  All  three  play  
crucial  roles,  as  we   shall  see  in   detail  later.
