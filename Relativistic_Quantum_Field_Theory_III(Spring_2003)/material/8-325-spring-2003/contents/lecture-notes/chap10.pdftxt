Strong  P,  T  Problem 

One  result   of  the  analysis  is  that  a   term  ≈  �  trG  ˜G  in  the  action  of   QCD  is  not 
negligible,  even  though,   it  is  a  total  derivative  (so  it  does  not   appear  in  the   classical 
equations  of  motion). 
Since  it   is   a  dimension  4  interaction,   it  should   appear  in  our  canonical  form   for 
QCD.  Unfortunately   it violates  P  and  T ,  so  its   processes  with a  substantial coeﬃcient 
would  not  agree  with  experience.  Detailed  estimates   suggest 

θ 
(the  natural  parameter)  ≤  10−9 
| 2π | 
Since  there  is  P  and  T  violation  in  the  electroweak  interaction,  this   term  will  be 
needed  for  renormalization  so  unless  there  is  an   extra  symmetry to  explain  why  θ  ≈  0 
(or  can   be  rotated  away)  we  have  an   ugly  situation.  
The  required  symmetry   Peccei-Quinn)  is  essentially  axial  baryon  number,  since 
this  counts  (Δwinding)  and  thus  powers  of  eiθ  . 
If  there  is  a  symmetry  of   this   type  and  spontaneously  broken  at   a  high   scale   F , 
the  kinetic  term  of   its  Nambu-Goldstone  phase  ﬁeld  reads

This  puts  us   back  at   our  earlier  analysis.  We  get,   for   large  F  a  very  light,  very  
weakly interacting  particle,   the  axion. 
It   is  a  serious  candidate  to  supply   the  dark   matter  of  the  universe.
