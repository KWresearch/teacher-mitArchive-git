Lattice   Gauge 

As  I  have  mentioned   repeatedly,  this  is   the  ultimate  deﬁnition  of  QCD.  (For  elec­
troweak  theory,  there  is  no   satisfactory  non-perturbative  deﬁnition).  I  also  discussed 
before  the  process  of  dimensional  transmutation,  you  should  refer  back  to  this   after 
we  have  gone  through   the  explicit  construction  of  LGT. 
Agenda  here: 

1.  Formulation  of  pure  gauge  theory.  

2.  Formulation  of  fermion  theory,  doubling  phenomenon.  

3.  Conﬁnement   in  strong  coupling 

Euclideanize,  introduces  4d  cubic  lattice.   On  links  introduce  (for   QCD)   SU (3)  
matrices  Un1 ,n2  .

They  should  be  thought  of  as  parallel   transporters,  i.e.,  solution  of  the  equation 

Thus,  if,  say, 

then

Note  that  there  is  path-dependence  in  this  deﬁnition  of  ψ(x)  and  the  parallelism 
is   only  along  the  path.  
Let me  emphesis,  though,  that  this   is  only a  mnemonic,  for  relating to  the  (formal) 
continuous  theory.  LGT  itself  does  not  know  about   A. 

We  will  enforce  a  gauge  symmetry 

Un1n2  =  U −1 
n2n1 

Un1n2  → Ω(n1 )Un1n2 Ω−1 (n2 ) 
with  site-dependent   Ω(n)  ∈ SU (3).  Thus,  the  symmetry  group  is  SU (3)Z 4 
The  simplest  nontrivial  local  invariant  is  the  trace  around  a  plaquette

This  occurs  near  pi  ≈ 0  –  smooth  ﬁelds,  but  also  for   any  pi  =  π 
Near  pi  =  π  the  direction  of   E  as   pi  is  reversed,  so   chirality is   opposite.  
This  introduces  16  branches,  where  we  wanted  1.  You  can  scheme  this  eﬀect  but 
not  eliminate  it,  by  simple  modiﬁcations.  Recently  more  basic  methods,  involving 
adding  considerable  additional  structure  (≈ extra  dimensions,  4d  domain  wall) have 
emerged.  
The  brutal  way  (Wilson)   is  to  add

This  eliminates  the  small  energy  at  any  cos  p  =  −1.  It  also,  of  course,  violates 
chiral  symmetry explicitly. The  4 must  actually,  be  tuned,  in  an  interaction  dependent 
way,  to  get   a  light  branch. 
Massive  quarks  will  stay  put,  so  adding  a  massive  quark-antiquark  pair  separated 
at  distance  R  for   time  T  inserts   U  matrices.

The  1  term  works  ﬁne  in  the  denominator,  but  the  integration  over  links  appearing  
in  the  large  loop  will  vanish.  To  get   a  non-zero   answer  we  must   pair   these  links.

so  V  (R) ∝ R. 
Linear  potential  (⇒ conﬁnement)  is  manifest  at  strong  coupling.  Of   course,  the 
continuous  theory  –  ﬁne  lattice  spacing  –  corresponds  to  weak  coupling,  as   we  saw 
earlier.   If  there  is  no  phase  transition,  we  get   conﬁnement  there  too.  This  has   been 
shown  numerically  for   QCD.  QED  (U (1)),  on   the  other  hand,  has   a   phase  transition.
