Conversion  of  Anomalies

derived   from  axions  (CVC,  bose  statistics,  ...)  so   they  all  must  give  the  same 
answer.

4.  This  is  also  closely   commuted  to   trace  anomaly,  scaling  anomaly.  Note  these  
do  get  renormalized. 
5.  In  path   �  ,  the  anomaly  arises  from   non-invariance  of  the  measure  (Fujikawa)  .
