<h2>Exploring level curves with Functions of Two Variables</h2>

<p>
Use the <i><b>Show</b></i> menu to put the applet in input mode.<br>
Choose the input <i>x^2 - y^2 + 3</i> from the drop-down list
and click the 'plot' button.<br>
Use the <i><b>Show</b></i> menu to put the applet in level curves mode.<br>
Check the 'show all contour lines' box.<br>
<p>
Move the slider on the bottom left
back and forth and watch the yellow contour move.<br>
Explain what is happening as the slider goes through <i>z</i> = 3.
<p>
Now use the 
<i><b>Show</b></i> menu to put the applet back in in input mode and
choose input <i>x^2+y^2 + 1</i>. <br> 
Before going back to level curves
mode predict what the level curves will look like.<br>
What will they look like around the minimum at <i>(x,y) = (0,0)</i>?
