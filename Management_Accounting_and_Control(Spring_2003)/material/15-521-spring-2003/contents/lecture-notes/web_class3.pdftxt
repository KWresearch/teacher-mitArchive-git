Emrich Processing


See the exercise “Emrich Processing”: Problem 2-11 
in Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 75-6. 

Problem – Corporate Jet Co.


A firm with three divisions has two facilities, one in 
Chicago, one in Orlando. 

Everyday some of the executives in the Chicago 
office fly to the Orlando office, and others return. 
The Company is considering buying their own jet. 

What are the factors the firm must consider in their 
decision to purchase the jet? 

Agency Costs


Most economic models assume people attempt to 
maximize their well being (known as utility). 

Agency Problem:  Agents will undertake actions to 
maximize their utility regardless of whether their actions 
maximize profits. 

Moral Hazard - Insurance 
Adverse Selection - Hiring/fuse 
Short Horizon - project selection 
Free rider - Group Projects 

Napster


File Sharing community to allow a group of 
individuals to share files through the internet. 

The current innovation in this technology is 
known as Gnutella. 

It is a form of peer-to-peer technology. 

How can peer-to-peer technology be designed to 
reduce their agency problems? 

Free Riders


How do firms reduce the costs associated with free riders? 

In a multidivisional firm, there are often “public goods” provided by 
the main headquarters to all of the divisions.  How does the firm 
discourage free riders and the over use of the common good? 

- Copy centers 

- Building space 

- Human resources 

- Parking spaces 

- Capital 

University Physician (Prob 4-6)

in Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 182. 

Private Country Clubs (P4-16)

Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 185-6. 

The Equitable


Mutual Insurance Company until 1993.  Was a member of 
the Fortune 100. 

Ownership of the company is maintained by the 
policyholders. 

This means no single person owns a significant interest in 
the firm (no traded equity either) 

What are some of the problems that are likely to arise from 
the mutual form of organizational structure? 

Agency Costs


What are the factors that limit the agency costs a firm 
will incur? 

1.  The principle’s ability to monitor and thereby control 
the agent 

Monitor until: 

Marginal Costs > Marginal Benefits 

How can the firm’s internal accounting system be used 
to monitor the agent? 

Agency Costs


Consider Michael Eisner’s 1996 

employment contract with Disney:


1.	 10 year contract 
2.	 Base salary of $750,000

3.	 Bonus based on Disney meeting targeted 
EPS. 
4.	 Stock Options on 8 million shares of stock 
extending a period of 15 years. 

Agency Costs


Other Factors that limit the Agency costs of the firm: 

- The market for corporate control. 

- The competitiveness of the labor market. 

- External Competition. 

Decision Rights


For a team to produce more efficiently than each of the 
individuals, decision rights must be allocated among the 
members of the team. 

When the owner allocates decision rights, she must 
consider the following: 

1. Shirking

2  Influence Costs 

3.  Separation of decision making and 
decision control. 

Decision Rights and Accounting Systems


How is accounting information important in the allocation 
of decision rights? 

The principle should implement controls within the 
accounting system to reduce the costs associated with 
allocating decision rights.  For example: 

•	 Requiring competitive bids on purchases over a certain 
dollar amounts. 

•	 Requiring approval of purchases over certain dollar 
amounts. 

•	 Measuring firm performance that is reflective of 
managerial effort. 

Priceline.com


What is priceline.com? 

Why doesn’t Delta replicate priceline.com on their 
own ? 

Why did priceline.com work for airplane tickets 
and not for supermarkets or gas sales? 

Value Added Retailing


AT&T is in the business of providing phone service. 

One division provides phone lines for internet retailers or providers. 

These companies typically need reliable connections to the WEB and 
costly equipment to provide these services. 

AT&T has three divisions that jointly handle these transactions: 

- Sales department for telephone lines 

- Installation unit 

- Billing department for both groups 

What are some of the problems with this organizational design? 

Markets vs. Firms


When do transactions get conducted inside the firm vs. in a 
competitive market? 

For a firm to survive, it must be less costly to internally 
produce the good than going to an external market. 

Consider the following 2 examples: 

Priceline.com
