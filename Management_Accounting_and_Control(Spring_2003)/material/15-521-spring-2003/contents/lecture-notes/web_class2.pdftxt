Cost Drivers


•	 Up until this point we have focused on how costs change 
with changes in output or units sold. 

•	 There are other “cost drivers” that may better describe the 
behavior of a cost than the output of the manufacturing 
process. 

•	 Consider the following manufacturing process for insect 
traps (which I was involved in as an undergraduate.)

Cost Drivers


Most insect traps work because of Pheromones. 

Each insect has a different Pheromone, thus to make a 
particular type of insect trap, you need to mix different 
chemicals. 

We can break up the production process into the following 
activities. 

To make an insect trap you must: 
1.  Set up for mixing 
2.  Mix chemicals 
3.  Kiln chemicals 
4.  Make the traps.

Cost Drivers


To set up to mix 16 ounces to 1600 ounces of a pheromone 
for kilning takes 50 hours of labor @ $20 per hour. 

An individual Kiln can only handle up to 100 pounds of a 
pheromone, then a new kiln has to be setup. 

Thus  setup costs are fixed cost for up to 100 pounds of a 
pheromone. 

So how much would it cost (in terms of labor dollars) to 
make 250 lbs of fruit fly pheromone?

Cost Drivers


What was your first inclination to do in calculating 
the cost of making the fruit fly pheromone? 

What happens in costing this product when we add 
layers to the production process like assembly, 
disposal, shipping, receiving? 

ABC costing suggests that instead of tracking set(cid:173)
up costs per pound of pheromone, it makes pore 
sense to track set-up costs per batch kilned.

Breakeven Analysis


Consider the following format of the income statement 

Revenues 
-Variable costs 
Contribution Margin 
-Fixed Costs 
Profit 

Where the contribution margin equals fixed costs, we have 
hit the break even point. 

If we have some desired profit level, we can “work 
backwards” to determine the number of units we need to 
produce and sell to reach the desired profit.

Operating Leverage


Operating Leverage represents the ratio of fixed costs to 
total costs. 

Firms with higher operating leverage will experience 
relatively larger changes in income when there are changes 
in volume. 

This because firms with more operating leverage have 
relatively larger per unit contribution margins.

Summary


1.	 Focus on how managerial accounting information is used 
in a decision making process: 

- Incremental analysis 

- Contribution margin


- Break even analysis


2.	 Review of cost terminology 

3.	 Highlight the importance of relevant range, and cost 
drivers 

4.	 Once again reinforce the idea that we need to 

“Be aware of reported costs”
