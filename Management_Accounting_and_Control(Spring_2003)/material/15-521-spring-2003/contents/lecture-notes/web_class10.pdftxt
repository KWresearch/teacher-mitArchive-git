Absorption Costing


The focus of this class is on how to allocate manufacturing costs to the 
product. 

- Direct Materials 


- Direct Labor 


- Overhead 


Absorption costing is a process of tracing the variable costs of 
production and the fixed costs of production to the product. 

Variable Costing traces only the variable costs of production to the 
product and the fixed costs of production are treated as period 

expenses. 

Absorption Costing


There are three different types of Absorption Costing Systems: 
- Job Order Costing 
- Process Costing 
- ABC Costing 

In Job Order Costing costs are assigned to the product in Batches or lots. 
- Printing 
- Furniture manufacturing 
- Bicycle Manufacturing 

In Process Costing, costs are systematically assigned to the product, since 
there are no discreet batches to assign costs. 
- Oil Distilling 
- Soda Manufacturing 

ABC Costing assigns cost from cost centers to the product 
- Best in a multi product firm, where there are different volumes

Absorption Costing


How do we account for the production process? 

1.  Direct materials are purchased and recorded as an asset. 

2.  As direct materials are placed into production, their cost 
is transferred from the raw materials account to the Work-
in-Process account (an asset) 

3.  As direct labor costs are incurred they are recorded in a 
labor expense account.  Throughout the year they are 
transferred from the labor expense account to Work-in-
process account (an asset). 

Absorption Costing


4.  Overhead costs are initially accumulated in expense 
accounts (electricity, depreciation, etc..).  Throughout the 
year they are transferred to Work-in-process. 

5.  When goods are completed, their costs (direct materials, 
direct labor and overhead) are transferred out of Work-in-
process, and into Finished Goods. 

6.  When foods are sold, their costs are transferred out of 
finished goods inventory (an asset) and into Cost of goods 
sold (an expense). 

Absorption Costing


Important points to take away from how we account for manufacturing costs: 

1.  Initial expenditures on raw materials, direct labor, and overhead are 
CAPITALIZED (recorded as assets) in Work in process and finished goods 
inventory. 

2.  They are transferred to expense accounts when the finished goods are sold 
(they go to cost of goods sold). 

3.  Generally the cost of goods manufactured, (the costs incurred in 
manufacturing the product) will not equal the cost of goods sold. 

- This means that in any year some of the costs associated with manufacturing 
the product will not flow through the income statement as an expense, they 
will remain in the inventory accounts as assets! 

Absorption Costing


Consider the following example: 

A company is formed to manufacture computers. It starts 
the year with $2000 in cash and equity. During the year the 
company incurs $500 in payroll costs, $500 in rent for the 
plant, and $500 in raw materials.  During the year he 
makes 100 computers. 

What will his profits (or loss) be if he sells no computers? 

What will his profits be if he sells all 100 computers at $20 
per computer? 

Job Order Costing


Job Order Costing is one method of  allocating the costs of manufacturing to 
the product. 

In Job order costing the manufacturing costs are allocated to the product by 
batch. 

Job order costing is appropriate when the firm makes products in small 
batches, and each batch consumes different amounts of direct labor, direct 
materials, and processing time/energy. 

A survey in “Cost and Management Accounting Practices..” in the Management 
Accounting Research Centre indicate that job order costing is the primary method of 
costing in the following industries: 
- Electorics 
- Machinery 
- Computers 
- Furniture and fixtures 

Job Order Costing


Consider a computer manufacturing company.  They have a plant that 
receives an order for 50 computers.  They need to determine how 
much it costs to manufacture these computers. 

The batch of 50 computers starts with the introduction of direct 
materials: 

- 50 Computer Cases

- 50 Motherboards

- 50 CD drives, and floppy drives


Individuals mount equipment, add additional memory etc, to meet the 
specifications of the job. 

Special machines are also used to attach the disk drives. 

Job Order Costing


In Job order costing the manufacturing costs are allocated to the product by 
batch.  Thus the company allocates manufacturing costs to the 50 Computers 
ordered. 

The Job is assigned a Lot #.  Lets call this Lot # 1118. 

When the Parts warehouse provides 50 motherboards, cd roms etc… to the 
manufacturing group, they allocate the costs of these raw Materials to LOT 
#1118. 

The individuals that assemble these computers record the time spent 
assembling Lot 1118 on their time sheets.  The accounting system will allocate 
the payroll costs at the hourly wage rate to the job. 

Finally, the cost of the plant, the cost of the specialized machines, the utilities, 
the accounting system that tracks costs within the plant, the accountant 
running the system etc… must be allocated to the product.  This is known as 
overhead allocation. 

Job Order Costing

Direct Materials: 

50 Motherboards @ $200 per board 

50 Floppy Disk Drives @ $50 per drive 

50 CD Rom drives @ $20 per dirve 

50 Cases @ $20 per case

Job Order Costing


A natural question to ask with this example, is how do we determine 
the overhead allocation rate? 

1.  Estimate total Overhead for the plant for the year. 

2.  Select an activity base to allocate overhead costs to the product. 

3.  Estimate expected usage of the activity base. 

4.  Overhead allocation Rate = 	 Estimated Overhead Costs 

Estimated Activity Base 

Job Order Costing


Suppose the company estimates overhead costs for the 
plant to be to be $1,000,000 and direct labor hours to be 
1000 hours. 

What is the overhead application rate?


What happens if the employees only work 900 hours?


What happens if the employees work 1100 hours?


What happens if the price of heating oil is greater than 

expected?


Job Order Costing


What happens to the under or over applied overhead? 

1.  Write-off directly to cost of goods sold. 

2.  Write off proportionately to WIP, Finished goods and 
Cost of goods sold. 

3.  Re-allocate costs to all products to “correctly” allocate 
overhead to WIP, Finished goods, and Cost of goods sold.

Process Costing


A process cost system is used when a manufacturing 
company makes large volumes of identical products. 
(pharmaceuticals, bottles of Pepsi, gallons of oil) 

Each unit consumes the same amount of direct materials, 
direct labor and indirect costs (overhead) 

Instead of assigning costs to jobs, then averaged across the 
job to get a per unit cost, process costing assigns costs to 
the product through each process the product goes through. 

Process Costing


Consider a Cola Manufacturer 


Mixing 

Bottling 

Distribution 

Direct materials (sugar, water, coloring)are mixed.


They are poured into a bottle.


Carbonation is added.


They are capped.


Process Costing


How does process costing differ from job 

costing?


Survey indicates that Process costing is most 
often used in the following industries: 

1.  Oil refining (100%) 

2.  Chemicals 

3.  Pharmaceuticals 

4.  Food and Beverage 

Absorption Costing - Problems


1.  In an absorption cost system such as Job order costing, 
what happens to plant profitability if additional output is 
produced and not sold? 

2.  Suppose you allocate overhead using direct labor hours, 
and a special order comes in that requires the factory be 
completely recalibrated, to process the job.  Will this cost 
be traced back to the job? 

Variable Costing


Variable costing tries to reduce the incentive to over 
produce by charging fixed overhead costs to expense in the 
period they are incurred, and allocating only variable costs. 

Increasing production does not allow a firm to move fixed 
costs out of COGS and into inventory.
