1. Motivation for the importance of cost allocations.

2.  How do we allocate costs? 

3. Effects of cost allocations?

4.  Examples 

5.  Concluding comments 

Why are cost allocations important?


Consider the apartment you shared with someone that was 
not related to you, how did you pay for the following? 

- Rent 

- Phone 

- Food 

- Electric 

- Cable 

- Gas 

Does the method you allocate costs matter?  Why? 


Will the method you select affect the total cost incurred? 


Cost Allocations


Consider a very simple example where an individual buys an office 
building and rents the building to tenants. 

The owner of the office building has a problem. She has to pay for 
common area maintenance costs such as: 

- Lighting and heating in the lobby and halls 
- Snow removal and parking lot maintenance. 
- Security 
- Building Management 
- Roof maintenance 
- Property taxes 

All of the tenets in the office building benefit from these expenditures.  

What should the manager do? 

Cost Allocations


1.  What happens if the manager does not charge 
the tenants for these costs? 

2.  What happens if the manager charges an 
average rate per tenant? 

3.  How are these costs consumed?  What is the 
cost object? 

4.  What costs need to be assigned? 

5.  How would you assign them? 

Cost Allocations


How would you assign the costs of a 
maintenance department to the tenants of 
the building? 

Why doesn’t the tenants rent include a 
CAM charge?  Why is this separate from 
the rent? 

Cost Allocations


Now think of the firm as the office building and each of 
the tenants as a product the firm manufactures. 

Common area costs include the cost of the plant, the 
payroll department, the janitorial staff, the benefits office, 
the accountants, etc… 

These costs must be allocated to the products. 

How the costs are allocated is going to affect the profits of 
the entire firm, and the behavior of the manager. 

Why Allocate Costs


- Third Party reimbursements 
- Rate regulated industries 
- Governmental subsidies 
- Cost plus contracts 

- External Reporting/Taxes 
- FASB and IRS requires allocation. 

- Costing products accurately is important. 
- Decision Making 
- Control 

Cost Allocations


Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. has acknowledged that 
some Washington lobbying expenses incurred by its parent 
corporation were improperly included in the company's 
regulated interstate rate base. 

The lobbying expenses totaled about $1.4 million over a 
five-year period and included money spent to promote 
changes in the Modified Final Judgment, according to 
documents submitted this month to the Federal 
Communications Commission.

Cost Allocations


As part of its costs related to treating Medicaid patients, St. 
Elizabeth Medical Center in Covington included $13,466 
for Cincinnati Reds box seats. Owensboro-Daviess County 
Hospital included a $35,000 payment to settle a sexual-
harassment case against a doctor. And Columbia Suburban 
Hospital in Jefferson County put down $117,700 worth of 
free meals for doctors. These were among the expenses 
that Kentucky hospitals submitted as part of their costs in 
reports to the state Medicaid program.

Cost Allocation


According to Strategic Cost Management, Free Press, 
1993. 

There is a billion-dollar-a-year market in strategic cost 
management consulting services dominated by such 
firms as Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, 
Booz-Allen & Hamilton, McKinsey etc. 

Cost Allocation


There are also consulting firms that develop niche groups 
that are experts in cost allocations for example: 

Brattle Group – Energy Department 

We address the economic and financial issues raised by the 
allocation of costs over time or among different services 
and customers. 

What costs are allocated?


In a single product firm, that has one customer, and only one division 
there is no need to worry about cost allocations. 

Most companies are: 
- Multi Divisional 
- Offer a variety of Products 
- Thousands of Customers 

Divisions, products, and customers consume common costs at different 
rates, or in different amounts. 

An effective cost allocation system will more accurately trace the 
shared costs of production to the divisions, products and customers that 
consume those costs. 

What are the common Costs of production ?


Overhead 

1.	 How are overhead costs consumed in the plant? 
2.	
Can these costs be traced back to products? 
3.	 What costs can and can not be traced back to individual products? 
- Maintenance 
- Electricity 
- Benefits department 
- Plant costs 
- CEO time 
- Customer service 
4.	 How do we allocated the costs that can not be traced back to the 
product? 
5.	 Does the method used to allocate these costs matter? 

Cost Allocations


The method of allocating costs and the amount of costs allocated are 
important for the following reasons: 

1. 
The method of allocating costs will determine the use of common 
assets. 

- Internal Taxation

- Internal Subsidization


2.  The method of allocation may also affect whether divisions 
compete or coordinate. 

- Insulating Allocation

- Non-insulating allocation.


3.  Cost allocations affect performance and compensation.
