Standard Costs


What are standard Costs?


Standard costs are the expected costs of manufacturing the product.


Standard Direct Labor Costs = Expected wage rate X Expected 

number of hours


Standard Direct Materials cost = Expected cost of raw materials X 

Expected number of units of raw material.


Standard overhead costs = Expected fixed OH + Expected Variable 

Overhead X Expected number of units to be produced. 


Standard Costs


What is a standard Cost system? 

A standard cost system is a method of setting cost targets and 
evaluating performance. 

Targets or expected costs are set based on a variety of criteria, and 
actual performance relative to expected targets is measured. 

Significant differences between expectations and actual results are 
investigated. 

Consistent with the themes developed throughout this class, standard 
cost systems are a means of helping managers with decision making 
and control. 

Standard Costs


Target Costing 

1.  The market place determines the selling price of the 
future product 

2.  The company determines the profit margin they desire 
to achieve on this product. 

3.  The difference between the selling price and the profit 
margin is the target cost 

Standard Costs


Why use a standard cost system? 

1.  Standards are important for decision making 

- How we produce our product. 

- How we price our product. 

- Contract billing 

2.  Monitor manufacturing 

- Large variances may indicative of problems in production. 

3.  Performance measurement 

- Deviations between actual and standards are often used as 

measures of a manager’s performance


- Who sets the standard?

How do we set the standards? 

Theoretically the standard should be the expected cost of producing the 
product. 

General practices:
General practices:
1.  Prior years performance 

2.  Expected future performance under normal operating 

conditions. 

3.  Optimistic (Motivator)

Important considerations in setting standards: 

1.  Why are senior managers using standards? 


- Pricing


- Performance measurement


- Production decisions


2.  What happens if managers fail to meet the standards? 

3.  Standards are supposed to represent the opportunity cost of 

production.

Standard Costs


There are three types of overhead variances that are commonly computed in standard 
cost systems.  Before we describe each of these variances we need to do a brief review 
on overhead. 

1.  Overhead consists of both fixed costs and variable costs. 

2.  Overhead is allocated to the product using an activity base. 

Thus overhead variances can occur for three reasons 

1.  the activity base estimate is different than the actual activity base. 

2.  The amount spent for fixed overhead differs from the standard. 

3.  The amount spent on variable overhead (the rate per unit) differs from the standard. 

Standard Costs


Overhead spending variance 

This variance is designed to measure how much 
overhead was actually incurred compared to the 
overhead that should have been incurred at the 
actual volume for the activity base. 

Spending variance = Actual overhead – budgeted 
fixed costs – budgeted variable overhead 
allocation rate * actual activity base. 

Standard Costs


Overhead efficiency variance 

This variance is a measure of the effect of the 
difference in the amount of an activity base 
incurred compared to the expected amount of the 
activity base. 

Using additional machine hours or direct labor 
hours causes additional variable overhead 

Efficiency variance = Variable overhead 
allocation rate * ( actual activity base – budgeted 
activity base) 

Western Sugar (Problem 13-9)


See the exercise “Western Sugar”: Problem 13-9 in Zimmerman, 
Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and Control (4th  Edition). 
McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 660-1. 

Standard Costs


Overhead volume variance 

The overhead volume variance measures the cost or benefits of using less or 
more than expected capacity. 

Volume Variance = Fixed Overhead *(Budgeted volume – actual volume) 

budgeted volume 

If budgeted volume = actual volume, then you have derived no extra benefits 
or costs associated with capacity. 

When budgeted volume is less than expected volume, then the fixed costs 
associated with providing capacity are greater than expectations 

Standard Costs


When standards are used to measure performance, then the manager has an 
incentive to insure production costs come in below standards.  Consider the 
following good and bad incentives: 

1.  Direct Material Price standards create the incentive to purchase materials in 
large volume to get price discounts. 

2.  Direct Material Price standards create the incentive to reduce the quality of 
the material purchased. 

3.  Standards create the incentive for cross monitoring.  When managers are 
held responsible for costs that are outside of their control, they will monitor 
other managers to ensure they meet standards. 

4.  Managers also have the incentive to control costs so long as they do not 
exceed the standard.  No incentive to reduce costs below standard. 

Standard Costs


What controls can you implement to discourage 
the harmful incentives and encourage the 
productive incentives? 

Just-in-time inventory 

System of Quality Control 

Engineering specifications 

Controllability of Costs 

Non-linear reward system for cost reduction. 

Activity Based Costing


How do we use Activity Based Costing? 

1.  Costs are accumulated in activity centers (a.k.a. Cost Centers such as order 
processing or special components) 

2.  Managers select an activity base for the center to apply the cost to the product. 

- Multiple cost drivers in the firm 

- Use non-financial measures to reduce the tax on production 


activities.


- Four Basic types of Cost Drivers: 

1.  Unit level 

2.  Batch Level 

3.  Product Level 

4.  Production Sustaining Costs 

3.  Costs are allocated to the product as the product passes through the activity center. 

Activity Based Costing


What are the benefits of using Activity Based Costing Systems? 

1.  More costs are traced to the product. 

2.  Activity Based Costing Requires managers to obtain a better understanding 
of: 

- How costs are consumed by individual products.

- The different activities that produce products.

- The indirect costs associated with these activities.

- How indirect costs relate to cost drivers.


3.  Product costs are more accurate.


Proponents argue that having more accurate costs will help in decision making


Activity Based Costing 

Key Points regarding Activity Based Costing: 

1.  Useful for developing a more accurate measure of the cost of 
multiple products with different levels of manufacturing sophistication 
and different volumes of production. 

2.  Managers must recognize that overhead varies by factors other than 
volume of production for the product. 

3.  The managers ability to successfully identify these cost drivers will 
ultimately determine the usefulness of an ABC costing system. 

Activity Based Costing


What are the costs of implementing an Activity Based Cost system? 

1.  Updating the accounting system and maintaining an ABC system requires 
additional time and money. 

2.  Managers select cost drivers in their activity centers.  There is a tradeoff 
between decision making and control. 

3.  While ABC systems may more accurately measure costs, they ignore the 
benefits of a multi-product production strategy. 

4.  Generally ABC system demonstrate that low volume products are more 
costly to produce than high volume products.  This is a very costly method to 
derive this result.
