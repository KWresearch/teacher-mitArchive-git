Budgeting - Overview


1.  Budgets as a mechanism of partitioning decision rights and as a 
mechanism for control. 
- Decision management

- Decision control


2.  Incentives 
- Performance measurement 
- Compensation 
- Horizon problem 
- Perverse Incentives 

3.  Types of budgets 
- Line Item Budgets 
- Lapsing Budget 
- Flexible Budget 
- Zero based budgets 
- Incremental Budgets 

Budgeting


Theoretically, budgets serve two roles: 

1.  Allocate Decision Rights: 

- Decision Initiation – Budget Preparation


- Decision Implementation – Operating Decisions


2.  Control Behavior 

- Decision Ratification


- Decision Monitoring


Budgets are also used as a method of measuring 
performance, a mechanism to plan expenditures, and to 
reward performance. 

Budgeting


Let’s make sure we know what budgets are from a practical 
perspective: 

1.  They are plans for 1 to 10 years for all of the business units. 

2.  The budgets serves as a mechanism for coordinating production and 
sales 

3.  Estimates are compared to actual as a means of evaluating 
performance. 

4.  Budget variances are often used as a means of punishing and 
rewarding behavior. 

5.  Budgets are updated to reflect outcomes. 

Budgeting


Firms often use budgets to measure the performance of 

managers.


When budgets are used to measure performance we need 

to think about the concepts of:


- Controllable Variances


- Uncontrollable Variances


Rosebud (Prob 6-28)


See the exercise “Old Rosebud Farms”: Problem 6-28 in 
Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 316-7. 

Budgeting

We also need to think about how do you account for 
volume effects? 

What happens when there is a reduction in volume? 

Does it matter if it is controllable? 

- Static vs. Flexible Budgets. 

Golf World (prob 6-9)


See the exercise “Golf World”: Problem 6-9 in Zimmerman, 
Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and Control (4th 
Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 301-2. 

Budgeting -Textbook sales


When budgets are used to measure performance, they are also often used in the 
compensation scheme. 

Consider the following compensation scheme used in textbook sales. 

The head office forecasts sales for each sales territory using the ratcheting 
principle. 

The sales rep prepares a budget for complementary books and over night visits 
that is approved by the head office. 

Sales reps are compensated a fixed salary and receive a fixed bonus for 
reaching their budgeted revenues 
They receive a small fractional increase bonus money for each dollar of sales 
generated over the budgeted amount through 110% of the budget 

Larger bonuses if budgeted revenues are exceeded by more than 10%. 

Budgeting -Textbook sales


What are the sales rep’s incentives? 

What mechanisms does the sales rep have to influence 
actual outcomes 

What do you think the sales pattern of a textbook rep looks 
like over time? 

What incentives does the rep have if incentive pay is based 
on budgeted income instead of budgeted revenue?

What is a line item budget?


How are decision rights allocated in line 
item budgets? 

How does a line item budget control 
behavior? 

What incentives do line item budgets 
provide? 

Budgeting


What is a lapsing budget?


How are decision rights allocated in lapsing 
budgets? 

How does a lapsing budget control 
behavior? 

What incentives do lapsing budgets 
provide? 

Budgeting


What is a zero based budget?


How are decision rights allocated in zero based 

budgets?


How does a zero based budget control behavior?


What incentives do zero based budgets provide?


Budgeting


What is an incremental budget?


How are decision rights allocated in incremental 

budgets?


How does an incremental budget control 

behavior?


What incentives do incremental budgets provide?


Budgets - Summary


Budgets are an important mechanism in the 

allocation of decision rights.


Budgets are often used to measure performance


Budgets are also used as a mechanism for control.


There is a tradeoff between decision control and 

decision management


Identify the strengths and weaknesses of various 
types of budgets.
