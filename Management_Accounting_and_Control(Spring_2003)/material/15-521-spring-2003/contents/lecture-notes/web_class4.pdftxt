Allocation of Decision Rights


As we discussed on Monday, in firms owners often have to 
allocate decision rights to managers. 

Firms are often divided into subunits. 

The decision rights assigned to a subunit are used to 
classify the unit as a: 

1.  Cost Center 

2.  Profit Center 

3. Investment Center

Cost Centers


Decision rights 
1.  labor 
2.  Supplies 
3.  Materials 

Performance measures 

1.  Minimize total cost for a selected level of output. 

2.  Maximize total output for a given budget. 

Problems: 

Quality for Quantity Tradeoff 

Average cost crates incentive to  overproduce 

Profit Centers


Decision Rights 

1.  Input Mix (see Cost Centers) 
2.  Product Mix 
3.  Selling Price 

Performance Measurement 

-

Accounting profits compared to budget or some expectation. 

Problems 

- Interdependencies of profit centers.

- Transfer Pricing

- Cost Allocation


Investment Centers


Decision Rights: 

1.  Input Mix 

2.  Product Mix 

3.  Selling Prices 

4.  Capital Investment 

Performance measures 

1.  Net Income 

2.  Return on Investment 

3.  Residual Income 

4.  EVA 

Performance Measures -Net Income


Net income is generally defined as the revenues of the 
investment center less the costs of the investment center. 
Where the costs include the allocated costs or overhead. 

Strengths: 

Weaknesses: 

Performance Measures - ROI


Return on Investment is generally defined as the net 
income of the investment center divided by some measure 
of assets (typically total assets or net assets) 

Strengths:. 

Weaknesses: 

Performance Measures – Residual Income


Residual Income is a variant of ROI.  Residual income is 
calculated as the investment center’s Net income less a 
targeted return times assets (or net assets). 

Strengths: 

Weaknesses: 

Performance Measures - EVA


EVA is basically the same as residual income.  There are three 

adjustments: 
1.  Accounting earnings are adjusted. 

2. 

They use WACC, weighted average cost of capital. 

3.  Highlights how compensation should be linked to EVA. 

Strengths: 

Weaknesses: 

Canadian Sub (Prob 5-1)


See the exercise “Canadian Submarine”: Problem 5-1 
in Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 230. 

Quincy’s Insurance


Sometime in the late 1980’s early 1990’s The Bull Dog 

insurance company stopped selling Major Medical 

Insurance.


Policies still needed to be serviced. 

Bull Dog Insurance contracted with Quincy’s to administer 
the line of business. 

Quincy’s pays claims, handles complaints, and makes 
policy changes. 

Quincy’s is compensated an annual fee and a bonus.  All 

costs incurred in administrating the book of business are 

paid by Quincy’s


Quincy’s Insurance


Quincy’s Bonus has three key ingredients: 

1.  $250,000 based on reduction of  claim backlog. 

2.  Per file bonus for paying more than the base number of 
claims established in the contract. 

3.  A bonus based on the size of the book of business. 

What types of behavior does this compensation package 
encourage? 

Quincy’s Insurance


1.  Low skilled laborers. 

2.  High Turnover. 

3.  Easy claim payments 

4.  “Super” customer service. 

5.  Quality control was done in house, there was no penalty 
for poor quality. 

Stale Mart (Prob 5-19)


See the exercise “Stale Mart”: Problem 5-19 in Zimmerman, 
Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and Control (4th  Edition). 
McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 240-1. 

Controllability Principle


What metric should be selected to evaluate a unit’s 
performance? 

How is the performance evaluation mechanism 
affected by random shocks? 

Does the performance evaluation system induce 
dysfunctional behavior. 

Accounting Information used in transfer pricing


Perfect information vs. Asymmetric information 

Types of transfer pricing: 

1.  Market Based 

2.  Variable Cost 

3.  Full Cost 

4.  Negotiated 

Accounting Information used in transfer pricing


Transfer pricing is important to 

- Cost Centers 

- Profit Centers 

- Investment Centers 

Transfer Pricing – Internal Audit


Internal audit is traditionally a cost center.


What happens if you allow audit to price its product and 

charge units?


Key Lessons:


- Incentives to be efficient?

- Incentives to consult?

- Potential Disputes?


Alternatives:


- Compensation for cost cutting and innovations.


Lewis Corporation (Prob 5-9)


See the exercise “Lewis Corporation”: Problem 5-9 in 
Zimmerman, Jerold L. Accounting for Decision Making and 
Control (4th  Edition). McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2002, pp 234. 

Pepsi Co.  (Prob 5-17)

L. Accounting for Decision Making and Control (4th  Edition).

Summary


1.  Develop an understanding of cost Centers, 
profit centers and investment centers. 

2.  Consider the different means of measuring 
performance and the strengths and weaknesses of 
each alternative. 

3.  Develop an understanding of the importance of 
transfer pricing within the firm.
