Weber’s Customized Electronics 

Overview 

Weber’s Customized Electronics was  founded  in 1990. T.J. Weber,  an  engineer with 20 
years  in  the  airline  industry,  founded  the  company.  The  company  initially  supplied 
customized  electronic  components  to  the  military.  As  the  company  prospered,  the  firm 
expanded  by  purchasing  some  of  their  competitors,  and  bidding  on  outsourced  business 
from the commercial airline industry. 

By  April  2002,  Weber’s  had  become  a  multidivisional  corporation  (twelve  in  total) 
producing  a  variety  of  customized  electronic  components  for  the  airline  and  automobile 
industries as well as the military. 

The  Electronics  Testing  Division  (ETD)  is  one  of  the  twelve  divisions.  ETD  provides 
centralized  testing  for  the  electronic  components  produced  in  the  other  11  divisions. 
ETD  was  created  in  1997  as  a  result  of  a  strategic  reorganization  of  the  company.  As 
Weber’s  expanded  in  the  1990’s  each  division  separately  employed  various  machinery 
and  personnel  to  test  the  integrated  circuits  (I.C.’s),  diodes,  transistors,  capacitors, 
resistors,  transformers,  relays  and  crystals  that  were  used  in  the  various  products.  The 
costs  of  the  machinery  and  the  personnel  in  each  division  were  substantial,  and 
management believed that consolidating testing into one central division that serviced the 
other eleven divisions in the corporation would result in substantial cost savings. 

ETD was organized  as  a  cost  center. The other  eleven divisions would provide products 
to  the  division  to  be  tested,  and  the  costs  of  testing  these  products were  transferred  back 
to  the divisions at  full cost  (direct  labor cost and allocated burden  for overhead,  there are 
no  direct materials  used  in  this  division). Although  ETD  is  a  captive  division,  the  other 
divisions  in Weber’s were  allowed  to  use  outside  testing  services  if ETD  could  not meet 
their  cost  or  service  requirement.  Furthermore,  ETD  was  permitted  to  use  20%  of  their 
capacity  to  test  the  circuits,  diodes,  transistors,  capacitors,  resistors,  transformers,  relays 
and  crystals  of  outside  companies.1  The  department  has  no  budget  for  advertising  or 
marketing services, thus most outside customers were obtained by word of mouth. 

ETD  employed  approximately  65  hourly  personnel  and  40  administrative  and  technical 
staff members. Budgeted expenses were 7.9 million in 2002 (See Exhibit 1) 

Testing Procedures 

ETD  had  tested  30 million  components  in  2001  and  expected  to  test  between  35  and  40 
million  components  in  2002. Component  testing was  required  for  two  reasons.  First,  if 
defective components were not caught early in the manufacturing cycle, the cost of repair 
could be  substantial. Studies  indicated  that  a defective  capacitor  caught before  its use  in

 The division was expected to make a 15% profit margin on outside business. 

the manufacturing process, cost two cents to repair. If the defect was not caught until the 
product  was  out  in  the  field,  the  costs  of  replacing  the  capacitor  could  run  in  to  the 
thousands  of  dollars,  greatly  exceeding  the  cost  of  the  electronic  component.  Second,  a 
large proportion of Weber’s work was defense related. Military specifications frequently 
required extensive testing of components used in aerospace and naval products. By 2002, 
ETD  had  the  ability  to  test  6500  different  types  of  components.  Typically  the  division 
would  test  500  different  components  a  month  and  between  3000  and  3500  different 
components per year. Each division or outside customer would send components to ETD 
in  lots.  ETD  would  then  test  each  lot  and  the  defective  pieces  would  be  identified  and 
separated for retooling. In 2002, ETD expected to receive 12,000 lots of components. 

ETD  performs  both  electrical  and  manufacturing  testing.  Electrical  Testing  involves 
measuring  the  electrical  characteristics  of  the  components  and  comparing  these 
measurements with the component’s specifications. For example, the specifications of an 
amplifier may  have  called  for  a  1-volt  input  to  be  amplified  into  a  10-volt  output.  ETD 
would  deliver  a  1-volt  charge  to  the  amplifier,  and  then measure whether  the  amplifier’s 
output was in conformance with specifications. 

Mechanical  testing  included  solderability,  component  burn-in,  thermal  shock,  lead 
straightening  and  leak detection. Solderability  involved  the  inspection of  components  to 
ensure  they  held  solder. Burn-in  involves  the  extended  powering  of  components  at  high 
temperatures. Thermal  shock  involves  the cycling of  components between high  and  low 
temperatures.  Lead  straightening  was  the  detection  and  correction  of  bent  leads  on 
components.  Leak  detection  involved  the  examining  of  hermetically  sealed  I.C.s  for 
leaks. 

Components varied  significantly  in  the number and  the  type of electrical and mechanical 
testing  procedures  they  required.  This  variation  resulted  in  about  200  different  standard 
process  flows  for  the  division.  One  manager  in  the  division  was  responsible  for 
determining  the  process  flows  in  the  facility.  He  organized  the  monthly  testing  runs 
based  on  the  different  combinations  of  tests  and  specifications  the  customer  requests. 
Based  on  these  combinations,  he  would  determine  the  routing  of  the  product  between 
testing  equipment  and  the  type  of  tests  performed  at  each  station.  I.C.s,  for  example, 
could  follow  up  to  twelve  different  flows  through  the  facilities.  Some  of  the  I.C.’s  only 
require  electrical  testing  at  room  temperature;  others  required  solderability  and  leak 
detection as well as thermal shock and burn-in tests. 

Each  type  of  component  required  separate  software  development,  custom  tools,  and 
occasionally  custom  fixtures  were  also  required.  Software,  tools,  and  fixtures  were 
developed  by  the  engineering  group,  which  was  made  up  of  specialists  in  software 
development,  equipment  maintenance,  calibration  and  repair,  tooling  and  fixturing,  and 
testing operation. Software engineers developed programs for specific applications. The 
programs were then retained in the software library for future use. During 2002 ETD has 
added  another 1300  software programs  to  the  library,  increasing  the  total  in  the  software 
library  to  over  6500  different  software  programs.  ETD  also  had  an  inventory  of  1500 
tools  and  fixtures,  of which  300  had  been  developed  in  the  past  year. The  large  number 

of  tools  and  fixtures  allowed  the  testing  of  components  with  a  variety  of  leads,  pin 
combinations, and mating configurations. 

ETD  monitored  the  costs  and  the  processes  that  were  necessary  to  test  the  various 
components  Weber’s  produced,  and  they  often  compared  their  costs  to  bids  from  their 
competitors.  On  complex  parts  that  require  screening,  environmental  conditioning,  the 
division  was  consistently  cheaper  than  outside  vendors. Where  only  elementary  testing 
was required, low technology outside laboratories were often cheaper, especially on large 
lots. The  division manager  at ETD, Susan Swampscott,  believed  that  the  advantage  that 
the  division  brought  customers  over  the  outside  labs  was  that  the  latter  had  almost  no 
engineering  support,  while  ETD  has  engineering  resources  available  to  quickly  design 
and  implement  tests  on  complex  parts  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  The  shift  to  more 
technically  sophisticated  services  has  prompted  a  shift  in  the  labor  mix  from  direct  to 
indirect  personnel.  The  division  expected  to  see  a  crossover  between  engineering  head 
count and hourly headcount some time in the next three years. 

The  testing  facility was divided  into  three  rooms. The stock  room housed administrative 
personnel, and also was designed  for  receiving  incoming components  for  testing, and  for 
sorting outgoing products  that had already been  tested. The main  testing room contained 
the equipment used  for electrical  testing. The mechanical  room contained  the equipment 
used  for  mechanical  testing.  30  people  worked  in  the  mechanical  room  and  another  30 
people  worked  in  the  main  testing  room.  The  remaining  5  people  worked  in  the  stock 
room. 

Recently there had been some innovations at Weber’s that were likely to affect the testing 
of  components.  First,  Weber’s  has  been  moving  towards  producing  high-technology 
components,  creating  the  need  for  automatic  testing  on  sophisticated  equipment. 
Automatic  testing  will  lead  to  longer  test  cycles  and  more  data  per  part.  For  example, 
digital  components  are  currently  tested  for  up  to  100  conditions  (a  condition  is  a 
combination  of  electrical  input  and  output  state).  The  new  generation  of  digital 
components  is  so  much  more  complex  that  they  require  the  verification  of  up  to  10,000 
conditions.  These  components  require  expensive  highly  automated  equipment  and  less 
direct labor to complete the tests. 

Second, in 2002, Weber’s adopted a Just-in-Time inventory system for all of its divisions. 
As  part  of  the  adoption  of  this  system,  Weber’s  implemented  a  vendor  certification 
program, where Weber’s engineers verified that vendor’s production process would result 
in  pieces  of  components  that  met  required  engineering  specifications.  As  each  division 
determines which  of  their  vendors must  be  certified,  the  testing  of  some  of  the  pieces  of 
Weber’s electrical components will be pushed back to the vendor. ETD was expecting to 
move  from  the  primary  tester  of  several  components  to  a  quality  inspector  of  these 
components. Thus instead of testing every component in a lot, ETD would use statistical 
sampling  and  test  a  percentage  of  the  components  to  insure  that  the  vendors  supplied 
pieces  that  met  the  firms  engineering  standards.  Early  indications  suggest  that  the  JIT 
system  will  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  smaller  lots  being  received  by  ETD,  and 
vendor certification will reduce  the number of  tests  that ETD will have  to perform. ETD 

forecasts  that  over  the  next  three  years,  30%  of  the  products  produced  by  Weber’s  will 
have been initially tested by certified vendors. 

Cost Accounting System 

The  cost  accounting  system  measures  two  components  of  cost:  Direct  Labor  and 
Overhead.  The  Overhead  costs  were  accumulated  into  a  single  cost  pool.  All  of  the 
overhead  costs  associated  each  of  the  testing  rooms,  the  stock  room,  and  the  costs  of 
engineering,  software  development,  and  tooling/fixtures  development  were  accumulated 
in  this  pool.  Total  overhead  costs  were  divided  by  the  sum  of  testing  and  engineering 
labor dollars to arrive at a burden rate per direct labor dollar. The division costed each lot 
of components. The overhead allocated  to each  lot by multiplying  the actual direct  labor 
dollars  associated  with  the  lot  by  the  burden  rate.  Thus  the  total  cost  associated  with 
testing  a  lot  of  components  is  the  sum  of  the  direct  labor  and  overhead.  In  2002,  the 
facility  wide  burden  rate  was  145%  of  each  direct  labor  dollar.  (See  Exhibit  1  for  a 
description of the overhead costs, and the calculation of the burden rate for 2002.) 

Current Events 

In  April  2002,  Stacy  Swampscott,  the  manager  in  charge  of  ETD,  was  reviewing  the 
results  for  the  division  for  the  first  quarter.  She  realized  that  this  was  the  second 
consecutive  quarter  in  which  the  Aerospace  division  had  reduced  the  number  of 
components  they  had  sent  to  ETD  for  testing.  She  assigned  her  assistant manager,  Fred 
Dusseldorf,  to  find  out  why  aerospace  was  reducing  their  use  of  ETD.  Fred  had 
determined  that  Aerospace  was  outsourcing  testing  for  some  of  their  components. 
Furthermore,  the  division  manager  of  the  military  department  in  Weber’s  had  recently 
suggested  that  they  might  outsource  some  of  their  testing  because  ETD’s  costs  were 
getting a  little high. The manager of  the Aerospace division had complained  to Fred  that, 
“I do not know what you all are paying your people over  there, but ABC  labs came  in at 
25% of your cost.” 

This  seemed  strange  to Susan.  Just  this quarter,  the department had won  an  external bid 
for  testing  components  for  a  defense  contractor,  Spellman  Industries,  that  does  not 
compete  with  Weber’s.  When  her  production  manager,  Hank  Kellog,  had  prepared  the 
estimate  for  the  costs  of  the  new  job,  he  had  determined  that  testing  on  this  product 
would  require  that  the  department  purchase  another  machine,  that  would  cost  the 
department  approximately  $2,000,000. However,  similar  to  the  last  two  external  testing 
jobs, the testing on this component was almost entirely automated, direct labor costs were 
estimated  to be  less  than $50,000, handling costs were estimated  to be  less  than $15,000, 
and  other  engineering  and  overhead  costs  associated  with  this  job  were  expected  to  be 
less  than  $100,000.  He  also  determined  that  after  the  job  was  completed,  the  machine 
could  be  retooled  and  used  to  help  test  some  of  the  military  parts  for  which  testing  was 
currently outsourced. Since the machine could be used to test other products in Weber’s, 
her  assistant  prepared  the  bid  by  calculating  a  revised  cost  estimate  using  the  2002 
budget, and applying a 20% margin to those costs. 

She  decided  it  was  time  to  have  a  meeting  with  Fred  and  Hank  to  see  if  she  could 
determine  what  was  happening  with  the  division’s  costs.  Since  the  aerospace  division 
manager  was  complaining  about  her  direct  labor  costs,  she  asked  Fred  to  analyze  the 
departments  labor  costs  over  the  last  two  years  focusing  on  the  direct  labor  costs  for 
aerospace  components  (Exhibit 2),  and  she  asked Hank  to bring his  estimates  for  the bid 
the department had recently won (Exhibit 4). 

The Meeting 

Fred: Well Susan, I  talked  to Ross Watts,  the manager  in charge of process flows, and I 
thought  we  might  be  onto  something  by  analyzing  the  labor  costs  of  testing  electronics 
components  of  the  Aeronautics  division.  Ross  indicated  that  we  were  testing  about 
60,000 units a month  for  this division, and  that  the  testing of Aeronautics Components  is 
mostly  a  manual  process,  done  on  simple  machines,  and  require  relatively  more  direct 
labor hours. 

So  the  first  thing  I did was  investigate whether  the  increase  in  the union  rates was  larger 
than we had anticipated. As you can  see  from  this graph  (Exhibit 2),  last March  the  line 
personnel  got  a  3%  raise,  so  I  don’t  think  the  slight  increase  in  the  wage  rate  is  the 
driving factor in the difference between our costs and our competitors. 

I also looked at the direct labor costs for testing the Aeronautics components. In total, the 
costs look relatively stable at about $10,000 per month until the 4th  quarter of 2001. Then 
they  outsourced  the  Fetzner  boards  to  ABC  LABS,  and  in  January  they  outsourced  the 
splintners  circuits.  Thus  the  direct  labor  costs  associated  with  testing  Aeronautics 
electronic components dropped. 

I also checked the Dl$ per unit tested, and compared it to the average DL$ per unit tested 
for the company. As you can see in this third graph, the Dl$ per unit tested is higher than 
the  average  unit  tested  in  the  company,  but  it  is  very  stable  and  actually  decreasing 
slightly  for  the products we  test  in  this division. We  implemented  a  slight  change  in  the 
process  flow  that  allowed  laborers  to  handle more  units  per  hour.  I  just  don’t  think  our 
labor  costs  are  the  source  of  the  problem.  Maybe  the  costs  of  our  overhead  have 
increased?  Or perhaps ABC LABS has figured out a way to do this better? 

Susan:  I  was  afraid  that  it  wasn’t  the  direct  labor  costs  Fred.  I  went  and  looked  at  the 
direct  labor  costs  for  our  entire  department,  and  they  look  like  they  have  are  expected  to 
go  down  this  year  as  we  bring  on  more  of  these  automated  testing  machines.  I  also 
looked  at  the  total  overhead  for  the  department,  and  total  cost  of  the  department  and  I 
don’t  see much of a change  (See Exhibit 3). Since  I don’t  see a  large percentage change 
in  costs,  our  competitors must  have made  some  technological  improvement  in  how  they 
test these electronic components. 

Susan: What amazes me is that we seem to be losing some of our divisions as customers 
but external customers seem to find us to be the low cost bidder. Hank, how did we 
determine the cost to charge Spellman for their components? 

Hank: Well Susan, let me give you some of the basics. First, we are going to be testing 
about 1,200,000 components a year for Spellman. The machine can handle 30,000 
components a week at full capacity, so I figure that we are going to use 80% of the 
machines capacity running the Spellman job. 

In determining a rate to charge Spellman, I figured that since we were going to use 20% 
of the machines capacity on internal orders, the best thing to do was to estimate the costs 
of adding the Spellman business and then revised the budget to include the expected cost 
of the Spellman job. (See Exhibit 5) I figure Spellman will use $50,000 in direct labor 
costs. Some of these costs will be from hiring an additional part time worker, and some 
of these costs will be from using the excess capacity created when we lost our 
Aerospace’s components. I also estimated additional overhead associated with this job to 
be $315,000 and the new burden rate is 1.533, so I come out with total costs of about 
$126,000. I then used a margin of 20%, and I come up with revenues of $151,200. 
When I divide this by the 1,200,000 units, I get a rate of 12.6 cents per component tested. 
I rounded up to 13 cents a unit. 

I also analyzed how this job will affect the machine hours available for testing. As you 
can see from this exhibit, we had 33,201 hours in the main room, and 17,203 hours of 
machine time in the mechanical testing room. The new machine will annually provide an 
additional 2000 hours of testing time to the Mechanical room, since all the tests on the 
Spellman components will be done there. This year I expect the Machine will be used 
exclusively on the Spellman job. In the future we will have 400 hours of excess capacity 
to take on additional work. 

Susan: Hank, that seems reasonable to me. I’m lost as to how we can be beating our 
competitors in one set of tests and losing in the other. Perhaps we need to bring in an 
expert to figure this out. Fred, why don’t call that consultant that just graduated from 
Sloan maybe she/he can help us.

costs are provided in Panel A 
6 ETD is a cost center, the transfer price to the other divisions is full cost.  Thus for all of the testing done 
on Electronic components produced by divisions within Weber’s the expected revenues for ETD is equal to 
expected costs. For ETD’s external customer’s, the division is expected to markup the costs by 15% to 
determine the selling price of their service.  Any profits above the 15% margin are allocated to a profit 
sharing pool for the senior managers of the division.  For Fiscal 2002, the average margin for servicing 
outside customer is expected to be 20%, expected profits on external customers is $300,000 and $75,000 is 
expected to be available for profit sharing.

10 Depreciation is done over 10 years on a straight-line basis assuming no residual value. 
11 Instead of bringing in an additional full time employee, the division will hire a part time employee for 
approximately $20,000 per year, the rest of this cost will be from the excess capacity that we have from 
losing the testing of Aerospace products. 
12 Since the Machine is being purchase in April, only 75% of the machine’s annual capacity is available.  In 
addition all of the 1500 hours will be used on testing the external product.

Questions


Consider yourself to be the consultant that ETD hires to come help them address the 
problems that the division is facing. Prepare a report to Susan that highlights the 
problems that Weber’s currently has and proposed solutions. In your report you should 
address the following questions. 

1. 	 What are the important issues in the ETD division of Weber’s Electronic 

Components? How would you predict the problems in the ETD division would 

affect the other divisions in Weber’s?


2. 	 What steps would you suggest ETD implement to rectify these problems? What are 
the advantages and disadvantages of your proposed system? What other information 
would you need to help in your recommendation? 

3.	 Exhibit 5 provides data on 5 representative products. What are the costs of the 5 
representative products in the current system? What will the costs be when the firm 
takes on the Spellman job? If you have proposed any changes to the cost accounting 
system, what are those changes, and what are the costs of these products under your 
system? 

4.	 How profitable do you think the Spellman job will be? What price would have you 
charged to make a 20 percent margin? Does the excess capacity that the machine 
provides affect your analysis? How? 

5.	 Susan also asks that you include a section in your report that provides suggestion for 
changes in ETD and/or in the firm that could be provided to the CEO. 

Remember be clear and concise in your write up. If you need to make any additional 
assumptions, then be explicit in identifying your assumptions. Please provide schedules 
supporting any calculations you make. If you elect to email me your solution, your entire 
write up must be contained in a single, printer friendly document.
