***** Course Objectives *****
As an introduction to the field of Housing, Community, and Economic Development
(HCED), the course is structured to:
   1. Advance student's understanding of how public policy and private markets
      affect housing, economic development, the local economy, and
      neighborhoodÂ institutions;

   2. Provide an overview of techniques for framing public and private
      interventions to meet housing and community development agendas, broadly
      defined, of inner city and low income neighborhoods;

   3. Review and critique specific programs, policies and strategies that are
      (and have been) directed at local development and neighborhood
      regeneration issues;

   4. Give students an opportunity to reflect on their personal sense of the
      "housing,Â community, and economic development" process and the various
      roles that planners play in implementing the elements of that agenda.
Given that the quest for effective practice underlies the HCED philosophy, the
course emphasizes strategic analysis of the institutional contexts within which
public, nonprofit, and private actions directed at housing, economic, and
community development are implemented. Framing neighborhood institutions
andÂ organizations, their relationship to one another and to "city-wide"
players is a theme running throughout the course.
***** Requirements *****
Students are expected to do the required reading, to participate in class
discussions, and to hand in three memos. Expectations for the memos, their
form, purpose, content, setting etc., will be discussed in detail in class.
***** Grade *****
The final grade will be based on the following:
ACTVITIES           PERCENTAGES
Class Participation 40%
Memos               60%
