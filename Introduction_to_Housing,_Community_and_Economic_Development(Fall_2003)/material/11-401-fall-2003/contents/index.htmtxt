***** Course Description *****
As an introduction to the field of Housing, Community, and Economic Development
(HCED), the course is structured to:
   1. Advance student's understanding of how public policy and private markets
      affect housing, economic development, the local economy, and neighborhood
      institutions;
   2. Provide an overview of techniques for framing public and private
      interventions to meet housing and community development agendas, broadly
      defined, of inner city and low income neighborhoods;
   3. Review and critique specific programs, policies and strategies that are
      (and have been) directed at local development and neighborhood
      regeneration issues;
   4. Give students an opportunity to reflect on their personal sense of the
      "housing, community, and economic development" process and the various
      roles that planners play in implementing the elements of that agenda.
