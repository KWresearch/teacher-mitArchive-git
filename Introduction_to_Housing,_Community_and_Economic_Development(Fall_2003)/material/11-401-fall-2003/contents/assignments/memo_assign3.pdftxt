11.401  Introduction to Housing, Community and Economic 
Development 
 
                                                    Memo III 
                            Due  at  5 PM Monday December 8 
 
Option I  Working Neighborhoods 
 
"Working Neighborhoods: Taking Charge of Your Local 
Economy,"  has been used to promote neighborhood-based 
economic development. 
 
The handbook has come to the attention of John Street, the 
recently re-elected Mayor of that city e years ago. Street 
faces an urban landscape with serious economic problems: 
loss of jobs, middle-class population, deteriorating housing 
stock, regional growth at the expense of the central city, 
and so on. You know the scene.  
 
Always looking for new ways to confront the challenges 
before him, Mayor Street is intrigued by the handbook. At 
present Philadelphia is using its public funds, primarily 
CDBG, to promote housing rehabilitation and to encourage 
private investment in the city's neighborhoods. Michael 
Porter has made frequent visits and the Mayor has been 
impressed by his approach to the economic problems 
confronting the neighborhoods. 
 
The Mayor asks you, the seasoned but unbowed veteran of 
community development working in his administration, to give 
your views of "Working Neighborhoods:" how he, the Mayor,

ought to think about the approaches and strategies presented 
in the Handbook. Your job then is to provide Mayor Street 
with a critical, balanced examination of the assumptions, 
analysis and prescriptions contained in "Working 
Neighborhoods." 
 
Does the Handbook's message apply to Philadelphia's 
problems? What should Street take from the analysis, if 
anything, and why?  What, if anything, is left out of the 
approach? And so on.... 
 
In four pages or less of the usual tight, concise, pointed 
prose tell the Mayor what you think and why. 
 
Wherever you come out in your view be sure to make a 
concise, analytic argument for the position. 
 
 
Option II:  Forget the Hood-Focus on the People 
 
“Why Improve Neighborhoods? Shifting the Goals of Inner City 
Neighborhood Commrcial Revitalization,” by Andy Waxman 
(MIT/MCP) has come to the attention of John Street, the 
Philadelphia Mayor of that city. Street faces an urban 
landscape with serious economic problems: loss of jobs, 
middle-class population, deteriorating housing stock, 
regional growth at the expense of the central city, and so 
on. You know the scene.  
 
Always looking for new ways to confront the challenges 
before him, Street is intrigued by Waxman’s message. At 
present Philadelphia is using its public funds, primarily 
CDBG, to promote housing rehabilitation and economic

development in the city's neighborhoods using CDCs as the 
primary vehicle for production. As a "man from the 
neighborhoods" Street has a history of working with 
nonprofit organizations. But he is becoming increasing  
concerned that his approach, focusing on the neighborhoods 
to the exclusion of the rest of the city and the region, may 
be an incorrect strategy. 
 
The Mayor (once again!) asks you, the seasoned but unbowed 
veteran of community development working in his 
administration, to give your views of Waxman’s article:  how 
he, the Mayor, ought to think about the approaches and 
strategies presented in the  paper. Your job then is to 
provide Mayor Street with a critical, balanced examination 
of the assumptions, analysis and prescriptions contained in 
the document. 
 
Does Waxman’s message apply to Philadelphia's problems? What 
should Street take from the analysis, if anything, and why? 
Is it truly anti-neighborhood?  What, if anything, is left 
out of the approach? And so on.... 
 
In  four pages or less of the usual tight, concise, pointed 
prose tell the Mayor what you think and why. 
Again analysis-,step by step- as to where you end up is what 
it is all about 
 
Option III:  Bridging  and Bonding 
 
The effort has been made throughout the term to look at 
“neighborhood issues and institutions” through the social 
capital lens set out in  the first class. (See Keyes, 
”Housing, Social Capital and Poor Communities”-September

10th reading- for a refresher.) You are a student in11.401 
who has been asked by your professor to write a critique of 
the approach:  
 
Has it been useful? If so where and how? Has it not been 
useful? If so where and how? 
  
In  four pages or less of the usual tight, concise, pointed 
prose tell  your professor what you think and why. 
Use specific examples and be analytic.
