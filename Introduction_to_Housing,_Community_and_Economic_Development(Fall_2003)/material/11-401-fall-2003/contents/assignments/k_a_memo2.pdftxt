• 

to provide background about the America Park Housing Development and stakeholders; 

to analyze four options for redeveloping the site and possible roles for TCB;   

•  and to recommend an initial planning process for The Community Builder. 

 
Situation and Players 
 
The Tenants Association of America Park Housing Development (The Park) has contacted us about 

partnering to redevelop the site.  The development is considered “troubled” due to its age, design, 

accumulated deferred maintenance, and the income of residents. (Vale)  Built in 1950, the Park 

contains 408 units in low-density, low-rise buildings. It has a prime location on the waterfront.  The 

vacancy rate is over 50%, and several buildings have been abandoned.  Over 75% of residents are 

single mothers whose only income is from welfare.  Although half of the tenants have lived there 

under two years, many want to stay in this community.  They have formed a strong Association. 

In contrast, the Lynn Housing Authority (LHA) suffers from an “institutional void.”  (Laws) 

Considered ineffective, LHA has not maintained the property and has no experience in property 

redevelopment.  The Lynn CDC may be interested in an opportunity for a joint venture though it is 

not presently involved in the Park.   

Redevelopment Options 
 
Given this context, I have outlined 4 main options for the site in the matrix below.  My 

recommendation for redevelopment and TCB’s role follow. 

1 

o Temporary 
Relocation 
o Improved units for 
the short term 

o Moderate 
o Identify units 
o Manage developer 
o Handle relocation

•  Demolition: Demolition would be the cheapest solution for LHA, but the social costs are high for 

residents – dislocation and the permanent loss of affordable housing. This option requires an 

extensive strategy to relocate families to other developments or subsidized units.  

•  Renovation:  Residents keep their units, but renovation is expensive given the extent of the structural 

problems and age of the buildings. Relocating residents is another major challenge.  The double move 

(to the temporary home and back) disrupts social networks and the community and even affects 

health.  Staged reconstruction would minimize the disruption to tenants but increases costs and the 

project time frame.  Residents will need to ensure they can return to their units.   

•  Comprehensive Modernization (Rehabilitation):  The major advantages are that tenants would be able 

2 

 
to stay in their community, enjoy a re-designed site and buildings, with possibly more open space on 

 

the waterfront, and have significant control over the process.  Major disadvantages are the cost, time 

frame, loss of units and relocation.  Renovations are costly and may take longer than expected as at 

Orchard Park  (Phase I). Units will be lost, but current tenants should not be affected given the 

current vacancy rate.  Relocation, moves and reassignment represent major disruptions for tenants. 

The Tenant Association can either work with the LHA or a private developer.  Orchard Garden 

(Phase I) and Bromley Heath are examples of the former.  At Harbor (formerly Columbia) Point, the 

strong tenant council and a private developer created a mixed income development that took 

advantage of the waterfront location. Market rate units could attract private developer and supplement 

the operating subsidies for units for low and moderate-income families.   

•  HOPE VI Redevelopment:  In this option the Park would be demolished and rebuilt as a mixed-

income development.  Mission Main and Orchard Gardens are two examples.  On the positive side 

HOPE VI residents live in new townhouses with better management, upkeep and access on-site 

social services including child care and job training.  From a management standpoint, HOPE VI 

offers significant HUD resources including more operating support than in modernization.   

However, there are shortcomings for tenants concerned about the loss of units and sense of 

community among other issues.  Units are not replaced on a 1 to 1 basis because current codes 

require bigger rooms than when the projects were built.  In typical HOPE VI projects, only 25% of 

housing units are reserved for the lowest income families.  Further, only 11.4% of tenants return to 

their units. As such, some argue the HOPE VI’s income mix benefits private developers and 

management companies more than residents and unsophisticated housing authorities.  Low rise, low 

density projects may actually encourage a greater sense of community than the suburban style 

townhouses in urban contexts. (Goddard)   

3 

 

Some see the HOPE VI development as a way to connect residents to the larger community.  

 

However, residents of the Park who feel stigmatized by the community may be resistant as were 

tenants at Mission Main. (National Law Housing Project, et al., iii; Keyes)  Working on HOPE VI 

requires intense participation by stakeholders, but how much do HUD rules actually allow 

residents’ participation after the application?  (National, iii)  (HOPE VI in Boston may be an 

anomaly in this regard.)  This option represents a tradeoff between funding and meeting the needs 

of tenants for affordable housing and for genuine participation. 

The Community Builders Role 

Given the prime location and need for housing, America Park is an opportunity to build capacity in 

a strong tenants organization and to serve as a catalyst for community revitalization in Lynn.   

Depending on the option residents choose, TCB can serve as a development consultant (to advise 

and assemble players), financial consultant, developer or co-partner with the tenants.  Our 

recommendation requires an analysis of: 

• 

• 

the project costs based on a physical assessment of the property. Do the numbers work? 

funding and time constraints: a mix of credit and equity funding from city, the Mass. Housing 

Finance Agency, HUD, private investment, including limited tax income credits.   

• 

the potential for collaboration or negotiation.  What roles will tenants and LHA play?  Will 

LHA sponsor the project or lease the land to a team of tenants and a developer? What is Lynn 

CDC’s interest in the project, track record and expertise?   

Challenge 

TCB’s ultimate decision to participate depends on quality of the working relationship between the 

Tenant Association and the LHA (and ultimately the chosen development team).  We can address 

the need for education and building capacity for both tenants and LHA, but the project cannot go 

4 

 
forward without their willingness to negotiate and address the inevitable challenges of development 

 

and HUD requirements.  In Mission Main HOPE VI, the lack of trust, social capital and clear 

communication between the tenants, the BHA and the developers undermined the direction of the 

project and the quality of resident engagement.  Given this need, we might see our pre-development 

work as a relationship-building tool.  With a local planning grant, we should: 

1.  Conduct training sessions to educate tenants about the process and build capacity.  Share 

examples of other resident-initiated development projects. 

2.  Meet with the Tenants and the LHA to describe the project, its history, shared interests and 

constraints.  Identify project teams, communication and decision-making protocol.   

3.  Facilitate a Master Planning process with Tenant Association and LHA about their vision, goals, 

concerns and questions. Discuss redevelopment options through a joint analysis of the strengths, 

weaknesses, opportunities and threats.  Facilitate decision-making process and negotiations.    

With a shared understanding, we can identify TCB’s role.  Only then would we begin to work with 

residents (and possibly LHA) to plan the site, identify funding, create and start a development plan. 

Conclusion 

Given our mission to build strong communities where people of all incomes can achieve their full 

potential, I recommend that we explore the options to redevelop America Park in Lynn. This 

project’s strong tenant organization, prime location, and the need for housing in Greater Lynn make 

this project an attractive leadership opportunity in the current funding climate.  Our first steps are to 

assess the capacity for the tenants and the Housing Authority to work together then examine 

financing for the project to determine the appropriate role for TCB.
