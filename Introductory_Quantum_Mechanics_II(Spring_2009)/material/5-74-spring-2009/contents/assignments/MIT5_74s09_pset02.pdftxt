2.  The infrared rotational-vibrational spectrum of a diatomic 

Let’s study the correlation function for the rotational-vibrational infrared absorption spectrum of 
a heteronuclear diatomic molecule.  We are considering the transitions induced by infrared light 
that is resonant with a vibrational transition with frequency much greater than kT, and the 
frequency of the infrared light is much higher frequency than the splitting between rotational 
levels. We will use the harmonic oscillator and rigid rotor Hamiltonians to describe the 
vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom: 

H 0  = H vib  + H rot 

H  = 
vib 

H  =

Here where  M R  is the reduced mass and q is the vibrational coordinate. I is the moment of inertia, 
which is related to the rotational constant by  B = h / 4π Ic .  So, the state of the system will be 
described by three quantum numbers  n J M   . 

The diatomic will interact with the light through the transition dipole moment.  Since we assume 
that there are no interactions between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom, we will also 
partition the dipole operator into two parts: 

μ= μˆ m 

where μˆ  is a unit vector oriented along the transition moment (and along the vibrational coordinate 
in this case), and m is the magnitude of the dipole moment, which we take to be a weak function of 
the nuclear coordinate: 

⎛ ∂m ⎞ 
m m= 
⎟  q
0  + ⎜ 
⎝ ∂q  ⎠q0 
= m0  + m q
 
1 

m0  is the magnitude of the permanent dipole moment and  m1 is the amplitude of the transition dipole 
moment.

For the following, the system will interact with an electric field oriented along the εˆ = zˆ axis of the 
laboratory.  Remember that in describing the probability of occupying an initial state, we need to 
consider both probability of occupying the initial state at temperature T and the probability of 
having a particular orientation in the laboratory frame. The initial state of the system will always be 
isotropically distributed, i.e. equal probability of finding a dipole oriented in any direction. 

a)	 Evaluate the dipole matrix element  k εˆ ⋅μ l  for the interactions between an initial state 
l  =  n J M   and a final state  k  = n J M  using the separation of orientational and 
′
′
′
vibrational variables.  Calculate this only to the leading order expansion coefficient for m. 

μ( t )μ( 0 ) 
b)	 Evaluate the correlation function 
 for a gas phase ensemble of molecules at 
pressures low enough to neglect interactions between molecules.  

c)	 Plot the correlation function for temperatures such that  B k/  T >> 1 ,  B = kT , and  B k/  T << 1 
(but neglect temperatures high enough that you need to consider n=2).  Be sure to point out 
the important features of the time-dependent behavior. You will probably want to plot the 
rotational, vibrational and combined contributions separately. For the purpose of plotting 
results, you can use  Ω0 = 2000 cm-1 and  B = 5 cm-1. 

d)	 Calculate the analytical form of the spectrum corresponding to the correlation functions in 
 
(b) and plot the lineshapes.   Point out how the frequency resolved features in the spectrum 
were manifested in the time-dependent behavior in (b). 

3. Numerical calculation of correlation function from a trajectory 

The file cf.dat on the 5.74 web site contains a trajectory of instantaneous transition frequencies ωi(t) 
for the vibration of a molecule in a fluctuating environment.  The file is a set of roughly 32000 
consecutive frequencies in cm-1 for points separated by 10 femtoseconds (10 x 10-15 sec). We will 
calculate the correlation function using the time-averaging expression for a single molecule valid 
for an ergodic system.   
a) 	 Express the integral version of the time-correlation function  C t( )  δω t δω(  ) as an 
( ) 
0
= 
explicit summation over all pairs of points for a finite discrete data set.   
b) 	 Calculate ω0  and plot the trajectory δω( t ) . 
 
c) 	 Plot the correlation function for the frequency fluctuations using the expression you found in 
(a). What is the correlation timeτc for these fluctuations?  How does this value compare to 
an exponential fit? 
d)  	 Make a histogram for occurrences ofδω and compare to a Gaussian distribution with a 
( )0C
standard deviation 
.
