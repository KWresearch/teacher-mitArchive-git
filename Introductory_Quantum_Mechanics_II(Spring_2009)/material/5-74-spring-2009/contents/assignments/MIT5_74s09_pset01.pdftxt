between  two  displaced  harmonic  oscillators.    Specifically,  calculate  the  Franck 
Condon  factor  for  overlap  of  a  harmonic  oscillator  with  eigenstates 
with  a
ψn 
displaced harmonic oscillator in the ground state.  That is:

Time-Development of the Density Matrix 
The density matrix is an alternate approach to representing the state of a quantum system. It 
becomes  very  practical  for  condensed  phase  and  nonlinear  spectroscopy  problems.    The 
density matrix ρ is defined as the outer product of the system wavefunction ρ= |ψ〉〈ψ|. 

a)  	 If  you  express  the  wavefunction  as  an  expansion 

= ∑ cn  ( )t  n  ,  convince
ψ( t ) 
n 
⎡⎣ Aρ( t ) ⎤⎦ .
( )  
yourself that the expectation value of an operator A is written as  A t  = Tr
 
b)  Using  the  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation,  show  that  the  time-dependence  of 
the density matrix is given by the Liouville-Von Neumann equation: 
i  [ H , ρ] . 
∂ρ	 = −
∂t 
h 
By  deriving  this  equation,  you  have  also  effectively  demonstrated  that  the  density 
matrix  in  the  interaction  picture  ρΙ  =  |ψΙ〉〈ψΙ|  evolves  according  to  the  following 
equation of motion: 

∂ρI  = −
∂t 

i  [V  , ρ ] .

c)  	 Time-integrate  the  Liouville-Von  Neumann  equation  from  0  to  t,  and  show  that  this 
integral  solution  for  the  time-development  of ρ  is  equivalent  to  ρ( ) = U ρ 0

4.  Electronic excitation by electron scattering. 

An  electron  passes  by  a  hydrogen  (Z=1)  atom 

with a velocity v in the y direction.  At the time of  

closest  approach  (t  =  0),  the  ion  is  separated  by  a  

distance  B  (the  impact  parameter)  along  the  x 

direction.  At any other time, the distance between

the atom and electron is


R ( t )  =  B2  + (

)2v  t  

 

 

(1)

 

As  it  passes  by,  the  Coulombic  interactions  with  

the electron will act  to mix  the electronic states of

the  atom, which we will  take  to be  real hydrogen-

like wavefunctions. 


The  time  dependent  Hamiltonian  for  this  problem  could  be  written  in  terms  of  the 
Hamiltonians  for  the  atom  and  for  the  electron,  as  well  as  a  time-dependent  interaction 
( ) .  Let’s  consider  how  a  weak  interaction  mixes  the 
between  them  H H= 
atom  + H electron  + V t
 
atomic  eigenstates.  This  is  an  appropriate  picture  if  |V(t)|<<|Hatom|.  To  just  consider  the 
induced changes to the electronic wavefunction of the atom, we will write 
( )
atom  + V t
H H  
= 
and treat the problem in the interaction picture. We will assume that we prepare the atom at t 
= −∞ in the 1s orbital [b1s(−∞) = 1] and follow time dependent interactions that couple the 1s 
state  to  the  n  =  2  states.  This  would  hold  for  relatively  large  impact  parameters,  so  we  will 
assume  that  the separation of  the  free electron  from  the hydrogen nucleus and  the H electron 
are  approximately  equal:    R pe  ≈ R ee  = R ( t )
 
.  We  can  take  the  frame  of  reference  to  be  the 
atomic nucleus.

We will get  this by directly numerically solving  the coupled  linear differential equations  that 
describe the time-evolution of bn, the expansion coefficients in the eigenstates of H0:

We will write the appropriate form of the Hamiltonian in eq. 2, calculate the matrix elements 
in V, and then numerically solve eqs. 3.

(a)	 Write out  an  explicit  form of  the Hamiltonian  in  eq. 2  in  terms of kinetic  and potential 
energies  involved.    Assume  that  you  can  neglect  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  nucleus. 
Neglect  any  interactions  between  the  particles  other  than  the  Coulomb  terms  (for 
instance spin). 

(b)	 To  start,  determine  the  time-dependent  matrix  elements  in  the  interaction  picture 
ab  ( )
Hamiltonian  V t
 where  a  and  b   include  the n=1 and n=2  (2s, 2px,
 = a
 V( t )
 b
2py, 2pz) states. 

There  are  a  few ways  but  the way  I  did  this was  as  follows: Choose  the  nucleus  as  the 
frame  of  reference  and write  the  problem  in  terms  of  spherical  coordinates.   Write  the 
hydrogenic wavefunctions in terms of spherical harmonics  a  = R ( )r  lm  .  The matrix 
elements  involve  an  integral  over  the  wavefunctions  for  the  bound  electron  position, 
which are described by coordinates ( r, θ, φ ) .  The position of  the  free  (moving) electron 
(	
( ) )
is  described  by  the  coordinates  R ( t ),  
.  It  will  be  necessary  to  represent  the 
′ t
,
′
θ φ  
time-dependent potential in terms of an expansion in spherical harmonics, for which the 
following expression (from Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics) is very helpful:

Here 	 R ( t ) and  r  are vectors from the nucleus to the electrons, but R(t) and r are scalars. 

Evaluate  all  of  the  matrix  elements.  Show  their  dependence  on  the  impact  parameter, 
the Bohr radius a0, electron velocity, and time.   

(c)	

Solve  the  coupled  differential  equations  for  the  time-dependent  interactions  between 
the electronic states.   

This  will  require  numerically  solving  the  set  of  five  coupled  first-order  linear 
differential  equations  that  describe  the  time-evolution  of  the  expansion  coefficients  for 
the  n=1  and  n=2  states.  (You  can  neglect  couplings  to  higher  lying  states).  You  will 
need to numerically integrate the differential equations. 

If you are using MathCad,  the Runga-Kutta  routine  for numerically  solving differential 
equations  requires  real  valued  numbers  to  solve  the  equations.    You  will  need  to 
separate  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  each  equation,  giving  twice  as  many  coupled 
differential equations. To see these, expand eq. 3 using  bk = Re[bk] + i Im[bk], and then 
separate the real and imaginary variables.  (See problem set 0).

Show the time-dependent probabilities of occupying the n=1 and n=2 states, from large 
negative  times  to  large  positive  times.    You  can  take  the  energy  of  the  1s  state  to  be 
En=1=0 and the energies of the n=2 states to be En=2 = 82,000 cm-1.  To start, choose B = 
2a0.  Chose what  you would  call  relatively  low  or  high  velocities  for  these  parameters. 
What  time  point  would  effectively  constitute  t  =  −∞?  Discuss  the  influence  of  the 
velocity and impact parameter on the observed time-dependence.  

(d)	 Make sequential contour plots of the time-dependent electron probability density in the 
x-y plane for several times from t<0 to t>0 to illustrate the behavior.
