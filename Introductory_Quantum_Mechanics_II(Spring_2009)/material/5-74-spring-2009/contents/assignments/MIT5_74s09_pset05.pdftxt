1.  	 Density Matrix Description of the Linear Response Function 

In problem set 2 you showed that the equation of motion for the density matrix in the interaction 
i  [V ,I  ρI  ] , where the density matrix in the interaction picture is defined as 
picture is  ∂ρI  = −

a)  How do you express the expectation value of the operator A in terms of  ρ I  ? 

b)	 The time development of  ρI   can be obtained by integrating the equation of motion. Use the 
first-order solution to the differential equation for  ρI   above to obtain a density matrix 
expression for the linear response function. 

c)  Explicity evaluate the expression in (b) for the electric dipole interaction of a field with a 
two level system 

in which the dipole operator couples the two states: 

H0 = |a〉 εa  〈a| + |b〉 εb  〈b| 

μ =  |a〉 μab  〈b|  +  |b〉 μba  〈a|. 

What is the form of ρeq? What is the matrix form of U0? Show that your result is consistent

2. Vibrational relaxation in a triatomic 

We’ll  examine  the  process  of  vibrational  relaxation  commonly  found  in  triatomic  molecules, 
focusing specifically at the case of water. For the case of a nonlinear “ABA” molecule such as H2O, 
the normal modes of vibration  are  the  symmetric  and  asymmetric O-H  stretching modes, νa  and νs, 
and  the  bending  mode,  δHOH,  with  vibrational  frequencies  of  ωa0=3450  cm-1,  ωs0=3200  cm-1  and 
ωb0=1650  cm-1,  respectively. The  splitting between νa  and νs  arises  from  coupling between  the  two 
OH  local mode stretching vibrations.  In  the case of  the nonlinear “ABC” molecule HDO (where D 
is 2H), the normal modes are well-approximated by local O-H and O-D stretching vibrations, νh and 
νd,  and  the  bend  is  δHOD.  The  frequencies  in  this  case  are  ωh0=3400  cm-1,  ωd0=2500  cm-1  and 
ωb0=1450 cm-1, respectively. 
For  both  H2O  and  HOD,  the  dominant 
mechanism  by  which  vibrational  energy  in 
stretching 
vibrations 
dissipates 
to 
the 
environment  is  through  stretch-bend  coupling. 
An  anharmonic  coupling  exists  by  which 
vibrational  energy  flows  from  the  stretch  to  the 
v=2  state  of  the  bend  (bend  overtone).  That  is, 
annihilation  of  one  quantum  of  stretch  leads  to 
two quanta in the bend.  The energy difference is 
made  up  by  the  bath.  We  will  be  investigating 
this  vibrational  energy  transfer  process  treating 
the  bend  overtone  as  a  sink  for  vibrational 
energy  in  the  stretches.  For  our  purposes,  we 
take  the energy of  the bend overtone  states  to be 
ωb=3250  cm-1  and  ωb=2900  cm-1  for  H2O  and 
HOD respectively. 
The  values  of  the  couplings  V  between  the  stretches  and  bend  overtones  are  as  follows.  In 
the case of H2O, the bend overtone has the same symmetry as the symmetric state, leading to strong 
mixing  in  comparison  to  the  asymmetric  state.   Let’s  take  Vab=  15  cm-1  and  Vsb=  50  cm-1.  In  the 
case of HOD, the coupling of stretch to bend overtone is about the same Vhb = Vdb = 30 cm-1. 

a)	 Assuming  that  these  vibrations  interact  linearly with  a  harmonic  bath, write  expressions  for 
the rate of vibrational energy relaxation from each stretch state of H2O and HOD to the bend 
overtone  in  terms  of  the  coupling  V,  the  density  of  states  of  the  bath  W,  and  the  thermal 
occupancy of the bath. 

b)  Using  the HOD  and H2O molecules  as  examples,  explain  under what  circumstances  do  you 
expect to: 
i) 
…observe  Arrhenius  vibrational  relaxation  behavior?  (That  is,  when  do  you  have 
linear scaling between ln[k] and 1/T?) 

ii)  …observe rates that increase linearly with temperature? 

iii)  What about rates independent of temperature? 


c) 	

In  certain  cases  it  is  observed  that  vibrational  relaxation  rates  decrease  with  increasing 
temperature.  Explain the types of circumstances that can lead to this behavior.

d)	 To  examine  a  specific  example  of  temperature  dependent  vibrational  relaxation  rates,  let’s 
assume that that the density of states (DOS) for the bath takes on a normalized Ohmic form 

ω 
2  e−ω/ωc
W (
) = 
ω  A 
ωc 

where  ωc defines  the  characteristic  maximum  in  the  DOS,  and  that  DOS  shifts  to  higher 
frequencies  with  temperature.  We  will  describe  the  shift  with  temperature  through  the 
relationship ω  T  ( 0.3 cm 
) and take A = 5.

Calculate  and  plot  the  temperature-dependent  vibrational  relaxation  rate  from  each  stretch 
mode  to  the  bend  overtone  for  T  =  50  to  350  K.    Explain  the  temperature  dependence 
observed.  What is the fastest rate observed? 

e)	 Now, let’s numerically calculate time-dependent populations in all vibrational modes during 
the  vibrational  relaxation  of  population  prepared  in  the  symmetric  stretching mode  of H2O. 
In  addition  to  the  couplings  above, we  expect  that  the  two  stretch modes are coupled by Vas 
=  50  cm-1.  Start  by  writing  the  first-order  rate  equations  that  explain  the  population  flow 
between  the  bend  and  stretch  modes.  Then  numerically  evaluate  the  time-dependent 
populations in the a, s, and b states by integrating these differential equations using the same 
routines you used in Problem Set 1.  For simplicity, you may assume that the bend mode is a 
sink from which population may not return to the bends, i.e. kab = ksb = kbb = 0. Examine and 
explain the population flow for temperatures between 50 and 350 K.
