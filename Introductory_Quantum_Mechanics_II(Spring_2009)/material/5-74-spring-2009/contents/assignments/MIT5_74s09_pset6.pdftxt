1.  Nonlinear Response Function 

In  analogy  to  the derivation  of  the  linear  response  function, derive  the quantum  form of  the 
second-order (nonlinear) response function.   

2. Second Order Response Functions 

Draw  the  Feynman  and  ladder  diagrams  for  the  two  correlation 
functions  of  the  second  order  nonlinear  response, Q1  and Q2,  and 
write expressions for the phenomenological time-domain response 
functions  of  these  systems  and  corresponding  frequency-domain 
nonlinear  susceptibility.  Assume  that  you  have  a  three  level 
system  for  which  the  eigenstates  of  the  system  Hamiltonian  are 
a  ,  b  , and  c  , and also assume that Ea < Eb < Ec.

3. Nonlinear Experiments on an Anharmonic Vibration 

third-order  nonlinear

Here  we  will  consider 
experiments  on  an  anharmonic  vibration.  For  high  vibrational  2 
frequencies we will only occupy  the ground state at equilibrium  (ρeq = 
|0><0|  ),  and  the  response  can  be  represented  by  a  three  level  system  1 
for  the  n=0,  1,  and  2  vibrational  states.  For  a  weakly  anharmonic 
oscillator,  we  will  have  only  a  very  small  shift  between  the  0 
fundamental  transition  frequency ω10  =  Ω and  the  n=1→2  transition, 
ω21=Ω−δΩ. 

ω21= Ω−δΩ 

ω10 = Ω 

We want to describe the behavior of two experiments shown here. Two pulses, both with frequency 
ω  resonant  with  the Δn  =  ±1  transitions  (ω ≈ ω10  ≈ ω21)  and  separated  by τ  are  crossed  at  a  small 
angle, to generate two background free signals 
after  the  sample.  The  field  E1  incident  along 
k1  preceeds  the  second  pulse E2  along  k2.  On 
a plane after the sample the two signals k+ and 
k−  are  observed  as  equally  spaced  spots  on 
either  side  of  the  transmitted  beams.    k+  lies 
next to the transmitted k1. 

(a)  Give  the  wavevector  matching  condition  that  leads  to  the  signals  radiated  in  the  k+  and  k− 
directions. What is the frequency of each radiated signal? 
(b)  Draw  all Feynmann  and Ladder diagrams  that contribute  to  the k+  and k−  signals,  assuming 
that the system starts in the ground state. 
(c)  Write the correlation function corresponding to each diagram, assuming a phenomenological 
damping for propagation under H0. 
(d)  Now  let’s  look more  carefully  at  the  signal  k−,  for  an  inhomogeneously  broadened  system. 
Assume  that  the  homogeneous  damping  of  all  coherences  is  Γ=Γ10  =  Γ21, and  there  are  a 
Gaussian distribution of resonance frequencies

Assuming  that  the  experiment  is  performed  with  delta  function  pulses,  derive  an  analytical

and Δ<<Γ.  (To understand what you see it might help to plot  P (3) as a function of τ1 and τ3.)

4. 2D Spectrum of Coupled Oscillators 

Calculate the 2D spectrum obtained from a third-order nonlinear experiment for a degenerate 
 
pair of coupled anharmonic vibrations.   Imagine that you have two anharmonic oscillators 
described by the with vibrational levels in problem 3.  For each oscillator, the transition energy 
for the v=0-1 transition is ε and the 1-2 transition is ε − Ω . Then, these are coupled through a 
(  1
2a + a1a2  ) .  Similar to before, we take  Ω,V << ε .

Where the rows refer to the states  0, 0 ,  0,1  ,  1, 0 ,  0, 2 ,  2, 0 ,  1,1  . 
The states refer to the quantum number for each oscillator, and the 
1,1  state is the combination band in which one quantum of excitation 
is in each oscillator.  Show how the states correspond to the bands 
shown to the right.

(b)  Considering allowed resonances between the adjacent bands, draw the ladder diagrams 
that correspond to the R2 and R3 (rephasing) terms of the third-order nonlinear response.  
You can assume that only the following transitions (which change state by one quantum) 
are allowed: μ00 ,10 , μ00 ,01 , μ10 , 20 , μ01,02 , μ01,11 , μ10 ,11 .  Also, you may assume that 
2μ00 ,10  = μ01,02 ,  2μ00 ,01  = μ10 ,20 , and μ01,11  = μ10 ,11 . Also write out the response obtained 
for each diagram setting τ2=0. 

(c)  Fourier transform the responses in both the τ1 and τ3 variables, setting Γij→0.  This leads 
to each diagram contributing to a delta-function peak in a two dimensional spectrum 
plotted as a function of ω1 and ω3. Show where the peaks are and how their positions are 
dictated by the parameters ε, V and Ω.
