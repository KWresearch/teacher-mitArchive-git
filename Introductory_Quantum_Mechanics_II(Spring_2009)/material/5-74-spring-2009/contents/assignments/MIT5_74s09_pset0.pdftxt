These are some problems to make sure that you are up to speed on the basics of solving 
numerical problems.     

1.	

Numerically solving for eigenstates and eigenvalues of an arbitrary 1D potential. 
Obtain the energy eigenvalues En and wavefunctions ψ ( r ) for the anharmonic Morse 
n
potential below.  (Values of the parameters correspond to HF).  Tabulate En for n = 0 to 
5, and plot the corresponding ψ n ( r ) .

potential, the differential equations that describe their probability amplitude are

Numerically  solve  for  the  probability  of  being  in  state  k  and  l  for  times  t =  0  to  t =1  ps 
given  that  the  system  is  in  state  k at  t =  0.  You  can  take  the  coupling  to
