1. Relaxation from a Prepared State 
The linear response function  R ( )τ  describes the time-dependent behavior of a system subject to an 
impulsive perturbation from equilibrium. You can also imagine applying a force that holds the 
system away from isolated equilibrium state, and then suddenly releasing this force. The relaxation 
back to equilibrium is dictated by the step response function  S (τ) , which we will investigate.

( )  is the unit step function. We have applied the force at a time in the distant past, so that the 
Θ  t
system at t = 0 has come to equilibrium under the Hamiltonian H.  At long times, t = +∞, the system 
is at equilibrium under H0. We will use the eigenstates of H0 as the basis to solve this problem.  
 Give expressions for the expectation value of A at time t = 0,  A

where the system evolves only under H0? To solve this, first prepare the system in the state

Obtain an expression describing the time-evolution of the internal variable A for t > 0 for the 
limit that η→0. It may be helpful to make use of the Fourier transform relationship that relates 
the response function to the susceptibility.

Show that the step response in (b) can be differentiated to give the impulse response and that the 
step response can be expressed as an expansion in cosines, i.e., functions that are even in time.

4. Transformation between Hamiltonians. 
Motivated  by  the  previous  problem,  imagine  that  you  wish  to  express  the  time-evolution  of  a 
wavefunction  under  one  Hamiltonian  He  in  terms  of  another  Hg.  We  also  define  the  difference 
Hamiltonian:  H eg  = H e  − H g  .  This  suggests  that  we  find  a  way  of  expressing  the  time  evolution 
under He  as: 

H  = H  + H
eg
e
 g
U  = U U

Show  that we  can  obtain  a  transformation  between  U e  and  U g  analogous  to what we  did with  the 
interaction picture Hamiltonian: 

 

⎡ −i  t d τ H
