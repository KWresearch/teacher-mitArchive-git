8.1.  LINEAR RESPONSE THEORY 
We  have  statistically  described  the  time-dependent  behavior  of  quantum  variables  in  an 
equilibrium  system  through  correlation  functions.  We  have  also  shown  that  spectroscopic 
lineshapes  are  related  to  correlation  functions  for  the  dipole  moment.  But  it’s  not  the  whole 
story. You have probably sensed this from the perspective that correlation functions are complex, 
and how can observables be complex? 
We will use linear response theory as a way of describing a real experimental observable. 
Specifically  this  will  tell  us  how  an  equilibrium  system  changes  in  response  to  an  applied 
potential.  The  quantity  that  will  describe  this  is  a  response  function,  a  real  observable  quantity. 
We will go on to show how it is related to correlation functions. 
In  this  also  is  perhaps  the more  important  type  of  observation.   We will  now  deal with  a 
nonequilibrium  system,  but  we  will  show  that  when  the  changes  are  small  away  from 
equilibrium, the equilibrium fluctuations dictate the nonequilibrium response!  Thus a knowledge 
of the equilibrium dynamics are useful in predicting non-equilibrium processes. 
So, the question is “How does the system respond if you drive it from equilibrium?”  We 
will  examine  the  case  where  an  equilibrium  system,  described  by  a  Hamiltonian  H0  interacts 
weakly with an external agent, V(t). The system is moved away from equilibrium by the external 
agent, and the system absorbs energy from external agent.   
How  do  we  describe  the 
time-dependent  properties  of  the 
system?  We  first  take  the  external 
agent  to  interact  with  the  system 
through  an  internal  variable  A.  So 
the  Hamiltonian  for  this  problem  is 
given by 

H H= 

0  −  f  ( t ) A . 
Here  f(t)  is  the  time-dependence  of  external  agent.  We  describe  the  behavior  of  an  ensemble 
initially  at  thermal  equilibrium  by  assuming  that  each member  of  the  ensemble  is  subject  to  the 
same  interaction with  the external agent, and  then ensemble averaging.  Initially,  the  system  is at 
equilibrium  and  the  internal  variable  is  characterized  by  an  equilibrium  ensemble  average  A  . 

(0.1) 

8-2 

The  external  agent  is  then  applied  at  time 
t0,  and  the  system  is  moved  away  from 
equilibrium,  and  is  characterized  through  a 
average, A  . 
non-equilibrium 
ensemble 
A  ≠ A t( ) as a result of the interaction. 
For  a  weak  interaction  with  the 
external  agent,  we  can  describe  A ( )t
performing  an  expansion 
in  powers 
of  f  ( )t  .

(
A t( ) =  A  + ∫ dt  0  R  t ,t  0 
( 
)
) 
t0  +K  
f
In  this  expression  the  agent  is  applied  at t0  ,  and we  observe  the  system  at t . The  leading  term  in 
this expansion is independent of f, and is therefore equal to  A  .  The next term in (0.3) describes 

(0.2) 

(0.3)

the  deviation  from  the  equilibrium  behavior  in  terms  of  a  linear  dependence  on  the  external 
agent.  R ( t ,t  0 ) is  the  linear  response  function,  the  quantity  that  contains  the  microscopic 
information  that  describes  how  the  system  responds  to  the  applied  agent.   The  integration  in  the 
last  term  of  eq.  (0.3)  indicates  that  the  non-equilibrium  behavior  depends  on  the  full  history  of 
the  application  of  the  agent  f  (
)   and  the  response  of  the  system  to  it.    We  are  seeking  a
t0 
quantum mechanical description of R.

Properties of the Response Function 

1.  Causality:    The  system  cannot  respond  before  the  force  has  been  applied.    Therefore 
R t( ,t0 ) = 0  for t
t<  0  , and the time-dependent change in A is

The  lower  integration  limit  has  been  set  to  −∞   to  reflect  that  the  system  is  initially  at 
equilibrium,  and  the  upper  limit  is  the  time  of  observation. We  can  also  make  the  statement  of 
Θ −(

2. Stationarity:   Similar  to our discussion of correlation  functions,  the  time-dependence of  the 
system  only  depends  on  the  time  interval  between  application  of  potential  and  observation. 
Therefore we write  R ( t ,t  0 ) = R t  ( − t0 ) and

This expression says that the observed response of the system to the agent is a convolution of the 
material response with the time-development of the applied force.

3. Impulse response.  Note that for a delta function perturbation: 
f  ( t ) = λδ( t − t0 ) 

We obtain

(0.8) 

δA t( ) = λR t  
( − t0 ) . 
Thus,  R  describes  how  the  system  behaves  when  an  abrupt  perturbation  is  applied  and  is  often 
referred to as the impulse response function.

FREQUENCY-DOMAIN REPRESENTATION: THE SUSCEPTIBILITY 

The observed  temporal behavior of  the non-equilibrium system can also be cast  in  the frequency 
domain  as  a  spectral  response  function,  or  susceptibility.  We  start  with  eq.  (0.7)  and  Fourier 
transform both sides:

transform  (single-sided  Fourier  transform)  of  the  impulse  response  function.  It  is  a  frequency-
domain  representation  of  the  linear  response  function.  Switching  between  time  and  frequency 
domains  shows  that  a  convolution  of  the  force  and  response  in  time  leads  to  the  product  of  the 
force and response in frequency.  This is a manifestation of the convolution theorem:

If we  choose  to  evaluate  the  limit L → ∞ ,  the  cosine  terms  are  hard  to  deal with,  but we  expect 
they  will  vanish  since  they  oscillate  rapidly.  This  is  equivalent  to  averaging  over  a 
monochromatic 
field.  Alternatively,  we  can 
instead  average  over  a  single  cycle: 
 (
) to  obtain  eq.  (0.24).  The  other  relation  can  be  derived  in  a  similar  way.    Note 
L = 2 /

that  the  Kramers-Krönig  relationships  are  a  consequence  of  causality,  which  dictate  the  lower

Example: Classical Response Function and Susceptibility 

We can model absorption of light through a resonant interaction of the electromagnetic field with 
an oscillating dipole, using Newton’s equations for a forced damped harmonic oscillator: 
2  x = F ( t ) 
x + γ  + ωx 
&&
&
0

(0.28)

8-8 

Here  the  x  is  the  coordinate  being  driven,  γ is  the  damping  constant,  and 

0ω =  k / m   is  the 
natural  frequency  of  the  oscillator. One way  to  solve  this  problem  is  to  take  the  driving  force  to 
have the form of a monochromatic oscillating source 
ω =t  qE0  cos ωt . 
m 

F t( ) = F  cos

Then, equation (0.28) has the solution

This  shows  that  the  driven  oscillator  has  an  oscillation  period  that  is  dictated  by  the  driving 
frequency ω,  and whose  amplitude  and phase  shift  relative  to  the driving  field  is dictated by  the 
detuning  (ω−ω0).  If  we  cycle  average  to  obtain  the  average  absorbed  power  from  the  field,  the 
absorption spectrum is

Again  we  are  integrating  over  the  entire  history  of  the  application  of  two  forces  f1  and  f2, 
including any quadratic dependence on  f  . 
In  this  case,  we  will  enforce 
causality  through  a  time  ordering  that 
requires  (1)  that  all  forces  must  be 
applied before a response  is observed and 
(2)  that  the  application  of  f2  must  follow

8-11 

To  develop  a  quantum  description  of  the  linear  response  function,  we  start  by  recognizing  that 
the response of a system to an applied external agent is a problem we can solve in the interaction 
picture.  Our time-dependent Hamiltonian is

H t

(0.44) 

H 0 is  the  material  Hamiltonian  for  the  equilibrium  system.  The  external  agent  acts  on  the 
equilibrium system through  ˆ
A , an operator in the system states, with a time-dependence f
(t).  We 
take V(t)  to  be  a  small  change,  and  treat  this  problem with  perturbation  theory  in  the  interaction 

picture.   
( )A t

We want  to  describe  the  non-equilibrium  response 
averaging  the  expectation  value  of Aˆ .  Remember  the  expectation  value  for  a  pure  state  in  the 
interaction picture is

To calculate an ensemble average of  the state of  the system after applying  the external potential, 
we recognize  that  the non-equilibrium state of  the system characterized by described by  ψ I ( t ) 

is  in  fact  related  to  the  initial  equilibrium  state  of  the  system  ψ 0  ,  as  seen  in  eq.  (0.45).  So  the

The important thing to note is that the time-development of the system with the applied external 
potential is governed by the dynamics of the equilibrium system.  All of the time-dependence in 
the response function is under H0. 
The  linear  response  function  is  therefore  the  sum  of  two  correlation  functions  with  the 
order  of  the  operators  interchanged,  which  is  the  imaginary  part  of  the  correlation  function

8.3. THE RESPONSE FUNCTION AND ENERGY ABSORPTION 
Let’s  investigate  the  relationship  between  the  linear  response  function  and  the  absorption  of 
energy  from  an  electromagnetic  field.  We  will  relate  this  to  the  absorption  coefficient  α 
&α= E I/
 which we have described previously.  For this case,

This  expression  gives  the  energy  of  the  system,  so  the  rate  of  energy  absorption  averaged  over 
the non-equilibrium ensemble is described by:  
∂f A t
∂H

We will want  to cycle-average  this over  the oscillating field, so  the  time-averaged rate of energy

So  the  absorption  of  energy  from  an  external  force,  that  is  the  time-evolution  of  a  non-
equilibrium system,  is  related  to  the  imaginary part of χ .  In  turn, within  the weak perturbations 
allowed by  linear  response,  χ  is  related  to  the Fourier  transform of  the correlation  function  that 
describes the fluctuations and dynamics of the equilibrium system  C AA  ( t ) .  Relationships of this 
form  that  relate  non-equilibrium  dynamics  of  the  system  driven  away  or  relaxing  toward 
equilibrium  to  the  fluctuations  about  the  equilibrium  state  are  known  as  fluctuation-dissipation 
relationships. 

8.3. RELAXATION OF A PREPARED STATE

  describes  the 

The  impulse  response  function 

( )R t
behavior  of  a  system  initially  at  equilibrium  that  is 
driven  by  an  external  field.    Alternatively,  we  may 
need  to describe  the  relaxation of  a prepared  state,  in 
which  we  follow  the  return  to  equilibrium  of  a 
system  initially  held  in  a  non-equilibrium  state.  This 
behavior is described by step response function  S t( ) . 
The  step  response  comes  from  holding  the  system 
with  a  constant  field  H H 0  − fA   until  a  time  t0  when  the  system  is  released,  and  it  relaxes  to 
= 
the equilibrium state governed by  H H 0 .
= 
We  can  anticipate  that  the  form  of  these  two 
functions  are  related.  Just  as we  expect  that  the  impulse 
response  to  rise  from  zero  and  be  expressed  as  an  odd 
function  in  time,  the  step  response  should  decay  from  a 
fixed  value  and  look  even  in  time.  In  fact,  we  might 
expect 
response  by 
impulse 
the 
to  describe 
differentiating the step response.

•  Quantum Correlation Functions are complex:  
•  Classical Correlation Functions are real and even:   C t( ) = C ( −t ) 

For relaxation in terms of a real observable that is even in time, we construct a symmetrized 
function:

S is related to the real part of the correlation function, and defined for  t ≥ 0 .  The impulse

This is the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (Chemistry Nobel Prize, 1968; proven in 1951 by

Lars Onsager (1930):  The relaxation of macroscopic non-equilibrium disturbance is governed by 
the same laws as the regression of spontaneous microscopic fluctuations in an equilibrium state.
