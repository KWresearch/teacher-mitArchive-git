7.4 QUANTUM MECHANICAL TREATMENT OF FLUCTUATIONS§ 

Introduction 
In  describing  fluctuations  in  a  quantum  mechanical  system,  we  will  now  address  how  they 
manifest  themselves  in  an  electronic  absorption  spectrum  by  returning  to  the  Displaced 
Harmonic  Oscillator  model.  As  previously  discussed,  we  can  also  interpret  the  DHO  model  in 
terms  of  an  electronic  energy  gap  which  is  modulated  as  a  result  of  interactions  with  nuclear 
motion.  While  this motion  is  periodic  for  the  case  coupling  to  a  single  harmonic  oscillator, we 
will  look  this  more  carefully  for  a  continuous  distribution  of  oscillators,  and  show  the 
correspondence to classical stochastic equations of motion.  

Energy Gap Hamiltonian 

Now  let’s  work  through  the  description  of  the  Energy  Gap  Hamiltonian  more  carefully. 
Remember  that  the Hamiltonian  for  coupling  of  an  electronic  transition  to  a harmonic degree of 
freedom is written as  

H 0  = H e  + Ee  + H g  + Eg 
H 0  = (cid:61)ωeg  + H eg  + 2H g 
where the Energy Gap Hamiltonian is 

(7.48) 

(7.49) 

H eg  = H e  − H g  . 
Note  how  eq.  (7.49)  can  be  thought  of  as  an  electronic  “system”  interacting  with  a  harmonic 
“bath”, where  H eg   plays the role of the system-bath interaction: 
+ H B 
H 0  = H S  + H SB
 
We  will  express  the  energy  gap  Hamiltonian  through  reduced  coordinates  for  the 
momentum, coordinate, and displacement of the oscillator

= − 2(cid:61)ω0 d q  + λ

(cid:4) (cid:4)
So,  we  see  that  the  energy  gap  Hamiltonian  describes  a 
linear  coupling  of  the  electronic  system  to  the  coordinate  q. 
The  slope  of  Heg  versus  q  is  the  coupling  strength,  and  the 
average  value  of Heg  in  the  ground  state, Heg(q=0),  is  offset 
by the reorganization energy λ. 
To  obtain  the  absorption  lineshape  from  the  dipole 
correlation  function  we  must  evaluate 
the  dephasing 
function.

We  now  want  to  rewrite  the  dephasing  function  in  terms  of  the  time  dependence  to  the  energy 
gap  H eg  ;  that  is,  if  F t( ) =  U eg 
,  then  what  is  U eg  ?  This  involves  a  transformation  of  the 
dynamics to a new frame of reference and a new Hamiltonian. The transformation from the DHO 
Hamiltonian  to  the  EG Hamiltonian  is  similar  to  our  derivation  of  the  interaction  picture.   Note 
the mapping 

H  = H 0  +V 
H e  = H g  + H eg
  ⇔ 
Then  we  see  that  we  can  represent  the  time  dependence  of  H eg  by  evolution  under  H g  .  The 
time-propagators are

Remembering  the  equivalence  between  H g  and  the  bath  mode(s)  H B  indicates  that  the  time 
dependence  of  the  EG  Hamiltonian  reflects  how  the  electronic  energy  gap  is  modulated  as  a 
result of the interactions with the bath.  That is U g  = U B  .

Note: Transformation of time-propagators to a new Hamiltonian

and we want to express this in terms of  
(  B −  A )t 
A e − i H   H   = A e  
− iH BAt
, 

we  will  now  be  evolving  the  system  under  a  different  Hamiltonian  H BA .  We  must 
perform  a  transformation  into  this  new  frame  of  reference, which  involves  a  unitary 
transformation under the reference Hamiltonian:

This is what we did for the interaction picture. Now, proceeding a bit differently, we

This is a result of how we defined  H eg  .  Alternatively, the EG Hamiltonian could also be defined 
relative to the energy gap at  Q = 0 :  H eg  = H e  − H g  −λ. In fact this is a more common definition. 
In this case the leading term in (7.64) would be zero, and the mean energy gap that describes the 
high frequency (system) oscillation in the dipole correlation function is ωeg +λ. 
The  second  exponential  term  in  (7.64)  is  a  correlation  function  that  describes  the  time

This  is  the  correlation  function  expression  that  determines  the  absorption  lineshape  for  a  time-
dependent energy gap.  It is a perfectly general expression at this point.  The only approximation 
made for the bath is the second cumulant expansion. 
Now,  let’s  look  specifically  at  the  case  where  the  bath  we  are  coupled  to  is  a  single 
harmonic mode. Evaluating the energy gap correlation function

Spectral representation of energy gap correlation function 
Since  time-  and  frequency  domain  representations  are  complementary,  and  one  form  may  be 
preferable over another, it is possible to express the frequency correlation function in terms of its 
spectrum.   We  define  a  Fourier  transform  pair  that  relates  the  time  and  frequency  domain 
representations:

Distribution of States: Coupling to a Harmonic Bath 
More  generally  for  condensed  phase  problems,  the  system  coordinates  that  we  observe  in  an 
experiment  will  interact  with  a  continuum  of  nuclear  motions  that  may  reflect  molecular 
vibrations, phonons, or intermolecular interactions. We conceive of this continuum as continuous 
distribution of harmonic oscillators of varying mode  frequency. The Energy Gap Hamiltonian  is 
readily  generalized  to  the  case  of  a  continuous  distribution  of  motions  if  we  statistically 
characterize the density of states and the strength of interaction between the system and this bath. 
This  method  is  also  referred  to  as  the  Spin-Boson  Model  used  for  treating  a  spin  two-level 
system interacting with a quantum harmonic bath. 
Following  our  earlier  discussion  of  the  DHO  model,  the  generalization  of  the  EG 
Hamiltonian to the multimode case is 
H 0  = (cid:61)ωeg  + H eg  + H B 
H B  = ∑ (cid:61)ωα ( pα

e− iH  t  (cid:61)
H eg  ( t ) = eiH t

Also, since the harmonic modes are normal to one another, the dephasing function and lineshape 
function are readily obtained from

For  a  continuum,  we  assume  that  the  number  of  modes  are  so  numerous  as  to  be 
continuous,  and  that  the  sums  in  the  equations  above  can  be  replaced  by  integrals  over  a 
continuous  distribution  of  states  characterized  by  a  density 
of  states  W (
)ω .  Also  the  interaction  with  modes  of  a 
particular frequency are equal so  that we can simply average

An  integral  of  a  single  harmonic  mode  spectrum  over  a  continuous  density  of  states  provides  a 
coupling  weighted  density  of  states  that  reflects  the  action  spectrum  for  the  system-bath 
interaction. We evaluate this with the single harmonic mode spectrum, eq. (7.86). We see that the 
spectrum  of  the  correlation  function  for  positive  frequencies  is  related  to  the  product  of  the 
density of states and the frequency dependent coupling

In this expression the temperature dependence implies that in the high temperature limit, the real 
part  of  g(t)  will  dominate,  as  expected  for  a  classical  system.  The  reorganization  energy  is

This  is  a perfectly general  expression  for  the  lineshape  function  in  terms of  an  arbitrary  spectral 
distribution describing the time-scale and amplitude of energy gap fluctuations.  Given a spectral 
density ρ(ω), you can calculate spectroscopy and other time-dependent processes in a fluctuating 
environment. 
Now,  let’s  evaluate  the  lineshape  function  for  two  special  cases  of  the  spectral  density. 
To  keep  things  simple, we will  look  specifically  at  the  high  temperature  limit,  kT  >> (cid:61)ω. Here 
coth (β(cid:61)ω 2 ) → 2 β ω(cid:61)   and  we  can  neglect  the  imaginary  part  of  the  frequency  correlation 
function and lineshape function:

1)  What happens when  C(cid:4) ′′ ω  grows linearly with frequency?  This represents a system that is

A  linearly  increasing  spectral  density  leads  to  a  homogeneous  Lorentzian  lineshape  with 
width  Γ.  This  case  corresponds  to  a  spectral  density  that  linearly  decreases  with  frequency, 
and is also referred to as the “white noise” spectrum.

2)  	 Now take the case that we choose a Lorentzian spectral density centered at ω=0. Specifically, 
let’s write the imaginary part of the Lorentzian lineshape in the form

Λ

g t( ) ≈  (cid:61)Λ 2  ⎣⎡exp ( −Λt ) + Λ  −t  1⎦⎤ 
This expression looks familiar.  If we equate

we obtain the same lineshape function as the classical Gaussian-stochastic model:

So,  the  interaction  of  an  electronic  transition  with  a  harmonic  bath  leads  to  line  broadening 
that is equivalent to random fluctuations of the energy gap.

Coupling to a Harmonic Bath: Correspondence to Stochastic Equation** 
So,  why  does  coupling  to  a  quantum  harmonic  bath  give  the  same  results  as  the  classical 
stochastic equations for fluctuations?  Why does coupling  to a continuum of bath states have  the 
same physical meaning as random fluctuations?  The answer is that in both cases, we really have 
imperfect  knowledge  of  the  particles  of  the  bath,  and  observing  a  subset  of  those  particles  will 
have  a  random  character  that  can  alternatively  be  viewed  as  a  correlation  function  or  a  spectral 
density for the time-scales of motion of the bath. 
To  take  this  discussion  further,  let’s  again  consider  the  electronic  absorption  spectrum 
from a classical perspective. It’s quite common to think that the electronic transition of interest is 
coupled  to  a  particular  nuclear  coordinate  Q   which  we  will  call  a  local  coordinate.  This  local 
coordinate  could  be  an  intramolecular  normal  vibrational  mode,  a  intermolecular  rattling  in  a 
solvent  shell,  a  lattice vibration, or  another motion  that  influences  the  electronic  transition.  The 
idea  is  that  we  take  the  observed  electronic  transition  to  be  linearly  dependent  on  one  or  more 
local coordinates. Therefore describing Q allows us to describe the spectroscopy. However, since 
this local mode has further degrees of freedom that it may be interacting with, we are extracting a 
particular  coordinate  out  or  a  continuum  of  other  motions,  the  local  mode  will  appear  to  feel  a 
fluctuating environment—a friction. 
Classically, we would describe  the  fluctuations  in Q as Brownian motion, described by a 
Langevin  equation.  In  the  simplest  sense  this  is  an  equation  that  restates Newton’s  equation  of 
motion F=ma for a fluctuating force acting on a harmonic coordinate Q.

Here  the  terms on  the  left  side  represent  a damped harmonic oscillator. The  first  term  is ma,  the 
second  term  is  the  restoring  force  of  the  harmonic  potential  Fres = ∂
∂Q ,  and  the  third  term
V 
allows  friction γ to  damp  the  motion  of  the  coordinate.  The  motion  of  Q  is  driven  by  f(t),  a 
random  fluctuating  force.  We  take  f(t)  to  follow  Gaussian  statistics  and  obey  the  classical 
fluctuation-dissipation theorem:

Here  the  delta  function  indicates  that  we  have  a  Markovian  system  −  the  fluctuations 
immediately loose all correlation on the time scale of the evolution of Q. 
A more general description is the Generalized Langevin Equation, which accounts for the

Bath of H.O.s,  Xα 

Therefore,  a  harmonic  bath  can  be  used  to  construct  the  behavior  corresponding  to 
random fluctuations. The important thing to remember when using a harmonic bath is that it is an 
abstract  entity  and  does  not  have  a  clear  physical  interpretation  in  and  of  itself.    If  the  spectral 
density  has  a  peak  at  a  frequency  that  corresponds  to  a  known  vibration  of  the  molecule,  it  is 
reasonable to assume that the electronic transition is coupled to this motion. On the other hand if 
the  spectral  density  is  broad  and  featureless,  as  is  common  for  low  frequency  intermolecular 
motions  in  condensed  phases,  then  it  is  difficult  to  ascribe  a  clear  microscopic  origin  to  the 
motion.  It  is  challenging  to  evaluate  and  understand  both  the  frequency  dependent  density  of 
states and the frequency dependent coupling, making is that much more challenging to assign the 
spectral density. Strategies that are meant to decompose and assign these effects remain an active 
area of research.

The Brownian Oscillator 
Now  we  do  back  to  our  energy  gap  Hamiltonian  and  express  it  in  a  form  that  describes  the 
energy  gap  dependence  on  one  primary  vibration  which  is  linearly  coupled  to  the  remaining 
modes of a quantum bath.  This formulation is known as the Brownian oscillator model. 
We begin by writing 

H H= 

S  + H B  + H SB 
where  the  system  Hamiltonian  is  the  full  Hamiltonian  for  a  displaced  harmonic  oscillator 
Hamiltonian which described the coupling of the electronic energy gap to a local mode, q. 
H S  =  E  H E  E  + G  H G  G

coordinates of the bath xa

correlation  function  allows  one  to  vary  the  parameters  to  interpolates  smoothly  between  the 
coherent undamped limit and the overdamped Gaussian stochastic limit.  Consider the following: 

1)  If we  set  γ→ 0 , we  recover  our  earlier  result  for Ceg(t)  and  g(t)  for  coupling  to  a  single 
undamped nuclear coordinates and leads to fine structure on the electronic spectrum
