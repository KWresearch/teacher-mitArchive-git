THE DENSITY MATRIX 
The  density  matrix  or  density  operator  is  an  alternate  representation  of  the  state  of  a  quantum 
system  for  which  we  have  previously  used  the  wavefunction.  Although  describing  a  quantum 
system  with  the  density  matrix  is  equivalent  to  using  the  wavefunction,  one  gains  significant 
practical  advantages using  the  density matrix  for  certain  time-dependent problems – particularly 
relaxation and nonlinear spectroscopy in the condensed phase.  
The  density  matrix  is  formally  defined  as  the  outer  product  of  the  wavefunction  and  its 
conjugate. 

ρ( t ) ≡ ψ( t )  ψ( t ) . 

(1.1) 

This implies that if you specify a state  χ  , the integral  χρχ  gives the probability of finding 

a particle in the state  χ  . Its name derives from the observation that it plays the quantum role of 

a probability density.  If you think of the statistical description of a classical observable obtained 
from moments of a probability distribution P, then ρ plays the role of P in the quantum case:

where Tr[…] refers to tracing over the diagonal elements of the matrix.  

The last expression is obtained as follows. For a system described by a wavefunction 

the expectation value of an operator is 

ψ( t )  = ∑ cn ( t ) n  ,

We  see  that ρn m  ,  the  density  matrix  elements,  are  made  up  of  the  time-evolving  expansion 
coefficients.  Substituting into eq. (1.5) we see that 
ˆ

A t( ) 
n m

ˆ  ( )⎦ 
= Tr  A ⎡ ρ t  ⎤
⎣
In  practice  this  makes  evaluating  expectation  values  as  simple  as  tracing  over  a  product  of 
matrices.  

(1.7) 

So why would we need the density matrix?  It is a practical tool when dealing with mixed 
states. Pure states are those that are characterized by a single wavefunction.  Mixed states refer to 
statistical mixtures in which we have imperfect information about the system, for which me must 
perform  statistical  averages  in  order  to  describe  quantum  observables.    A  mixed  state  refers  to 
any  case  in  which  we  subdivide  a  microscopic  or  macroscopic  system  into  an  ensemble,  for 
which  there  is  initially  no  phase  relationship  between  the  elements  of  the  mixture.    Examples 
include an ensemble at thermal equilibrium, and independently prepared states.  
Given  that  you  have  a  statistical  mixture,  and  can  describe  the  probability  pk   of 
,  with  ∑ pk  = 1 ,  evaluation  of  expectation  values  is  simplified

elements of ρ are obtained.

The  last  expression  reflects  the  fact  that  diagonal  matrix  elements  can  be  0  or  1  for  pure  states 
but  lie between 0 and 1  for mixed  states.  In addition, when working with  the density matrix  it  is 
convenient to make note of these trace properties:  

1)  Cyclic invariance:     Tr ( ABC ) = Tr  CAB 
(

2)  Invariance to unitary transformation:

Density matrix elements 

Let’s discuss the density matrix elements for a mixture. You can think about this as an ensemble 
in which  the  individual molecules  (i  =  1  to  N)  are  described  in  terms  of  the  same  internal  basis 
states  n  ,  but  the  probability  of  occupying  those  states  may  vary  from  molecule  to  molecule. 

We then expect that we can express the state of a certain molecule as  
ψi  = ∑ c n  , 
i
n 
n 
where  cn
i    is  the  complex  and  time-dependent  amplitude  coefficient  for  the  occupation  of  basis 
state  n  on molecule i.  Then the density matrix elements are

This  expression  states  that  the  density  matrix  elements  represent  values  of  the  eigenstate 
coefficients averaged over the mixture:

Density matrix at thermal equilibrium 

Our  work  with  statistical  mixtures  will  deal  heavily  with  systems  at  thermal  equilibrium.  The 
density  matrix  at  thermal  equilibrium  ρeq  (or  ρ0)  is  characterized  by  thermally  distributed 
populations in the quantum states: 

e 
−βEn
Z 
where  Z  is  the  partition  function.  This  follows  naturally  from  the  general  definition  of  the 
equilibrium density matrix

TIME-EVOLUTION OF THE DENSITY MATRIX 
The equation of motion for the density matrix follows naturally from the definition of  ρ and the 
time-dependent Schrödinger equation.  Using

Equation  (1.27)  is  the  Liouville-Von  Neumann  equation.    It  is  isomorphic  to  the  Heisenberg 
equation of motion for internal variables, since ρ is also an operator. The solution is  
ρ( t ) = U ρ( 0 )U † . 
This can be demonstrated by first integrating eq. (1.27) to obtain  
i  t

If we expand eq.  (1.29) by  iteratively  substituting  into  itself,  the expression  is  the  same as when 
we substitute

(1.30) 

Note  that  eq.  (1.28)  and  the  cyclic  invariance  of  the  trace  imply  that  the  time-dependent 
expectation  value  of  an  operator  can  be  calculated  either  by  propagating  the  operator 
(Heisenberg) or the density matrix (Schrödinger or interaction picture):

For  a  time-independent Hamiltonian  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that  the  density matrix 
elements evolve as 

ρ  ( )t  =  n

− iωnm ( t −t0 )

(1.32)

(1.33) 

From  this we see  that populations,  ρnn  ( t ) = ρnm  ( t0 ) , are  time-invariant, and coherences oscillate 
at the energy splitting ωnm . 

The density matrix in the interaction picture 

For  the  case  in  which  we  wish  to  describe  a material  Hamiltonian H0  under  the  influence  of  an 
external potential V(t), 

H t( ) = H 0  + V ( t ) 
we  can  also  formulate  the  density  operator  in  the  interaction  picture  ρI.  From  our  original 
definition of the interaction picture wavefunctions

of motion in the interaction picture is

Correlation Functions and Response Functions

value in a product of operators: 

C AA  ( t ) =  A t( ) A ( 0 )

= ∑ pn  n A t( )  ( )A  0  n
