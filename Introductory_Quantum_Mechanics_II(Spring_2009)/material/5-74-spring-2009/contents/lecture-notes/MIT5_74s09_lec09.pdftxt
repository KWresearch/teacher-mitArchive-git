7.  OBSERVING FLUCTUATIONS IN SPECTROSCOPY1 
Here  we  will  address  how  fluctuations  are  observed  in  spectroscopy  and  how  dephasing 
influences  the  absorption  lineshape.  Our  approach  will  be  to  calculate  a  dipole  correlation 
function  for  a  dipole  interacting  with  a  fluctuating  environment,  and  show  how  the  time  scale 
and  amplitude  of  fluctuations  are  encoded  in  the  lineshape. Although  the  description  here  is  for 
the  case  of  a  spectroscopic  observable,  the  approach  can  be  applied  to  any  such  problems  in 
which  the  deterministic  motions  of  an  object  under  an  external  potential  are  modulated  by  a 
random force.  
We  also  aim  to  establish  a  connection  between  this  picture  and  the Displaced Harmonic 
Oscillator  model.  Specifically,  we  will  show  that  a  frequency-domain  representation  of  the 
coupling between a transition and a continuous distribution of harmonic modes is equivalent to a 
time-domain  picture  in  which  the  transition  energy  gap  fluctuates  about  an  average  frequency 
with a statistical time-scale and amplitude given by the distribution coupled modes.  

7.1.  FLUCTUATIONS AND RANDOMNESS: SOME DEFINITIONS2 
“Fluctuations”  is  my  word  for  the  time-evolution  of  a  randomly  modulated  system  at  or  near 
equilibrium.  You  are  observing  an  internal  variable  to  a  system  under  the  influence  of  thermal 
agitation  of  the  surroundings.  Such  processes  are  also  commonly  referred  to  as  stochastic.  A 
stochastic  equation  of  motion  is  one  in  which  there  is  both  a  deterministic  and  a  random 
component to the time-development.   
Randomness  is  a  characteristic  of  all  physical  systems  to  a  certain  degree,  even  if  the 
equations  of  motion  that  govern  them  are  totally  deterministic.    This  is  because  we  generally 
have  imperfect  knowledge  about  all  of  the  degrees  of  freedom  for  the  system.    This  is  the  case 
when  we  look  at  a  subset  of  particles  which  are  under  the  influence  of  others  that  we  have 
imperfect  knowledge  of.  The  result  is  that  we  may  observe  random  fluctuations  in  our 
observables.  This  is  always  the  case  in  condensed  phase  problems.    It’s  unreasonable  to  think 
that  you  will  come  up  with  an  equation  of  motion  for  the  internal  determinate  variable,  but  we 
should be able  to understand  the behavior statistically and come up with equations of motion for 
probability distributions

Press,  New  York,  2006),  Chapter  7;  C.H.  Wang,  Spectroscopy  of  Condensed  Media:  Dynamics  of

When  we  introduced  correlation  functions,  we  discussed  the  idea  that  a  statistical 
description of a  system  is commonly  formulated  in  terms of probability distribution  functions P. 
Observables  are  commonly  described  by moments  of  a  variable  obtained  by  integrating  over  P, 
for instance

Random  fluctuations  are  also  described 
distribution,  for which we need  an  equation of motion. A  common  example of  such  a process  is 
Brownian  motion,  the  fluctuating  position  of  a  particle  under  the  influence  of  a  thermal 
environment.  It’s not practical  to describe  the  absolute position 
of  the  particle,  but we  can  formulate  an  equation  of motion  for 
 
the  probability  of  finding  the  particle  in  time  and  space  given 
that you know its initial position. This probability density obeys 
the  well  known  diffusion  equation,  here  written  in  one 
dimension:

∂Ρ ( x t,  ) = D  ∂

∂t 
∂x 2 
Here  D  is  the  diffusion  constant  which  sets  the  time-scale  and  spatial  extent  of  the  random 
motion.  Note  the  similarity  of  this  equation  to  the  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation  for  a 
free  particle  if  D  is  taken  as  imaginary.  Given  the  initial  condition  Ρ ( x, t0 ) = δ( x − x0 ) ,  the 
solution is a conditional probability density

The  probability  distribution  describes  the  statistics  for 
fluctuations  in  the  position  of  a  particle  averaged  over 
many  trajectories.  Analyzing  the  moments  of  this 
probability density in eq. (7.2) we find that  

x  = 0 
2x  = 2Dt 

7-3 

(7.6)

So, the distribution maintains a Gaussian shape centered at  x0  , and broadening with time as 2Dt. 
Brownian motion  is  an  example  of  a Gaussian-Markovian  process. Here Gaussian  refers 
(
) as  a  Gaussian
Ρ x
to  cases  in  which  we  describe  the  probability  distribution  for  a  variable 

normal distribution.  Here in one dimension:

(7.7)

The  Gaussian  distribution  is  important,  because  the  central  limit  theorem  states  that  the 
distribution  of  a  continuous  random  variable  with  finite  variance  will  follow  the  Gaussian 
distribution. Gaussian distributions also are completely defined  in  terms of  their  first and second 
moments, meaning that a time-dependent probability density P(x,t) is uniquely characterized by a 
mean value  in  the observable variable x and a correlation function  that describes  the fluctuations 
in  x.  Gaussian  distributions  for  systems  at  thermal  equilibrium  are  also  important  for  the 
relationship between Gaussian distributions and parabolic free energy surfaces:   
( ) = −kT  
( x ) 
G x  
ln Ρ
If  the probability density  is Gaussian  along  x,  then  the  system’s  free  energy projected  along  this 
coordinate  (often  referred  to  as  a  potential  of mean 
force)  has  a  harmonic  shape.  Thus  Gaussian 
statistics  are  effective  for  describing  fluctuations 
about an equilibrium mean value  x0 . 
Markovian means that, given the knowledge of the state of the system at time  t1 , you can 
exactly  describe  P  for  a  later  time  t2  .  That  is,  the  system  has  no memory  of  the  behavior  at  an 
earlier time  t0 .

Markovian  therefore  refers  to  a  timescale  long  compared  to  correlation  time  for  the  internal 
variable that you care about.  For instance, the diffusion equation only holds after the particle has 
experienced  sufficient  collisions  with  its  surroundings  that  it  has  no  memory  of  its  earlier 
position and momentum:  t >τc .

7.2.  FLUCTUATIONS IN SPECTROSCOPY: SPECTRAL DIFFUSION 
To  begin  our  discussion  about  how  fluctuations  manifest  themselves  in  spectroscopy,  let’s 
discuss their influence on the transition energy gap ωeg for the absorption lineshape. Consider the 
two limiting cases of line broadening:   

7-5 

Homogeneous:  	

Inhomogeneous:  	

Here,  the  absorption  lineshape  is  dynamically  broadened  by 
rapid  variations  in  the  amplitude,  phase,  or  orientation  of 
dipoles.  Pure dephasing, lifetime, and rotation all contribute to 
an  exponential  decay  time  T2 . For  our  current  discussion,  let’s 
only  concentrate on pure-dephasing  T2
*   from  rapid  fluctuations 
in ωeg. 

In  this  limit,  the  lineshape  reflects  a  static  distribution  of 
resonance  frequencies,  and  the  width  of  the  line  represents 
the  distribution  of  frequencies,  which  arise,  for  instance, 
from different structural environments.   

Spectral Diffusion 

More generally,  every  system  lies between  these  limits. 
Imagine 
every  molecule 
having 
a 
different 
i  ( ) 
“instantaneous  frequency”  ω  t
  which  evolves  in
time.  This  process  is  known  as  spectral  diffusion.  The 
homogeneous  and 
inhomogeneous 
limits  can  be 
described  as  limiting  forms  for  the  fluctuations  of  a 
i  ( ) through a distribution of frequencies Δ
ω  t
.

i  ( ) evolves rapidly relative to Δ-1, the system is homogeneously broadened. If ω  t  evolves

slowly  the  system  is  inhomogeneous.    This  behavior  can  be  quantified  through  the  transition 
frequency  time-correlation  function  Ceg  ( t ) =  ωeg  ( t )ωeg  ( 0 )  .  Our  job  will  be  to  relate  the

7.3.  GAUSSIAN-STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR SPECTRAL DIFFUSION 

We will begin with a classical description of how random fluctuations in frequency influence the 
absorption  lineshape,  by  calculating  the  dipole  correlation  function  for  the  resonant  transition. 
This  is  a  Gaussian  stochastic  model 
for  fluctuations,  meaning  that  we 
will describe  the  time-dependence of 
transition  energy  as  random 
the 
fluctuations  about  an  average  value 
with a Gaussian statistics.   

ω( t ) =  ω +δω ( t ) 
δω( t ) = 0 
The  fluctuations  in  ω  allow  the  system  to  explore  a  Gaussian  distribution  of  transitions 
frequencies characterized by a variance: 

(7.11) 

(7.10) 

Δ =  δω2  1/ 2  . 

(7.12) 

Furthermore,  we  will  describe  the  time  scale  of  the  random  fluctuations  through  a  correlation 
time:   

1  ∞
Δ 2  ∫0 
Let’s  treat  the  dipole  moment  as  a  classical  internal  variable  to  the  system,  whose  time

The dephasing function here is obtained by performing an equilibrium average of the exponential 
argument over  fluctuating  trajectories.  For  ergodic  systems,  this  is equivalent  to averaging  long 
enough over a single trajectory. 
The  dephasing  function  is  a  bit  of  a  complicated  to  work  with  as  written.  However,  for 
the case of Gaussian statistics for the fluctuations, it is possible to simplify  F t( ) by expanding it 
as a cumulant expansion of averages  (see Appendix)

In  this  expression  the  first  term  is  zero,  and  only  the  second  term  survives  for  a  system  with

that  describes  the  fluctuating  energy  gap.  Note  that  this  is  a  classical  description,  so  there  is  no 
time-ordering to the exponential.  Now recognizing that we have a stationary system, we have

So  the  Gaussian  stochastic  model  allows  the  influence  of  the  frequency  fluctuations  on  the 
lineshape to be described by a frequency correlation function that follows Gaussian statistics. 

(7.22)

Cδωδω ( t ) = δω( t )δω( 0 ) 
Note we are now dealing with two different correlation functions  Cδωδωand  Cμμ. 

(7.23) 

7-9 

Now, we will calculate the lineshape assuming that  Cδωδω  takes on an exponential form 
Cδωδω ( t ) = Δ 2  exp [ −t /τc ] 
(7.24) 

Then eq. (7.22) gives 

F t( ) = exp ⎣⎡−Δ τc  ( exp ( −t /τc ) + t /τc − 1)⎤⎦ . 
2 2
Or given  F t( ) = exp ( − g t

g t( ) = Δ τc  ( exp ( −t /τc ) + t /τc − 1)

Let’s look at the limiting forms of  g t( ) :

t <<τc .  This  corresponds  to  the  inhomogeneous

and from eq. (7.26) we obtain  


g t(  ) = Δ  t

At  short  times,  our  dipole  correlation  function  will  have  a  Gaussian  decay  with  a  rate 
given  by  Δ2:  F t( ) = exp ( −Δ  t
/ 2 ) .  This  has  the  proper  behavior  for  a  classical 
2 2
correlation function, i.e.  even in time  Cμμ ( t ) = Cμμ ( −t ) .

Very  short  correlation  times:  t >>τc .  This  corresponds  to  the  homogeneous  limit  in 
which you can approximate  Cδωδω ( t ) = Δ 2δ( t ) .  For  t >>τc  we set  e− t /τ ≈ 0 ,  t /τc  >> 1

frequencies,  if  the  system explores all of  these  frequencies on a  time scale  fast compared 
to  the  inverse  of  the  distribution  (Δ τc  >  1),  then  the  resonance  will  be  “motionally

We  see  that  for  a  fixed  distribution  of  frequencies  Δ  the  effect  of  increasing  the  time  scale  of 
fluctuations  through  this  distribution  (decreasing  τc)  is  to  gradually  narrow  the  observed 
lineshape  from  a Gaussian  distribution  of  static  frequencies with width  (FWHM)  of  2.35·Δ  to  a 
motionally narrowed Lorentzian lineshape with width (FWHM) of  Δ 2τ c  π = Δ ⋅ κ π . 
This  is  analogous  to  the  motional  narrowing  effect  first  described  in  the  case  of 
temperature  dependent  NMR  spectra  of  two  exchanging  species.  Assume  we  have  two 
resonances at ωA and ωB associated with two chemical species that are exchanging at a rate kAB 
k AB
A ⎯⎯→ B
←⎯⎯ 
kBA 
If  the  rate of  exchange  is  slow  relative  to  the  frequency  splitting,  kAB << ωA−ωB,  then we  expect 
two  resonances,  each  with  a  linewidth  dictated  by  the  molecular  relaxation  processes  (Τ2)  and 
transfer  rate  of  each  species.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the  rate  of  exchange  between  the  two 
species becomes faster than the energy splitting, then the two resonances narrow together to form 
one resonance at the mean frequency.3

An  expansion  in  cumulants  converges  much  more  rapidly  than  an  expansion  in  moments, 
particularly when you consider that x may be a time-dependent variable.  For a system that obeys 
Gaussian statistics, all cumulants with n > 2 vanish! 
We  obtain  the  cumulants  above  by  comparing  terms  in  powers  of  x  in  eq.  (7.35)  and 
(7.36).  We start by postulating that instead of expanding the exponential directly, we can instead 
expand the exponential argument in powers of an operator or variable H

The  cumulant  expansion  can  also  be  applied  to  time-correlations.  Applying  this  to  the 
time-ordered exponential operator we obtain:
