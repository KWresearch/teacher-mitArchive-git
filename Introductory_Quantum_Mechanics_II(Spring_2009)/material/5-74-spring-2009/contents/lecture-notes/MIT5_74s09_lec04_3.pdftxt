4.3. EINSTEIN B COEFFICIENT AND ABSORPTION CROSS-SECTION 

The rate of absorption induced by the field is

The  rate  is  clearly  dependent  on  the  strength  of  the  field.    The  variable  that  you  can  most  easily 
measure  is  the  intensity I,  the energy  flux  through a unit area, which  is  the  time-averaged value of 
the Poynting vector, S

If  we  associate  the  energy  density  with  a  number  of  photons  N,  then  U   can  also  be  written  in  a 
quantum form

Now  let’s  relate  the  rates  of  absorption  to  a  quantity  that  is  directly  measured,  an 
absorption cross-section α: 

α=

More  generally,  you  may  have  a  frequency-dependent  absorption  coefficient  α ω ∝ Bk ω

also gives the same rate for stimulated emission.  Given two levels  m  and  n  :

The absorption probability per unit time equals the stimulated emission probability per unit time.   

Also,  the  cross-section  for  absorption  is  equal  to  an  equivalent  cross-section  for  stimulated 
emission,  (

We  can  now  use  a  phenomenological  approach  to  calculate  the  change  in  the  intensity  of 
incident  light,  due  to  absorption  and  stimulated  emission  passing  through  a  sample  of  length  L 
where  the  levels  are  thermally  populated.    Given  that  we  have  a  thermal  distribution  of  identical

Here  N n  and  N m   are  population  of  the  upper  and  lower  states,  but  expressed  as  a  population

We see that the transmission of light through the sample decays exponentially as a function of path 
length.  ΔN = N n  − N m      is  the  thermal population difference between states. The second expression 
comes from the high frequency approximation applicable to optical spectroscopy, but certainly not 
for magnetic resonance:  N N .
