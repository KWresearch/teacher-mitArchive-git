IRREVERSIBLE RELAXATION1 

It may not seem clear how  irreversible behavior arises  from  the deterministic TDSE, although  this 
is  a  hallmark  of  all  chemical  systems.  To  show  how  this  comes  about,  we  will  describe  the 
relaxation of  an  initially prepared  state  as  a  result of coupling  to  a  continuum.  We will  show  that 
first-order  perturbation  theory  for  transfer  to  a  continuum  leads  to  irreversible  transfer—an 
exponential decay—when you include the depletion of the initial state.   

The Golden Rule gives the probability of transfer to a continuum as:   
2π Vk A

∂Pk A  =

The  probability  of  being  observed  in  k   varies  linearly  in  time.    This  will  clearly  only  work  for 
( ) ≈ k 0
( ) .

short times, which is no surprise since we said for first-order P.T. 
k 

What  long-time  behavior  do  we  expect?    A  time-independent  rate  is  also  expected 
for  exponential  relaxation.  In  fact,  for  exponential  relaxation  out  of  a  state  A  ,  the  short  time 

behavior looks just like the first order result: 

AA  ( ) =  AA  ( 0 exp  
( wk A t ) 
)

So we might believe that  wk A  represents the tangent to the relaxation behavior at t = 0 . 

wk A =

(3.3)

The problem we had previously was we don’t account for depletion of initial state.   

From  an  exact  solution  to  the  two-level  problem,  we  saw  that  probability  oscillates 
sinusoidally between the two states with a frequency given by the coupling:

= 

But  we  don’t  have  a  two-state  system.    Rather,  we  are  relaxing  to  a  continuum.    We  might 
 
imagine  that  coupling  to  a  continuous  distribution  of  states  may  in  fact  lead  to  exponential 
relaxation,  if  destructive  interferences  exist  between  oscillations  at many  frequencies  representing 
exchange of amplitude between the intital state and continuum states. 

COUPLING TO CONTINUUM 

When  we  look  at  the  long-time  probability  amplitude  of  the  initial  state  (including  depletion  and 
feedback), we will find  that we get exponential decay.   The decay of  the  initial state  is  irreversible 
because there is feedback with a distribution of destructively interfering phases.   
Let’s  look  at  transitions  to  a  continuum  of  states  { k }   from  an  initial  state  A   under

(3.4) 

As  we  go  on,  you  will  see  that  we  can  identify  A   with  the  “system”  and  { k } with  the  “bath” 
+ H .  We  want  a  more  accurate  description  of  the  occupation  of  the

For  first-order  perturbation  theory,  we  set  the  final  term  in  this  equation U I  (τ, t0 ) → 1 .  Here  we 
keep it as is.

(3.8)

Note, here Vkn is not a function of time.  Equation (3.8) expresses the occupation of state k in terms 
of  the  full  history  of  the  system  from  t0  → t   with  amplitude  flowing  back  and  forth  between  the 
states n. Equation  (3.8)  is  just  the  integral  form of  the coupled differential equations,  that we used 
before:

(3.9) 

These exact forms allow for feedback between all the states, in which the amplitudes  bk  depend on 
all other states.   

Now  let’s  make  some  simplifying  assumptions.    For  transitions  into  the  continuum,  let’s 
assume  that  transitions  in  the  continuum  only  occur  from  the  initial  state.    That  is,  there  are  no 
k V  
k ′
This  can  be  rationalized  by 
= 0 . 
 
interactions  between  the  states  of  the  continuum: 

thinking  of  this  problem  as  a  discrete  set  of  states  interacting with  a  continuum  of  normal modes. 
Moreover  we  will  assume  that  the  coupling  of  the  initial  to  continuum  states  is  a  constant  for  all 
states k:  A V k  =  A V k ′  = constant . 

So  since  you  only  feed  from  A   into  k  ,  we  can  remove  the  summation  in  (3.8)  and 

express the complex amplitude of a state within the continuum as 

t 
bk  = − = Vk A  ∫t0 
i

A  ( )τ 
τ  ω τ  b

(3.10) 

3-4 

We  want  to  calculate  the  rate  of  leaving  A  ,  including  feeding  from  continuum  back  into  initial 

state.  From eq. (3.9) we can separate terms involving the continuum and the initial state:   
i= ∂  bA  = ∑ eiωAk t  VAk  bk  + VAA  bA 
∂t
k ≠ A 

Now substituting (3.10) into (3.11), and setting t0  = 0 :

(3.12)

This  is an  integro-differential equation  that describes how  the  time-development of  bA  depends on 
 
entire history of the system.   Note we have two time variables for the two propagation routes: 

τ:  A  →  k 
t :  k  →  A

(3.13)

The  next  assumption  is  that  bA   varies  slowly  relative  to ωk A ,  so  we  can  remove  it  from  integral. 
This is effectively a weak coupling statement: =ωk A  >> Vk A . b  is a function of time, but since it is in 
the interaction picture it evolves slowly compared to the ωk A oscillations in the integral.

We  see  that  one  has  exponential  decay  of  amplitude  of bA  !  This  is  a  manner  of  irreversible 
relaxation from coupling to the continuum.

The  solutions  to  the  TDSE  are  expected  to  be  complex 
and  oscillatory.  What  we  see  here  is  a  real    dissipative 
component and an imaginary dispersive component. The 
probability  decays  exponentially  from  initial  state. 
Fermi’s Golden Rule rate tells you about long times!   

Now, what is the probability of appearing in any

The probability distribution for occupying states within the continuum is described by a Lorentzian 
distribution  with  a  width  given  by  the  relaxation  rate.    Note  that  the  final  states  with  maximum 
probability of being occupied is centered at the corrected energy of the initial state EA ′  .
