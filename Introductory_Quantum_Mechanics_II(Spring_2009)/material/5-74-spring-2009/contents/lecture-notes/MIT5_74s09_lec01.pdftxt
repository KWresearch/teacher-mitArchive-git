5.74  TIME-DEPENDENT QUANTUM MECHANICS 

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Time-evolution for time-independent Hamiltonians 
The  time  evolution  of  the  state  of  a  quantum  system  is  described  by  the  time-dependent 
Schrödinger equation (TDSE): 

(1.1)


is  the Hamiltonian operator which describes  all  interactions between  particles  and  fields,  and 
is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy. For one particle 

(1.2)


The  state  of  the  system  is  expressed  through  the  wavefunction 

.  The  wavefunction  is 

complex and cannot be observed itself, but through it we obtain the probability density 

(1.3)


which  characterizes  the  probability  that  the  particle  described  by 
time t. 

is  between 

and 

at 

Most  of  what  you  have  previously  covered  is  time-independent  quantum  mechanics, 
where we mean  that  the Hamiltonian 
is assumed  to be independent  of  time: 
.  We 

then  assume  a  solution  with  a  form  in  which  the  spatial  and  temporal  variables  in  the 
wavefunction are separable:

,  or  rather  position  and momentum).  Equation  (1.5)  can  only  be  satisfied  if  both 
space  only  ( 
sides are equal to the same constant, 
.  Taking the right hand side we have 

1-2 

(1.6) 

This  is our  beloved Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE). The TISE  is an  eigenvalue 
the  eigenstates  and  E  is  the  eigenvalue.  Here  we  note 

equation,  for  which 

are 

that 

,  so 

is  the  operator  corresponding  to  E  and  drawing  on  classical 

mechanics we  associate 

with  the expectation value of  the energy of  the system. Now  taking 

the left hand side of (1.5): 

So,  in  the  case  of  a  bound  potential  we  will  have  a  discrete  set  of  eigenfunctions 

(1.7)


(1.8)


with 

corresponding  energy  eigenvalues 

from  the  TISE,  and  there  are  a  set  of  corresponding 

solutions to the TDSE. 

(1.9)


where 

and 

is  a  (complex)  amplitude. The  n  eigenfunctions  form  an  orthonormal 

set,  so  that 

. Since the only  time-dependence is a phase factor,  the probability density 

(1.3) is independent of time for the eigenfunctions 

.  Therefore, the eigenstates 

do 

not change with time and are called stationary states.


However, more generally, a system may exist as a linear combination of eigenstates:


 r E  ˆHr()!r()!r()=E"ˆHr()!r()=E!r() !r()  ˆH=!ˆH!=E  ˆH  ˆH   i!1Tt()!T!t=E"!!t+iE!#$%&’(Tt()=0   Tt()=T0exp!iEt/!()=T0exp!i"t() !nr() En  !nr,t()=cn"nr()exp#i$nt()   !n=En/! cn  cnn!2=1  !nr,t() !r()where 

are  (complex)  amplitudes.  For  such  a  case,  the  probability  density  will  oscillate  with 

time.  As an example, consider two eigenstates 

1-3 

(1.10)


For this state the probability density oscillates in time as 

: 

(1.11)


(1.12) 

We  refer  to  this  as  a  coherence,  a  coherent  superposition  state.  If  we  include  momentum  (a 
wavevector) of particle associated with this state, we often describe this as a wavepacket. 

Time Evolution Operator 
More generally, we want  to understand  how  the  wavefunction  evolves with  time.  The TDSE  is 
linear  in  time.  Since  the  TDSE  is  deterministic,  we  will  define  an  operator  that  describes  the 
dynamics of the system: 

(1.13)


U  is  a  propagator  that  evolves  the  quantum  system  as  a  function  of  time.  For  the  time-
independent Hamiltonian: 

(1.14)


To solve this, we will define an operator 

, which  is a function of an operator. 

A function of an operator is defined through its expansion in a Taylor series: 

  !r,t()=cn!nn"r,t()=cne#i$nt%nr()n" cn  !r,t()=!1+!2=c1"1e#i$1t+c2"2e#i$2t  cos!2"!1()t  Pt()=!2=!1+!22=!12+!22+2Re!1*!2"#$%=c1&12+c2&22+c1*c2&1*&2e’i(2’(1t()+c2*c1&2*&1e+i(2’(1()t=!12+!22+2!1!2cos(2’(1()t  !t()=ˆUt,t0()!t0()   !!t"r,t()+iˆH!"r,t()=0   ˆT=exp!iˆHt/!()1-4 

(1.15)


Note:  about  functions  of  an  operator 
,  i.e., 
eigenvectors  of 
,  you  can  show  by  expanding  the  function 

:  Given  a  set  of  eigenvalues  and 

as a polynomial that 

You can also confirm from the expansion that 

, noting that 

is Hermetian and 

commutes with 

. Multiplying eq. (1.14) from the left by 

, we can write 

, 

(1.16) 

and integrating 

, we get 

So, we see that the time-propagator is 

and therefore

This form is useful when 

are characterized.  So now we can write our time-developing wave-

function as 

. 

(1.23)


As  written  in  eq.  (1.13),  we  see  that  the  time-propagator 

acts  to  the  right  (on 

kets)  to evolve the system  in  time.  The evolution of  the conjugate wavefunctions (bras)  is under 
the Hermetian conjugate of 
acting to the left: 

From its definition as an expansion and recognizing 

as Hermetian, you can see that

1.2. Time-evolution of a coupled two-level system (2LS) 
Let’s use this propagator using an  example that we will refer  to often.  It  is common  to reduce or 
map  quantum  problems  onto  a  2LS.  We  will  pick  the most  important  states  –the  ones  we  care 
about− and then discard the remaining degrees of freedom, or incorporate them as a collection or 

continuum of other degrees of freedom termed a “bath”, 

. 

We  will  discuss  the  time-evolution  of  a  2LS  with  a  time-independent  Hamiltonian. 
Consider  a 2LS with  two (unperturbed) states 
and 
with  energies 
and 
, which  are 

then coupled through an interaction 

.  We will ask: If we prepare the system in state 

, what 

is the time-dependent probability of observing it in 

? 

(1.26) 

The  states 

and 

are  in  the  uncoupled  or  noninteracting  basis,  and  when  we  talk  about 

spectroscopy these might refer to nuclear or electronic states in what I refer to as a “site” basis or 
“local”  basis.  The  coupling  V  mixes  these  states,  giving  two  eigenstates  of 
, 
and 
, 

with corresponding energy eigenvalues 

and 

. 

We  start  by  searching  for  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenfunctions  of  the  Hamiltonian.  Since 

the Hamiltonian is Hermetian, 

, we write 

(1.27)


  ˆH=ˆH0+ˆHbath !a !b !a !b Vab !a !b  ˆH=!a"a!a+!b"b!b+!aVab!b+!bVba!a="aVabVba"b#$%&’( !a !b  ˆH!+!"!+!"  Hij=Hji*()  Vab=Vba*=Ve!i"Now we define variables for the mean energy and energy splitting between the uncoupled states 

1-7


(1.28)


Then we obtain the eigenvalues of the coupled system by solving the secular equation 

, 

giving 

(1.29) 

(1.30) 

(1.31) 

(1.32) 

Because  the  expressions get messy, we don’t  use  this expression  to  find  the  eigenvectors  for  the 

coupled system, 

.  Rather, we use a substitution where we define: 

with 0 ≤ θ≤ π/2.  Now, 

and we can express the eigenvalues as 

(1.33) 

. 

(1.34)


We 

want  to  find  the  eigenstates  of  the  Hamiltonian, 

from 

e.g. 

.  This gives 

(1.35) 

where 

(1.36)


  !±=E±"sec2#!±  ˆH!±="±!± !+=ca!a+cb!b  ˆH=!aVe"i#Ve+i#!b$%&’()  E=!a+!b2  !="a#"b2  detH!"I()=0  !±=E±"2+V2!±  tan2!=V"  ˆH=EI+!1tan2"e#i$tan2"e+i$#1%&’()*  !+=cos"e#i$/2!a+sin"ei$/2!b!#=#sin"e#i$/2!a+cos"ei$/2!bNote that this basis is orthonormal (complete and orthogonal): 

. 

1-8 

Now, let’s examine the expressions for the eigenstates in two limits: 

(a) Weak coupling (V/Δ  << 1).  Here θ≈ 0, and 

corresponds to 

weakly perturbed 

by  the 

interaction. 

corresponds  to 

.  In  another  way,  as 

,  we 

find 

and 

. 

(b) Strong  coupling  (V/Δ  >>  1). 
In  this  limit  θ  =  π/4,  and  the  a/b  basis  states  are 
indistinguishable.  The eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations: 

(1.37)


Note  from  eq.  (1.36)  that  the  sign of V dictates whether 

or 

corresponds  to  the 

symmetric  or  antisymmetric  combination.  For  negative  V  >>  Δ, θ  =  −π/4,  and  the 
correspondence changes. 

We can schematically represent the energies of these states with the following diagram.  Here we 
available given a fixed value of the coupling V and a varying splitting Δ. 
explore the range of 

 !+!++!"!"=1!+ !a Vab!" !b !"0 !+"!a !"#!b  !±=12!b±!a()!+!"!±1-9 

This diagram  illustrates an  avoided  crossing  effect.  The  strong  coupling  limit  is equivalent  to  a 
degeneracy  point  (Δ~0)  between  the  states 
and 
.  The  eigenstates  completely  mix  the 

unperturbed  states,  yet  remain  split  by  the  strength of  interaction 2V.  Such  an  avoided  crossing 
is  observed  where  two  weakly  interacting  potential  energy  surfaces  cross  with  one  another  at  a 
particular nuclear displacement. 

The time-evolution of this system is given by our time-evolution operator. 

(1.38)


where 

.  Since 

and 

are  not  the  eigenstates,  preparing  the  system  in  state 

will lead to time-evolution!  Let’s prepare the system so that it is initially in

What is the probability that it is found in state 

at time  ?
