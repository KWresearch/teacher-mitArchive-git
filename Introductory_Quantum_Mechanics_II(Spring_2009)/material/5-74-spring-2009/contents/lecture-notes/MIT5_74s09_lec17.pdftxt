11.6. TWO-DIMENSIONAL CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY 
Our  examination  of  pump-probe  experiments  indicates  that  the  third-order  response  reports  on 
the  correlation  between  different  spectral  features.  Let’s  look  at  this  in  more  detail  using  a 
system  with  two  excited  states  as  an  example,  for  which  the  absorption  spectrum  shows  two 
spectral features at ωba  and ωca . 

Imagine  a  double  resonance  (pump-probe)  experiment  in  which  we  choose  a  tunable  excitation 
frequency ωpump  ,  and  for  each  pump  frequency we measure  changes  in  the  absorption  spectrum 
as a function of ωprobe  .  Generally speaking, we expect resonant excitation  to  induce a change of 
absorbance. 
The  question  is:  what  do  we  observe  if  we  pump  at  ωba   and  probe  at  ωca ?   If  nothing 
happens,  then we  can  conclude  that microscopically,  there  is no  interaction between  the degrees 
of  freedom  that  give  rise  to  the  ba  and  ca  transitions.  However,  a  change  of  absorbance  at ωca
indicates  that  in  some  manner  the  excitation  of  ωba   is  correlated  with  ωca .  Microscopically, 
there  is  a  coupling  or  chemical  conversion  that  allows  deposited  energy  to  flow  between  the 
coordinates.  Alternatively,  we  can  say  that  the  observed  transitions  occur  between  eigenstates 
whose  character  and  energy  encode  molecular  interactions  between  the  coupled  degrees  of 
freedom (here β and χ):

p. 11-55 

Now  imagine  that  you  perform  this  double  resonance  experiment  measuring  the  change 
in  absorption  for  all  possible  values  of  ωpump  and  ωprobe  ,  and  plot  these  as  a  two-dimensional 
contour plot:1 

This  is  a  two-dimensional  spectrum  that  reports  on  the  correlation  of  spectral  features  observed 
in the absorption spectrum.  Diagonal peaks reflect the case where the same resonance is pumped 
and  probed.  Cross  peaks  indicate  a  cross-correlation  that  arises  from  pumping  one  feature  and 
observing  a  change  in  the  other.  The  principles  of  correlation  spectroscopy  in  this  form  were 
initially developed  in  the  area of magnetic  resonance, but  are  finding  increasing use  in  the  areas 
of optical and infrared spectroscopy. 
Double  resonance  analogies  such  as  these  illustrate  the  power  of  a  two-dimensional 
spectrum  to  visualize  the  molecular  interactions  in  a  complex  system  with  many  degrees  of 
freedom.    Similarly,  we  can  see  how  a  2D  spectrum  can  separate  components  of  a  mixture 
through the presence or absence of cross peaks.

Also,  it  becomes  clear  how  an  inhomogeneous  lineshape  can  be  decomposed  into  the 
distribution  of  configurations,  and  the  underlying  dynamics  within  the  ensemble.  Take  an 
,  which  is  composed  of  a 
inhomogeneous  lineshape  with  width  Δ  and  mean  frequency  ωab 
distribution of homogeneous  transitions of width Γ. We will now  subject  the  system  to  the  same 
narrow  band  excitation  followed  by  probing  the  differential  absorption  ΔA  at  all  probe 
frequencies. 

Here we  observe  that  the  contours of  a  two-dimensional  lineshape  report on  the  inhomogeneous 
broadening.  We  observe  that  the  lineshape  is  elongated  along  the  diagonal  axis  (ω1=ω3).  The 
diagonal  linewidth  is  related  to  the  inhomogeneous  width  Δ   whereas  the  antidiagonal  width 
/ 2⎤⎦  is determined by the homogeneous linewidth  Γ .

2D Spectroscopy from Third Order Response 
These examples  indicate  that narrow band pump-probe experiments can be used  to construct 2D 
spectra,  so  in  fact  the  third-order  nonlinear  response  should  describe  2D  spectra.  To  describe 
these  spectra, we  can  think  of  the  excitation  as  a  third-order  process  arising  from  a  sequence  of 
interactions  with  the  system  eigenstates.  For  instance,  taking  our  initial  example  with  three 
levels, one of the contributing factors is of the form R2:

system  at  ωba   and  observing  the  system  at  ωca   (after  waiting  a  time τ2  ).  In  particular,  this

In  practice,  the  use  of  Fourier  transforms 
requires  a  phase-sensitive measure  of  the  radiated 
signal  field,  rather  than  the  intensity measured  by 
photodetectors.  This  can  be  obtained  by  beating 
the  signal  against  a  reference  pulse  (or  local 
oscillator)  on  a  photodetector.  If  we  measure  the

Characterizing Couplings in 2D Spectra2 
One  of  the  unique  characteristics  of  2D  spectroscopy  is  the  ability  to  characterize  molecular 
couplings.  This  allows  one  to  understand  microscopic  relationships  between  different  objects, 
and  with  knowledge  of  the  interaction  mechanism,  determine  the  structure  or  reveal  the 
dynamics of the system. To understand how 2D spectra report on molecular interactions, we will 
discuss  the  spectroscopy  using  a  model  for  two  coupled  electronic  or  vibrational  degrees  of 
freedom. Since  the 2D  spectrum  reports on  the eigenstates of  the coupled  system, understanding 
the  coupling  between microscopic  states  requires  a model  for  the  eigenstates  in  the  basis  of  the 
interacting  coordinates  of  interest.  Traditional  linear  spectroscopy  does  not  provide  enough 
constraints  to uniquely determine  these variables, but 2D spectroscopy provides  this  information 
through  a  characterization  of  two-quantum  eigenstates.  Since  it  takes  less  energy  to  excite  one 
coordinate if a coupled coordinate 
already  has  energy 
in 
it,  a 
characterization  of  the  energy  of 
the  combination  mode  with  one 
quantum  of  excitation  in  each 
coordinate  provides  a  route  to 
obtaining  the  coupling. 
This 
principle  lies  behind  the  use  of 
overtone  and  combination  band 
molecular 
to 
spectroscopy 
unravel anharmonic couplings.  
The  language  for  the  different  variables  for  the  Hamiltonian  of  two  coupled  coordinates 
varies  considerably  by  discipline.  A  variety  of  terms  that  are  used  are  summarized  below.  We 
will use the underlined terms.

The  model  for  two  coupled  coordinates  can  take  many  forms.  We  will  pay  particular

The  bi-linear  interaction  is  the  simplest  form  by  which  the  energy  of  one  state  depends  on  the

local  states.  Higher  order  expansion  terms  are  used  in  another  common  form,  the  cubic

EXAMPLE 
So,  how  do  these  variables  present  themselves  in  2D  spectra?   Here  it  is  helpful  to  use  a 
For  the 
specific  example:  the  strongly  coupled  carbonyl  vibrations  of  Rh(CO)2(acac)  or  RDC.   
purpose of 2D spectroscopy with infrared fields resonant with the carbonyl 
transitions,  there  are  six  quantum  states  (counting  the  ground  state)  that 
must  be  considered.  Coupling  between  the  two  degenerate  CO  stretches 
leads to symmetric and anti-symmetric one-quantum eigenstates, which are 
more  commonly  referred  to  by  their  normal  mode  designations:  the 
symmetric  and  asymmetric  stretching  vibrations.  For  n=2  coupled 
vibrations,  there are n(n−1)/2 = 3  two-quantum eigenstates.    In  the normal 
mode  designation,  these  are  the  first  overtones  of  the  symmetric  and 
asymmetric  modes  and  the  combination  band.  This  leads  to  a  six  level 
system  for  the  system  eigenstates,  which  we  designate  by  the  number  of 
quanta  in  the  symmetric  and  asymmetric  stretch:  00  ,  s  = 10  ,  a  = 01  ,  2s  = 20

To  discuss  these  peaks  we  examine  how  they  appear  in  the  experimental  Fourier 
transform  2D  IR  spectrum  of  RDC,  here  plotted  both  as  in  differential  absorption  mode  and 
absolute  value  mode.  We  note  that  there  are  eight  peaks,  labeled  according  to  the  terms  i  eq. 
(5.17)  from  which  they  arise.  Each  peak  specifies  a  sequence  of  interactions  with  the  system 
eigenstates,  with  excitation  at  a  particular  ω1  and  detection  at  given  ω3.  Notice  that  in  the 
excitation  dimension  ω1  all  of  the  peaks  lie  on  one  of  the  fundamental  frequencies.  Along  the 
detection axis ω3 resonances are seen at all six one-quantum transitions present in our system. 
More  precisely,  there  are  four  features:  two  diagonal  and  two  cross  peaks  each  of which 
are  split  into  a  pair.  The  positive  diagonal  and  cross  peak  features  represent  evolution  on  the

Δ as  gives the off-diagonal anharmonicity.   
Notice  for  each  split  pair  of  peaks,  that  in  the  limit  that  the  anharmonicity  vanishes,  the 
two  peaks  in  each  feature  would  overlap.  Given  that  they  have  opposite  sign,  the  peaks would 
destructively  interfere and vanish  for a harmonic system.   This  is a manifestation of  the rule  that 
a  nonlinear  response  vanishes  for  a  harmonic  system.    So,  in  fact,  a  2D  spectrum  will  have 
signatures  of  whatever  types  of  vibrational  interactions  lead  to  imperfect  interference  between 
these  two  contributions.  Nonlinearity  of  the  transition  dipole  moment  will  lead  to  imperfect 
cancellation  of  the  peaks  at  the  amplitude  level,  and  nonlinear  coupling with  a  bath will  lead  to 
different lineshapes for the two features. 
With an assignment of  the peaks  in  the spectrum, one has mapped out  the energies of  the 
one-  and  two-quantum  system  eigenstates.    These  eigenvalues  act  to  constrain  any  model  that 
will  be  used  to  interpret  the  system.  One  can  now  evaluate  how  models  for  the  coupled 
vibrations  match  the  data.    For  instance,  when  fitting  the  RDC  spectrum  to  the  Hamiltonian  in 
eq.  (5.4)  for 
two  coupled  anharmonic 
local  modes  with  a  potential  of 
the  form 
V q(
) = 1  k q  2  + 1  g q  3  ,  we  obtain  hωi  = hωj  =  2074  cm-1,  J  =  35  cm-1,   and  g  = g  =  172

cm-1.  Alternatively,  we  can  describe  the  spectrum  through  eq.  (5.7)  as  symmetric  and 
asymmetric  normal  modes  with  diagonal  and  off-diagonal  anharmonicity.    This  leads  to 
hω10  = 2038  cm-1,  hω10  = 2108  cm-1,  g aaa  = g sss  =  32  cm-1,  and  g ssa  = g aas  =  22  cm-1.  Provided

that one knows the origin of the coupling and its spatial or angular dependence, one can use these 
parameters to obtain a structure.

Two-dimensional spectroscopy to characterize spectral diffusion 
A  more  intuitive,  albeit  difficult,  approach  to  characterizing  spectral  diffusion  is  with  a  two-
dimensional correlation  technique.   Returning  to our example of a double resonance experiment, 
let’s  describe  the  response  from  an  inhomogeneous  lineshape with width Δ  and mean  frequency 
, which is composed of a distribution of homogeneous transitions of width Γ. We will now 

ωab 
subject  the  system  to  excitation  by  a  narrow  band  pump  field,  and  probe  the  differential 
absorption ΔA at all probe frequencies.  We then repeat this for all pump frequencies:

In  constructing  a  two-dimensional  representation  of  this  correlation  spectrum,  we  observe  that 
the  observed  lineshape  is  elongated  along  the  diagonal  axis  (ω1=ω3).  The  diagonal  linewidth  is 
related  to  the  inhomogeneous  width  Δ   whereas  the  antidiagonal  width  ⎡
/ 2⎤⎦ is

determined by the homogeneous linewidth  Γ . 
For the system exhibiting spectral diffusion, we recognize that we can introduce a waiting 
time  τ2    between  excitation  and  detection,  which  provides  a  controlled  period  over  which  the 

Andrei Tokmakoff, MIT Department of Chemistry, 6/15/2009

system  can  evolve.    One  can  see  that  when τ2    varies  from  much  less  to  much  greater  than  the 
correlation time, τc , that the lineshape will gradually become symmetric.   

This  reflects  the  fact  that at  long  times  the system excited at any one  frequency can be observed 
at  any  other  with  equilibrium  probability.    That  is,  the  correlation  between  excitation  and 
detection frequencies vanishes.

To characterize the energy gap correlation function, we choose a metric 
that  describes  the  change  as  a  function  of  τ2  .  For  instance,  the 
ellipticity

is directly proportional to  C  τ  .
The photon echo experiment  is  the  time domain version of  this double-resonance or hole 
burning  experiment.    If we  examine  R2   in  the  inhomogeneous  and  homogeneous  limits, we  can 
plot the polarization envelope as a function of τ1  and τ3 . 

Andrei Tokmakoff, MIT Department of Chemistry, 6/15/2009 

p. 11-49 

In the inhomogeneous limit, an echo ridge decaying as  e− Γt  extends along τ1  =τ3  .  It decays with 
the  inhomogeneous  distribution  in  the  perpendicular  direction.    In  the  homogeneous  limit,  the 
response  is  symmetric  in  the  two  time  variables.   Fourier  transformation  allows  these  envelopes 
to  be  expressed  as  the  lineshapes  above.    Here  again  τ2    is  a  control  variable  to  allow  us  to 
eg  ( ) 
characterize  C  τ  through the change in echo profile or lineshape.   

1  Here  we  use  the  right-hand  rule  convention  for  the  frequency  axes,  in  which  the  pump  or 
excitation  frequency  is  on  the  horizontal  axis  and  the  probe  or  detection  frequency  is  on  the 
vertical  axis.  Different  conventions  are  being  used, which  does  lead  to  confusion.   We  note 
that  the  first  presentations  of  two-dimensional  spectra  in  the  case  of  2D  Raman  and  2D  IR 
spectra used a RHR convention, whereas  the first 2D NMR and 2D electronic measurements 
used the LHR convention.
