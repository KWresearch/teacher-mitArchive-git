11.1 VIBRATIONAL RELAXATION* 

Here  we  want  to  address  how  a  quantum  mechanical  vibration  undergoes  irreversible  energy 
dissipation  as  a  result  of  interactions  with  other  intra-  and  intermolecular  degrees  of  freedom. 
Why  is  this  process  important?  It  is  the  fundamental  process  by  which  non-equilibrium  states 
thermalize.  As  chemists,  this  plays  a  particularly  important  role  in  chemical  reactions,  where 
efficient  vibrational  relaxation  of  an  activated  species  is 
important  to  stabilizing  the  product  and  not  allowing  it  to  re-
cross  to  the  reactant  well.  We  will  be  looking  specifically  at 
vibrational  couplings  and  relaxation,  but  the  principles  are  the 
same  for  spin-lattice  relaxation  and  electronic  population 
relaxation through electron-phonon coupling. 
For  an  isolated  molecule  with  few  vibrational  coordinates,  an  excited  vibrational  state 
must relax by interacting with the remaining internal vibrations or the rotational and translational 
degrees  of  freedom.  If  a  lot  of  energy  must  be  dissipated,  radiative  relaxation  may  be  more 
likely.  In  the  condensed  phase,  relaxation  is  usually  mediated  by  the  interactions  with  the 
environment,  for  instance,  the  solvent  or  lattice.  The  solvent  or  lattice  forms  a  continuum  of 
intermolecular  motions  that  can  absorb  the  energy  of  the  vibrational  relaxation.  Quantum 
mechanically  this  means  that  vibrational  relaxation  (the  annihilation  of  a  vibrational  quantum) 
leads  to  excitation  of  solvent  or  lattice  motion  (creation  of  an  intermolecular  vibration  that 
increases the occupation of higher lying states). 
For  polyatomic molecules  it  is  common  to  think 
of  energy  relaxation  from  high  lying  vibrational  states 
( kT  << hω0 )  in  terms  of  cascaded  redistribution  of 
energy  through  coupled  modes  of  the  molecule  and  its 
surroundings  leading  finally  to  thermal  equilibrium. 
We  seek  ways  of  describing 
these  highly  non-
equilibrium relaxation processes in quantum systems.

Classically  vibrational  relaxation  reflects  the  surroundings  exerting  a  friction  on  the 
vibrational  coordinate  which  damps  its  amplitude  and  heats  the  sample.  We  have  seen  that  a 
Langevin equation for an oscillator experiencing a fluctuating force f(t) describes such a process:

This equation ascribes a phenomenological damping rate γto the vibrational relaxation; however, 
we also know  in  the  long  time  limit,  the  system must  thermalize and  the dissipation of energy  is 
related  to  the  fluctuations  of  the  environment  through  the  classical  fluctuation-dissipation 
relationship:

We  would  also  like  to  understand  the  correspondence  between  these  classical  pictures  and 
quantum relaxation.

Let’s  treat  the problem of a vibrational system  H S  that  relaxes  through weak coupling V 
to  a  continuum  of  bath  states  H B using  perturbation  theory.  The  eigenstates  of  H S are  a   and 
those  of  H B are  α  .  Although  our  earlier  perturbative  treatment  didn’t  satisfy  energy 
conservation, here we can take care of it by explicitly treating the bath states.

Vibration coupled to a harmonic bath 
To  evaluate  these  expressions,  let’s  begin  by  consider  the  specific  case  of  a  system  vibration 
coupled  to  a  harmonic  bath,  which  we  will  describe  by  a  spectral  density.  Imagine  that  we 
prepare  the  system  in  an  excited  vibrational  state  in  v = 1  and  we  want  to  describe  relaxation

Here ξ is a coupling constant that describes the strength of the interaction

suggests that the system vibration is a local mode interacting with a set of 
normal vibrations of  the bath.    In principle,  this  form of  the coupling can 
be  diagonalized  to  obtain  a  complete  set  of  normal  modes  in  which  the 
system vibration is mixed slightly into each of the bath modes.

This  expression  describes  two  relaxation  processes  which  depend  on  temperature.    The  first  is 
allowed at T = 0 K and  is obeys  −ωba  =ωα . This  implies  that  Ea  > Eb  , and  that a  loss of energy 
in  the  system  is  balanced  by  an  equal  rises  in  energy  of  the  bath.    The  second  term  is  only 
allowed  for  elevated  temperatures.  It  describes  relaxation  of  the  system  by  transfer  to  a  higher 
energy state  Eb  > Ea  , with a concerted decrease of the energy of the bath. Naturally, this process 
vanishes if there is no thermal energy in the bath.2 
To  more  accurately  model  the  relaxation  due  to  a  continuum  of  modes,  we  can  replace 
the explicit sum over bath states with an integral over a density of bath states W

We  can  also  define  a  spectral  density,  which  is  the  vibrational  coupling-weighted  density  of 
states:

We  see  that  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  fluctuating  coupling  correlation  function,  is  equivalent 
to  the  coupling-weighted  density  of  states,  which  we  evaluate  atωba   or  −ωba  depending  on 
whether we  are  looking  at  upward  or  downward  transitions.    This  is  a  full  quantum  expression, 
and  obeys  detailed  balance  between  the  upward  and  downward  rates  of  transition  between  two 
states:

From  our  description  of  the  two  level  system  in  a  harmonic  bath,  we  see  that  high 
frequency relaxation ( kT  << hω0 ) only proceeds with energy from  the system going  into a mode 
of the bath at the same frequency, but at lower frequencies ( kT  ≈ hω0  ) that energy can flow both 
into  the  bath  and  from  the  bath  back  into  the  system.   When  the  vibration  has  energies  that  are 
thermally  populated  in  the  bath, we  return  to  the  classical  picture  of  a  vibration  in  a  fluctuating 
environment that can dissipate energy from the vibration as well as giving kicks that increase the 
energy  of  the  vibration.  Note  that  in  a  cascaded  relaxation  scheme,  as  one  approaches  kT,  the 
fraction  of  transitions  that  increase  the  system  energy  increase.  Also,  note  that  the  bi-linear 
coupling  in eq. (11.20) and used  in our  treatment of quantum fluctuations can be associated with 
fluctuations  of  the  bath  that  induce  changes  in  energy  (relaxation)  and  shifts  of  frequency 
(dephasing).

Multiquantum relaxation of polyatomic molecules3 
Vibrational  relaxation  of  polyatomic  molecules  in  solids  or  in  solution  involves  anharmonic 
coupling  of  energy  between  internal  vibrations  of  the  molecule,  also  called  IVR  (internal 
vibrational  energy  redistribution). Mechanical  interactions  between multiple modes  of  vibration 
of the molecule act to rapidly scramble energy deposited into one vibrational coordinate and lead 
to cascaded energy flow toward equilibrium. 
For  this  problem  the  bilinear  coupling  above  doesn’t  capture  the  proper  relaxation 
process.  Instead we  can  express  the molecular  potential  energy  in  terms  of well  defined  normal 
modes  of  vibration  for  the  system  and  the  bath,  and  these  interact  weakly  through  small 
anharmonic  terms  in  the  potential.  Then  we  can  extend  the  perturbative  approach  above  to 
include  the effect of multiple accepting vibrations of  the  system or bath. For a  set of  system and 
bath  coordinates,  the  potential  energy  for  the  system  and  system-bath  interaction  can  be 
expanded as

Here,  the  system-bath  interaction  potential  describes  the  case  for  a  cubic  anharmonic  coupling

interactions involving four or more quanta.  
Working  specifically  with  the  cubic  example,  we  can  use  the  harmonic  bath  model  to 
calculate  the  rate  of  energy  relaxation.  This  picture  is  applicable  if  a  vibrational  mode  of 
frequency  Ω  relaxes  by  transferring  its  energy  to  another  vibration  nearby  in  energy  ( ωα ),  and 
the  energy  difference  ωβ   being  accounted  for  by  a  continuum  of  intermolecular  motions.    For

two  possible  relaxation  pathways,  the  first  in  which  annihilation  of  a  quantum  of  Ω leads  to  a 
creation  of  one  quantum  each  of  ωαand  ωβ .  The  second  term  describes  the  dissipation  of 
energy  by  coupling  to  a  higher  energy 
vibration,  with  the  excess  energy  being 
absorbed  from  the  bath.   Annihilation  of 
a quantum of Ω leads to a creation of one 
quantum  of  ωαand  the  annihilation  of 
one  quantum  of ωβ .  Naturally  this  latter 
term  is  only  allowed  when  there  is 
adequate  thermal  energy  present  in  the 
bath. 

Rate calculations using classical vibrational relaxation 
In  general, we would  like  a  practical way  to  calculate  relaxation  rates,  and  calculating  quantum 
correlation  functions  isn’t  practical.  How  do  we  use  classical  calculations  for  the  bath,  for 
instance drawing on a classical molecular dynamics simulation?  Is there a way to get a quantum 
mechanical rate? 
The  first  problem  is  that  the  quantum  correlation  function  is  complex  C t( ) = C  ( −t )
*
ab 
ab 
and  the  classical  correlation  function  is  real  and  even  C t( ) = C  ( −t ) .  In  order  to  connect
Cl 
Cl 
these  two  correlation  functions,  one  can  derive  a  quantum  correction  factor  that  allows  one  to 
predict  the  quantum  correlation  function  on  the  basis  of  the  classical  one.  This  is  based  on  the 
assumption  that  at  high  temperature  it  should  be  possible  to  substitute  the  classical  correlation 
function with the real part of the quantum correlation function

Now we will  assume  that one  can  replace  a  classical  calculation of  the  correlation  function here 
as  in  eq.  (11.33).    The  leading  term  out  front  can  be  considered  a  “quantum  correction  factor” 
that accounts for the detailed balance of rates encoded in the quantum spectral density. 
In  practice  such  a  calculation might  be  done with molecular  dynamics  simulations. Here 
one  has  an  explicit  characterization  of  the  intermolecular  forces  that  would  act  to  damp  the 
excited  vibrational  mode.  One  can  calculate  the  system-bath  interactions  by  expanding  the 
vibrational potential of the system in the bath coordinates

Here  V α  represents the potential of an interaction of one solvent coordinate acting on the excited

system  Q   and  bath α  coordinates,  and  we  can  use  variation  in  this  parameter  to  calculate  the 
correlation  function  for  the  fluctuating  interaction  potential.  Note  that  F   is  the  force  that 
molecules  exert on Q!  Thus  the  relevant  classical  correlation  function  for vibrational  relaxation

1	 Note that we are using an equilibrium property, the coupling correlation function, to describe a 
non-equilibrium  process,  the  relaxation  of  an  excited  state.  Underlying  the  validity  of  the 
expressions  are  the  principles  of  linear  response.  In  practice  this  also  implies  a  time-scale 
separation between the equilibration of the bath and the relaxation of the system state: The bath 
correlation function should work fine if it has rapidly equilibrated, even though the system may 
not have.  An instance where this would work well is electronic spectroscopy, where relaxation 
and thermalization in the excited state occurs on picosecond time scales, whereas the electronic 
population relaxation is on nanosecond time scales. 

2	 There  is  an  exact  analogy  between  this  problem  and  the  interaction  of matter  with  a  quantum 
radiation  field.  The  interaction  potential  is  instead  a  quantum  vector  potential  and  the  bath  is 
the photon  field of different  electromagnetic modes. Equation  (11.25) describes has  two  terms 
that  describe  emission  and  absorption  processes.  The  leading  term  describes  the  possibility  of 
spontaneous  emission, where  a material  system  can  relax  in  the  absence  of  light  by  emitting  a 
photon at the same frequency.
