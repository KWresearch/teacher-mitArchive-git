INTERACTION OF LIGHT WITH MATTER 

One  of  the  most  important  topics  in  time-dependent  quantum  mechanics  for  chemists  is  the 
description  of  spectroscopy,  which  refers  to  the  study  of  matter  through  its  interaction  with  light 
fields (electromagnetic radiation). Classically, light-matter interactions are a result of an oscillating 
electromagnetic  field  resonantly  interacting  with  charged  particles.    Quantum  mechanically,  light 
fields will act to couple quantum states of the matter, as we have discussed earlier.   

Like  every other problem, our  starting point  is  to derive  a Hamiltonian  for  the  light-matter 
interaction, which in the most general sense would be of the form 

H H   H
=  M + 

H
L + 

LM . 

(4.1) 

The  Hamiltonian  for  the  matter  H M is  generally  (although  not  necessarily)  time  independent, 
whereas  the electromagnetic  field  H L   and  its  interaction with  the matter  H LM are  time-dependent. 
A  quantum  mechanical  treatment  of  the  light  would  describe  the  light  in  terms  of  photons  for 
different modes of electromagnetic radiation, which we will describe later.   

We will start with a common semiclassical  treatment of  the problem. For  this approach we 
treat  the matter quantum mechanically, and  treat  the  field classically. For  the  field we assume  that 
the light only presents a time-dependent interaction potential that acts on the matter, but the matter 
doesn’t influence the light.  (Quantum mechanical energy conservation says that we expect that the 
change  in  the  matter  to  raise  the  quantum  state  of  the  system  and  annihilate  a  photon  from  the 
field.  We won’t deal with this right now).  We are just interested in the effect that the light has on 
the matter.  In  that case, we can  really  ignore H L , and we have a Hamiltonian  that can be solved  in 
the interaction picture representation:

Here,  we’ll  derive  the  Hamiltonian  for  the  light-matter  interaction,  the  Electric  Dipole 
Hamiltonian.  It  is  obtained  by  starting  with  the  force  experienced  by  a  charged  particle  in  an 
electromagnetic  field,  developing  a  classical  Hamiltonian  for  this  system,  and  then  substituting 
quantum operators for the matter:

(4.3) 

In order  to get  the classical Hamiltonian, we need  to work  through  two  steps:  (1) We need 
to  describe  electromagnetic  fields,  specifically  in  terms  of  a  vector  potential,  and  (2)  we  need  to 
describe how the electromagnetic field interacts with charged particles. 

Brief summary of electrodynamics 

Let’s  summarize  the  description  of  electromagnetic  fields  that  we  will  use.    A  derivation  of  the 
plane  wave  solutions  to  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  and  vector  potential  is  described  in  the 
appendix. Also, it is helpful to review this material in Jackson1 or Cohen-Tannoudji, et al.2 
>	  Maxwell’s Equations describe electric and magnetic fields ( 
E B )

.
>  	 To  construct  a Hamiltonian, we must  describe  the  time-dependent  interaction  potential  (rather 
than a field). 
(  ,  )  and
>  	 To  construct  the potential  representation of  E   and B , you need a vector potential 
A r t
a  scalar potentialϕ( r t,  ) .  For electrostatics we normally  think of  the  field being  related  to  the 
electrostatic  potential  through E = −∇ϕ ,  but  for  a  field  that  varies  in  time  and  in  space,  the 

>  	

electrodynamic potential must be expressed in terms of both  A  andϕ . 
In general an electromagnetic wave written in terms of the electric and magnetic fields requires 
6  variables  (the  x,y,  and  z  components  of  E  and  B).  This  is  an  overdetermined  problem; 
Maxwell’s  equations  constrain  these.  The  potential  representation  has  four  variables 
,A A  andϕ ),  but  these  are  still  not  uniquely  determined.  We  choose  a  constraint  –  a 
( A  ,
x

z 
representation or guage – that allows us to uniquely describe the wave.  Choosing a gauge such 
that ϕ= 0  (Coulomb gauge) leads to a plane-wave description of  E  and B :

Classical Hamiltonian for radiation field interacting with charged particle 

Now,  let’s  find  a  classical  Hamiltonian  that  describes  charged  particles  in  a  field  in  terms  of  the 
vector potential.  Start with Lorentz force3 on a particle with charge q: 
= ( + × ) 
F q E v B .
Here  v   is  the  velocity  of  the  particle. Writing  this  for  one  direction  (x)  in  terms  of  the  Cartesian 
components of E ,  v and B , we have: 

(4.13)

v⎝ ∂ x ⎠
Using  the  relationships  that describe  E and  B   in  terms of  A andϕ,  inserting  into eq.  (4.14), and 
working it into the form of eq. (4.15), we can show that:

(4.15)

 

U q

This is derived in CTDL,4 and you can confirm by replacing it into eq. (4.15).  
Now we can write a Lagrangian in terms of the kinetic and potential energy of the particle

This  is  the  classical  Hamiltonian  for  a  particle  in  an  electromagnetic  field.    In  the  Coulomb

Generally  the  last  term  is  considered  small  compared  to  the  cross  term.  This  term  should  be 
considered for extremely high field strength, which is nonperturbative and significantly distorts the 
potential  binding  molecules  together.  One  can  estimate  that  this  would  start  to  play  a  role  at 
intensity  levels  >1015  W/cm2,  which  may  be  observed  for  very  high  energy  and  tightly  focused 
pulsed  femtosecond  lasers.    So,  for  weak  fields  we  have  an  expression  that  maps  directly  onto 
solutions we can formulate in the interaction picture:

Quantum mechanical Electric Dipole Hamiltonian 

Now we are  in a position  to substitute  the quantum mechanical momentum  for  the classical.   Here 
the vector potential remains classical, and only modulates the interaction strength.

operating on a wavefunction ∇ ⋅ A ψ  = ∇	 A  ψ  + A ⋅ (∇ ψ ) . The  first  term  is zero  since we are

Under  most  circumstances,  we  can  neglect  the  wavevector  dependence  of  the  interaction 
potential. 
If 
the  wavelength  of 
the

larger 
than 
the  molecular

k  → 0 ) , then e  ⋅ ≈1 .  This is known as the electric dipole approximation.

We  do  retain  the  spatial  dependence  for  certain  types  of  light-matter  interactions.    In  that 
case we define  r0  as the center of mass of a molecule and expand

For interactions, with UV, visible, and infrared (but not X-ray) radiation,  k r −

<<1 , and setting 
i
r0  = 0   means  that eik  r ⋅ → 1 .  We  retain  the  second  term  for  quadrupole  transitions:  charge 
distribution interacting with gradient of electric field and magnetic dipole.

Transition dipole matrix elements 
We  are  seeking  to  use  this  Hamiltonian  to  evaluate  the  transition  rates  induced  by  V(t)  from  our 
first-order  perturbation  theory  expression.  For  a  perturbation  V t(  ) = V0  sinωt 
the  rate  of 
transitions induced by field is

Equation  (4.45)  is  an  expression  for  the  absorption  spectrum  since  the  rate  of  transitions

project  onto  the  dipole  moment.    This  allows  information  to  be  obtained  on  the  orientation  of 
molecules, and forms the basis of rotational transitions.

Let’s  combine  the  results  from  the  last  two  lectures,  and  describe  absorption  to  a  state  that  is 
coupled  to  a  continuum. What  happens  to  the  probability  of  absorption  if  the  excited  state  decays
