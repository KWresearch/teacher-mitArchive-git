10. NONLINEAR SPECTROSCOPY 
10.1. Introduction 
Spectroscopy comes from the Latin “spectron” for spirit or ghost and the Greek “σκοπιεν” for to 
see. These  roots  are  very  telling,  because  in molecular  spectroscopy  you  use  light  to  interrogate 
matter,  but  you  actually  never  see  the  molecules,  only  their  influence  on  the  light.    Different 
spectroscopies give you different perspectives. This indirect contact with the microscopic targets 
means  that  the  interpretation  of  spectroscopy  in  some  manner  requires  a  model,  whether  it  is 
stated  or  not.  Modeling  and  laboratory  practice  of  spectroscopy  are  dependent  on  one  another, 
and  therefore  a  spectroscopy  is  only  as  useful  as  its  ability  to  distinguish  different models.   The 
observables  that  we  have  to  extract  microscopic  information  in  traditional  spectroscopy  are 
resonance  frequencies,  spectral  amplitudes,  and  lineshapes.  We  can  imagine  studying  these 
spectral  features  as  a  function  of  control  variables  for  the  light  field  (amplitude,  frequency, 
polarization,  phase,  etc.)  or  for  the  sample  (for  instance  a  systematic  variation  of  the  physical 
properties of the sample). 
In complex systems, those in which there are many interacting degrees of freedom and in 
which spectra become congested or featureless, the interpretation of traditional spectra is plagued 
by  a  number  of  ambiguities.    This  is  particularly  the  case  for  spectroscopy  of  disordered 
condensed  phases,  where  spectroscopy  is  the  primary  tool  for  describing  molecular  structure, 
interactions  and  relaxation,  kinetics  and  dynamics,  and  tremendous  challenges  exist  on 
understanding  the  variation  and  dynamics  of  molecular  structures.    This  is  the  reason  for  using 
nonlinear  spectroscopy,  in  which  multiple  light-matter  interactions  can  be  used  to  correlate 
different  spectral  features  and  dissect  complex  spectra.  We  can  resonantly  drive  one 
spectroscopic  feature  and  see  how  another  is  influenced,  or we  can  introduce  time  delays  to  see 
how properties change with time.   
Absorption  or  emission  spectroscopies  are  referred  to  as  linear  spectroscopy,  because 
they  involve  a  weak  light-matter  interaction  with  one  primary  incident  radiation  field,  and  are 
typically presented  through a single  frequency axis. The ambiguities  that arise when  interpreting 
linear spectroscopy can be illustrated through two examples: 

Andrei Tokmakoff, MIT Department of Chemistry, 4/16/2009

1) 	

Absorption spectrum with two peaks. 
Do these resonance arise from different, 
non-interacting  molecules,  or  are  these 
coupled  quantum  states  of  the  same 
cannot

correlations 
directly).  

2) 

	Broad  lineshapes. Can you distinguish whether  it  is a homogeneous  lineshape broadened 
by  fast  irreversible  relaxation  or  an  inhomogeneous  lineshape  arising  from  a  static 
distribution  of  different  frequencies?      (Linear  spectra  cannot  uniquely  interpret  line-
broadening mechanism, or decompose heterogeneous behavior in the sample). 

homogeneous	 

inhomogeneous 

In  the  end  effect  linear  spectroscopy  does  not  offer  systematic  ways  of  attacking  these  types  of 
problems. It also has little ability to interpret dynamics and relaxation. These issues take on more 
urgency  in  the  condensed  phase,  when  lineshapes  become  broad  and  spectra  are  congested. 

Andrei Tokmakoff, MIT Department of Chemistry, 4/16/2009 

p. 10-3 

Nonlinear spectroscopy provides a way of resolving these scenarios because it uses multiple light 
fields  with  independent  control  over  frequency  or  time-ordering  in  order  to  probe  correlations 
between  different  spectral  features.  For  instance,  the  above  examples  could  be  interpreted with 
the  use  of  a  double-resonance  experiment  that  reveals  how  excitation  at  one  frequency  ω1 
influences absorption at another frequency ω2. 

What is nonlinear spectroscopy? 
Linear  spectroscopy  commonly  refers  to  light-matter  interaction  with  one  primary  incident 
radiation  field which  is weak,  and  can  be  treated  as  a  linear  response  between  the  incident  light 
and  the  matter.    From  a  quantum  mechanical  view  of  the  light  field,  it  is  often  conceived  as  a 
“one  photon  in/one  photon  out” measurement.   Nonlinear  spectroscopy  is  used  to  refer  to  cases 
that  fall  outside  this  view,  including:  (1)  Watching  the  response  of  matter  subjected  to 
interactions with two or more independent incident fields, and (2) the case where linear response 
theory is inadequate for treating how the material behaves, as in the case of very intense incident 
radiation.  If  we  work  within  the  electric  dipole  Hamiltonian,  nonlinear  experiments  can  be 
expressed  in  terms  of  three  or  more  transition  matrix  elements.    The  response  of  the  matter  in

10.2.  COHERENT SPECTROSCOPY AND THE NONLINEAR POLARIZATION 
We  will  specifically  be  dealing  with 
the  description  of  coherent  nonlinear 
spectroscopy. 
If  you  cross 
three 
intense  light  fields  in  a  sample,  you 
can  observe  an  array  of  spots  behind 
the  sample, which may  be  the  same  or 
different  colors.  These  are  nonlinear 
signals  that  arise  when  one  or  more  input  fields  coherently  act  on  the  dipoles  of  the  sample  to 
generate  a  macroscopic  oscillating  polarization.    This  polarization  acts  as  a  source  to  radiate  a

signal  that we  detect  in  a well-defined  direction. This  class  includes  experiments  such  as  pump-
probes, transient gratings, photon echoes, and coherent Raman methods. However understanding 
these experiments allows one to rather quickly generalize to other techniques.

Spontaneous  and  coherent  signals  are  both  emitted  from  all  samples,  however,  the 
relative  amplitude  of  the  two  depend  on  the  time-scale  of  dephasing  within  the  sample.  For 
electronic  transitions  in  which  dephasing  is  typically  much  faster  than  the  radiative  lifetime, 
spontaneous  emission  is  the  dominant  emission  process.  For  the  case  of  vibrational  transitions

where non-radiative  relaxation  is  typically a picoseconds process and  radiative  relaxation  is a μs 
or longer process, spontaneous emission is not observed. 
The  description  of  coherent  nonlinear  spectroscopies  is  rooted  in  the  calculation  of  the 
polarization,  P .  The  polarization  is  a  macroscopic  collective  dipole  moment  per  unit  volume, 
and  for  a  molecular  system  is  expressed  as  a  sum  over  the  displacement  of  all  charges  for  all 
molecules being interrogated by the light

as dictated by the susceptibility of the sample.  The polarization acts as a source to radiate a new 
electromagnetic  field,  which  we  term  the  signal  Esig  .  (Remember  that  an  accelerated  charge 
radiates an electric field.) In the electric dipole approximation, the polarization is one term in the 
current and charge densities that you put into Maxwell’s equations.

These relationships enforce momentum and energy conservation for the problem. The oscillating 
polarization  radiates  a  coherent  signal  field,  Esig  ,  in  a  wave  vector  matched  direction  k sig  . 
Although  a  single  dipole  radiates  as  a  sin θ  field  distribution  relative  to  the  displacement  of  the 
charge,1  for  an  ensemble  of  dipoles  that  have  been  coherently  driven  by  external  fields,  P  is 
given  by  (10.6)  and  the  radiation  of  the  ensemble  only  constructively  adds  along  k sig  .  For  the

This  solution  comes  from  solving  (10.5)  for  a  thin  sample  of  length  l,  for  which  the  radiated 
signal  amplitude  grows  and  becomes  directional  as  it  propagates  through  the  sample.    The

Here  we  note  the  oscillating  polarization  is  proportional  to  the  signal  field,  although  there  is  a 
π/2 phase shift between the two, Esig ∝ i P , because in the sample the polarization is related to the 
gradient of the field.  Δk is the wave-vector mismatch between the wavevector of the polarization 
k s′ig  and the radiated field  k sig  , which we will discuss more later. 
For the purpose of our work, we obtain the polarization from the expectation value of the 
dipole operator

The  fields  only  act  to  drive  transitions  between  quantum  states  of  the  system.  We  take  the 
interaction with the fields to be sufficiently weak that we can treat the problem with perturbation 
theory.  Thus,  nth-order  perturbation  theory  will  be  used  to  describe  the  nonlinear  signal  derived 
from interacting with n electromagnetic fields.

Linear absorption spectroscopy 
Absorption  is  the  simplest example of a coherent spectroscopy.  In  the  semi-classical picture,  the 
polarization  induced by  the electromagnetic  field  radiates  a  signal  field  that  is out-of-phase with 
the transmitted light.  To describe this, all of the relevant information is in  R ( )t
 or χ(
)ω  . 
P t( ) = ∫ ∞  τ R ( ) 
(  −τ
) 
d  τ  E t  
0 
P (ω) = χ ω(  ) E (ω) 
Let’s  begin  with  a  frequency-domain  description  of  the  absorption  spectrum,  which  we 
previously  found was proportional  to  the  imaginary part of  the  susceptibility, χ′′ .  3  We consider 
one monochromatic  field  incident  on  the  sample  that  resonantly  drives  dipoles  in  the  sample  to 
create a polarization, which subsequently re-radiate a signal field (free induction decay). For one 
input 
field, 
the 
energy 
and  momentum 
conservation  conditions  dictate  that  ωin  =ωsig 
and  kin  = k sig  ,  that  is  a  signal  field  of  the  same 
frequency  propagates  in  the  direction  of  the 
transmitted excitation field. 
In  practice,  an  absorption  spectrum  is  measured  by  characterizing  the  frequency-
dependent  transmission  decrease  on  adding  the  sample  A = − log I out  I in  .  For  the  perturbative 
case,  let’s  take  the  change  of  intensity δI  = I in  − I out  to  be  small,  so  that  A ≈ δI   and  I in  ≈ I out  . 
Then we can write the measured intensity after the sample as

δI = 2χ′′ I in  . 
A  time-domain  approach  to  absorption  draws  on  eq.  (10.14)  and  should  recover  the 
relationships  to  the  dipole  autocorrelation  function  that  we  discussed  previously.  Equating 
( ) , we can calculate the polarization in the density matrix picture as

Also, as we would expect, when we use an impulsive driving potential to induce a free induction 
decay,  i.e., E t( −τ) = E0δ( t −τ) ,  the  polarization  is  directly  proportional  to  the  response 
function, which can be Fourier transformed to obtain the absorption lineshape. 
Nonlinear Polarization 
For  nonlinear  spectroscopy,  we  will  calculate  the  polarization  arising  from  interactions  with 
multiple fields. We will use a perturbative expansion of  P  in powers of the incoming fields   
P t ( ) = P ( 0 ) + P (1) + P ( 2 ) + P (3) + L  
(10.23) 
where  P ( n )  refers to the polarization arising from n incident light fields. So,  P ( 2 )  and higher are 
the nonlinear terms.  We calculate  P  from the density matrix

We see that in general the nonlinear response functions are sums of correlation functions, and the

by  whether  sequential  operators  act  on  the  bra  or  ket  side  of  ρ  when  enforcing  the  time-
ordering.  Since  the  bra  and  ket  sides  represent  conjugate  wavefunctions,  these  correlation 
functions  will  contain  coherences  with  differing  phase  relationships  during  subsequent  time-
intervals.

To see more specifically what a specific  term  in  these nested commutators refers  to,  let’s 
look at  R ( 2 )  and enforce the time-ordering:

(1)  dipole acts on ket of ρeq 
(2)  evolve under H0 during τ1. 
(3)  dipole acts on ket. 
(4)  Evolve during τ2. 
(5) Multiply by μ and take 
trace. 

KET/KET interaction 

At  each  point  of  interaction  with  the  external  potential,  the  dipole  operator  acted  on  ket  side  of 
ρ. Different  correlation  functions are distinguished by  the order  that  they act on bra or  ket. We 
only  count  the  interactions with  the  incident  fields,  and  the  convention  is  that  the  final  operator 
that we use prior to the trace acts on the ket side.  So the term Q1 is a ket/ket interaction. 
An alternate way of expressing this correlation function is in terms of the time-propagator 
ˆ
for  the  density matrix,  a  superoperator  defined  through:  G t( )ρab  = U 0  a  b U 0
†  .  	 Remembering 
the time-ordering, this allows Q1 to be written as

For  the  remaining  terms  we  note  that  the  bra  side  interaction  is  the  complex  conjugate  of  ket 

side, so of the four terms in eq. (10.29), we can identify only two independent terms: 

BRA/KET interaction

This  is  a  general  observation.  For  R ( n ) ,  you  really  only  need  to  calculate  2n−   correlation

So  what  is  the  difference  in  these  correlation  functions?    Once  there  is  more  than  one 
excitation  field,  and  more  than  one  time  period  during  which  coherences  can  evolve,  then  one 
must  start  to  carefully  watch  the  relative  phase  that  coherences  acquire  during  different 
consecutive  time-periods,  ( ) =ω τ 
.  To  illustrate,  consider  wavepacket  evolution:  light 
φτ 
ab 
interaction can impart positive or negative momentum ( ± kin  ) to the evolution of the wavepacket, 
which  influences  the  direction  of  propagation  and  the  phase  of  motion  relative  to  other  states. 
Any  subsequent  field  that  acts  on  this  state  must  account  for  time-dependent  overlap  of  these 
wavepackets  with  other  target  states.  The  different  terms  in  the  nonlinear  response  function 
account  for  all  of  the  permutations  of  interactions  and  the  phase  acquired  by  these  coherences 
involved.  The  sum  describes  the  evolution  including  possible  interference  effects  between 
different interaction pathways. 

Third-Order Response 
Since  R(2)  orientationally  averages  to  zero  for  isotropic  systems,  the  third-order  nonlinear 
response described the most widely used class of nonlinear spectroscopies.

Summary: General Expressions for nth Order Nonlinearity 
For an nth-order nonlinear  signal,  there are n  interactions with  the  incident electric  field or  fields 
that  give  rise  to  the  radiated  signal.    Counting  the  radiated  signal  there  are  n+1  fields  involved 
(n+1 light-matter interactions), so that nth order spectroscopy is also at times referred to as (n+1)-
wave mixing.  
The radiated nonlinear signal field is proportional to the nonlinear polarization:
