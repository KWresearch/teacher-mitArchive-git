6.4  NUCLEAR MOTION COUPLED TO ELECTRONIC TRANSITION1 

Here we will start with one approach to a class of widely used models for the coupling of nuclear 
motions  to  an  electronic  transition  that  takes  many  forms  and  has  many  applications.  We  will 
look at the specific example of electronic absorption experiments, which leads to insight into the 
vibronic structure in absorption spectra. Spectroscopically, it is also used to describe wavepacket 
dynamics; coupling of electronic and vibrational states to intramolecular vibrations or solvent; or 
coupling  of  electronic  states  in  solids  or  semiconductors  to  phonons.  Further  extensions  of  this 
model  can  be  used  to  describe  fundamental  chemical  rate  processes,  interactions  of  a  molecule 
with  a  dissipative  or  fluctuating  environment,  and  Marcus  Theory  for  non-adiabatic  electron 
transfer. 

Two-electronic state as displaced harmonic oscillators 
We  are  interested  in  describing  the  electronic 
absorption spectrum for the case that the electronic 
energy  depends  on  nuclear  configuration.  The 
simplified model  for  this  is  two  identical harmonic 
oscillators  potentials  displaced  from  one  another 
along  a  nuclear  coordinate,  and  whose  0-0  energy 
splitting  is  Ee−Eg. We  will  calculate  the  electronic 
absorption  spectrum  in  the  interaction  picture

The harmonic vibrational Hamiltonian has the same curvature in the ground and excited states, 
but the excited state is displaced by d relative to the ground state.

Born-Oppenheimer  Approximation.  Although  this  is  implied  in  eq.  (6.2)  when  we 
write  the  electronic  energy  as  independent  of  q,  specifically  it  means  that  we  can  write 
the state of the system as a product state in the electronic and nuclear configuration: 

G 

,= g n

(6.7) 

Condon Approximation.  This approximation states  that  there  is no nuclear dependence 
for the dipole operator.  It is only an operator in the electronic states.

Under  all  reasonable  conditions,  the  system  will  only  be  on  the  ground  electronic  state  at

Here  the oscillations at  the electronic energy gap are separated  from  the nuclear dynamics  in  the 
final factor, sometimes known as the dephasing function:

Note  that  physically  the  dephasing  function  describes  the  time-dependent  overlap  of  the  initial 
nuclear wavefunction on the ground state with the time-evolution of the same wavepacket on the 
when initially projected onto the excited state  
F t( ) =  ϕg  ( t ) ϕe  ( t )  . 
This is a perfectly general expression that does not depend on the particular form of the potential.  
If you have knowledge of the nuclear and electronic eigenstates or the nuclear dynamics on your 
ground and excited state surfaces, this expression is your route to the absorption spectrum.2
To evaluate F(t), it helps to realize that we can write the nuclear Hamiltonians as

which shifts an operator in space: 

(6.14)

	(6.15) 
This  allows  us  to  express  the  excited  state  Hamiltonian  in  terms  of  a  shifted  ground  state 
Hamiltonian  in  eq.  (6.13),  but  also  allows  us  to  relate  the  time-propagators  on  the  ground  and 
excited states

Up  to now,  everything we’ve written  is general  to  any  form of  the potential, but here we 
will  continue by  evaluating  the  results  for  the  specific  case of  a harmonic nuclear potential. The 
time-evolution of p is obtained by evaluating eq. (6.18) by applying eq. (6.12) to

Thus we can equate D with  the mean number of vibrational quanta excited  in  E  on absorption 
from  the  ground  state.   Also, we  can  define  the  vibrational  energy  vibrational  energy  in  E   on 
excitation at  q = 0

Coupling to a Harmonic Bath 
To further interpret this example, it is worth noting a similarity between the Hamiltonian for this 
displaced  harmonic  oscillator  problem,  and  a  general  form  for  the  coupling  of  an  electronic 
“system” which is observed, and a harmonic oscillator “bath” whose degrees of freedom are dark 
to  the  observation,  but  which  influence  the  behavior  of  the  system.    This  is  a  preview  of  the 
concepts  that  we  will  develop  more  carefully  later  for  the  description  of  fluctuations  in 
spectroscopy. 
We  demonstrated  the  electronic  absorption  lineshape  derives  from  a  dipole  correlation 
function  which  describes  the  overlap  between  two  wave  packets  evolving  on  the  ground  and 
excited surfaces  E  and  G  .

This is a perfectly general expression, which indicates that the absorption spectrum is the Fourier 
transform of the time-dependent overlap between excited and ground state nuclear wave packets.    
Expressed  in a slightly different physical picture, we can also conceive of  this process as 
nuclear motions  that act  to modulate  the  electronic  energy gap ωeg .  We  can  imagine  re-writing 
the  same  problem  in  terms  of  a  Hamiltonian  that  describes  the  electronic  energy  gap’s 
dependence on q, i.e. its variation relative to ωeg . Defining an Energy Gap Hamiltonian: 
H eg  = H E  − H G  − hωeg  = H e  − H g 
We can see that this leads to a problem for an electronic transition linearly coupled to a harmonic 
oscillator:

The Energy Gap Hamiltonian describes a  linear coupling between  the electronic  transition and a 
harmonic oscillator. The  strength of  the coupling  is  c and  the Hamiltonian has a constant energy 
offset value given by the reorganization energy. 
This  discussion  illustrates  how  the  displaced  harmonic  oscillator  and  Energy  Gap 
Hamiltonian  are  isomorphic  with  a  Hamiltonian  for  an  electronic  “system”  coupled  to  a 
harmonic oscillator “bath”:

Here HSB  describes  the  interaction of  the electronic system (HS) with  the vibrational bath (HB). It 
is  a  linear  coupling Hamiltonian, meaning  that  it  is  linear  in  the  bath  coordinate  has  a  strength-
of-coupling term ( m d ).

Coupling to Multiple Vibrations or a Continuum 
The  Hamiltonians  we  have  written  so  far  describe  coupling  to  a  single  bath  degree  of  freedom, 
but  the  results  can  be  generalized  to  many  vibrations  or  a  continuum  of  nuclear  motions.  This 
approach  is  used  to  treat  the  spectroscopy  of  dissipative  systems,  through  the  interaction  of  a 
system  with  a  continuum  of  states  that  are  dark  to  the  field,  and  which  we  treat  in  a  statistical 
manner, in addition to describing fluctuations in spectroscopy. 
So,  what  happens  if  the  electronic  transition  is  coupled  to many  vibrational  coordinates, 
each with  its own displacement?   The extension  is straightforward  if  the modes are  independent, 
i.e. we can conceive of the bath vibrations as harmonic normal modes. We imagine an electronic 
transition coupled to a set of normal modes for the molecule or lattice. Then we write the state of

the  system  as  product  states  in  the  electronic  and  nuclear  occupation,  i.e.  G  =  g n

For  independent  modes,  the  dipole  correlation  function  is  just  a  product  of  multiple  dephasing 
functions that characterize the time-evolution of the different vibrations.  In the time-domain this 
would  lead  to  a  complex  beating  pattern, which  in  the  frequency  domain  appears  as  a  spectrum 
with several superimposed vibronic progressions that follow the rules developed above. 
Taking  this  a  step  further,  the  generalization  to  a  continuum  of  nuclear  states  should  be 
apparent.  This  approach  describes  the  absorption  lineshape  that  results  from  dephasing  or 
irreversible  relaxation  induced  by  coupling  to  a  continuum.  Given  that  we  have  a  continuous 
frequency  distribution  of  normal  modes  characterized  by  a  density  of  states,  W (
)ω ,  and  a 
frequency dependent coupling,D(ω), we can change the sum in eq. (6.54) to an integral over the 
distribution

Here  the  product  ω  D  ω  can  be  considered  a  coupling-weighted  density  of  states, 
sometimes referred to as a spectral density. 
What  this  treatment  does  is  provide  a  way  of  introducing  a  bath  of  states  that  the 
spectroscopically  interrogated  transition  couples  with.  You  can  see  that  if  the  distribution  of 
states  is very broad and coupling  is a constant, we can associate  g t( ) with a constant Γ, and we 
obtain a Lorentzian lineshape. So coupling to a continuum or bath provides a way of introducing 
relaxation  effects  or  damping  of  the  electronic  coherence  in  the  absorption  spectrum.    More 
generally  the  lineshape  function will be  complex, where  the  real part describes damping  and  the 
imaginary part modulates the primary frequency and leads to fine structure.

Displaced Harmonic Oscillator Model at Finite Temperature 

If  you  solve  the  problem  for  coupling  to  a  single  vibrational mode  at  finite  temperatures, where 
excited vibrational levels in the ground state are initially populated, you find

n   is  the  thermally  averaged  occupation  number  of  the  harmonic  vibrational  mode.  Now,  let’s 
calculate  the  lineshape.  Expanding  exponentials  in  the  dephasing  function  and  Fourier 
transforming gives

The  first summation over  j (setting all k to zero)  looks as before, but  the second summation now 
includes  “hot  bands”:  transitions  upward  from  thermally  populated  vibrational  states with  a  net 
decrease  in  vibrational  quantum  number  on  excitation.  Note  their  amplitudes  depend  on  the 
thermal occupation.  

We  can  extend  this  description  to  describe  coupling  to  a  many  independent  nuclear 
modes  or  coupling  to  a  continuum.  We  write  the  state  of  the  system  in  terms  of  the  electronic
