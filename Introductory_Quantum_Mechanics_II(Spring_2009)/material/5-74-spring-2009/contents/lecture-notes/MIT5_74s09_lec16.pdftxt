11.5. CHARACTERIZING FLUCTUATIONS 

Eigenstate vs. system/bath perspectives 
From  our  earlier  work  on  electronic  spectroscopy, we  found  that  there  are  two  equivalent  ways 
of  describing  spectroscopic  problems, which  can  be  classified  as  the  eigenstate  and  system/bath 
perspectives.  Let’s  summarize  these  before  turning  back  to  nonlinear  spectroscopy,  using 
electronic spectroscopy as the example: 
1)  Eigenstate:  The  interaction  of  light  and  matter  is  treated  with  the  interaction  picture 
( ) .  H 0   is  the  full  material  Hamiltonian,  expressed  as  a 
0  + V t
 
Hamiltonian  H H= 
function  of  nuclear  and  electronic  coordinates,  and  is  characterized  by  eigenstates which 
0H n  = E  n  .  In  the  electronic  case  n  =  e n

labels  for  a  particular  vibronic  state.  The  dipole  operator  in  V t( ) couples  these  states. 
Given  that  we  have  such  detailed  knowledge  of  the matter,  we  can  obtain  an  absorption 
spectrum in two ways.  In the time domain, we know 
( ) μ 0  n  = ∑ pn  μ
C t( ) = ∑ pn  n μ( )t

The absorption lineshape is then related to the Fourier transform of  C t( ) ,

nm 
where  the  phenomenological  damping  constant  Γ nm    was  first  added  into  eq.  (1).    This 
approach  works  well  if  you  have  an  intimate  knowledge  of  the  Hamiltonian  if  your 
spectrum  is  highly  structured  and  if  irreversible  relaxation  processes  are  of  minor 
importance.   
2)  System/Bath:  In  condensed  phases,  irreversible  dynamics  and  featureless  lineshapes 
suggest a different approach. In the system/bath or energy gap representation, we separate 
our  Hamiltonian  into  two  parts:  the  system  H s  contains  a  few  degrees  of  freedom  Q 
which  we  treat  in  detail,  and  the  remaining  degrees  of  freedom  (q)  are  in  the  bath  H B . 
Ideally, the interaction between the two sets  H SB ( qQ ) is weak. 
H 0  = H S  + H B  + H SB
.

Spectroscopically  we  usually  think  of  the  dipole  operator  as  acting  on  the  system  state, 
i.e.  the  dipole  operator  is  a  function  of  Q.  If  we  then  know  the  eigenstates  of  H S  , 
H n  = E  n  where  n  =  g   or  e   for  the  electronic  case,  the  dipole  correlation

The influence of the dark states in  H B  is to modulate or change the spectroscopic energy 
gap ωeg   in  a  form  dictated  by  the  time-dependent  system-bath  interaction.   The  system-
bath  approach  is  a  natural  way  of  treating  condensed  phase  problems  where  you  can’t 
treat  all  of  the  nuclear  motions  (liquid/lattice)  explicitly.  Also,  you  can  imagine  hybrid 
approaches

Energy Gap Fluctuations 

How  do  transition  energy  gap  fluctuations  enter  into  the  nonlinear  response?  As  we  did  in  the 
case  of  linear  experiments,  we  will  make  use  of  the  second  cumulants  approximation  to  relate 
dipole correlation functions to the energy gap correlation function  Ceg (τ) . Remembering that for 
the  case  of  a  system-bath  interaction  that  that  linearly  couples  the  system  and  bath  nuclear 
coordinates,  the  cumulant  expansion  allows  the  linear  spectroscopy  to  be  expressed  in  terms  of 
the lineshape function  g t( )

Ceg ( )τ  = De iω0τ ,  as  we  might  expect  for  coupling  of  the  electronic  transition  to  a  nuclear  mode 
with  frequency  ω0,  we  recover  the  expressions  that  we  originally  derived  for  the  electronic 
absorption lineshape in which D is the coupling strength and related to the Frank-Condon factor.   
Here  we  are  interested  in  discerning  line-broadening  mechanisms,  and  the  time  scale  of 
random fluctuations that influence the transition energy gap.  Summarizing our earlier results, we 
can  express  the  lineshape  functions  for  energy  gap  fluctuations  in  the  homogeneous  and 
imhomogeneous limit as  
Homogeneous.  The  bath  fluctuations  are  infinitely  fast,  and  only  characterized  by  a

In this limit, we obtain the phenomenological damping result 
g t( ) = Γ t 
Which leads to homogeneous Lorentzian lineshapes with width Γ. 
Inhomogeneous.  The  bath  fluctuations  are  infinitely  slow,  and  again  characterized  by  a 
magnitude, but there is no decay of the correlations 
Ceg (τ) = Δ 2  . 
This limit recovers the Gaussian static limit, and the Gaussian inhomogeneous lineshape 
where Δ is the distribution of frequencies. 
g t( ) =  2  Δ  t .

The intermediate regime is when the energy gap fluctuates on the same time scale as the 
experiment. The simplest description is the stochastic model which describes the loss of

In a manner that parallels our description of the linear response from a system coupled to a bath, 
the  nonlinear  response  can  also  be  partitioned  into  a  system,  bath  and  energy  gap  Hamiltonian, 
leading to similar averages over  the fluctuations of the energy gap.  The nonlinear response for a 
fluctuating two-level system can be written as a sum of correlation functions of the form

These  expressions  only  account  for  fluctuations  of  the  energy  gap  while  the  system  evolves

How can you characterize fluctuations and spectral diffusion? 
The rephasing ability of the photon echo experiment provides a way of characterizing memory of 
the  energy  gap  transition  frequency  initially  excited  by  the  first  pulse.  For  a  static 
inhomogeneous  lineshape,  perfect  memory  of  transition  frequencies  is  retained  through  the 
experiment, whereas homogeneous broadening implies extremely rapid dephasing.  So, let’s first 
examine the polarization for a two-pulse photon echo experiment on a system with homogeneous 
and  inhomogeneous  broadening  by  varying  Δ / Γ eg  .  Plotting  the  polarization  as  proportional  to 
the response in eq. (24):

We  see  that  following  the  third  pulse,  the  polarization  (red  line)  is  damped  during  τ3  through 
homogeneous  dephasing  at  a  rate  Γ eg  ,  regardless  of  Δ.  However  in  the  inhomogeneous  case 
Δ >> Γ eg  ,  any  inhomogeneity  is  rephased  at τ1  =τ3  .  The  shape  of  this  echo  is  a Gaussian with 
width  ~  1 /  Δ .  The  shape  of  the  echo  polarization  is  a  competition  between  the  homogeneous 
damping and the inhomogeneous rephasing.

where  erfc(x)  =  1−erf(x)  is  the  complementary  error  function.  For  the  homogeneous  and

Δ >> Γ eg  ⇒  S (τ) ∝ e  4  τ 
− Γeg
In either limit, the inhomogeneity is removed from the measured decay. 
In the intermediate case, we observe 
that  the  leading  term  in  eq.  (26)  decays 
whereas  the  second  term  rises  with  time. 
This  reflects 
the  competition  between 
homogeneous 
the 
and 
damping 
inhomogeneous  rephasing.  As  a  result,  for 
the intermediate case ( Δ ≈ Γ ab ) we find that 
the  integrated  signal  S(τ)  has  a  maximum 
signal for τ> 0 . 

Andrei Tokmakoff, MIT Department of Chemistry, 5/10/2007 

p. 11-51 

The  delay  of maximum  signal,  τ*,  is known  as  the peak  shift. The observation of  a peak  shift  is 
an  indication  that  there  is  imperfect ability  to  rephrase. Homogenous dephasing,  i.e.  fluctuations 
fast on  the  time scale of τ, are acting  to scramble memory of  the phase of  the coherence  initially 
created by the first pulse.  
In  the  same way,  spectral  diffusion  (processes which  randomly modulate  the  energy  gap 
on  time  scales  equal  or  longer  than  τ)  randomizes  phase.    It  destroys  the  ability  for  an  echo  to 
form  by  rephasing.   To  characterize  these  processes  through  an  energy  gap  correlation  function, 
we  can  perform  a  three-pulse  photon  echo  experiment.  The  three  pulse  experiment  introduces  a 
waiting  time τ2 between  the  two coherence periods, which acts  to define a variable shutter speed 
for  the experiment. The  system evolves as a population during  this period, and  therefore  there  is 
nominally no phase acquired.  We can illustrate this through a lens analogy: 

Lens Analogy:  For an inhomogeneous distribution of oscillators with different frequencies, 
we define the phase acquired during a time period through  eiφ = ei (δωi t )  .

Since we  are  in  a population  state during  τ2,  there  is no  evolution of phase.  Now  to  this picture 
we  can  add  spectral  diffusion  as  a  slower  random  modulation  of  the  phase  acquired  during  all 
time  periods.    If  the  system  can  spectrally  diffuse  during  τ2,  this  degrades  the  ability  of  the 
system to rephase and echo formation is diminished.

Since  spectral  diffusion  destroys  the  rephasing,  the  system  appears  more  and  more 
“homogeneous”  as  τ2  is  incremented.  Experimentally,  one  observes  how  the  peak  shift  of  the 
integrated echo changes with the waiting time τ2. 
It will be observed to shift toward 
τ* 0  as a
=
function of τ2. 

In  fact,  one  can  show  that  the  peak  shift  with  τ2  decays  with  a  form  given  by  the  the 
correlation function for system-bath interactions: 
τ*  (τ2 ) ∝ Ceg (τ) 
(29) 
Using  the  lineshape  function  for  the  stochastic  model  g t( ) = Δ τc  ⎡⎣exp ( −t /τc  ) + t /τc  − 1⎤⎦ ,  you
