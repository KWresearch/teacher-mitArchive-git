A Classical Description of Spectroscopy 
The  traditional  quantum  mechanical  treatment  of  spectroscopy  is  often  a  rather  static 
representation of  the rather dynamic process of  light  interacting with matter.   The dynamic picture 
emerges  from  a  time-domain  description,  which  is  similar  to  the  classical  treatment  of 
spectroscopy.  Much  of  the  physical  intuition  that  is  helpful  in  understanding  the  nature  of  light-
matter interaction in spectroscopy naturally emerges from the classical view.  Let’s review that: 
The  classical  view  begins with  the  observation  that  atoms  and molecules  are  composed  of 
charged particles, and these charges are the handle by which an electromagnetic field exerts a force 
on  the atom or molecule.   The  force exerted on  the molecules depends on  the strength of  the  field, 
the magnitude of the charges, and how far the charges move.   
The  simplest  elements  of  a  model  that  captures  what  happens  in  absorption  spectroscopy 
require  us  to  consider  a  charged  particle  in  a  bound  potential  interacting  with  a  harmonic  driving 
force.  The  matter  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  a  particle  with  charge  q  under  the  influence  of  a 
harmonic potential (the leading term in the expansion of any bound potential in the coordinate Q): 
1 kQ  2  ,

The  light  field we will  take as plane electromagnetic waves. The simplest expression  for  the  light-
matter interaction potential is 
V t( ) = −μ⋅ E t( ) , 
the electric field interacting with the dipoles of the system. 
The  classical  description  of  this  system  starts  with  Newton’s  equation  of  motion  F=ma, 
which we write as 
m ∂ 2Q 
∂t 2 
On  the  right  hand  side  of  eq.  (3)  there  are  three  forces:  the  harmonic  restoring  force,  a  damping 
force, and the external driving force exerted by the light.  Remembering that

Eq.  (6)  indicates  that  increasing  the  force on  the oscillator  is achieved by  raising  the magnitude of 
the  field,  increasing  how  much  the  charge  is  displaced,  or  improving  the  alignment  between  the 
electric field polarization and the transition dipole moment. 
We can re-write eq. (5) as the driven harmonic oscillator equation:

Here the damping constant γ=

Let’s first look at the solution to eq. (7) for a couple 
of simple cases.   First, for  the case  that  there  is no damping 
or  driving  force  (γ = F0  = 0 ),  we  have  simple  harmonic 
solutions 
frequency  ω0 : 
in  which  oscillate  at  a 
Q t( ) = A sin (ω0t ) + B cos (ω0t ) .  Let’s  just  keep  the  sin 
term  for  now.  Now  if  you  add  damping  to  the  equation: 
Q t( ) = A e−γt sin Ω 0t .  The  coordinate  oscillates  at  a  reduced 

k m . 

 

frequency  Ω =  ω2  −γ2  .  As  we  continue,  let’s  assume  a

So this solution to the displacement of the particle says that the amplitude certainly depends on the 
magnitude  of  the  driving  force,  but more  importantly  on  the  resonance  condition.    The  frequency 
of  the  driving  field  should  match  the  natural  resonance  frequency  of  the  system,  ω0 ≈ω …like

pushing  someone on a  swing. When you drive  the  system at  the  resonance  frequency there will be 
an  efficient  transfer  of  power  to  the  oscillator,  but  if  you  push  with  arbitrary  frequency,  nothing 
will  happen.  Indeed,  that  is  what  an  absorption  spectrum  is:  a  measure  of  the  power  absorbed  by 
the system from the field.   
Notice  that  the  coordinate  oscillates  at  the  driving  frequency  ω  and  not  at  the  resonance 
frequency  ω0.  Also,  the  particle  oscillates  as  a  sin,  that  is,  90°  out-of-phase  with  the  field  when 
driven  on  resonance.  This  reflects  the  fact  that  the maximum  force  can  be  exerted  on  the  particle 
when  it  is  stationary  at  the  turning  points.    The  phase  shift β,  depends  varies  with  the  detuning 
from resonance.   
Now  we  can  make  some  simplifications  to  eq.  (8)  and  calculate  the  absorption  spectrum. 
For weak damping γ <<ω0  and near resonance ω0 ≈ω , we can write 
(ω0  −ω )  = (ω0  −ω)  ( ω0  +ω)  ≈ 4ω0  (ω0  −ω)

The absorption spectrum is a measure of the power transferred to the oscillator, so we can calculate 
it by  finding  the power absorbed  from  the  force on  the oscillator  times  the velocity, averaged over 
a cycle of the field.
