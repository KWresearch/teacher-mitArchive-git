10.2. DIAGRAMMATIC PERTURBATION THEORY 

In practice,  the nonlinear  response  functions as written above provide  little  insight  into what  the 
molecular  origin  of  particular  nonlinear  signals  is.  These  multiply  nested  terms  are  difficult  to 
understand when  faced  the  numerous  light-matter  interactions, which  can  take  on  huge  range  of 
permutations  when  performing  experiments  on  a  system  with  multiple  quantum  states.  The 
different  terms  in  the  response  function  can  lead  to  an  array  of  different  nonlinear  signals  that 
vary  not  only  microscopically  by  the  time-evolution  of  the  molecular  system,  but  also  differ 
macroscopically in terms of the frequency and wavevector of the emitted radiation.   
Diagrammatic  perturbation  theory  (DPT)  is  a  simplified  way  of  keeping  track  of  the 
contributions  to a particular nonlinear signal given a particular set of states  in H0  that are probed 
in  an  experiment.    It  uses  a  series  of  simple  diagrams  to  represent  the  evolution  of  the  density 
matrix  for  H0,  showing  repeated  interaction  of ρ  with  the  fields  followed  by  time-propagation 
under H 0 .  From  a  practical  sense,  DPT  allows  us  to  interpret  the microscopic  origin  of  a  signal 
with  a  particular  frequency  and  wavevector  of  detection,  given  the  specifics  of  the  quantum 
system we are studying and  the details of  the  incident radiation.   It provides a shorthand  form of 
the  correlation  functions  contributing  to  a  particular  nonlinear  signal,  which  can  be  used  to 
understand  the  microscopic  information  content  of  particular  experiments.  It  is  also  a 
bookkeeping method that allows us to keep track of the contributions of the incident fields to the 
frequency and wavevector of the nonlinear polarization. 
There  are  two  types  of  diagrams we will  discuss, Feynman  and  ladder  diagrams,  each  of 
which  has  certain  advantages  and  disadvantages.  For  both  types  of  diagrams,  the  first  step  in 
drawing a diagram  is  to  identify  the states of H0  that will be  interrogated by  the  light-fields. The 
diagrams  show  an  explicit  series  of  absorption  or  stimulated  emission  events  induced  by  the 
incident  fields which appear as action of  the dipole operator on  the bra or ket side of  the density 
matrix.  They  also  symbolize  the  coherence  or  population  state  in  which  the  density  matrix 
evolves  during  a given  time  interval. The  trace  taken  at  the  end  following  the  action of  the  final 
dipole  operator,  i.e.  the  signal  emission,  is  represented  by  a  final  wavy  line  connecting  dipole 
coupled states. 

Feynman Diagrams1 
Feynman  diagrams  are  the  easiest  way  of  tracking  the  state  of  coherences  in  different  time 
periods, and for noting absorption and emission events.

interaction.  Absorption  is  designated  through  an 
inward  pointing  arrow.  Emission  is  an  outward

on the ket, whereas the right line is bra. 
	System  evolves  freely  under  H 0  between

period is often explicitly written.

Ladder Diagrams2 
Ladder  diagrams  are  helpful  for  describing  experiments  on  multistate  systems  and/or  with 
multiple  frequencies;  however,  it  is  difficult  to  immediately  see  the  state  of  the  system  during  a 
given  time  interval.  They  naturally  lend  themselves  to  a  description  of  interactions  in  terms  of 
the eigenstates of H0.

interactions. Absorption is an upward arrow and 
emission  is  downward.    A  solid  line  is  used  to 
indicate  action  on  the  ket, whereas  a  dotted  line 
is action on the bra. 
4.  	 Free propagation under H0 between interactions, 
but  the  state  of  the  density matrix  is  not  always

For  each  light-matter  interactions  represented  in  a  diagram,  there  is  an  understanding  of 
how  this  action  contributes  to  the  response  function  and  the  final  nonlinear  polarization  state. 
Each  light-matter  interaction  acts  on  one  side  of  ρ,  either  through  absorption  or  stimulated 
emission.  Each  interaction  adds  a  dipole  matrix  element  μij  that  describes  the  interaction 
amplitude  and  any  orientational  effects.3  Each  interaction  adds  input  electric  field  factors  to  the 
polarization, which are used to describe the frequency and wavevector of the radiated signal. The 
action  of  the  final  dipole  operator  must  return  you  to  a  diagonal  element  to  contribute  to  the 
signal.  Remember  that  action  on  the  bra  is  the  complex  conjugate  of  ket  and  absorption  is 
complex  conjugate  of  stimulated  emission.   A  table  summarizing  these  interactions  contributing 
to a diagram is below.

Once you have written down  the  relevant diagrams, being  careful  to  identify  all permutations of 
interactions of your system states with the fields relevant to your signal, the correlation functions 
contributing to the material response and the frequency and wavevector of the signal field can be 
readily obtained.  It is convenient to write the correlation function as a product of several factors 
for each event during the series of interactions:  

1)  Start with  a  factor  pn  signifying  the  probability  of  occupying  the  initial  state,  typically  a 
Boltzmann factor.  
2)  Read  off  products  of  transition  dipole  moments  for  interactions  with  the  incident  fields, 
and for the final signal emission. 
3)  Multiply by terms that describe the propagation under  H 0  between interactions. 
As a starting point for understanding an experiment, it is valuable to include the effects of 
relaxation  of 
the  system  eigenstates 
in 
the 
time-evolution  using  a  simple 
phenomenological approach. Coherences and populations are propagated by assigning the 
damping constant  Γ ab   to propagation of the  ρab  element:

Example: Linear Response for a Two-Level System 
Let’s  consider  the  diagrammatic  approach  to  the  linear  absorption  problem,  using  a  two-level 
system  with  a  lower  level  a  and  upper  level  b.  There  is  only  one  independent  correlation 
function in the linear response function,

⎣ 
This  does  not  need  to  be  known  before  starting,  but  is  useful  to  consider,  since  it  should  be 
recovered  in  the  end.  The  system will  be  taken  to  start  in  the  ground  state ρaa.  Linear  response 
only allows  for one  input  field  interaction, which must be absorption, and which we  take  to be a 
ket side interaction. We can now draw two diagrams:

As  expected  the  signal  will  radiate  with  the  same  frequency  and  in  the  same  direction  as  the 
incoming  beam.   Next we  can write  down  the  correlation  function  for  this  term.   Working  from 
bottom up:

More  sophisticated ways  of  treating  the  time-evolution  under H0  in  step  (3)  could  take  the  form

However,  there  is  no  new  dynamical  content  in  these  extra  diagrams,  and  they  are  generally

Example: Second-Order Response for a Three-Level System 
The  second-order  response  is  the  simplest  nonlinear  case,  but  in  molecular  spectroscopy  is  less 
commonly  used  than  third-order  measurements.  The  signal  generation 
requires  a  lack  of  inversion  symmetry, which makes  it  useful  for  studies  of 
interfaces  and  chiral  systems.  However,  let’s  show  how  one  would 
diagrammatically  evaluate  the  second  order  response  for  a  very  specific 
system  pictured  at  right.  If  we  only  have  population  in  the  ground  state  at 
equilibrium  and  if  there  are  only  resonant  interactions  allowed,  the 
permutations of unique diagrams are as follows: 

p. 10-21 

From  the  frequency conservation conditions,  it  should be clear  that process  i  is a  sum-frequency 
signal  for  the  incident  fields,  whereas  diagrams  ii-iv  refer  to  difference  frequency  schemes.  To 
better  interpret what  these diagrams  refer  to  let’s  look  at  iii.   Reading  in  a  time-ordered manner, 
we can write the correlation function corresponding to this diagram as 
⎣  ( )

Note  that a  literal  interpretation of  the  final  trace  in diagram  iv would  imply 
an  absorption  event  –  an  upward  transition  from  b  to  c. What  does  this  have  to  do 
with radiating a signal?  On the one hand it is important to remember that a diagram 
is  just  mathematical  shorthand,  and  that  one  can’t  distinguish  absorption  and 
emission  in  the  final action of  the dipole operator prior  to  taking a  trace.   The other 
thing to remember is that such a diagram always has a complex conjugate associated 
with  it  in  the  response  function.  The  complex  conjugate  of  iv,  a  Q2
∗  ket/bra  term, 
shown  at  right  has  a  downward  transition  –emission–  as  the  final  interaction.  The 
combination  Q2  − Q2 
∗  ultimately describes the observable. 

(10.9)

p. 10-22 

Now,  consider  the  wavevector  matching  conditions  for  the  second  order  signal  iii. 
Remembering that the magnitude of the wavevector is  k  =ω c = 2π λ, the length of the vectors 

will be  scaled by  the  resonance  frequencies. When  the  two  incident  fields are crossed as a  slight 
angle, the signal would be phase-matched such that the signal is radiated closest to beam 2. Note 
that the most efficient wavevector matching here would be when fields 1 and 2 are collinear. 

Third-Order Nonlinear Spectroscopy 

p. 10-23 

Now  let’s  look at examples of diagrammatic perturbation  theory applied  to  third-order nonlinear 
spectroscopy. Third-order nonlinearities describe  the majority of coherent nonlinear experiments 
that  are  used  including  pump-probe  experiments,  transient  gratings,  photon  echoes,  coherent 
anti-Stokes  Raman  spectroscopy  (CARS),  and  degenerate  four  wave  mixing  (4WM).  These 
experiments are described by some or all of the eight correlation functions contributing to  R (3) :

The  diagrams  and  corresponding  response  first  requires  that  we  specify  the  system 
eigenstates.    The  simplest  case,  which  allows  us  discuss  a  number  of  examples  of  third-order 
spectroscopy  is  a  two-level  system.  Let’s write  out  the  diagrams  and  correlation  functions  for  a 
two-level system starting in  ρaa , where the dipole operator couples  b and  a .

The  R2  term has the property of time-reversal: the phase acquired during τ1 is reversed in τ3. For 
that  reason  the  term  is  called  “rephasing.”    Rephasing  signals  are  selected  in  photon  echo 
experiments  and  are  used  to  distinguish  line  broadening  mechanisms  and  study  spectral 
diffusion.  For  R4 ,  the  phase  acquired  continuously  in  τ1  and  τ3,  and  this  term  is  called  “non ­

respectively.

For  the  present  case  of  a  third-order  spectroscopy  applied  to  a  two-level  system,  we 
observe  that  the  two  rephasing  functions  R2 and R3   have  the  same  emission  frequency  and 
wavevector, and would therefore both contribute equally to a given detection geometry.  The two 
terms  differ  in which  population  state  they  propagate  during  the  τ2  variable.  Similarly,  the  non­
rephasing functions  R1  and R4  each have the same emission frequency and wavevector, but differ 
by  the  τ2  population.  For  transitions  between more  than  two  system  states,  these  terms  could  be 
separated  by  frequency  or  wavevector  (see  appendix).  Since  the  rephasing  pair  R2   and R3   both

Here  a  is  the  initial  state  and  the  sum  is  over  all  possible  intermediate  states.   Also,  to  describe 
frequency  domain  experiments,  we  have  to  permute  over  all  possible  time  orderings.  Most 
generally,  the  eight  terms  in  R (3)   lead  to  48  terms  for  χ( 3) ,  as  a  result  of  the  3!=6  permutations 
of the time-ordering of the input fields.5 
Given a set of diagrams, we can write the nonlinear susceptibility directly as follows:

Appendix: Third-order diagrams for a four-level system 
The  third  order  response  function  can  describe  interaction  with  up  to  four  eigenstates  of  the 
system  Hamiltonian.  These  are  examples  of  correlation  functions  within  R(3)  for  a  four-level 
system  representative  of  vibronic  transitions  accompanying  an  electronic  excitation,  as  relevant 
to  resonance  Raman  spectroscopy.  Note  that  these  diagrams  present  only  one  example  of 
multiple permutations that must be considered given a particular time-sequence of incident fields 
that may have variable frequency.

Appendix: Third-order diagrams for a vibration 
The  third-order  nonlinear  response  functions  for  infrared  vibrational  spectroscopy  are  often 
applied to a weakly anharmonic vibration.  For high frequency vibrations in which only the v = 0 
state is initially populated, when the incident fields are resonant with the fundamental vibrational 
transition,  we  generally  consider  diagrams  involving  the  system  eigenstates  v  =  0,  1  and  2,  and 
which include v=0-1 and v=1-2 resonances.  Then, there are three distinct signal contributions:

Note that for the SI and SII signals there are two types of contributions: two diagrams in which all 
interactions  are with  the v=0-1  transition  (fundamental)  and one diagram  in which  there  are  two 
interactions  with  v=0-1  and  two  with  v=1-2  (the  overtone).    These  two  types  of  contributions 
have opposite signs, which can be seen by counting the number of bra side interactions, and have 
emission  frequencies  of  ω10  or  ω21.  Therefore,  for  harmonic  oscillators,  which  have  ω10  =  ω21 
= μ  ,  we  can  see  that  the  signal  contributions  should  destructively  interfere  and 
and 
2μ

vanish.  This  is  a  manifestation  of  the  finding  that  harmonic  systems  display  no  nonlinear 
response.  Some  deviation  from  harmonic  behavior  is  required  to  observe  a  signal,  such  as 
vibrational  anharmonicity  ω10  ≠ ω21,  electrical  anharmonicity  2μ10  ≠ μ21 ,  or  level-dependent 
damping Γ10  ≠ Γ21 or Γ00  ≠ Γ11 .
