There are no required books for the class, but you will need to read on the
lecture topics in some of the following references. Specific_readings are
suggested in the table below, where the texts are referred to by number.
***** Texts You Can't Do Without *****
[Nitzan] =Â [Amazon_logo] Nitzan, Abraham. Chemical Dynamics in Condensed
Phases. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780198529798.
This is a wonderful new book that thoroughly covers all topics that you might
care to learn about for time-dependent quantum mechanics relevant to the
condensed phase. We will follow the treatment of several topics in this book.
[Schatz] =Â [Amazon_logo] Schatz, George C., and Mark A. Ratner. Quantum
Mechanics in Chemistry. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2002. ISBN:
9780486420035.
This is an important book to have. It has the most overlap with the topics we
will cover, uses a similar language and notation, and treats the problems at a
similar level.
***** Additional References *****
These are excellent readings for the lecture topics, and problems are often
drawn from them.
[McHale] =Â [Amazon_logo] McHale, J. L. Molecular Spectroscopy. Upper Saddle
River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998. ISBN: 9780132290630.
This text covers basic light matter interactions, correlation functions, and
various molecular spectroscopies.
[Merzbacher] = [Amazon_logo] Merzbacher, E. Quantum Mechanics. 3rd ed. New
York, NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1997. ISBN: 9780471887027.
General physics text for quantum dynamics, perturbation theory, light-matter
interactions.
[Mukamel] = [Amazon_logo] Mukamel, S. Principles of Nonlinear Optical
Spectroscopy. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1999. ISBN: 9780195132915.
This is an advanced text that treats quantum dynamics, correlation functions,
response functions, coupling of a system to a bath, and nonlinear spectroscopy.
[Sakurai] = [Amazon_logo] Sakurai, J. J. Modern Quantum Mechanics. Reading, MA:
Addison-Wesley, 1993. ISBN: 9780201539295.
[Tannor] = [Amazon_logo] Tannor, D. J. Introduction to Quantum Mechanics: A
Time-Dependent Perspective. Sausilito, CA: University Science Books, 2006.
ISBN: 9781891389238.
This appears to be a wonderful new quantum textbook at the level of this class.
It was just published, so I haven't had time to digest it yet, but it clearly
will be an excellent reference.
**** Electromagnetic Waves ****
[Jackson] = [Amazon_logo] Jackson, J. D. Classical Electrodynamics. New York,
NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998. ISBN: 9780471309321.
Useful for light-matter interactions. Chapter 6 describes vector and scalar
potentials and chapter 7 talks about plane waves.
**** Correlation Functions ****
[Berne] = [Amazon_logo] Berne, B. J. Physical Chemistry: An Advanced Treatise.
Vol. VIIIB. Edited by D. Henderson. New York, NY: Academic Press, 1972. ISBN:
9780122456589.
[Zwanzig] = Zwanzig, R. Annual Review of Physical Chemistry 16 (1965): 67.
[Gordon] = Gordon, R. G. Adv Magn Reson 3 (1968): 1.
[McQuarrie] = [Amazon_logo] McQuarrie D. A. Statistical Mechanics. New York,
NY: Harper and Row, 1976. ISBN: 9780060443665.
Useful for correlation function description of spectroscopy.
[Wang] = [Amazon_logo] Wang, C. H. Spectroscopy of Condensed Media: Dynamics of
Molecular Interactions. Burlington, MA: Academic Press, 1985. ISBN:
9780127347806.
**** Density Matrix and Relaxation ****
[Blum] = [Amazon_logo] Blum, K. Density Matrix Theory and Applications. New
York, NY: Academic Press Inc, 1996. ISBN: 9780306453410.
[Slichter] = [Amazon_logo] Slichter, C. P. Principles of Magnetic Resonance
with Examples from Solid State Physics. New York, NY: Harper and Row, 1963.
