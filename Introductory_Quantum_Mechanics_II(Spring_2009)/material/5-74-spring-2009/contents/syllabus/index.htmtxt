Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Overview *****
This class will be covered in twelve, 1.5 hour lectures. We will cover topics
in time-dependent quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and relaxation, with an
emphasis on descriptions applicable to condensed phase problems and a
statistical description of ensembles. There will also be an extra 4 lectures
focusing on nonlinear spectroscopy.
    * Time-dependent quantum mechanics
    * Interaction of light with matter
    * Correlation function description of condensed phase spectroscopy
    * Fluctuations and relaxation
    * Nonlinear spectroscopy
***** Grading *****
There will be 4 problem sets worth a total of 75% of the grade, which can and
should be worked on together. A take-home exam will account for the remaining
25% of the grade. It will be distributed during the last lecture, and should
not be discussed with your classmates.
      Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES         PERCENTAGES
Four problem sets  75%
One take-home exam 25%

***** Mathematical Software *****
The problem sets in this class will include numerical problems that require you
to solve one-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equations, integrate coupled differential
equations, and other problems involving the manipulation of matrices and
vectors. For this, the most convenient approach is using some type of
mathematical or engineering calculation software. If you have little experience
with this, I recommend Mathcad(R) 14, because I will distribute Mathcad
worksheets with sample routines on this Web site.
***** Textbooks *****
[Amazon_logo] Nitzan, Abraham. Chemical Dynamics in Condensed Phases. New York,
NY: Oxford University Press, 2006. ISBN: 9780198529798.
This is a wonderful new book that thoroughly covers all topics that you might
care to learn about for time-dependent quantum mechanics relevant to the
condensed phase. We will follow the treatment of several topics in this book.
[Amazon_logo] Schatz, George C., and Mark A. Ratner. Quantum Mechanics in
Chemistry. Mineola, NY: Dover Publications, 2002. ISBN: 9780486420035.
This is an important book to have. It has the most overlap with the topics we
will cover, uses a similar language and notation, and treats the problems at a
similar level.
