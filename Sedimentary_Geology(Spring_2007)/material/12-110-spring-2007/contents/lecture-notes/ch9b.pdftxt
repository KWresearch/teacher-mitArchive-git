BRACHIOPODS 
(Phylum  Brachiopoda) 
Time span:  Early Cambrian to now 

 
 

 
Organism 
The soft body is enclosed in a shell consisting of two valves (Figure 9B-1; 
Clarkson, E.N.K., 1979, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution: George Allen 
& Unwin, 323 p. Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2).  The shell is usually fixed to the sea 
floor by a stalk (the pedicle) that protrudes through an opening (the pedicle 
foramen) in one of the valves, called the pedicle valve.  The other, smaller, valve 
is called the brachial valve.   
Brachiopods  are  filter  feeders:   most  of  the  shell  cavity  is  filled with  a  long, 
looped  band  called  the  lophophore  on  which  are  sticky  filaments  with  cilia  that 
wave  to  create  a  current  through  the  shell  cavity.   Small  food  particles  are  caught 
by the filaments and passed to a simple gut. 
 
Skeleton 
The  valves  are  hinged  or  articulated  for  a  short  or  long  distance  along  one 
edge.   Unlike mollusks,  the valves have a symmetry plane  that bisects both valves 
perpendicular  to  the  hinge  line;  the  two  valves  are  fundamentally  different  in 
shape, not just mirror images.   
The  valves  are  usually  robust,  and  they  have  always  been  of  calcite,  so  they 
preserve  relatively  well.    Some  brachiopods  have  chitinophosphatic  instead  of 
calcareous  shells.    Size  varies  from  less  than  a  centimeter  to  several  centimeters.  
Valve shape varies widely.  Ribs and growth ridges are of varying prominence. 
 
Classification 
Brachiopods  are  subdivided  into  two  classes,  Inarticulata  and  Articulata.  
The  inarticulates  are  those  with  chitinophosphatic  shells.    They're  not  very  abun-
dant  in  the  fossil  record  and  they're  not  very  useful  stratigraphically,  but  they're 
interesting  because  they're  so  well  adapted  and  evolutionarily  conservative:    one 
genus, Lingula, has been around since the Early Cambrian!   
The articulates are subdivided  into six orders, whose names we won't burden 
you  with.    Figure  9B-2  (Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate  Palaeontology  and 
Evolution:  George  Allen  &  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  7.13)  shows  a  variety  of 
different  forms.    These  orders  have  various  time  spans,  and  varying  degrees  of 
importance during their time spans.  Only three have not become extinct.

 Importance 
Brachiopods  were  a  major  component  of  invertebrate  faunas  in  the  past, 
especially  in  the  Paleozoic;  their  heyday  was  from  the  beginning  of  the 
Ordovician  to  the  end  of  the  Permian.    They  are  of  only  minor  importance  now.  
The  shells  are  usually  well  preserved,  and  they  are  stratigraphically  important, 
especially in the mid-Paleozoic. 
 
Habitat 
Brachiopods  are  attached  bottom  dwellers,  on  various  sediment  types;  they 
are exclusively marine, usually shallow. 
 
Comments 
Brachiopods  are  the  most  common  fossil  you'll  find  in  many  Lower  and 
Middle  Paleozoic  rocks.    Warning:    you  can  see  the  same  brachiopod  in  various 
views, because there's an inner and an outer surface to each of the two valves, and 
you see each of the four surfaces in either positive or negative.  Sometimes just the 
cemented  filling  (called  a  steinkern)  of  the  still-articulated  shell  is  preserved;  this 
looks like a shell itself, but it's the negative of both the inner surfaces.

BRYOZOANS 
(Phylum Bryozoa) 
Time span:  Late Cambrian to now 

 
Organism 
Bryozoans  are  colonial  marine  invertebrates.    The  individual  organism, 
called  a  zooid,  is  in  the  shape  of  a  cylinder  with  a  ring  of  retractable  tentacles 
coming  out  of  the  top  (Figure  9B-3;  Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate 
Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen  &  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  6.1  and 
Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of 
Invertebrate 
Paleontology:   McGraw-Hill,  816  p. Figure  7_41).   Cilia  on  the  tentacles wave  to 
create  a  current  toward  the  base  of  the  tentacles.    Plankton  brought  in  by  this 
current  are  caught  by  the  tentacles  and  carried  down  into  the  gut  within  the 
cylindrical body.   
The zooid is housed in a skeleton called the cystid, which may or may not be 
mineralized.  The zooids always live in a closely packed colony called a zoarium. 
Bryozoans superficially resemble colonial corals, but they are more advanced 
physiologically.    They  have  some  fundamental  physiological  similarities  to 
brachiopods (but their fossil record looks entirely different). 
 
Skeleton 
The calcareous colonies take on a wide variety of forms:  they look like cups, 
leaves,  branches,  tufts,  globs,  and  even  spirals  (Figure  9B-4;  Shrock,  R.R.,  and 
Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of  Invertebrate  Paleontology:    McGraw-Hill, 
816  p.  Figure  7_44).    Usually  you  see  fragments  of  colonies  rather  than  whole 
colonies. 
 
Classification 
Bryozoans  are  divided  into  three  classes,  two  of  which  appeared  in  the 
Ordovician and one  in  the Mesozoic.   One of  the orders of  the class Stenolaemata 
were  the  dominant  bryozoans  in  the  Paleozoic,  and  another  order  of  that  class 
were the dominant bryozoans in the Mesozoic. 
 
 Importance 
Bryozoans  are  fairly  abundant  throughout  the  fossil  record,  and  you'll  see 
some  rocks  that  contain mostly  fragments of bryozoan  colonies, but  they're not  as 
common  as  some  other  kinds  of  fossils.    The  species  are   mostly wide-ranging  in 
time and therefore not very useful stratigraphically. 
 
Habitat 
Today,  bryozoans  are  found  at  all  depths  from  the  shoreline  down  to 
trenches,  but  they're  most  abundant  in  shallow  water.    They  need  a  fairly  firm 
substrate on which to anchor and grow colonies, so they're not common on muddy 
bottoms.    Strong  currents  and  waves  are  destructive  of  the  relatively  fragile 

 235

colonies.    Bryozoans  are  contributors  to  reefs,  but  they  have  never  formed  reefs 
themselves.

CEPHALOPODS 
(Phylum Mollusca) 
Time span:  Late Cambrian to now 

 
Organism 
Cephalopods  are mollusks  that  live  in  a  single  chambered  shell.   As with  all 
the mollusks,  the  soft  body  has  a mouth,  an  anus,  and  gills  (Figure  9B-5; Shrock, 
R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of  Invertebrate  Paleontology:  
McGraw-Hill,  816  p.  Figure  10_55  and  Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate 
Palaeontology and Evolution: George Allen & Unwin, 323 p. Figure 8.20).   
Cephalopods are the most advanced of mollusks:  their brains are more highly 
developed  and  their  sense  organs  are  more  specialized  than  in  pelecypods  or 
gastropods.    They  are  predatory  carnivores  with  a  highly  developed  ability  to 
swim. 
Cephalopods  have  an  effective  means  of  maintaining  buoyancy:    the  cham-
bers,  each  containing  both  gas  and  water,  are  connected  by  a  long  tube,  the  si-
phuncle,  though  which  water  can  be  added  or  removed  from  the  chambers  to 
adjust  the  bulk  density  of  the  animal.    The  danger  of  implosion  restricts 
cephalopods to the uppermost several hundred meters of the ocean. 
 
   Skeleton 
Some  cephalopods  are  coiled  (usually  tightly,  and  almost  always  planispi-
rally; Figures 9B-5, 9B-6; Clarkson, E.N.K., 1979, Invertebrate Palaeontology and 
Evolution:  George  Allen  &  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  8.18)  and  others  are  straight 
(Figure  9B-7;  Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of 
Invertebrate  Paleontology:    McGraw-Hill,  816  p.  Figure  10_58)  to  somewhat 
curved, but  the common element of all  the shells  is  that  they are made up of many 
chambers.   New chambers are added at the outer end as the animal grows, and the 
animal lives in the outermost chamber.   
The  outer  surface  of  the  shell  shows  closely  spaced  growth  lines,  and  the 
inner  surface  of  the  shell  (which  is  often  seen  in  fossils  that  are  internal molds)  is 
marked  by  sutures  where  the  septa  between  adjacent  chambers  meets  the  shell 
wall. 
 
Classification 
A  large  number  of  different  kinds  of  cephalopods,  divided  into  three  sub-
classes,  developed  during  the  Paleozoic.    Most  of  these  had  straight  or  curved 
shells,  although  some  were  coiled.    These  are  usually  called  nautiloids  (one  kind 
was  the  forerunner  of  the  modern  Nautilus),  but  it  would  be  better  to  call  them 
non-ammonoid  cephalopods.    All  of  these  except  the  coiled  forms  that  led  to 
Nautilus became extinct by the end of the Paleozoic.   
Cephalopods  of  another  subclass,  called  ammonoids  (often  also  called 
ammonites),  became  abundant  in  the  Mesozoic.    Ammonoids  have  beautiful 
planispirally coiled shells.   

 237

Chapter 9B  FOSSILS 

 

 

 

The  only  other  geologically  important  group,  the  belemnites,  with  straight 
shells, belong  to  still another  subclass;  they evolved  in  the Late Paleozoic and be-
came extinct in the Early Cenozoic.  
 
Habitat 
Cephalopods  swim  freely  in  the  shallow  waters  of  the  open  ocean,  and  the 
shell  settles  to  the  bottom  after  the  organism  dies.    Since  they  do  not  live  on  the 
bottom,  they can be geographically wide-ranging, and can be found in a variety of 
sediments, although fine sediment is the rule. 
 
 Importance 
Cephalopods,  especially  nautiloids  in  the  Paleozoic  and  ammonoids  in  the 
Mesozoic,  are  of  enormous  stratigraphic  importance.    They  are  among  the  very 
best  index  fossils,  because  the  species  tend  to  be  short-ranging  in  time  and  long-
ranging in space (See especially Figure 9B-7A).  
 
 Comments 
Cephalopods are common enough  in certain  rock  types  to be useful, but  they 
are  not  common  as  fossils.    You're  not  nearly  as  likely  to  see  a  cephalopod  as  a 
brachiopod, a crinoid, or a pelecypod.

CORALS 
(Phylum Cnidaria)  
Time span:  Early Cambrian to now 

 
Organism 
Cnidarians  are  the  simplest  of  all  true  metazoans,  although  they're  better 
organized than sponges, because their cells are organized into definite tissues.  The 
sedentary organism, called  the polyp, of  the order of a centimeter across, has cells 
organized  into  just  two  layers,  an  outer  ectoderm  and  an  inner  endoderm,  with  a 
jellylike  structureless  layer,  the  mesogloea,  between  them  (Figure  9B-8;  Shrock, 
R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of  Invertebrate  Paleontology:  
McGraw-Hill, 816 p. Figure 4_11 and Figure 4_26).  The body cavity, surrounded 
by a ring of tentacles, has only one opening, which serves as mouth and anus.   
Some  corals  are  solitary,  others  colonial.    It's  the  colonial  corals  that  are  of 
greatest sedimentological importance.  
 
 Skeleton 
The  polyp  sits  in  a  basal  skeleton  called  the  corallum,  generally  cup-shaped 
or  columnar.    The  lowermost  cells  of  the  organism  secrete  aragonite  or  calcite  to  
build  the  corallum  upward  as  time  goes  on.    The  corallum  has  an  outer  wall,  the 
epitheca, within which are numerous septa parallel to the axis of the corallum and 
radiating outward.   
The solitary corals are often shaped like horns or columns; the colonial corals 
take on a great variety of fanlike, branching, or tabular shapes.  
 
Classification 
Corals are one subclass, Zoantharia, of the class Anthozoa (including also sea 
anemones  and  sea  pens),  which  is  itself  one  of  three  classes  of  cnidarians,  the 
others being Hydrozoa (hydroids and millepores) and Scyphozoa (jellyfish).  
Corals are classified into four orders, three of which are very important in the 
fossil  record:    Rugosa  (rugose  corals),  Cambrian  to  Triassic;  Tabulata  (tabulate 
corals),  Cambrian  to  Permian;  and  Scleractinia  (scleractinian  corals),  Triassic  to 
now  (Figure  9B-9;  Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of 
Invertebrate Paleontology:  McGraw-Hill, 816 p. Figure 4_39 and Figure 4_41).   
θ   Rugose  corals :    solitary  (usually  a  curved  horn,  sometimes  cylindrical)  and 
colonial  (many  styles,  but  mostly  branching,  parallel-columnar,  and 
massively packed). 
θ  Tabulate corals:  always colonial; cylindrical, branching, massive. 
θ  Scleractinian  corals:    solitary  (conical,  cylindrical,  horn-shaped)  and 
colonial (columnar, massive, branching, and brain-shaped) 

 
Habitat 
The  rugose  corals  lived  unattached  on  the  bottom.    They  seem  to  have  pre-
ferred  soft  muddy  bottoms.    The  colonies  never  grew  to  be  very  large,  and  these 

 239

Chapter 9B  FOSSILS 

 

 

 

corals  were  not  reef-builders.    The  tabulate  corals  seem  to  have  liked  generally 
similar  environments;  they  had  no  good means of  attachment,  so  they didn't build 
large  frameworks  either.    Paleozoic  corals  are  commonly  found  in  fine-grained 
limestones  and  calcareous mudstones.   As  you've  already  seen,  the  colonial  kinds 
of  scleractinians  have  built  great  reefs  by  attachment  of  the  colonies  to  a  hard 
substrate.  
  
Importance 
Corals are generally not very useful in correlation, but they tell us a lot about 
paleoecology.    And,  of  course,  the  scleractinians  have  been  the  great  reef-
builders.  
  
Comments   
Corals,  along  with  other  members  of  this  phylum  (sea  anemones,  jellyfish, 
hydroids)  used  to  be  included  in  the  phylum  Coelenterata  but  are  now  thought  to 
be a separate but related phylum. 
Certain  solitary  rugose  corals  show  fine  growth  ridges,  a  couple  of  hundred 
per  centimeter,  on  the  epithecal  surface.    These  growth  ridges  are  grouped  into 
bands  or  annuli.    The  growth  ridges  reflect  daily  growth  cycles,  and  the  broader 
bands represent monthly and yearly cycles.  Certain Devonian corals show that the 
year had just about 400 days then.  Assuming that the year was of the same length, 
there must have been more and shorter days in the year during the Devonian!  This 
is consistent with the idea that the Earth's rate of rotation has been slowing by tidal 
friction.

CRINOIDS 
(Phylum Echinoderma) 
Time span:  Early Ordovician to now 

 
Organism and Skeleton 
Echinoderms,  entirely  marine,  are  a  phylum  of  invertebrates  that  are  very 
different  from  all  other  invertebrate  groups.    They  all  have  internal  skeletons 
consisting  of  porous  single-crystal  calcite  plates,  articulated  in  various  ways  and 
covered  by  a  thin  skin  of  protoplasm.    Most  echinoderms  have  a  five-rayed  or 
pentameral symmetry.  
The  crinoid  body  consists  of  a  globular  plated  cup,  the  theca,  which  has  a 
lower  part,  the  calyx,  with  thick  rigid  plates  and  an  upper  part,  a  kind  of  domed 
flexible  roof,  the  tegmen,  with  a  central  mouth  and  a  lateral  anus  (Figure  9B-10; 
Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate  Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen 
& Unwin, 323 p. Figure 9.35).  Inside the theca is a spiral gut.  Extending from the 
theca  are  long,  flexible,  plated  arms,  called  brachia.    The  brachia  have  sticky 
pinnules  that  catch  floating  food,  which  is  passed  along  food  grooves  to  the  gut.  
When feeding, the organism orients its arms to form a fan facing upcurrent. 
Most modern crinoids are attached directly  to  the bottom without a stalk, but 
most  ancient  crinoids  had  long,  flexible  stalks  consisting  of  stacks  of  doughnut-
shaped disks,  like vertebrae,  called ossicles, held  in a  flexible  skin  (Figure 9B-11; 
Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,  Principles  of 
Invertebrate 
Paleontology:    McGraw-Hill,  816  p.  Figure  14_17).    A  central  canal  runs  the 
length  of  the  stalk,  passing  through  the  hole  in  the  middle  of  each  ossicle.    The 
organism is attached to the bottom by a rootlike holdfast.  
 
Classification 
Crinoids, a  subphylum of echinoderms, are divided  into  four orders.   Two of 
these became extinct  in  the Permian and one  in  the Triassic.   Another echinoderm 
subphylum,  Blastozoa,  is  quite  similar  to  crinoids;  as  nonspecialists,  you  and  we 
would  have  a  hard  time  telling  them  apart.    The  taxonomically  unofficial  term 
pelmatozoans  is  used  for  all  these  echinoderms  with  plated  calices  mounted  on 
stems and with pinnulate arms for food gathering. 
  
Habitat 
Modern  crinoids  live  at  all  depths,  although  most  live  below  a  hundred  me-
ters.    Ancient  crinoids  must  have  lived  more  commonly  in  waters  of  shelf  depth.  
Most  crinoids  today  live  in  flowing  water,  orienting  themselves  upcurrent  for 
efficient  filtration-feeding,  and  many  ancient  crinoids  must  have  too.    But  other 
ancient  crinoids  seem  to  have  lived  in quiet water  in muddy  environments,  facing 
straight  upward.      So  in  the  ancient  you  find  crinoids  in  well  sorted  coarse  sedi-
ments as well as poorly sorted fine sediments.  
 

 241

Chapter 9B  FOSSILS 

 

 

 

Importance 
Crinoids  are  not  especially  useful  in  correlation,  but  they  provide  interesting 
paleoecological  insights.   Crinoids were very abundant  in  the Paleozoic, and since 
then  they  have  declined.    They  have  been  forced  mainly  into  the  deep  ocean, 
where they sometimes form enormous "gardens" of sea lillies. 
 
Comments 
Crinoids  are  rarely  found  preserved  whole,  but  disarticulated  or  partly  dis-
articulated  crinoid  debris,  especially  ossicles  but  also  calyx  plates,  are  extremely 
common.   Many  coarse, well  sorted  limestones  (biosparite; grainstone)  consist of 
mostly crinoid plates and ossicles.

GASTROPODS 
(Phylum Mollusca) 
Time span:  Early Cambrian to now 

 
Organism 
The body of a gastropod is in three parts:  a head, a foot, and viscera (Figure 
9B-12; Clarkson, E.N.K., 1979, Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution: George 
Allen & Unwin, 323 p. Figure 8.15).  The head has a mouth, a pair of stalked eyes, 
and  tentacles  that  act  as  sensory  organs.    The  mouth  opens  into  a  cavity,  the 
pharynx,  containing  a  chitinous  band,  the  radula,  with  transverse  teeth.    The 
radula acts as a rasp or file for boring and for cutting up vegetation (gastropods are 
herbivorous).    The  foot  is  a  flat  creeping  organ  behind  the  head  underneath  the 
body.    Gastropods  have  a  heart,  a  liver,  kidneys,  and  a  well  developed  nervous 
system.    Aquatic  forms  have  gills,  and  terrestrial  forms  have  lungs.    There  are 
male and female gastropods. 
 
Skeleton 
Most gastropod  shells have  the  form of a helicoid  spiral  in which  the cone  is 
coiled  loosely  or  tightly  around  an  imaginary  axis  (Figure  9B-13;  Clarkson, 
E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate Palaeontology  and Evolution: George Allen & Unwin, 
323  p.  Figure  8.16).    The  tightness  of  the  coiling  varies  considerably,  as  does 
overall  shape  and  also  external  ornamentation.    The  shells  of  modern  gastropods 
are  calcitic,  but  judging  by  the  poorness  of  preservation,  those  of  Paleozoic 
gastropods were probably aragonitic.   
Many gastropods have a horny or calcareous plate, the operculum, carried on 
the  back  part  of  the  foot,  to  close  the  shell  opening  after  the  animal  retreats 
entirely within its shell.  You don't often find fossil opercula. 
  
Classification 
Gastropods  are  subdivided  into  three  subclasses:    Prosobranchiata,  which 
includes  most  of  the  fossil  gastropods  as  well  as  modern  marine  shelled  gas-
tropods; Opisthobranchiata, which  includes marine  gastropods  that  have  lost  their 
shells; and Pulmonata, which have developed lungs and become adapted to life on 
land. 
 
Habitat 
Gastropods have  an  amazingly wide  range of adaptation,  from abyssal ocean 
depths  to  high  mountains.    The  marine  shelled  gastropods  of  interest  to  paleon-
tologists  must  have  mostly  crawled  upon  mud  and  sand  bottoms.    Some  modern 
gastropods also cling tenaciously to rocks. 
 
Importance 
Gastropods  generally  evolved  slowly  and  are  long-ranging  in  time,  so  they 
are  not  of  major  importance  for  correlation.    Their  abundance  has  generally  in-
creased through time.  

 243

Chapter 9B  FOSSILS 

 

 

 

 
Comments 
Gastropods  are  not  abundant  in  many  rocks,  but  if  you  hunt  around  you're 
likely  to  find  one.    Preservation  of  Paleozoic  gastropods  is  usually  as  external 
impressions.

GRAPTOLITES 
(Phylum Hemichordata) 
Time span:  Middle Cambrian to Early Mississippian 

 
Organism and Skeleton 
Graptolites  were  free-floating  colonial  marine  animals.    The  skeleton  con-
sists of a series of hollow interlinked tubes constructed of a thin sheetlike material 
called  periderm 
Invertebrate 
(Figure  9B-14;  Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979, 
Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen  &  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  10.1).    The 
first-formed part of the graptolite is a conical tube called the sicula.  Upward from 
the  sicula  grew  a  number  of  cuplike  thecae.    The  thecae  show  prominent  growth 
lines.    All  the  thecae  are  connected  by  a  common  canal,  so  presumably  food 
caught  by  the  individual  animals  was  ingested  and  shared  by  the  whole  colony.  
The  colonies  had  various  numbers  of  branches,  or  stipes.    The  entire  colony  is 
known as a rhabdosome.  Nothing is known about the the soft-bodied animals that 
occupied the thecae. 
 
Classification 
Graptolites  (officially,  class  Graptolithina)  are  divided  into  several  orders, 
only  two  really  important:    Dendroidea  (dendroids),  Cambrian  to  Mississippian, 
and  Graptoloidea  (graptoloids),  Early  Ordovician  to  Early  Devonian.    The 
dendroids  were  many-branched  colonies;  the  graptoloids  had    rhabdosomes  with 
only a few stipes (eight, four, two, or just one).  
 
Habitat 
Dendroids  appear  to  have  been  sessile  benthonic  organisms  (Figure  9B-15; 
Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate  Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen 
&  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  10.3  and  Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel,  W.H.,  1953,

They  probably  grew  upright,  with  a  holdfast  below  the  sicula  and  with  the  stipes 
extending upward like a shrub.  Graptoloids, on the other hand, seem to have been 
planktonic.  
 
Importance 
Graptolites  are  very  important  for  dating  Ordovician  and  Silurian  rocks.  
But  there  are  problems:    graptolite  species  are  fairly  long-ranging  in  time,  and 
preservation  is  not  really  good,  and  graptolites  are  found  mainly  in  deep-water 
shales, not coarser shallow-marine rocks.   
 
Comments 
Graptolites  are  almost  always  preserved  as  carbonaceous  films  on  bedding 
planes,  because  of  compression  and  diagenesis  after  the  colony  came  to  rest  on  a 
mud  bottom  and  was  buried.    So  unless  the  shale  tends  to  split  along  bedding 
planes, which  is  a  lot  less  common  than  along  the  cleavage,  you  don't  have much 
chance of finding graptolites.

PELECYPODS 
(Phylum Mollusca) 
Time span:  Early Ordovician to now 

 
Organism 
Pelecypods  are  mollusks  with  a  soft  body  enclosed  between  paired,  hinged 
shells.    The  body,  fairly  highly  organized,  consists  of  a  visceral mass,  a  foot,  and 
gills.    The  visceral mass,  attached  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  two  valves,  consists 
of  mouth, an esophagus, a stomach, a coiled intestine, and an anus (Figure 9B-16; 
Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate  Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen 
&  Unwin,  323  p.    Figure  8.7.  and  Figure  9B-17;  Shrock,  R.R.,  and  Twenhofel, 
W.H., 1953, Principles of Invertebrate Paleontology:  McGraw-Hill, 816 p. Figure 
10_13).    In  many  pelecypods  the  mouth  and  the  anus  are  a  pair  of  tubes  in  a 
retractable siphon that sticks out from the shell.  A circulatory system with a heart, 
a nervous  system,  and kidneys  are well developed.   The muscular  foot  is used  for 
moving and burrowing. 
 
Skeleton 
The  two  valves  of  the  shell  are  almost  exactly  mirror  images  of  each  other 
(Fig. 9B-18; Shrock, R.R.,  and Twenhofel, W.H., 1953, Principles of  Invertebrate 
Paleontology:    McGraw-Hill,  816  p.  Figure  10_18),  the  way  your  right  and  left 
hands  are.    The  only  difference  is  that  the  details  of  teeth  and  sockets  for 
articulation  at  the  hinge  are  different  in  the  two  valves.    When  pulled  closed  by 
adductor  muscles  attached  within  the  shell,  the  two  valves  meet  tightly  along  a 
curved  line  that  usually  lies  nearly  in  a  plane.    The  valves  show  closely  spaced 
growth  lines  that  are  records  of  the  former  positions  of  the  edge  of  the  shell;  new 
shell  material  is  added  only  at  the  margins  of  the  shell.    Some  pelecypods  also 
show prominent ribs radiating from the point of juncture of the shells.  
The  shells  in  some  species  are  calcite,  in  others  aragonite,  and  in many  are 
alternating  layers  of  calcite  and  aragonite.    Because  of  recrystallization  of  the 
aragonite  to  calcite,  most  fossil  pelecypod  shells  no  longer  show  fine  structural 
detail. 
 
Classification 
It's  fairly  easy  to  classify  pelecypods  at  the  level  of  species  and  genera,  but 
it's  difficult  to  classify  them  at  high  taxonomic  levels.    They've  been  divided  into 
six subclasses.  All of these but one (which evolved in the Triassic) appeared at the 
beginning  of  the  Ordovician,  when  pelecypods  underwent  a  spectacular  burst  of 
adaptive  radiation.    There  was  another  great  expansion  of  pelecypods  in  the 
Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. 
 
 Habitat 
Pelecypods  are  bottom-dwellers  (mainly marine,  but  also  fresh-water) with  a 
great  variety  of  life  modes:    infaunal  (burrowing,  shallow  or  deep),  epifaunal 
(attached  to  the  substrate  by  threads  or  cement,  or  free-lying),  swimming,  or 

 246

boring.    Both  infaunal  and  epifaunal  pelecypods  have  been  common.    They  are 
much more common in sandstones and mudstones than in limestones.   
Pelecypods  have  been  much  more  successful  than  their  competitors  the  bra-
chiopods  at  colonizing  difficult  environments  like  the  intertidal  zone,  and  are  to-
day far more important than brachiopods. 
 
Importance 
Pelecypods  are  mostly  too  wide-ranging  in  time  to  be  very  useful  strati-
graphically. 
 
Comments 
In  the  Paleozoic,  you're  not  nearly  as  likely  to  see  pelecypod  fossils  as  bra-
chiopod fossils, but in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, it's just the other way around. 
Pelecypods are also called lamellibranchs or bivalves.

TRILOBITES 
(Phylum Arthropoda) 
Time span:  Early Cambrian to Permian  

  
Organism 
Paleontologists  are  hampered  in  their  understanding  of  the  soft-body 
anatomy and physiology of  trilobites because trilobites are extinct.   Trilobites had 
chitinous  exoskeletons.  (Chitin  is  a  kind  of  nitrogenous  polysaccharide  that's 
extremely  resistant  to  solution  once  it's  secreted  by  the  organism).    Not  much  is 
known about the soft body, but it it's known that trilobites molted. 
 
Skeleton 
The  chitinous  skeleton  is  always  in  three  parts  (Figure  9B-19;  Clarkson, 
E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate Palaeontology  and Evolution: George Allen & Unwin, 
323  p.  Figure  11.3.  and  Figure  9B-20;  Clarkson,  E.N.K.,  1979,  Invertebrate 
Palaeontology  and  Evolution:  George  Allen  &  Unwin,  323  p.  Figure  11.13):    a 
head or cephalon,  in one piece; a  thorax, which is segmented; and a tail or pygid-
ium,  in  one  piece.   The  cephalon  usually  shows  a  raised  bulbous  central  area,  the 
glabella, on which are two compound eyes, each facet a single crystal of calcite.   
On  the  underside  (the  ventral  side)  of  the  thorax  is  a  pair  of  appendages, 
usually  not  preserved,  on  each  segment.    The  segmentation  of  the  thorax  allowed 
some trilobites to roll themselves up, probably for protection. 
 
Classification 
Trilobites  are  classified  into  about  eight  orders  and  sixteen  suborders  based 
on morphology  of  hard  parts  (Figure  9B-21; Shrock, R.R.,  and Twenhofel, W.H., 
1953,  Principles  of  Invertebrate  Paleontology:    McGraw-Hill,  816  p.  Figure 
13_36).   Many  characteristics  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  classification,  and 
it's hard to know which are the most significant.   
Of  the  six  suborders  apparently  already  in  existence  when  trilobites  devel-
oped  hard  parts  at  the  beginning  of  the  Cambrian,  four  became  extinct  at  the  end 
of  the  Cambrian,  but  ten  appeared  near  the  end  of  the  Cambrian.    (Evolutionary 
lineages  are  hard  to  figure  out,  though.)    Of  those,  only  one  survived  beyond  the 
end of the Devonian. 
 
Habitat 
Trilobites must have walked,  crawled, plowed, or  scooted upon  the  sediment 
surface  in  search  of  food.    The  "double-tire-tread"  track  represented  by  the  trace 
fossil  Cruziana  was  certainly  made  by  plowing  trilobites,  and  various  other 
scratch-mark  trace  fossils were probably made by walking or  skimming  trilobites.  
Trilobites  are  most  commonly  found  in  siltstones,  mudstones,  and  fine-grained 
limestones.

Importance 
Several  thousand  species have been described.   Trilobites are of great  strati-
graphic  value  in  the  Cambrian  (zoned  almost  entirely  on  trilobites)  and  of  some-
what  lesser value  in  the Ordovician.   In the Ordovician, trilobites and brachiopods 
in  shallow-water  facies  are  played  off  against  graptolites  in  deeper-water  facies.  
In  Silurian  and  younger  rocks  they  are  much  less  important  than  other  fossil 
groups for correlation. 
 
Comments 
Trilobite  fossils  are  common  enough  that  with  some  patience  you  can  often 
find  them  in  the  appropriate  rock  types  in  the Lower  and Middle  Paleozoic.   You 
usually  find  pieces  of  the  cephalon  or  pygidium.    It's  almost  always  the  upper 
(dorsal) surface, not the lower (ventral). 
The  taxonomic  status  of  trilobites  is  unclear.    It's  clear  that  they  should  be 
called  arthropods,  but  it's  generally  agreed  that  arthropods  are  actually  poly-
phyletic.    The  official  view  is  that  trilobites  are  a  questionable  subphylum  of  the 
artificial phylum Arthropoda, but maybe they should be a separate phylum.
