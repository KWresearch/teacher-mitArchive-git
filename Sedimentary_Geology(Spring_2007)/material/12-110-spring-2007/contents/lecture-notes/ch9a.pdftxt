PALEOBIOLOGY 

PART I.  PRECAMBRIAN LIFE 

 
 

 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
1.1  Life on Earth began early.  The oldest undoubted fossils are about 3500 
million years old, back in the early Archean—and, as you will see in a later 
section of this chapter, the earliest fossil organisms are very similar to organisms 
that are abundant and successful today.  These organisms, although primitive 
compared to advanced metazoans (like us), are, in an absolute sense, rather 
advanced in their physiology.  It’s generally agreed that the earliest life, earlier 
than that represented by the oldest fossils, must have been much simpler and less 
sophisticated biochemically  The clear implication is that life must have evolved 
much earlier than 3.5 Ga—although it is doubtful if fossils much older than that 
will ever be found.  Why not?  Perhaps largely because the sedimentary rocks in 
which they would have been preserved are no longer around, in pristine, 
unmetamorphosed condition, for us to scrutinize. 
1.2  This section purports to tell you something about the nature and 
evolution of life in the Precambrian (more specifically, up to the latter part of the 
Proterozoic; for the rise of eukaryotic organisms in general, and multicellular 
eukaryotes in particular, late in the Proterozoic, see the following section).  For the 
sake of full disclosure here, I should point out that I am a novice in biology!  I feel 
myself to be especially inadequate when it comes to the biochemistry of metabolic 
process and the molecular biology of replication and inheritance.  With that 
disclaimer, however, I have attempted here to present to you the basics of the 
fossil record of the Precambrian and some of its implications for the early 
evolution of life.  If you have a special interest in paleontology, and in particular 
the earliest life you might consider going into the literature.  I have provided a 
fairly long list of materials, largely review papers by specialists in the field. 
1.3  Just to set the stage at this early point in the chapter, Figure 9-1 is a 
diagram that shows, in a very generalized way, the known distribution of 
stromatolites and microbial microfossils through geologic time.  The clear 
message from Figure 9-1 is that the Archean fossil record is scanty but real, and 
the Proterozoic fossil record is far more abundant.  The terms used in Figure 9-1, 
as well as some of the place names, will be elaborated later in this section.

2.  THE KINGDOM OF LIFE 
 
2.1  Back when I was a child, the standard idea was that life was divided into 
the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom.  (In fairness to biologists, I should 
point out that the experts knew then that the situation was more complicated:  
what to do about fungi, for example?).  Progress on deciphering the “tree of life” 
(that is, the evolutionary development of the various life forms known today, 
through geologic time, from a presumably common original ancestor) has been 
truly spectacular in recent years.  With the development of techniques for 

 

183

examining the genetic material carried by RNA and DNA, it is now possible to 
trace evolutionary lineages back in time.  (I would have included a “background 
section” on that, but I think that it would have taken me weeks, not just days, to 
produce an adequate one, given the very steep learning curve I would have faced.)  
Biologists now have a fairly generally accepted picture of the “tree of life”.  
Before considering that, however, we need to deal with some rather intricate 
terminology for organisms and their metabolic processes. 
2.2  The basic distinction among organisms is between unicellular 
organisms and multicellular organisms.  Among the unicellular organisms, there 
is another fundamental distinction:  between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  
Prokaryotes are relatively primitive unicellular organisms in which the protoplasm 
and the genetic material are encased within a cell wall of some kind but the 
genetic material is not located within a nucleus.  Eukaryotes are relatively 
advanced unicellular organisms in which the genetic material is enclosed in a 
special nucleus within the cell.  Prokaryotes reproduce asexually, whereas 
eukaryotes reproduce sexually.  (The implication of that is that the pace of 
evolution was very slow early on, but quickened with the advent of eukaryotes, 
because sexual reproduction allows the ever-arising mutations to spread rapidly 
through an interbreeding population, leading to Darwinian evolution through 
natural selection processes.)  The earliest fossils are believed to be prokaryotic; 
eukaryotic organisms evolved in the course of the Proterozoic. 
2.3  All organisms can be classified as either heterotrophic or autotrophic.  
A heterotrophic organism obtains its raw-material energy resources (its “food”) 
from preexisting organic matter (or abiotic organic molecules).  An autotrophic 
organism synthesizes its own organic materials by conversion of simple inorganic 
compounds, making use of a variety of external energy sources.   
2.4  There seems to be a general consensus that the very earliest organisms 
must have been  heterotrophs, because heterotrophs can be simpler in their 
metabolic processes than autotrophs.  In that view, the more advanced autotrophic 
life forms evolved from early heterotrophs.  The problem with widespread 
heterotrophy is that eventually the organisms use up whatever stock of “food” is 
available, and without autotrophy, no more “food” is produced—except perhaps 
by the continuing inorganic synthesis of abiotic organic molecules, which would 
not have been produced in any great abundance. 
2.5  Depending on the form of energy utilized, autotrophs can be classified 
as either chemoautotrophic or photoautotrophic.  Chemoautotrophic organisms 
use chemical energy to fuel their processes of biochemical synthesis.  Such 
organisms are known to exist today, perhaps most spectacularly in the deep ocean, 
in the vicinity of hydrothermal vents (called, picturesquely, “black smokers”) 
associated with mid-ocean spreading ridges.  Photoautotrophic organisms use 
solar energy for their processes of synthesis.  
 

 

184

 
2.6  Photosynthesis is a complex set of biochemical processes.  The basic 
nature of all photosynthesis is to start with some relatively reduced compound 
that’s stable in the natural environment, and oxidize it using solar radiation as the 
source of the needed energy to drive the reaction, and using certain compounds, 
like chlorophyll, as catalysts to enable the reaction to happen.  The general 
reaction can be written as 
 
CO2 + 2H2X + light energy → (CH2O) + H2O + 2X 
 
The representative of element “X” in this reaction that is most familiar to you is, 
of course, oxygen:  by photosynthesis, the organism splits the water molecule 
(which takes a lot of energy) and combines the hydrogen released with carbon 
dioxide to manufacture carbohydrate cell material (represented here by the 
simplest form of carbohydrate; the carbohydrate sucrose, heavier but still simple, 
has the molecular formula C6H12O6) and free molecular oxygen.  That’s called 
oxygenic photosynthesis (and the organisms that do it are called oxygenic 
photoautotrophs).  Many organisms do not have chlorophyll and so can’t use 
oxygen for the “X” in photosynthesis.  Many bacteria contain compounds 
catalytically similar to chlorophyll that enable them to use H2S, hydrogen sulfide, 
as the raw material.  That kind of photosynthesis, called anoxygenic 
photosynthesis, produces free sulfur rather than oxygen as the by-product.  The 
organisms that do this are called anoxygenic photoautotrophs. 
 
2.7  Now for the main show of this section.  Figure 9-2 is a diagram that 
shows, schematically, the “tree of life” (which is more properly called a 
phylogenetic tree—that is, how the major taxa of organisms have developed 
through time) as it was understood in the early 1990s.  (I have not discovered a 
more recent version.)

2.8  Biologists now agree that there are three fundamental domains of life:  
eubacteria (formal name:  Bacteria); archaebacteria (formal name:  Archaea); and 
eukaryotes (formal name:  Eucarya).  This was generally known well before the 
breakthrough in use of techniques of molecular biology to pin down the 
phylogenetic tree, but the structure of the tree was not well known.  All of the 
“branch tips” shown in Figure 9-2 are represented by living organisms:  that’s 
what makes it possible to trace the lineages back in time.  In Figure 9-2, there we 
are, up along the top, having branched off one of the four major lines of 
eukaryotes, at about the same time as plants and fungi.  Is it some consolation that 
we are more closely related to slime molds than to bacteria?   
2.9  The big mystery in a diagram like that in Figure 9-2 is, of course:  what 
was the common original ancestor, represented by the open line at the bottom of 
the diagram?  It’s extremely unlikely that we will ever find any direct fossil 
evidence of it in the early geologic record.  Another very interesting feature of the 
phylogenetic tree in Figure 9-2 is that all of the earliest life forms seem to have 
been hyperthermophilic.  As the term implies, a hyperthermophilic organism is 
one that loves extremely high temperatures, even greater than 100°C.  They are 

 

186

known from a variety of extreme Earth environments today, and they are all very 
primitive prokaryotes, both eubacteria and archaebacteria.  It’s possible, of course, 
that one or more “deep” branches of the tree became extinct early on.  If so, we 
can’t include them in this tree.  And, of course, if in addition they left no fossil 
record, we know nothing about them at all! 
2.10  Figure 9-3 is a version of Figure 9-2 that shows not only the 
phylogenetic tree but also a lot of information on the nature of photosynthesis, in 
the cases of photosynthesizing organisms.  What’s striking, to me, about Figure 9-
3 is that both modern multicellular plants and cyanobacteria engage in oxygenic 
photosynthesis and, more specifically, use the same details of chemical processes 
in photosynthesis (the so-called Calvin–Benson cycle; no details here).   
Cyanobacteria are an ancient kind of eubacteria, formerly called blue–green  
algae, but now known not to be closely related to true algae.  They are widespread 
and important in today’s world as well—and their nature seems not greatly 
different from their representatives in the earliest fossil record (see a later section).  
The implication is that their pace of evolution has been extremely slow.

3.  THE NATURE OF FOSSILS 
 
3.1  What is a Fossil? 
 
3.1.1  A fossil can be defined, broadly, as any evidence of past plant or 
animal life contained in a sediment or a sedimentary rock.  The word comes from 
the Latin fossilis, an adjective meaning “dug up”.  In the early days of geology, the 
term was applied to any interesting natural object (minerals; pieces of ore; pieces 
of rock; traces of life) that were, literally, dug out of the ground.  The term 
gradually came to be restricted to materials that give evidence of past life. 
3.1.2  (One qualifying note at this point, though:  the mere presence of 
disseminated organic matter in ancient rocks, which might technically fall under 
the definition of a fossil above, is excluded by tacit agreement.  And the average 
concentration of such organic matter in sedimentary rocks is surprisingly high, 
something like one to two percent.  More later in the course on the role of that 
organic matter in our energy-hungry modern society.) 
3.1.3  There are two kinds of fossils: body fossils and trace fossils.  Body 
fossils are the actual organism or some part of it, or the imprint of the organism or 
some part of it.  Even more abundant than body fossils, however, are trace fossils, 
which are physical evidence of the life activities of now vanished organisms.  
Tracks, trails, burrows, feeding marks, and resting marks are all trace fossils.  
Trace fossils are useful for geologists and paleontologists because certain kinds of 
organisms, which live in specific environmental conditions, make distinctive 
traces.  When you hear the word “fossil”, you might think of shells or dinosaur 
bones.  These are indeed good examples of body fossils, but there are many other 
kinds of fossils, including both body fossils and trace fossils. 
3.1.4  In relatively young sediments and rocks, the actual body parts of 
organisms are often preserved.  In older rocks, however, the body parts are usually 
dissolved away, or recrystallized, or replaced by another kind of mineral.  Even so, 
the imprints of the organisms are still preserved, and they can be studied if the 
rock splits apart in the right place and the right orientation to reveal the imprint.  
Paleontologists usually collect large numbers of rock pieces and then split them in 
the laboratory with special mechanical splitting devices to try to find at least a few 
fossils. 
 

3.2  Fossilization 

 
3.2.1 Two important things to remember about the fossil record are that it’s 
imperfect and it’s biased.  Something like a quarter of a million fossil species have 
been discovered and described.  This represents only a small percentage of the 
million and a half species known to be living today.  There are certainly a lot more 
fossil species yet to be discovered, but by the same token probably only a third of 
the species in existence today have been recognized and described so far.  But 
things are not as bad as they might seem, because almost half of today’s species 

 

188

are insects, and only a few thousand fossil insects species are known, because of 
the difficulty of preserving insects in the fossil record. 
3.2.1  It is clear that some organisms are readily preserved and others are 
seldom, if ever, preserved.  Organisms with robust hard shells composed of 
difficultly soluble material, like calcite, are readily preserved if the shells are 
buried permanently soon after death of the organism.  For the body of an organism 
to become preserved as a fossil, it must escape destruction, at least in part, both 
before and after it is buried with sediments.  Destruction before burial might result 
from chemical and/or biological decomposition, or from mechanical effects like 
abrasion and/or breakage during transport by wind or water currents, or a 
combination of both. (Fragments produced by breakage and abrasion during 
transport are among the major constituents of limestones.  Technically, such 
particles are fossils, and sedimentologists tend to call such stuff “fossil fragments”, 
but they are not beloved of paleontologists because they are not very suitable for 
figuring out details of body morphology.)  Soft-bodied organisms like worms and 
jellyfish become preserved only under special circumstances, when their freshly 
dead bodies come to rest in soft, fine mud and are buried immediately.  There is a 
very high probability that any organism on Earth will be either consumed by 
another organism or decomposed by microorganisms following death.  For an 
organism or body part to become a fossil, it must either live within or be moved to 
a place where it can be buried and isolated from decay.  The more rapid the 
burial, the less decay and the better the chance of preservation.  Burial alone, 
however, does not guarantee that fossilization will occur, because conditions 
conducive to decomposition or dissolution often persist to great depths of burial.  
We have to assume that only a minuscule percentage of organisms become 
preserved in the sedimentary record. 
3.2.2  During the latter part of geologic time, at least, most subaerial 
environments (those exposed to the open air rather than being underwater) have 
been fully oxygenated, so the soft tissues of dead organisms, whether plants or 
animals, are susceptible to decay.  Microorganisms like bacteria are especially 
important in facilitating such decomposition.  Many if not most subaqueous 
(underwater) environments are also oxygenated, owing to the ability of water to 
dissolve the oxygen of the atmosphere—although the geologic record tells us that 
that have been times in geologic history when the oceans were largely stagnant, 
and reducing environments, in which organic matter accumulated in abundance, 
were widespread. 
3.2.3  For organisms to escape decay, burial must be extremely rapid, or the 
depositional environment must be anoxic (without the presence of oxygen).  Some 
of the best-preserved soft body fossils have been found in deposits that are 
interpreted to have formed in marine basins in which there is little or no vertical 
exchange of water, so that the bottom waters are stagnant, but at the same time 
there is a rain of organic matter from the near-surface waters, the result being 
anoxic bottom waters.  Free-floating organisms that fall to the bottom in such a 

 

189

water body have an excellent chance of preservation.  Probably the best modern 
example of such an environment is the Black Sea. 
3.2.4  Hard skeletal materials, like bones and shells, have a far high 
probability of preservation than soft tissues.  For a bone or shell to be preserved, it 
must only survive breakage and abrasion before burial and chemical dissolution of 
its constituent mineral material before and after deposition. Even if the object is 
dissolved after deposition, it is likely to be represented by a cavity, which serves 
the paleontologist almost as well as the entire preserved object.  Except in the 
youngest sedimentary rocks, imprints of the shells of marine invertebrates are just 
as common as the shells themselves, and usually even more so. 
 

3.3  Fossiliferous Rocks 

 
3.3.1  A rock that contains fossils is said to be fossiliferous (in contrast to 
unfossiliferous—or, perhaps better, nonfossiliferous).  Almost all fossils are 
contained in sedimentary rocks.  Not all sedimentary rocks, however, contain 
fossils.  If they parachuted you out of an airplane to land on a random outcrop of 
sedimentary rock, the chance of your finding a fossil would be rather small—
nowhere close to one hundred percent.  Fossils are virtually nonexistent in igneous 
rocks, and they are extremely uncommon in metamorphic rocks, although certain 
robust body fossils can survive a substantial degree of metamorphism.  Finding a 
fossil in a metamorphic rock is a significant and exciting event for a geologist, 
because it is extremely difficult otherwise to date the time of deposition of the 
sedimentary precursors of now-metamorphosed rocks.  More germane to this 
section is that even slight low-grade metamorphism is effective at obliterating, or 
at least obscuring, the evidence of the small, vulnerable, single-celled organisms 
that inhabited the early Earth. 
3.3.2  Some kinds of sedimentary rocks tend to be more fossiliferous than 
others. Limestones are the generally the most fossiliferous of sedimentary rocks.  
That should not be surprising, because most limestones consist in part, or even 
entirely, of the body parts of shelly marine organisms. Most coarse-grained 
limestones, and many fine-grained limestones as well, consist mostly of whole 
shells or fragments of shells.  Such fragments, although recognizably derived from 
whole organisms, are not usually the subject of special study by paleontologists, 
because they are not sufficiently intact to carry detailed information about the 
nature of the organisms from which they were derived (although technically they 
are nevertheless fossils). 
3.3.3  In the Precambrian, cherts, together with limestones and shales, are the 
major repositories of the fossil evidence of early life.  You can imagine a tiny, 
soft-bodied unicellular organism, perhaps no more than several micrometers in 
size, encased in soft, gelatinous, freshly precipitated amorphous silica from ocean 
waters.  Even if there is recrystallization of the chert, to a microcrystalline 

 

190

aggregate of quartz crystals, there is a non-vanishing likelihood of at least partial 
preservation of the organism.  The very oldest preserved fossils so far found are of 
this kind; see a later section. 
3.3.4  Many shales, which are derived from freshly deposited mud, are 
fossiliferous as well, because certain organisms like to live on muddy sea floors. 
Shales are often rich in trace fossils, but are less so in body fossils except when the 
chemical conditions during deposition were conducive to preservation rather than 
decomposition. The best representatives of soft-bodied organisms are from shales, 
although, frustratingly for paleontologists, instances of such preservation are very 
uncommon. Many sandstones are fossiliferous as well, although the body fossils in 
sandstones are usually relatively robust shelly materials, which are not highly 
susceptible to chemical decomposition. Conglomerates are the least fossiliferous 
of sedimentary rocks. 
 

4.  THE EARLIEST FOSSILS 
 
4.1  Introduction 
 
4.1.1  Before the middle of the twentieth century, the conventional wisdom 
among geologists (and paleontologists) was that there were no Precambrian 
fossils.  I can remember that era well, when I was an undergraduate geology major 
in the late 1950s.  My best friend, a fellow geology major, once confided to me, 
when we were students, that he would like to be the first geologist to find a 
Precambrian fossil:  what an advance in science that would be!  In fact, however, 
it was during the 1950s that a few geologists and paleontologists began to discover 
Precambrian fossils.  It was the start of a great reorientation in geological thinking.   
4.1.2  There were good reasons why Precambrian fossils, now known to be 
plentiful in the Proterozoic and present, though still scarce, even as early as the 
early Archean, were virtually unknown.  Geological work and thought were 
dominated by the geoscience “establishment” in Western Europe and the United 
States, where, basically just by geological accident, there was a major 
unconformity below the Lower Cambrian, and the rocks beneath the unconformity 
were mainly crystalline basement rocks—an unlikely venue for fossils.  Moreover, 
no one until the 1950s seemed to have thought to train the advanced microscopic 
techniques of the time on unmetamorphosed or only mildly metamorphosed 
Precambrian sedimentary rocks.  When they finally did, they found some 
spectacularly interesting microfossils. 
4.1.3  For what it’s worth, here’s a personal recollection from a now very 
senior geologist.  Once, when I was a undergrad, I went to an evening talk at the 
Harvard geology department, given by a paleobotanist named Elso Barghoorn.  He 
had been working with a colleague on microscopic examination of a Proterozoic 
chert unit, in the Canadian Shield, named the Gunflint Formation, an interbedding 
of chert and volcanics about 2000 Ma old.  Together, they discovered a rich fauna 

 

191

of microfossils, fossilized in the chert.  (Apparently, their discovery wasn’t just a 
matter of serendipity:  they reasoned that the most likely kind of rock in which to 
find fossilized Precambrian microfossils would be an unmetamorphosed old 
chert.)  It hit the audience like a bombshell.  I remember clearly that one of the 
audience, the distinguished chairman of the MIT geology department, and a 
paleontologist himself, stood up at the end of the talk and opined that this was one 
of the most seminal moments in his professional career, a milestone in the 
advancement of geological science. 
 

4.2  Archean Fossils 
 
4.2.1  The fossil record of life on Earth is now known to stretch all the way 
back to the early Archean.  In recent decades there have been many reports of 
Archean fossils:  by one count, as of 1992, 43 categories of supposed Archean 
fossils, from 30 sedimentary units, had been reported.  Of these, almost all have at 
one time or another been questioned as true fossils.  That brings up the question:  
how does one recognize a given fossil-like object in the sedimentary record as a 
genuine fossil? 
4.2.2  In the case of more recent fossils, during the Phanerozoic, almost all 
fossils are to some extent at least similar to living descendants.  Even when poorly 
preserved, such fossils are commonly recognized as true fossils.  Added to this is 
the “complexity effect”:  the more advanced and complex the body morphology of 
an organism, the more likely is a fossil representative recognized as organic, rather 
than as some kind of inorganic feature. 
4.2.3  Various kinds of objects, with globular, tubular, or other fairly regular 
shapes, are known to be inorganic, produced by abiotic processes.  Examples are 
mineralized bubble cavities, mineral dendrites (frond-like growths of mineral 
crystals on fracture surfaces), and non-biogenic aggregates of fossil organic 
matter.  When a geometrically simple fossil-like feature is found in very old 
Precambrian rocks, particularly when it is not obviously related to some 
previously authenticated early fossil, there is a natural skepticism about whether it 
is really biotic rather than the product of some abiotic process.  Added to that are 
problems associated with contamination by modern unicellular organisms during 
sample preparation. 
4.2.3  Scarcity of early Archean fossils is understandable, even if it is 
assumed that potentially fossilizable life existed at that time.  Probably you have 
already learned, in some previous course, that the early Archean continents were 
small nuclei, without broad and tectonically stable cratonal areas.  There are not 
many sedimentary successions in which to search for fossils in the first place, and 
most of them have suffered some degree of metamorphism since deposition.  
4.2.4  The most promising targets for the search for Archean fossils have 
been in the Archean terranes of southern Africa and western Australia.  A 

 

192

particularly promising find was made in the Early Archean Warrawoona Group, in 
western Australia, in the late 1980s.  That part of the Warrawoona Group is dated 
with confidence at 3540 ± 0.030 Ma.  At one particular locality, four taxa of 
filamentous microfossils were found in a chert layer.  The problem is that when 
the original discoverer and others went back to find the locality, they couldn’t find 
it again!  In a situation like this, relocation is important for authentication: 
 

Clearly, this is a tantalizing set of observations, one suggesting that it 
must be very probable that cellularly preserved evidence of Early 
Archean life exists in Warrawoona Group sediments.  Just as clearly, 
however, the available data fall short of providing the critical “hard-
nosed” proof that properly should be demanded of discoveries of this 
sort, discoveries that alter generalizations (in this case, regarding the 
oldest unequivocal evidence of life on earth) and, thus, become 
incorporated in college textbooks and even in common parlance.  The 
harsh reality is that because this discovery has not been reconfirmed, 
the results of this study, despite their presumed validity, are of limited 
value.” (Schopf, 1992, p. 28.) 

 
4.2.5  Never fear.  The author of that guardedly skeptical evaluation himself 
discovered similar fossils in that same Warrawoona Group later (albeit before he 
wrote the above quotation!).  Just to demonstrate relocatability, a person described 
as a “fledgling graduate student, who had not previously visited the outcrop and 
was armed solely with maps, notes, and field photographs from the previous ... 
collecting trip” (Schopf, 1992, p. 29) was able to relocate the locality and collect 
more material.  Below is a brief account of these extremely significant fossils:  the 
oldest undoubted fossils known. 
4.2.6  The Warrawoona fossils (Figure 9-4; Schopf, J. W., 1992, 
Paleobiology of the Archean, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C, eds., The Proterozoic 
Biosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study:  Cambridge University Press, 1348 p. 
Figure 1.5.6, p. 34) are described as filamentous, very dark brown to black 
kerogenous microfossils (kerogenous meaning that they contain kerogen, a general 
term for decomposition-resistant residual biogenic organic matter in a sedimentary 
rock).  They are composed of well-defined barrel-shaped or discoidal cells, 
arranged in the form of a long filament, and the terminal cells of the filament are 
rounded or conical.  The lengths of the filaments are some tens of micrometers 
long, and the individual cells are of the order of a few micrometers in size.  These 
seem to be colonial organisms, with each cell representing an individual 
unicellular organism.  In a few cases there is even evidence of cell division in 
progress, in the form of partial septa within an unusually long cell.  Such 
microfossils are called trichomes, the general term for chains of filamentous 
bacteria or algae.

4.2.7  That the fossils are indigenous to the deposit is not an issue here, 
because the fossils are found within small chert clasts, of sand size, in an enclosing 
layer of chert.  The interpretation is that the chert grains were derived from an 
even older chert unit and transported mechanically to the site of deposition of the 
enclosing chert. 
4.2.8  What are the phylogenetic affinities of these microfossils?  (In plainer 
English, which known organisms, if any, are they closely related to?)  They are 
very similar in morphology to Proterozoic and modern cyanobacteria.  One of the 
big questions about these oldest known organisms is whether they were oxygenic 
autotrophs or anoxygenic autotrophs.  Given that modern cyanobacteria are 
universally oxygenic photoautotrophs, that’s strong but not definitive evidence 
that these Archean cyanobacteria-like microfossils produced oxygen as well.  
We’ll never know for sure, of course. 
4.2.9  One of the uncertainties about early fossils that look much like much 
younger fossils, or like modern (“extant”) organisms is what the specialists 
whimsically called the “Volkswagen effect”:  A similar exterior morphology, but, 
hidden inside, substantial improvements in mechanisms and function. 
4.2.10  How about other Archean fossils?  Does it seem depressing to you to 
learn that there are only a few other undoubted examples?  Slightly younger 
microfossils similar to those described above, although not as clearly preserved, 
are also known from cherts of a unit of chert known as the Onverwacht Group, in 
southern Africa, dated at 3.540 ± 0.030 Ma, and from younger cherty carbonates 
(2.768 ± 0.014 Ma) from another unit in western Australia.  There are several 
reported microfossils that are currently considered “dubiofossils” (is that term 
sufficiently self-explanatory?); some of these are probably also fossils.  It seems 
reasonable to conclude that, as the search for Archean fossils continues, more 
undoubted cases will be discovered—but probably never more than a handful. 
4.2.11  In addition to the Archean fossils described or mentioned above, 
which are true body fossils, several examples of Archean stromatolites are known.  
Modern stromatolites are thought to be, at least in part, sedimentary features built 
by microorganisms, and if that is true of the Archean examples, then that adds to 
the short list of Archean fossils.  The problem is that the fossil nature of ancient 
stromatolites is inferential.  The following section tells much more about 
stromatolites. 
 
 

 

194

4.3  Stromatolites 
 
4.3.1  Here are three partly conflicting definitions of stromatolites: 
 
 “Stromatolites are organogenic, laminated calcareous rock structure, the 
origin of which is clearly related to microscopic life, which in itself must 
not be fossilized” (the original definition; Kalkowsky, 1908, translated 
from the original German) 
“Stromatolites are organosedimentary structures produced by sediment 
trapping, binding, and/or precipitation as a result of growth and metabolic 
activity of micro-organisms, principally cyanophytes” (Walter, 1976) 
“A stromatolite is an attached, laminated, lithified sedimentary growth 
structure, accretionary away from a point or limited surface of initiation” 
(Semikhatov et al., 1979) 

 
Make careful note that the first two definitions are genetic and the third is purely 
descriptive. 
4.3.2  Stromatolites are distinctive sedimentary features that are present in 
rocks as old as Archean.  They can be observed forming in subaqueous 
environments today.  Their origin, their significance for paleoenvironmental 
interpretation, and their significance for the evolution of life through geologic time 
has been controversial for a hundred years, and continues to be. 
4.3.3  The principal features of morphology of stromatolites are easy to 
describe, in a general way at least.  Stromatolites range widely in shape, from 
domes and cones with rather regular shape, to fairly regular individual cylinders, 
to irregularly branched columns.  The basic motif is that they grew upward from a 
number of points or small areas to form an array of convex-upward features of 
positive relief, separated by low areas.  Figure 9-5 (Walter, M.R., Grotzinger, J.P., 
and Schopf, J.W., 1992, Proterozoic stromatolites, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C, 
eds., The Proterozoic Biosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study:  Cambridge 
University Press, 1348 p.  (Figure 6.2.1, p. 254)) should give you an idea of 
the morphological diversity of stromatolites.  (Figure 9-5 contains much more 
morphological information than we can deal with here; it’s intended only to give 
you the “flavor” of stromatolite morphology.)  The morphological elements of 
stromatolites range in size from smaller than a decimeter to many tens of meters.  
Stromatolites are characteristically laminated, typically on a submillimeter to 
millimeter scale. 
 
 
4.3.4  The earliest students of stromatolites believed them to be actual 
organisms, and they gave the various shape categories of stromatolites names in 
the same way that all organisms, fossil and modern, are given binomial names 
according to the formal Linnaean naming system.  It is now universally 
recognized, however, that stromatolites are not individual organisms. 

 

195

4.3.5  The great debate about stromatolites centers around the role of 
microbial mats in the growth of stromatolites.  The classical view is that 
stromatolites grow by trapping and binding of fine sediment by a microbial mat at 
the water–sediment interface.  The mat consists of slimy green masses of 
cyanobacteria or algae, which thrive by photosynthesis in shallow waters. Influxes 
of fine suspended sediment, carried by waves and currents during episodes of 
strong water motions, cover the mat.  The microbes then grow upward to 
regenerate the surface of the mat.  In the process, after the organic matter of the 
buried mat is degraded, a lamina of carbonate sediment remains.  Such a process 
can be observed happening today, in just a few places where stromatolites exist. 
4.3.6  The problem with this classical interpretation is that what remains, in 
ancient stromatolites, is the carbonate sediment:  most or even all of the organic 
matter that was putatively involved in the growth of the stromatolites has long 
since been degraded.  Moreover, the texture of the fine carbonate sediment itself 
has been changed far-reachingly by later diagenesis.  In many cases, microbial 
fossils are found in association with stromatolites—but that does not, in itself, 
demonstrate that the stromatolite involved microbial mats:  the microbes may just 
have been non-essential occupants of an abiotically growing stromatolite.  It’s 
been estimated that less than one percent of all stromatolites ever described have 
microfossils associated with them. 
4.3.7  Stromatolites are known from as early as the Archean, although their 
earliest record is scanty (Figure 9-6).  They are extremely abundant in the 
Proterozoic—they are one of the most striking and characteristics aspect of that 
time in Earth history—although their abundance began to decline around 1000 
Ma, slowly at first and then catastrophically around the end of the Proterozoic.  
The most natural way to explain the decline is the emergence of organisms that 
either competed with stromatolites for space on the shallow sea floor (seaweeds 
developed around the same time) or grazed on the microbial mats (gastropods, 
a.k.a. snails, which emerged near the beginning of the Phanerozoic, or perhaps 
poorly fossilized soft-bodied earlier metazoans, which emerged near the end of the 
Proterozoic).

Figure 9-6: The distribution of known Archean stromatolite localities 

4.3.8  Where does this leave us?  I don’t know.  Just because modern 
stromatolites involve trapping and binding by microbial mats doesn’t 
automatically mean that ancient stromatolites developed in just the same way, 
although that’s the reigning paradigm.  On the other hand, it’s widely believed that 
most, if not all, ancient stromatolites give evidence of the existence of microbial 
biota.  Does the clear evolution of the nature of stromatolites reflect evolutionary 
changes in microbial populations, or gradual changes in such nonbiotic (or only 
indirectly biotic) things as ocean chemistry?  That’s still an unresolved question. 
4.3.9  Now to get back to Proterozoic microfossils.  The record of body 
fossils of microbes is far more abundant in the Proterozoic than in the Archean.   
 
5.  THE FOSSIL RECORD OF PROTEROZOIC PROKARYOTES 
 
5.1  The fossil record of Proterozoic prokaryotes is very abundant, relative to 
that of the Archean:  about three hundred species have been recognized, from a 
large number of localities.  They are found in both shales and cherts.  The fossil 
record of these prokaryotes becomes abundant and widespread by about 2100 Ma.  
The great majority of these fossil organisms “are of cyanobacterial affinity” 
(meaning that they look like modern cyanobacteria, in a general way).  In 
particular, a lot of them look like a particular group of modern cyanobacteria 
called chroococcaleans, which come in ellipsoidal to coccoidal (i.e., spheroidal) 
shapes, and are both solitary and colonial; others look like a modern group called 
 
197

nostocaleans, which are colonial in long, filamentous chains.  Figure 9-7; Schopf, 
J.W., 1992, Proterozoic prokaryotes:  affinities, geologic distribution, and 
evolutionary trends, in Schopf, J.W., and Klein, C, eds., The Proterozoic 
Biosphere; A Multidisciplinary Study: Cambridge University Press, 1348 p.  A) 
Figure 5.4.1, p. 195; B) Figure 5.4.2, p. 196, shows some representative modern 
cyanobacteria.  (No scale was given in the original figures, but I think that these 
features are of the order of ten micrometers to a few tens of micrometers in size.) 
5.2  Just to calibrate you, slightly, to the nature of these Proterozoic 
cyanobacteria-like fossils, here are a few comments about modern cyanobacteria.  
Modern cyanobacteria are unicellular oxygenic photoautotrophs (i.e., they are 
photosynthesizing plants, with chlorophyll, that produce oxygen during 
photosynthesis). (Incidentally, cyanobacteria used to be called blue-green algae, 
but they are not true algae.  Algae are eukaryotic plants, only very distantly related 
to cyanobacteria; see Figure 9-2.)   They resemble bacteria, but they differ in that 
bacteria are not photosynthesizers.  (If you go back to Figure 9-2, you can see that 
both bacteria and cyanobacteria belong to the domain of Bacteria, so they are 
relatively closely related.)  Most are colonial, forming long filaments.  They are 
extremely widespread in their distribution:  they are found in hot springs, soils, 
freshwater bodies, and the oceans. 
5.3  Not all Proterozoic prokaryotes are cyanobacteria-like.  A small 
minority of them are more like modern bacteria, and some are classed as 
“problematica” (meaning that paleontologists don’t know what to do with them).  
Whatever their taxonomic affinities, however, it seems clear that they underwent 
very little morphological evolution over extremely long periods of geologic time.  
It’s possible that their internal anatomy and physiology advanced more than their 
external morphology during that long time (the “Volkswagen effect” mentioned 
above):  there is absolutely no fossil evidence of their innards.  Given the relative 
simplicity of the internal anatomy and physiology of modern cyanobacteria, 
however, that seems unlikely.  This matter has relevance to the important question 
of whether these Proterozoic prokaryotes engaged in oxygenic photosynthesis.  
There is, of course, no direct evidence of that, but there is good circumstantial 
evidence:  the atmosphere became oxygenated in the course of the Proterozoic, 
and if these prokaryotes were the dominant organisms until late in the Proterozoic, 
it’s reasonable to assume that they were photosynthesizers.  Or were other 
organisms, which never became fossilized, responsible for the oxygenation?  
There’s a lesson in all of this:  you can see how speculative much of the thought 
about the Precambrian has to be. 
 
 
 

 

198

5.4  One of the major geological uses of fossils in the Phanerozoic is time 
correlation of strata from region to region of the Earth; more on that later, when 
we deal with the Phanerozoic.  (Another of the major geological uses of fossils is 
in the interpretation of paleoenvironments—an entirely separate matter.)  What’s 
clear from the Proterozoic record of prokaryotes is that they are virtually useless 
for correlation. 
 

PART II.  NEOPROTEROZOIC LIFE 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  The Neoproterozoic, from 1000 Ma to the beginning of the Cambrian, at 
543 Ma, was indeed an exciting time.  It saw the rise of organisms with eukaryotic 
cells, structurally and metabolically advanced, relative to organisms with 
prokaryotic cells (which had been around for well over two billion years!).  It saw 
the assembly and then breakup and dispersal of the supercontinent of Rodinia. 
1.2  In the course of the Neoproterozoic there were two major intervals of 
continental glaciation.  The latter of which was clearly the most extensive 
glaciation in Earth history.  There is good evidence of the existence of extensive 
glaciers even at low latitudes, and some believe that the Earth at that time was a 
“frozen ball”, described as the snowball Earth. 
1.3  In conjunction with these changes in climate there were great changes in 
geochemical signatures, most prominently of carbon, leading, for the first time, to 
the possibility of doing what is called chemostratigraphy (making correlations of 
strata and stratigraphic units from region to region on the basis of their 
geochemical signatures).  Study of the variations in such geochemical signatures 
through time is, of course, valuable in itself, because of the insight it can provide 
into the overall Earth environment. 
1.4  Near the end of the Proterozoic, there appeared on the scene a 
fascinating biota of large, well preserved organisms, all of them soft-bodied rather 
than with biomineralized skeletons, called the Ediacaran biota.  Were they the 
precursors of the various phyla of invertebrate animals that exploded near the 
beginning of the Cambrian, or were they a distinctive and unrelated set of 
organisms?  The matter is not settled.

2.  THE RISE OF THE EUKARYOTES 
 
2.1  Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes 
 
2.1.1  The appearance of organisms with eukaryotic cells was a major 
advance in evolution.  Eukaryotic cells are much larger than prokaryotic cells, and 
they are more advanced in structure and physiology.  Perhaps the most striking 
difference between the two kinds of cells (see background section below for more 
detail than is included in this paragraph) is that in the eukaryotic cell the genetic 
material is contained within a cell nucleus, a structure contained within the 
cytoplasm (the term used for the fluid content of the cell) but isolated from it by its 
own wall.  In prokaryotes, on the other hand, the genetic material is dispersed 
within the cytoplasm.  Moreover, eukaryotic cells contain a variety of special 
structures and bodies called organelles.  (The nucleus itself is one such organelle.)  
The most characteristic of such organelles, besides the nucleus, are mitochondria, 
in which much of the metabolic activity of cell is carried out, and, in the case of 
plants, chloroplasts, in which photosynthesis occurs. 
 
 
BACKGROUND:  PROKARYOTIC AND EUKARYOTIC CELLS 
 
1.  There are great differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.  
Within each kind, of course, there is considerable variety of structure and 
biochemistry, but a number of fundamental differences reflect the accepted idea 
that eukaryotic cells are a late (in the context of geologic time, that is) 
evolutionary advance over prokaryotic cells. don’t interpret that to mean that 
eukaryotic cells are more successful than eukaryotic ells, though:  prokaryotic 
organisms are highly successful in their diverse ecological niches—swarming all 
over us and within us throughout our lives! 
2.  Prokaryotic cells are both smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.  The 
typical size range of prokaryotic cells is 0.2 to 2 μm (micrometers, or microns) in 
diameter, whereas eukaryotic cells are much larger, typically 10–100 μm in 
diameter.  All cells, of course, have a cell wall or membrane of some kind, in order 
to isolate the contents of the cell from the outer world.  Cell walls vary greatly in 
their composition and structure.  Prokaryotic cells actually are more complicated 
than eukaryotic cells.  They consist of a chemically complex macromolecular 
network, and they are semi-rigid.   
3.  Both kinds of cell are filled with a material called the cytoplasm.  It is the 
internal matrix of the cell, in which all of the other internal constituents are 
embedded.  It consists mostly of water but contains proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, 
inorganic ions, and various low-molecular-weight organic molecules.  In 
eukaryotic cells, in contrast to prokaryotic cells, the cytoplasm is characterized by 

 

200

a complex internal structure that consists of an assemblage of very small rods and 
tubules which together constitute what is called the cytoskeleton. 
4. The fundamental differences between the two kinds of cells lie most 
distinctively in internal composition and structure.  Eukaryotic cells contain 
several kinds of specialized structures called organelles.  The most characteristic 
eukaryotic organelle is, of course, the nucleus, which contains the genetic 
information of the cell.  In prokaryotic cells, the genetic material is distributed 
throughout the cytoplasm rather than being encapsulated in the nucleus. 
5.  Among several other kinds of eukaryotic organelles, two of the 
characteristic are mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Mitochondria are spherical or 
rod-shaped bodies distributed throughout the cytoplasm.  Much of the metabolic 
activity of the cell occurs in the mitochondria, including synthesis of ATP 
(adenosine triphosphate), the compound that powers metabolic processes.  
Chloroplasts, contained in the photosynthesizing eukaryotes (algae and plants) are 
membrane-bounded bodies that contain the chlorophyll and the enzymes that are 
required for photosynthesis.  Chloroplasts are able to multiply on their own within 
the cell, by increasing in size and then dividing into two.  (There’s a theory, rather 
generally accepted nowadays, that chloroplasts were once symbiotic 
photoautotrophic prokaryotes that eventually became an actual internal part of the 
host cell!) 
 
 

2.2  How are Eukaryotes Recognized in the Fossil Record? 
 
2.2.1  There has been a longstanding problem—which continues today—
about when eukaryotic cells first evolved.  The problem is that the interior content 
of the cells of organisms are extremely evanescent, and are not preserved in 
fossils.  How, then, are we to tell whether a given Precambrian unicellular 
organism was a prokaryote or a eukaryote?  One basis is size:  eukaryotic cells are 
typically much larger than prokaryotic cells.  The problem is that this is not 
definitive, because there is an overlap in the two size ranges.  In the view of most 
paleontologists, this problem is always going to be with us. 
2.2.2  The problem is not quite as hopeless as it seems, however., inasmuch 
as the details of composition of the cell walls of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is 
significantly different.  The cell membranes of eukaryotes contain a class of 
compounds called sterols, which are complex lipids (a term used in organic 
chemistry for a wide variety of fats, oils, and waxes) not found in the cell 
membranes of the prokaryotes.  Under the right conditions of preservation (that is, 
no more than moderate diagenesis, and no metamorphism) the sterols can survive 
(as what were called organic fossils or biomarkers in the preceding chapter).  

 

201

That’s taken as excellent evidence that the cells in question are eukaryotic.  The 
problem, however, is that such evidence is regrettably scanty. 
 

2.3  The First Eukaryotes 
 
2.3.1  Remember the business about how molecular biologists can trace the 
deep evolutionary roots of the present biological world by the techniques of 
molecular phylogeny—by examining changes in RNA and DNA sequencing that 
are thought to have been occurring at an approximately constant tempo through 
geologic time?  By this line of investigation, the Eucarya first diverged from the 
Archaea far back in geologic time.  Also, the presence of organic compounds 
known to be derived from sterols in rocks as old as 2700 Ma place a minimum age 
on this evolutionary split.  (Remember that sterols are characteristic of eukaryotic 
cells but not of prokaryotic cells.)  The generally agreed-upon conclusion from 
such studies is that the eukaryotes diverged from the prokayotes very early in 
geologic history, as far back as 2700 Ma.  The problem is that such a hypothesis 
(or should we call it a speculation?) cannot be substantiated by the fossil record. 
2.3.2  The oldest fossils that can with some confidence be considered 
eukarotic are the earliest acritarchs (Figure 9-8; Vidal, G., 1994, Early ecosystems:  
Limitations imposed by the fossil record, in Bengtson, S., ed., Early Life on Earth; 
Nobel Symposium No. 84:  Columbia University Press, 630 p. (Figure 3, p. 307)).  
Acritarchs are organic-walled microfossils.  They consist of a central cavity 
enclosed by a wall of single or multiple layers of mainly organic composition.  
They have diameters from a few tens of micrometers to about two hundred 
micrometers and a generally globular shape, with either smooth walls or spine-like 
protuberances or more complex surface geometries (which paleontologists 
describe as ornamentation).  Acritarchs consist of a tough, durable cell wall made 
up of various organic compounds.  Paleontologists isolate acritarchs in large 
numbers from Precambrian shales, by laboratory techniques of hydrofluoric acid 
digestion of the inorganic part of the rock, leaving just the acritarchs! 
2.3.3  The phyletic affinities of acritarchs are not entirely clear.  Some 
resemble the walls of living dinoflagellates, which are unicellular eukaryotic 
marine plankton, especially abundant in warm seas.  Most acritarchs, however, are 
interpreted to be the remains of special coatings, called cysts, developed by algae 
(photoautotrophic unicellular eukaryotes) in the resting stage of their life cycle. 
2.3.4  Acritarch fossils are common from about 1000 Ma onwards, but they 
are known as far back as 1800–1900 Ma, from a special locality in China.  These 
earliest acritarchs are similar in general morphology to undoubted later acritarchs, 
which date back to about 1400 Ma, but there is some residual doubt about whether 
these fossils might instead be unusually large prokaryotic organisms. 
 

 

202

2.4  Evolution of the Eukaryotes 
 
2.4.1  The earliest evolution of the eukaryotes seems to have been very slow.  
During the course of the Mesoproterozoic (1600 to 1000 Ma), acritarchs became 
more abundant and more diverse in their morphology.  Also during this time, the 
first uncontroversially eukaryotic organisms made their appearance.  Some of 
these organisms seem to have been multicellular, but there’s the common problem 
of telling apart the truly multicellular organisms from colonial single-celled 
organisms, without the benefit of seeing the organisms alive. 
2.4.2  The earliest eukaryote that can with confidence be assigned to an 
extant phylum is a red alga from arctic Canada, dated at 1260 to 950 Ma.  It’s 
nowadays clear to paleontologists that such fossil records are a clear indication 
that complex multicellularity in the eukaryotes developed long before the end of 
the Proterozoic.   
2.4.3  During the Neoproterozoic, the diversity of eukaryotes, both 
unicellular (in the form mainly of acritarchs) and multicellular (mainly in the form 
of algae) became even more abundant.  There’s a rich record of such organisms 
from a number of localities around the world.  Such a significant evolutionary 
increase in diversity of organisms is known in paleontology as a radiation.) 
 

2.5  The Ediacaran Biota 
 
2.5.1  A fascinating and still mysterious assemblage of large organisms, 
called the Ediacaran biota, made their appearance in the latter part of the 
Proterozoic and survived until almost the end of the Proterozoic (in round 
numbers, they spanned the time interval from 600 Ma to 550 Ma).  They have 
been known for over fifty years, and finds at widely separated localities around the 
world continue to be made.  These are the first large organisms known.  In part, 
their diverse body plans have some resemblances to certain of the metazoan phyla 
that made their appearance near the start of the Phanerozoic, but there is 
continuing controversy over the extent to which these interesting organisms are 
the precursors of the Phanerozoic invertebrates.  As an outsider to the field, the 
best adjective I can think of to characterize the Ediacarans is spectacular. 
2.5.2  Back in the 1940s, a survey geologist named Sprigg, working for the 
geological survey in the Australian state of South Australia, while reconnoitering a 
mining property found a suite of distinctive fossils in a Neoproterozoic unit called 
the Pound Quartzite, exposed in an area called the Ediacara Hills.  (This is the 
story as I understand it.)  He published a few papers about the biota, but it wasn’t 
until a number of years passed, in the 1950s and 1960s, that the paleontological 
world at large came to realize the great significance of Spriggs’s discovery.  The 
biota he discovered, together with similar biotas in numerous localities of about 
the same age around the world, have come to be known as the Ediacaran biota.  (It 
has generally been called the Ediacaran fauna, but it’s not entirely certain that 

 

203

these were even animals, rather than plantlike organisms—see below— so it’s 
become safer to refer to them by the more general term biota.) 
 
 

BACKGROUND:  FAUNA, FLORAS, AND BIOTAS 

 
1.  You’ve probably heard the terms flora and fauna.  The term fauna is 
used to describe a particular collection of animals that lived in a given place at a 
given time.  The corresponding term flora is used for an assemblage of plants.  
There are singular nouns; the plural forms are faunas and floras.  The more general 
term, for plants and animals alive, are biota (singular) and biotas (plural). 
 
 
2.5.3  Ediacaran biotas have been found in the White Sea area of northern 
Russia, in Ukraine, in the Avalon terrane of southeastern Newfoundland, in 
England, in Namibia, and in certain other areas.  Their distribution thus seems to 
be worldwide (although keep in mind that the geography then was very different 
from now).  Although dates are not entirely well constrained, the Ediacarans seem 
to have spanned a time interval from a bit older than 600 Ma to about 550 Ma, a 
bit before the official beginning of the Cambrian.  Their large size and rather 
diverse and complex body plans suggests, however, that they must have been 
evolving, in obscurity, for a long time before that.  Or did they make a relatively 
sudden appearance, for evolutionary reasons we cannot know? 
2.5.4  A large number of different kinds of organisms are represented in the 
Ediacaran biota.  What they all have in common is that they are fossils of soft-
bodied organisms:  no biomineralization, to produce hard skeletal materials, was 
involved.  As should make good sense to you, soft-bodied organisms are 
notoriously difficult to preserve—and yet this great variety of organisms managed 
somehow to be extensively preserved.  Moreover, they are preserved not in 
shales—the diagenetic product of soft muddy bottoms of the kind that have tended 
to lead to preservation of delicate soft-bodied organisms in more recent geologic 
times—but in sandstones!  They appear as clear imprints on sandstone bedding 
planes.  Some even have an aspect of three-dimensional preservation.  It’s clear, 
from the sedimentological evidence of the enclosing deposits, that these organisms 
lived mostly in shallow ocean waters, where light was available.

Cambrian explosion, in Bengtson, S., ed., Early Life on Earth; Nobel Symposium 
No. 84:  Columbia University Press, 630 p. Figure 1, p. 390) show a variety of 
Ediacaran fossils.  Each kind has been named, in the standard binomial Linnaean 
system of genus and species, although there are long-standing controversies about 
how to recognize species among the Ediacaran fossils.  It’s the old problem of 
lumpers vs. splitters.  What is abundantly clear, however, is that there is a wide 
variety of different kinds of organisms involved. 
2.5.6  The variety and complexity of the great many kinds of Ediacaran 
fossils recognized so far continually astonishes even hardened paleontologists.  I 
can’t possibly do justice to that here.  Let me just point out one of the most 
distinctive and mysterious of them:  Dickinsoniana (represented by four similar 
species).  A picture and a sketch of Dickinsoniana are included in Figures 9-9 and 
9-10.  Here, lifted from the literature, is a basic description, in conventional 
paleontologic terminology: 
 
Dickinsoniana is oval in shape, broad and flat.  It is bilaterally 
symmetric, with a plane of symmetry bisecting the oval along its long 
axis.  In some specimens there is a raised ridge running along the 
symmetry line.  Both halves of the creature are divided into tubular 
partitions that run approximately perpendicular to the plane of 
symmetry at the point where they meet the midline.  Moving away 
from the midline, the tubular partitions become wider and curve gently 
toward the nearest end of the flat oval body.  Adjacent tubular 
partitions are fused along their lateral edges for almost all of their 
length.  At one end of the oval the tubes are long and constitute 
approximately one-third of the length of the midline of organisms.  At 
the end opposite to this one, the tubular structures are much shorter.  
There may be an inward indentation in the perimeter of the oval at this 
end.  The end of the oval with shorter tubules is presumably the end at 
which new tubular partitions are added during growth.  The margins of 
the oval may show concentric wrinkling.  (McMenamin, 1998, p. 33.) 
 
2.5.7  What is the basic nature of the Ediacaran biota?  The organisms seem 
to have been not biomineralized, but yet with much more potential for 
preservation than the soft-bodied organisms, like jellyfish, with which we are 
familiar today.  In general, they seem to have been large bag-like and sheet-like 
organisms, with highly diverse body plans but with certain common traits.  Most 
spectacularly, perhaps, is that they apparently were both mouthless and gutless, 
and without respiratory organs! 
2.5.8  If they were so simple anatomically, how did they obtain their food 
and oxygen?  That’s a problem that has concerned the experts for a long time, and 
continues to do so.  One idea is that they had such large surface area relative to 

 

205

their volume that they were able to obtain their oxygen by simple diffusion 
through their body surfaces, rather than needing to have more complicated 
oxygen-gathering organs.  Their shallow-water environment is consistent with this 
idea, and the sheetlike form of many of the Ediacaran species is suggestive of this.  
They could have obtained nutrients by diffusion of free-floating organic 
compounds in the waters in which they lived, rather than being filter feeders or 
mouthed scavengers, in the way that later metazoans obtained their food.  They 
seem not to had any complex apparatus for gathering and digestion of food. 
2.5.9  One of the ideas about the Ediacaran organisms that has gained some 
currency in recent years is that they (or at least some of them) had a symbiotic 
relationship with photoautotrophic microorganisms(single-celled plants), which 
would have supplied the organism with oxygen.  Such a phenomenon has been 
termed photosymbiosis.  But of course we don’t really know. 
2.5.10  Many, if not most, of the Ediacarans seem to have been sessile—that 
is, living in one place rather than moving around—as opposed to vagile.  Some 
might have been firmly attached to the bottom.  There is clear evidence that some 
incorporated sand into their interiors to aid in holding themselves down against 
currents.  The phrase “rock in a sock”,  describes some of the bag-like but 
anchored forms quite well!  Figure 9-11 shows one prominent paleontologist’s 
concept:  the animal had an internal skeleton of cemented sand at the base of its 
body to help anchor it to the substrate.

206

2.5.11  An enduring controversy, not yet settled to general satisfaction, is 
whether any of the Ediacaran forms are the predecessors of the later Cambrian 
invertebrate phyla that are so well known from the fossil record.  Some 
paleontologists think they can recognize in the Ediacaran biota the precursors of 
several of the Phanerozoic phyla of metazoan invertebrates.  Other paleontologists 
think that the Ediacaran organisms have no descendants.  In the later view, they 
became extinct without giving rise to the later life forms.  There are at least 
superficial similarities, especially to arthropods (the trilobites, which lived in great 
profusion on and near the sea floor during much of the Paleozoic, were 
arthropods), cnidarians (represented today by such beings as sea anemones and 
jellyfish) echinoderms, and worms, but such similarities by no means prove 
relationship.  One problem in making such connections is that paleontologists 
have be careful that they not let their so-called “search image” color their 
interpretations of what might be similar but completely unrelated beings! 
2.5.12  There is even a hypothesis out there that the Ediacaran organisms 
were very large unicellular organisms!  There’s no way of proving or disproving 
that, because the cells (cell?) are not preserved.  Certain modern animals, called 
xenophytophores, live on the deep sea floor.  They are giant unicellular organisms 
that form a skeleton of agglutinated sediment particles.  Their feeding strategy 
seems to involve both digestion of organic matter in sediment and direct 
absorption of nutrients from the seawater.  Maybe at least some of the Ediacarans 
were similarly unicellular. 
2.5.13  One prominent student of the Ediacaran biota has proposed that the 
Ediacaran organisms lived in a setting without predators.  We are used to the idea 
that, in the modern world, there are predators and there are prey.  That might not 
have been so at the time of the Ediacaran biota.  Perhaps they existed in what has 
been picturesquely called the “Garden of Ediacara”—a world in which these large 
and rather advance organisms lived without fear of being eaten!  In this view, with 
the advent of the precursors of the Phanerozoic invertebrates the defenseless 
Ediacarans slowly became extinct.  There is some supporting evidence for this 
hypothesis.  The Ediacarans show little evidence of predator damage, like missing 
pieces or healed wounds.  By Cambrian time, however, such evidence of predation 
is clear.  Maybe the world really did change. 
2.5.14  There is little, if any, overlap in the fossil record between the 
Ediacarans and the later invertebrates that are so characteristic of Cambrian and 
later times.  In terms of trace fossils, however, late in the Ediacaran interval there 
was a growing abundance of traces, presumably made by non-preservable soft-
bodied creeping and burrowing organisms.  As time went on, the trace-making 
organisms seem to have become more and more adept at living and feeding below 
the water–sediment interface, which is good evidence that they had developed 
strategies and physiology for much better locomotion on and in the sediment.  
Maybe these trace-makers were the precursors to the Phanerozoic metazoans we 
know so well.  If so, those poor brainless Ediacaran bags and sheets must have had 

 

207

no inkling that the small, evanescent trace-makers at their feet (more precisely, 
their anchoring devices) would eventually spell their doom! 
2.5.15  The organisms that constitute the Ediacaran biota lived for some tens 
of millions of years.  By that measure, and in terms of their diverse and complex 
body plans, together with their worldwide distribution, they can be counted an 
evolutionary success, even though they eventually became extinct, for whatever 
reason. 
 

PART III.  THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  If you go fossil hunting in Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks, in most 
places you don’t have to go very far to find fossiliferous rocks.  If, on the other 
hand, you try to find fossils in Precambrian rocks, you are almost certain to be 
doomed to failure.  Geologists have known from early on that the obvious fossil 
record comes in abruptly at the beginning of the Phanerozoic:  it’s one of those 
first-order facts of geology.  More accurately, however, it’s a matter of the sudden 
appearance of fossil organisms with hard skeletal materials; such organisms are 
said to be biomineralizing.  (You’ve learned already, in a previous section, that 
there is a significant, albeit not at all obvious, Precambrian fossil record.)  This 
chapter attempts to look more closely at the nature of that change in the fossil 
record. 
1.2  In the previous section you heard about the Ediacaran biotas, which 
existed for some tens of millions of years near the end of the Neoproterozoic.  The 
relationship between the Ediacaran beings and the later metazoans continues to be 
controversial.  The consensus seems to be that some, or a few (or should I say only 
a few?) of the Ediacarans are genuinely the ancestors of later metazoans.  The 
appearance of the metazoan phyla we know from the Phanerozoic was a 
spectacular event in Earth history:  it was one of the significant milestones in the 
history of life, and it happened over an astonishingly short period of geologic time.  
It’s been called the Cambrian radiation (in the biological context, a radiation is a 
development of many new life forms by rapid evolution from one or a few 
precursors during some relatively brief period of geologic time) or the Cambrian 
explosion.  The term “explosion” is, of course, hyperbole (did any other explosion 
you know of take ten to twenty million years?), but it’s seen as appropriate 
because the event happened in such a short period of time.

2.  CLASSIFYING LIVING ORGANISMS 

2.1  Since the time of the ancient Greeks, scientists have been trying to 
classify living beings according to some rational and systematic scheme.  The 
modern system of classification, in which each kind of living being is assigned a 
genus name and a species name (we are genus Homo and species sapiens) got its 
start with Linnaeus (1707–1778; his real, Swedish, name was Karl Linné).  
Linnaeus spent much of his long life going around and giving things genus and 
species name—in other words, classifying living things.  Eventually the same 
procedure was adopted for fossils as well. 
2.2  There has been a feeling on the part of certain scientists that only fields 
like physics are “real science”, and everything else is “just stamp collecting”.  In 
that view, classifying living things is just stamp collecting.  In fact, however, 
classification of living things gets right to the heart of the history of life on Earth.  
In the field of biology, classifying living things according to an accepted 
hierarchical scheme is called systematics. 
2.3  Up until the middle of the twentieth century, it was generally considered 
that all living things fell into one or two kingdoms:  animals, and plants.  Even as 
far back as the nineteenth century, however, there were biologists who were not 
comfortable with that neat two-part division, and proposed three-kingdom or four-
kingdom divisions, to take account of such things as fungi, yeasts, and bacteria, 
which don’t fit very neatly as either plants or animals.  You’ve seen that 
nowadays, with the advent of molecular phylogenetics or molecular systematics, 
mentioned in an earlier chapter, it has become natural to think in terms of three 
domains:  Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. 
2.4  An alternative way of classifying all life, past and present, which is 
based on all aspects of the biology of the beings, and not just molecular 
phylogenetics, divides all of life into two great domains, the Prokarya and the 
Eukarya, with the Eukarya in turn divided into five kingdoms:  Protoctista (algae, 
protozoa, slime molds, and certain other kinds of organisms), Animalia (animals 
without backbones, called invertebrates, and animals, like us, with backbones, 
called vertebrates), Fungi (mushrooms, molds, and yeasts), and Plantae (mosses, 
ferns, and other spore-bearing or seed-bearing plants).  (In this classification, the 
domain of the Prokarya contains only one kingdom, the Bacteria, which in turn is 
divided into two subkingdoms, the Archaea and the Eubacteria).   
2.5  These alternative classifications are not the final word:  there are other 
variants out there, and the scene will certainly change, at least in minor ways, as 
more and more of the details of life are studied, and as the fossil record is 
uncovered in more and more detail.   
 
2.6  In this section we will be concerned with the Animalia, and in 
particular, the early development of the Animalia.  If the foregoing material on 
classification of life seems a bit overwhelming to you, here’s some more for you 

 

209

order 
 
 
 

species 

to absorb:  how to classify the animals.  One way of doing it is to follow the 
standard taxonomic scheme for all living things.  (Taxonomy is the analysis of the 
characteristics of a given organism for the purpose of assigning that organism to 
a taxon, a taxon being a particular group of organisms that are related in some 
way or to some degree.)  Taxa are arranged according to a hierarchy with several 
levels, ranging from the broadest and most general (domain, then kingdom) down 
to the narrowest and most specific (the species, which is usually defined as a 
population of organisms that are able to interbreed to produce fertile offspring—
although that definition is less natural for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes). 
2.7  Here’s the conventional taxonomic hierarchy: 
 
domain 
  kingdom 
phylum 
   
class 
 
   
   
 
 
 
 
   
   
 
 
   
 
 
 
Comments: 
 
•  Each of these can be modified by the prefix super- or sub- to create even 
more levels in the hierarchy, if the need is felt to arise for a given group of 
organisms! 
•  The phylum occupies a somewhat special place in the hierarchy.  A 
phylum is a group of organisms whose ancestors became distinctive, by evolution 
from some even earlier common ancestor, at an early time in Earth history.  There 
continue to be differences of opinion, on the part of the classifying experts, on 
which phylum certain organisms belong to, and even about how many phyla there 
are!  Many phyla are represented by only a few kinds of organisms, and some 
phyla are represented by only extinct species.  By one standard classification, there 
are thirty-seven phyla of animals, only several of which are well represented in the 
fossil record. 
 
•  The only organisms for which we can study physiology as well as 
anatomy, and, very importantly, reproductive and developmental biology, are 
living organisms:  almost without exception, all we can study about fossil 
organisms is morphology, and mostly external morphology at that.  Traditionally, 

family 
 
genus 
 
 

 

210

the “taxonomic affinities” (that is, how the species should be classified in the 
taxonomic hierarchy) comes down to educated guesses about evolutionary 
lineages.  For only a surprisingly few fossil species can a clear evolutionary 
lineage be traced—largely because of the inevitable gaps in the fossil record.  In 
recent years, however, molecular phylogenetics has added enormously to 
biologists’ understanding of the evolutionary history of major groups of 
organisms. 
•  Paleontologists (and neobiologists as well) strive to make their 
classification of species into higher taxa natural, but the true, right answer is never 
really at hand; it’s a matter of judgment on the part of the practitioners.  The only 
natural basis for recognition of these so-called higher taxa is evolutionary 
lineages.  And how is one to know how evolution actually proceeded?  We have 
no time-lapse movies to tell the tale.  This is a fundamental problem not only for 
paleontologists, who never see their species in the living state, but also for 
neobiologists, who although they have living species to deal with, are still in the 
same boat as the paleontologists because they are lacking the dimension of past 
time. 

 
2.8  There are a few more things you need to hear about before we deal with 
the early evolution of animals.  The kingdom Animalia has been subdivided into 
two subkingdoms:  Subkingdom Parazoa (organisms that lack tissues organized 
into organs and that mostly have an indeterminate form) and Subkingdom 
Eumetazoa (true metazoans, with tissues organized into organs and systems of 
organs).  There are also a few kinds of organisms that do not fall naturally into 
either of these subkingdoms!  The Subkingdom Parazoa contains only two phyla:  
Placazoa (only one genus!) and Porifera (commonly known as sponges, which 
have been an important component of the world of animals since the initial 
appearance of animals).  Subkingdom Eumetazoa, on the other hand, contains 
thirty-three phyla.   
2.9  The Eumetazoa, in turn, comprise two branches:  radially symmetrical 
organisms (the Radiata) and bilaterally symmetrical organisms (the Bilateria).  
Most metazoans (including us!) are bilaterally symmetrical.  The Radiata comprise 
only two phyla:  Cnidaria (9400 species, including sea anemones, jellyfish, hydras, 
and corals), and Ctenophora (comb jellies, a different kind of jellyfish). 
2.10  Figure 9-12 (Margulis, L., and Schwartz, K.V., 1998, Five Kingdoms; 
An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth, Third Edition:  W.H. Freeman, 
Owl Books, 520 p. (p. 204)) taken from the magnificent book by Margulis and 
Schwartz on the five kingdoms of life, is the best I’ve ever found on the nature and 
phylogenetic relationships of all of the animal phyla.  I think it’s true (but I’m not 
entirely certain) that all of these phyla have a fossil record of some kind, but what 
I am sure of is that the fossil record of most of them is very scanty—because they 
are represented entirely by soft-bodied (non-biomineralizing) organisms. 

 

211

2.11  Almost all of the fossils that are commonly found in Phanerozoic 
sedimentary rocks belong to the following phyla (in alphabetical order): 
 
Brachiopoda (brachiopods) 
Bryozoa (bryozoans) 
Echinodermata (crinoids etc.) 
Cnidaria (corals) 
Mollusca (clams, snails, cephalopods) 
Porifera (sponges) 
Trilobites (classified either as extinct arthropods or as their own phylum). 
 
 

3.  THE EMERGENCE OF THE METAZOANS 
 
3.1  The Earliest Metazoans 
 
3.1.1  Which are the earliest metazoans depends on how metazoans are 
defined.  Were the Ediacarans metazoans?  There’s a difference of opinion about 
that, although the weight of opinion seems to be that, even among the Ediacaran 
species that seem not to have given rise to Phanerozoic descendants, they were 
multicellular eukaryotes, and therefore metazoans.  There is a minority opinion, 
though, that the Ediacarans were very large unicellular organisms.  Whatever is 
the case, however, it seems clear that the Ediacaran fossil record disappears well 
before the rise of the various metazoan phyla, biomineralizing or not, in the 
Cambrian.  (That in itself seems to point toward a fundamental difference between 
the Ediacarans, on the one hand, and the Phanerozoic metazoans, on the other 
hand.) 
 
 

BACKGROUND:  THE GEOLOGIC TIME SCALE 

 
1.  You should know, from your previous experience in geology, that 
geologic time has been subdivided into official, named intervals.  There is a 
relative time scale and an absolute time scale.  The relative time scale dates back 
to the 1800s; it was well worked out by the end of the nineteenth century.  With 
the advent of radioisotopic dating techniques, absolute ages in years have been 
incorporated into the geologic time scale.  The absolute time scale continues to be 
refined, as more and more reliable dates become available.  Only recently, for 
example, the beginning of the Cambrian was revised from 570 Ma to 543 Ma!

(And that had great implications for the timing of the Cambrian explosion; some 
details later).   
2.  You need to be exposed to the names of the various subdivisions of 
Phanerozoic time.  There is a hierarchy of geologic time units, order of decreasing 
scale: 
 
  eon 
   
   
   
   
 
 (The brackets indicate units that are not in common use.)  The reason why there 
are two sets of terms is that stratigraphers differentiate between time units (also 
called chronologic units), on the one hand, and time-stratigraphic units (also called 
chronostratigraphic units), on the other hand.  The time-stratigraphic units consist 
of the rocks themselves:  all the rocks (everywhere in the world!) that were 
deposited during the given corresponding time interval.  You need to understand 
the difference, for example, between the Cambrian Period ( a defined period of 
time) and the Cambrian System (rocks deposited during the Cambrian Period). 
3.  Figure 9-13 shows just one part of the official time scale, to introduce you
to the terms that are relevant to the Cambrian explosion.  The term Vendian is used
         for the final interval of the Neoproterozoic.  The stage and substage names for the
                  Lower Cambrian are taken from Russian localities, where the sections are fairly 
                           complete and very well exposed.

3.1.2  The fossil record of the metazoans extends back for about forty 
 
million years before the Cambrian explosion, which itself spans the age range 
from about 530 Ma to about 515 Ma (in very round and flexible numbers).  The 
big problem is that that fossil record of metazoans does not contain sequences of 
fossils that allow tracing the morphological evolution that led eventually to the 
Cambrian phyla.  This long period of obscure and controversial metazoan 
evolution has been called the prelude to the Cambrian explosion. 
3.1.3  It was noted in an earlier chapter that, at a certain point in the history 
of the Ediacarans, trace fossils made their appearance alongside the Ediacarans.  
At first these traces were very simple:  millimeter-wide tracks on the sediment 
surface.  As time went on, the traces become more sophisticated, in the sense that 
burrowing, in addition to surface tracks, appeared.  Presumably, it takes a more 
advanced soft-bodied organism to burrow through the sediment rather than just 
creeping across the surface of the sediment.  The abundance and complexity of the 
traces increased up into the earliest Cambrian, even after the disappearance (or 
almost so) of the fossil record of the Ediacarans.  The official base of the 
Cambrian is now defined on the basis of the appearance of one particularly 
 
214

characteristic burrowing trace fossil, called Trepnichnus pedum, an arcuate 
horizontal burrow from which branches rise to probe toward the sediment surface. 
 

3.2  The Earliest Biomineralizing Metazoans 
 
3.2.1  The prelude to the Cambrian explosion was not entirely without a 
fossil record of biomineralizing organisms.  A few such fossil species have been 
discovered in recent years.  Here’s a brief account of some of them (only genus 
names are shown): 
 
Cloudina:  First found in Namibia and then later at several localities around 
the world, Cloudina coexisted with some of the Ediacarans in latest 
Neoproterozoic carbonate rocks.  It consists of curved, tubular, multilayered 
shells.  The overall appearance is that of a fitted stack of paper or plastic drinking 
cups. 
 
Namacalathus:  Goblet-shaped, with a stem and an upward-flaring cup, a 
few millimeters to 2.5 cm in diameter, open at the top and with sides perforated 
with several side holes.  The image in Figure 9-15; McMenamin, M.A.S., and 
Schulte McMenamin, D.L., 1990, The Emergence of Animals; The Cambrian 
Breakthrough:  Columbia University Press,  p. 48.  B:  Grotzinger et al. 2000; was 
reconstructed by computer from serial sections through a complete fossil 
specimen. 
 
Namapoikia:  A fully biomineralized organism, with a complex and robust 
skeleton, up to 1 m in width and up to 0.25 m in height.  The skeleton consists of 
multiple continuously connected tubules a few millimeters in diameter. It 
encrusted perpendicular to the walls of vertical synsedimentary fissure in 
microbial reefs.  It probably represents a cnidarian or a poriferan. 
 

3.3  The Explosion 
 
3.3.1  The term Cambrian explosion (less picturesquely, but more 
accurately, the Cambrian radiation) is used for a brief period of geologic time 
when many metazoan phyla first appear in the fossil record.  The timing is not 
entirely pinned down, but it seems clear that the explosion spans the time interval 
from the middle of the Lower Cambrian, 530 to 520 Ma, and lasting until about 
515 Ma.  It was during this geologically very brief time period, of the order of ten 
million years, when organisms with hard and durable skeletal material became 
common.  The recent revision of the time of the beginning of the Cambrian, from 
570 Ma to 543 Ma, served to intensify the problem of the Cambrian explosion:  it 
made the permissible time interval much shorter, thus creating an even greater 
problem for paleobiologists (and, I suppose, providing welcome fuel for the 

 

215

creationists!).  In the context of geologic time, the biomineralizing organisms 
seem to have exploded into existence.  (You saw in an earlier section that there 
were biomineralizing organisms prior to the great explosion, but they were very 
few and very uncommon.) 
3.3.2  Figure 9-16, which shows the timing of the appearance of phyla in the 
fossil record, reveals the Cambrian explosion well.  As noted earlier, the Cnidaria 
and the Porifera are generally considered to have made their appearance near the 
end of the Neoproterozoic, in connection with the Ediacaran biota.  Several other 
animal phyla made their earliest appearance during the period called the Cambrian 
explosion, almost simultaneously in the context of geologic time.  (Many other 
animal phyla appear in the fossil record much later.)  The explosion first manifests 
itself at the base of the Tommotian Stage, when the earliest biomineralizing 
brachiopods and molluscs appear in the fossil record.  In the succeeding 
Atdabanian Stage, body fossils of echinoderms and arthropods make their 
appearance.

Figure 9-16: The earliest appearance of the various animal phyla in the fossil record 
3.3.3  Here’s an important point:  the Cambrian explosion involved more 
than the appearance of biomineralizing animals.  There are a precious and 
valuable few localities where soft-bodied animals of Atdabanian age are 
preserved, most notably in Yunnan, in China.  That suggests that non-
biomineralizing animals underwent an evolutionary radiation as well as the 
 
216

biomineralizing animals.  One could argue that earlier soft-bodied faunas existed 
but have not been found, or existed but are now obliterated by erosion or 
metamorphism.  But in the explosion interval, along with the expansion in types of 
body fossils, trace fossils also become larger and more varied, implying that soft-
bodied animals participated in the explosion as well. 
 

3.4  The Burgess Shale 
 
3.4.1  We can’t leave the topic of the Cambrian explosion without 
considering the fauna of the Burgess Shale.  A good case can be made that the 
Burgess Shale locality is the most famous of all fossil localities.  Discovered by 
the paleontologist Charles D. Walcott near the beginning of the twentieth century 
(more precisely, on Tuesday, 31 August 1909!) in British Columbia, on the slope 
of the long ridge between Mount Wapta and Mount Field, a few miles north of the 
town of Field (and now protected by law from casual visitors), the Burgess Shale 
locality contains a spectacular assemblage of fossils of soft-bodied organisms, 
many of them known from nowhere else, along with biomineralized organisms as 
well.  It provides a deeply informative look into the post-explosion world of the 
Cambrian.  Books have been written just about the Burgess Shale fauna. 
3.4.2  The Burgess Shale soft-bodied fossils are preserved as flattened 
imprints along the bedding planes of the shale.  Great effort has gone into 
reconstructing the original three-dimensional bodies on the basis of the imprints.  
It’s an endeavor not without uncertainties, but the results are spectacular.  Figure

242 p. (Figure 19, p. 55); just gives you the flavor of these reconstructions.  To do 
justice to them, you need to see photos of the imprints themselves; if you are 
interested, go to the books by Whittington and by Conway Morris, listed at the end 
of the chapter. 
3.4.3  The great significance of the Burgess Shale fauna is that it shows how 
varied the Cambrian animal faunas must have been.  It is universally assumed that 
the soft-bodied animals represented in the Burgess Shale fauna were ubiquitous in 
the Cambrian (and presumably later in the Phanerozoic as well) but were only 
very seldom preserved—under only just the right conditions for preservation.  Just 
imagine how impoverished our knowledge of Cambrian life would have been if 
the Burgess Shale fauna (and two other similar finds, from somewhat earlier in the 
Cambrian, and discovered only in recent years—one in Greenland and the other in 
China) had not been found.

4.  WHY THE EXPLOSION? 
 
4.1  There had to have been a reason why the Cambrian explosion happened 
when it did and how it did.  There are two rather different ways of looking at the 
cause, or causes, of the explosion.  In one view, which seems not to be as widely 
held as the other, it was a consequence of complex evolutionary interactions 
among the organisms themselves, independently of any outside environmental 
influences.  You might think of this as a “biological systems” approach.  In the 
other view, more common, some aspect or aspects of the late Neoproterozoic and 
early Cambrian environment caused, or led to, or triggered, the explosion. 
4.2  I’m using the term “environment” here in a very broad sense:  such 
things as climate, ocean chemistry, atmospheric composition, sea level, 
sedimentation, plate tectonics, continental configuration—and the changes, 
through time, of all such environmental factors.  Also, might there have been just 
one particular change in one particular thing that triggered the explosion?  (That’s 
been termed the “assassin’s bullet” hypothesis.)  Or must we appeal to a 
combination of environmental effects, working together in some perhaps very 
complex way?  A variation on the “trigger” metaphor is the “fuse” metaphor:  
there might have been some event that led to an evolutionary sequence that 
culminated in the explosion. 
4.3  The most widely cited idea about the cause of the appearance of 
metazoans has to do with the oxygen content of the atmosphere.  The metazoan 
phyla that emerged early in the Cambrian must have needed levels of atmospheric 
oxygen not much lower than at present.  If levels were too low before the late 
Neoproterozoic, then evolution could not have led to the metazoans at that time.  
There is indeed some independent evidence that the oxygenation of the 
atmosphere took place in two major steps, one far back in the Proterozoic, in 
conjunction with the deposition of iron formation, and the other late in the 
Proterozoic. 
4.4  You saw in the preceding chapter that the late Neoproterozoic was a 
time of spectacular variability in climate (for whatever reason), with snowball-
Earth (or at least “icehouse”) conditions alternating with much warmer periods.  It 
is natural to think that the synchrony of climate change and metazoan evolution 
was not fortuitous.  Might these severe environmental changes have been the fuse 
for the rapid evolution of metazoans?  It is universally accepted in evolutionary 
biology that environmental stress tends to result in an increased pace of evolution:  
populations become small, and they either evolve rapidly to accommodate to the 
changing environmental conditions or the species they represent becomes extinct. 
4.5  Another attractive idea has to do with the occurrence of what might be 
called the great Cambrian transgression.  (Recall that the term transgression, or 
marine transgression, is used for a shift of the ocean shoreline in the direction of 
the land.  Transgression can be worldwide, caused by sea-level rise, or local, 
caused by subsidence of the lithosphere in the local area.  Regressions are the 

 

218

opposite of transgressions.)  One of the first-order facts of the early Phanerozoic is 
that there was a slow but large worldwide rise in sea level in the course of the 
Cambrian and into the Ordovician.  At the height of the transgression, much of the 
continent of North America, for example, was covered by shallow seas, thousands 
of kilometers across and no more than a few hundreds of meters deep.  Such seas, 
called epeiric seas or epicontinental seas, are not well understood, because there 
are no good examples in today’s world of relatively low sea level (more details in 
the next chapter).  The development of such epeiric seas, with their various 
shallow marine environments, for the first time (in the latter part of geologic time, 
at least), might have been the trigger for the evolutionary radiation of the 
metazoans. 
 

PART IV.  PHANEROZOIC LIFE 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  All geoscientists would agree that life on Earth has interacted in 
fundamental ways with the strictly physicochemical aspects of the planet.  You 
have seen good examples of that idea already in this course:  for example, how 
photosynthesizing organisms have influenced the history of oxygenation of the 
atmosphere, as well as the broad outlines of climate by way of the role of carbon 
dioxide in the greenhouse effect.  The extreme position in that regard is the Gaia 
hypothesis:  that Earth and life have evolved through time in close association with 
one another, each regulating the other.  Most geoscientists seem not to be willing 
to go quite that far, but it’s clear that we can’t consider the history of the Earth’s 
physical and chemical environment without taking into account the evolution of 
life, and vice versa. 
1.2  It’s not going to be possible to consider, in this section, many of the 
fascinating twists and turns of the history of life on Earth, which led, in one way 
or another, to the appearance of the enormous diversity of life forms we observe 
today.  Questions along this line come easily to our minds:  How did birds develop 
flight?  Where did the dinosaurs come from, and what was the cause of their 
demise?  What caused primates to become distinct from other mammals?  To do 
justice to such matters, a full course in the history of life on Earth is needed!  (I 
would like to take such a course myself.) 
1.3  Here, after some comments on the nature of the fossil record, I’ll try to 
deal with the nature of evolution itself, to give you the flavor of how 
paleobiologists view the history of life, and then deal specifically with the history 
of what are called mass extinctions:  specific, and catastrophic, times in Earth 
history when, for whatever reason or reasons (and the nature of those reasons is 
controversial) large percentages of all living species became extinct, opening the 
way for explosive radiations of new life forms to fill the vacated niches.  In the 

 

219

process, we’ll look at the nature of asteroid impacts, which are implicated in at 
least some of the mass extinctions. 
 

2.  THE NATURE OF THE FOSSIL RECORD 
 
2.1  Generations of paleontologists have agonized over the incompleteness 
of the fossil record.  Some even admit to a kind of inferiority complex, arising 
from the necessity of having to lead their professional lives working on what they 
perceive to be an inadequate database.  Here’s a telling quotation along these lines: 
 

Paleontologists often give the impression that they don’t believe in 
their own subject and the data that fossils provide.  Indeed, 
paleontology suffers from several misperceptions which, because 
they are often propounded by paleontologists themselves, make us 
our own worst enemies.  (S.K. Donovan and C.R.C. Paul, 1998, p. 
1.) 

 
2.2  That the fossil record is incomplete is beyond any doubt:  we can’t 
possibly have a census of all of the organisms that have ever lived.  That’s not 
what worries paleontologists, though:  what’s troublesome is that it’s thought that 
we are not even close to having a census of all of the species that have ever 
existed.  (Neobiologists generally agree that we’re not even close to having a 
complete census of existing species!) 
2.3  The record of marine biomineralizing species is generally thought to be 
fairly good; the problem lies more with species of soft-bodied organisms, and with 
species of organisms that lived on land, where environments conducive to 
preservation are much less common than in the ocean.  Another way of putting 
this is that the fossil record is strongly biased in favor of skeletalized species. 
2.4  Various attempts have been made over the years to assess the degree of 
completeness of the fossil record.  Many methods have been proposed.  Here are 
some general considerations, which may not be wildly wrong.  Two of the 
approaches that have been taken, presumably complementary, are as follows.  
First, ,we know that something like ten percent of all extant species are 
skeletalized and therefore highly likely to be represented in the fossil record.  If 
we assume that the proportions of skeletalized and nonskeletalized species have 
been about the same through Phanerozoic time, then, given that almost none of the 
nonskeletalized species have been preserved, the fossil record is about ten percent 
complete.  Second, in the Burgess Shale fauna, again something like ten percent 
(in very round numbers) of the species represented are skeletalized.  If the Burgess 
Shale fauna is at all typical of later times in the Phanerozoic, in terms of the 
proportions of skeletalized vs. nonskeletalized forms, then, again, the fossil record 
is about ten percent complete.  The number “ten” here is of course extremely 
elastic—but the foregoing line of reasoning suggests that the true figure is much 

 

220

greater than just, say, one percent, but much less than, say, half.  Maybe that gives 
us the flavor of the matter. 
2.5  Paleontologists make a distinction between the completeness of the 
fossil record and the adequacy of the fossil record.  Those two concepts are related 
but different:  the record can be incomplete but still adequate for the pursuit of 
paleontological problems, as well as for addressing broader questions in geology 
and biology. 
2.6  Here’s just one example of how the incompleteness of the fossil record 
has affected the thinking of paleontologists about the adequacy of the record.  Do 
species evolve along gradual trends, or do they develop abruptly (in the context of 
geologic time, that is) after long periods of stasis?  The fossil record is almost 
always so full of “holes” that the matter can seldom be decided on the basis of the 
fossil record.  The number of examples of gradual evolutionary trends is 
amazingly small; according to one authority, they can be counted on the fingers of 
two hands.  Paleontologists have seemed to assume, tacitly, that gradual trends are 
the norm but just can’t be identified owing to the inadequacy of the record.  But 
maybe such trends are the exception rather than the rule. 
 

3.  EVOLUTION AND SPECIATION 
 
3.1  The term species has appeared often so far in this chapter, without being 
defined.  What is a species?  The species is the fundamental taxonomic unit, in 
both paleobiology and neobiology.  Roughly speaking, a species is one particular 
kind of organism.  More technically, a species could be defined as a population of 
organisms capable of fertile interbreeding.  The concept of species is thus natural, 
not arbitrary. 
3.2  Of course, there is some degree of variability, in morphology and 
physiology, from organism to organism within a species.  Variation of this kind is 
the stuff of natural selection—the process by which species change by preferential 
survival of organisms with certain features within a species. 
3.3  All “non-creationists”, scientists and nonscientists alike, are convinced 
that the living world has developed by a process of evolution.  Almost all 
scientists accept that as fact.  What has been controversial, and about which debate 
continues, is the nature of the processes by which evolution takes place—although 
by now, since the time of the neo-Darwinian “second revolution” in the mid-
twentieth century, there has been general agreement about the broad aspects of 
evolution.  Incidentally, there were evolutionists around before Darwin:  they just 
didn’t have the right ideas.  It was Darwin, with his theory of evolution by natural 
selection, that put the study of evolution on its modern footing. 
3.4  Darwin described his theory as evolution by natural selection.  The basic 
idea is that the members of any species of animals are not identical:  they vary in 

 

221

their characteristics, in numerous ways, as a reflection of their genetic material.  
Darwin knew this well, in part because of his close familiarity with animal 
breeding.  It was actually a rather revolutionary concept in science:  before his 
time, it was generally assumed that the members of a species were all identical.   
3.5  Variation is the essential prerequisite for evolution.  All house sparrows 
look just about alike to us (if we look at all that are the same sex and the same 
age), but if we were to measure things like beak shape we would find small but 
significant differences.  Such variation among the members of a species means 
that they differ, if only slightly, from individual to individual in their success in 
survival and reproduction.  The overall characteristics of the species tends to drift 
with time, in light of this differential success in reproduction. 
3.6  The origin of the variation is mutation, the process by which genes are 
altered, occasionally, as the DNA of the individual replicates itself.  Think of these 
mutations as just “mistakes of copying”.  Most mutations are deleterious to 
survival, but now and then a beneficial mutation arises, which offers the organism 
a greater chance of survival and reproductive success.  As such a beneficial 
mutation spreads through the population, the species has undergone change.  Of 
course, Darwin knew nothing about genetics, let alone nucleic acids and DNA—
but he realized the significance of mutations for evolution by natural selection. 
3.7  Evolution of a species by natural selection is especially rapid when the 
population is small and environmental conditions are changing rapidly.  Under 
those conditions, only the very fittest individuals survive to reproduce, and any 
variations that have adaptive value are strongly selected and then can spread 
rapidly through the small breeding population.  If environmental stresses are so 
great that the evolutionary response of the population of the species can’t keep up, 
however, the species becomes extinct. 
3.8  If you would like to read a spectacular account of a long-term study of 
evolution by natural selection in action, I recommend The Beak of the Finch, a 
recent book about a decades-long research program on the finches of a very small 
island in the Galápagos, by Weiner; see the reading list at the end of the chapter. 
3.9  The development of new species from old species is called speciation.  
The nature and processes of speciation have been the topic of heated debate 
among neobiologists and paleobiologists alike.  In a somewhat oversimplified 
view, there are two ways new species can evolve.  The older species can change 
gradually (or not so gradually) into a new species, as implied in the preceding 
paragraph.  If the change is gradual, it might be very difficult to draw the line 
between the two species, even though the accumulated changes necessitate the 
recognition of two distinct species.  (There’s the hidden problem here, which 
arises from the accepted definition of a species as a population of organisms that 
can interbreed to produce fertile offspring:  if the populations in question are 
widely separated in time, there’s no way of testing the new population against the 
definition!) 

 

222

3.10  Drawing the line between the two species is not as difficult in practice 
as it might seem, however, because of the spottiness of the fossil record.  The 
changes in species have usually been fast enough that the holes in the record 
prevent identification of the intermediate forms.  This gets us back to the statement 
earlier in this section that documented instances of trends of gradual evolution are 
rare. 

3.11  There’s another route of speciation, having to do with geographic (or, 
more generally, environmental) isolation.  The populations of given species 
ordinarily occupy some rather large geographic range.  To the extent that the 
individuals of the population do not roam very far from their places of birth (or, 
more precisely, the range of mobility of the individual is much smaller than the 
overall range of the species), then there is the possibility that parts of the overall 
population that are located in different geographic areas might evolve along 
different paths.  In such a way, a single species might evolve into two 
contemporary species by geographic isolation.  This is especially likely when a 
small part of a population becomes isolated from the rest of the population by 
some new environmental barrier (for example, a change in climate or in sea level). 
3.12  Here is a final, but significant, note.  It is good to keep in mind that 
paleontologists have no way of verifying that a given species they choose to 
“erect” was really a species!  What paleontologists do in practice is to collect a 
small or large number of individual specimens which are closely similar among 
themselves in morphology but which are different in morphology from other 
related organisms, and then assume that that group of fossils represents what was 
once a species in the neobiological sense of being an interbreeding population.  
They are probably right, usually, but clearly there is no way of ever knowing. 
 

4.  CLADISTICS 
 
4.1  You heard in an earlier section about taxa, taxonomy, and systematics.  
Taxonomists place species into genera, and genera into families, etc., in 
accordance with their best guesses about the evolutionary history of the species.  
Taxonomic classification changes as understanding of the evolutionary picture 
grows.  Sometimes, for example, a species is removed from one genus and put into 
another.  It’s not that the species has changed—it’s just that the understanding of 
the evolutionary history of that species has changed. 
4.2  There’s another, and less formal, way of classifying groups of 
organisms, which is different from the formal taxonomy of species, genera, etc., 
but complementary to it.  It’s called cladistics.  Cladistics is an attempt to trace 
phylogeny—the evolutionary pathways by which given species appeared.  In 
cladistics, species are organized into what are called clades.  A clade is a group of 
species that all descended from a common ancestor. 

 

223

4.3  For an analogy to cladistics, think in terms of a branching tree.  Such a 
tree has a single trunk, which branches into a number of main limbs.  Each limb 
then branches into smaller limbs, and so on, until the tips of the twigs are reached.  
The trunk of the tree represents the common ancestor of all of the species 
represented by all of the terminal twigs.  Two twigs that branch from the same 
larger twig represent a clade (a clade with only two species in it), because they 
have the same common ancestor.  Every clade began with a single branching event 
that produced the ancestor species of the clade.  (The only exception to that last 
statement is the clade that consists of all the species through all of geologic time, 
on the assumption that they all had one common ancestor.) 
4.4  The idea behind cladistics is to try to recognize groups of species that 
share a set of characters that evolved as new features in a common ancestor and 
then passed to all of the descendant species.  The evolutionary state that existed 
before those new characters evolved is called the primitive state, and the 
evolutionary state that exited after the new characters evolved is called the derived 
state.  Here’s an example, to make that real to you.  All living mammals have fur, 
but no other living organisms do.  The natural assumption is that fur was inherited 
from a common ancestor of all living mammals.  That makes mammals a clade.  
That hypothesis is strengthened by the observations that all living mammals are 
warm-blooded and all of them suckle their young. 
4.5  Diagrams that express the paleontologist’s concept of a clade (that is, 
the phylogenetic history of all the species of the clade) is called a cladogram.  
Figure 9-18 shows an example of a cladogram that shows the evolutionary history 
of three species that constitute a clade.  Cladograms always show the species of 
the clade along the upper edge of the diagram.  There are three possible 
evolutionary lineages that could account for the three species of the clade.  In each 
of the versions, the development of the novel feature that separates the primitive 
state from the derived state is at a qualitatively different point in the arrangement.  
In the upper diagram, species B and C form a smaller clade in themselves; in the 
middle diagram, species A and B form the smaller clade, and in the lower 
diagram, species A and C form the smaller clade.  How would it be known which 
is the appropriate version?  By study of the sharing of derived characters.

evolutionary relationships of three species that constitute a clade 

4.6  To make things more real to you, Figure 9-19 is a cladogram that deals 
with five major classes of animals (formally recognized classes—as taxa, that is).  
In this hypothesis (and that’s what it represents, a hypothesis, subject to 
modification if necessary), fishes are the ancestors not just of living fishes but also 
of living amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.  Note the particular topology 
of the cladogram:  tetrapods evolved from fishes by the acquisition of a particular 
derived character (four legs), then reptiles and amphibians developed from a 
common tetrapod ancestor, and so on. 
4.7  The cladistic approach leads to some startling insights.  For example, 
you can see from the cladogram in Figure 9-19 that humans are derived fishes, 
derived amphibians, and derived reptiles, all at the same time.  Even more 
startlingly, the case can be made that humans are, in a real sense, derived 
cyanobacteria!  Here’s a little poem that expresses the idea: 
 
The human species has thrived 
In the short time since we arrived 
But the cladist affirms 
That we are only worms 
Even though we are somewhat derived.

5.  IMPACTS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS WITH THE EARTH 
 
5.1 This section deals with the nature of impact events, what’s known about 
their frequency through geologic time, and the implications for the history of life 
on Earth.  Meteorites are at the small end of the range of extraterrestrial bodies 
that make impact with the Earth.  Over the history of the Earth, such 
extraterrestrial bodies have ranged in size all the way up to the infamous Mars-size 
impactor that is now thought to have resulted in the formation of the Moon.  That 
was a uniquely large event, but impacts by bodies hundreds of kilometers in 
diameter are known during later geologic history, even into the Phanerozoic. 
5.2  What happens when a large, fast-moving impactor strikes the surface of 
a rocky planet like the Earth?  There’s an important distinction based on the 
closing speed of the impactor.  If the closing speed is greater than the speed of 
sound (that is, the speed of compressive elastic waves, of the kind that are 
generated by earthquakes), then strong shock waves are set up (analogous to the 
sonic boom you hear from an airplane traveling at greater than the speed of sound 
in air), which destroy both the impactor and the target material.  Such impacts are 
said to be supersonic.  They are the most destructive. 
5.3  Think in terms of the energy carried by the impactor, versus the energy 
required to do damage to the impactee.  Here’s some material, slightly 
paraphrased, from Lewis (1997, p. 397), for a hundred-meter asteroid hitting the 
surface at 20 km/s.  (Note:  an erg is the cgs unit of work and energy.  It’s equal, to 
one dyne-centimeter.  To make that more familiar, we can convert it to foot-
pounds:  one dyne-centimeter is equal to about 7.5 x 10-8 foot-pounds.  A foot-
pound is the work you do when you lift a one-pound weight upward for a vertical 
distance of one foot.  According to my back-of-the-envelope computations, a 
dyne-centimeter is about the work you would do if you jack up a twenty-five-cent 
piece by a few thousandths of an inch!) 

 

226

 

The kinetic energy density [the kinetic energy per unit mass] of the 
impactor is 2 x 1012 erg/g.  The energy required to crush a typical rock 
is a little above 108 erg/g.  To heat it to its melting point requires about 
1010 erg/g, and to vaporize it requires less than 1011 erg/g.  Thus the 
impactor carries enough kinetic energy not only to vaporize itself 
completely, but also to crush up to roughly 104 times its own mass of 
target rock, melt roughly one hundred times its own mass, or vaporize 
about ten times its own mass.  Alternatively, it carries enough kinetic 
energy to accelerate a hundred times its own mass to a speed of 0.1 
times its impact speed.  In reality, an impact does all of these things to 
some degree and divides its energy over all these possible outcomes.  
Thus an impactor may crush one thousand times its own mass of rock, 
melt ten times it mass, vaporize a few times its own mass, and eject 
one hundred times its mass at speeds of tens to hundreds of meters per 
second and still give off a substantial amount of energy as seismic 
waves and radiation from the fireball. 

 
5.4  Figure 9-20; Lewis, J.S., 1997, Physics and Chemistry of the Solar 
System:  Academic Press, 591 p.  (Figure IX.15, p. 398); shows the progression of 
a typical supersonic cratering event.  Here, again paraphrased from Lewis (1997), 
is a description of the events shown: 
 

The impactor is crushed and flattened by the enormous transient 
pressures caused by its deceleration, pushing a cavity into the target.  
The region of the target closest to the projectile is heated so strongly 
that, as the peak shock is unloaded by the expansion of the debris from 
the explosion, it vaporizes.  A much larger volume, usually with several 
times the radius of the vaporized zone, is thoroughly crushed and 
partially melted.  Since the effective center of the explosion is well 
below the surface of the target, the explosion blasts out a substantial 
mass of rim material in a cone above the explosion site. 
5.5  The environmental consequences of a major impact are not fully 
understood.  (Humankind has never experienced one—yet!)  Enormous quantities 
of mineral dust would be injected into the atmosphere, all the way up into the 
stratosphere, from which it would take months to years to clear by settling.  
During that time, sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface would be reduced to only a 
small percentage of normal.  To the extent that either the impactor or the target 
area contain sulfur-bearing materials, there would be a high concentration of 
sulfur dioxide particles in the atmosphere, causing acid rain far more intense than 
what we now experience from burning of fossil fuels.  The heat from the fireball, 
which itself might last only minutes, might be sufficient to set wildfires of even 
subcontinental or greater size, putting more smoke and dust into the atmosphere.  
An impact in the ocean would generate seismic sea waves of gigantic proportions.  

 

227

Such effects have serious albeit uncertain consequences for the survival of life on 
Earth. 
5.6  What is the nature of the bodies that have made impact with the Earth?  
It’s common to hear that they are asteroids, which, remember, are rocky bodies 
with “ordinary” orbits (that is, nearly circular, and in the general plane of the solar 
system), but it’s now believed that most of the larger ones are comets, which have 
highly irregular orbits and range in distance from the Sun to far beyond the limits 
of what we think of as the solar system.  It’s common to hear that comets are big 
iceballs, but keep in mind that they have rocky cores, and it’s those rocky cores 
that would do the damage upon impact.  Another thing about comets is that, 
because of their less regular orbits, their closing speeds can be much greater than 
the typical closing speeds of asteroids. 
5.7  What do we know about the record of impacts?  There was a period, 
very early in Earth history but after the Earth had become largely accreted, called 
the late heavy bombardment.  For long after that, however, and into recent 
geologic time, there has been a continuing albeit occasional bombardment of 
objects both large and small.  There are some who think they detect an actual 
increase in frequency of impacts in latest geologic time, in the most recent 
hundred million years or so, but that is a controversial idea. 
5.8  The number of well-documented large impacts is increasing steadily, as 
geologic work on all of the continents continues.  In recent years, especially after 
the advent of the theory of a really big impact that marked the Cretaceous–Tertiary 
boundary, the discovery of impact structures has accelerated.  The known record is 
getting better and better, but there will always be the problem that the processes of 
weathering, erosion, and sediment deposition on the active surface of the earth 
tend to blur and finally obliterate the record of impacts, thus biasing the record in 
two ways:  minimizing the frequency of earlier impacts, and skewing the record of 
early impacts toward the larger events (which are less susceptible to obliteration). 
 
5.9  Figure 9-21 gives you some data on known large impacts through 
geologic time.  Part A gives data on impact structures in North America, and part 
B gives data for the entire world.  There have been some really big ones.

5.10  Even small events would have serious regional consequences, 
depending of course on location.  The Tunguska event, which occurred on 30 June 
1908 (it was an explosion of an extraterrestrial body, of size less than a hundred 
meters, in the atmosphere, before the body had a chance to make impact with the 
surface), flattened trees over an area of two thousand square kilometers in Siberia.  
Can you imagine the devastation that would have ensued if that event had 
happened over the eastern U.S., western Europe, or heavily populated areas in 
India or China?  From the graph, you can see that the frequency of such an event 
per year is about 10-2, meaning that the average recurrence interval is only of the 
 
order of a hundred years.  We shouldn’t be holding our breath, but the likelihood 
 
of another event of that kind within the lifetimes of some of you in the class is 
quite high.

6.  MASS EXTINCTIONS 
 
6.1  The evolution of life on Earth has been fraught with setbacks.  At 
various times in the geologic past, unusually large numbers of species have 
become extinct over short periods of geologic time.  Such events have been 
termed mass extinctions.  Because skeletalized marine invertebrates have a record 
that’s far better than that of soft-bodied marine organisms, or of terrestrial 
organisms in general, the nature of mass extinctions has been based largely on 
them. 
6.2  There is no doubt that mass extinctions have occurred.  The greatest 
mass extinction of all time (no, it’s not the one at the end of the Cretaceous, which 
is alleged to have involved the demise of the dinosaurs) was at the end of the 
Permian:  more than ninety percent of all extant species became extinct!  The 
controversy has revolved around the cause (or causes) of the extinctions. 
6.3  Mainly, three possible causes have been invoked for mass extinctions: 
 
•  impacts of large extraterrestrial bodies 
•  outpourings of continental flood basalts 
•  sea-level falls leading to major regressions 
 
It seems to make sense that large impacts might lead to widespread, catastrophic 
extinction, given the effects that such impacts are thought to have on the Earth 
surface environment.  The other two possible causes have been much less 
publicized, but they have their responsible proponents. 
6.4  At certain times in Earth history, there have been enormous outpourings 
of basaltic lava onto the Earth’s surface.  The basalts thus formed, which cover 
large areas to great thicknesses, are called flood basalts, and the regions affected 
are called large igneous provinces.  They form great volcanic plateaus, both on 
land and under the ocean.  Figure 9-23 shows the locations of major continental 
flood basalts and submarine basalt plateaus.  These massive emplacements of 
volcanic rocks originate by processes seemingly unrelated to the normal basaltic 
volcanism associated with sea-floor spreading.  They are generally thought to be 
associated instead with large mantle plumes.  Humankind has never experienced a 
such a period of outpouring of basaltic magmas:  the rates must have been orders 
of magnitude greater than during any volcanic eruptions in human history.  Such 
volcanism must have injected enormous quantities of greenhouse gases and 
particulates into the atmosphere and oceans, and the climatic effects, especially 
arising from the continental outpourings, must have been substantial.

6.5  Eustatic (simultaneously worldwide) changes in sea level have long 
been implicated in mass extinctions.  The idea is this:  during times of sea-level 
highstands, large areas of the continents are covered with shallow oceans, 
affording a great range of habitats for marine organisms.  A subsequent large and 
rapid sea-level fall drains the sea away from the continents, eliminating all of 
those habitats.  (Keep in mind that if sea level falls to the level of the continental 
shelf break, there is almost no shallow ocean anywhere in the world.) 
6.6  The possible effects of each of these possible causes of mass extinctions 
that might have played a role in the extinctions are highly varied, and to a great 
extent rather similar from one to another.  Figure 9-25 is a tabulation of the 
possible effects.  It’s all very deductive, but it gives you an idea of what might 
have been involved.

6.7  There have been various attempts at objective evaluation of the 
correlation between the known mass extinctions, on the one hand, and the various 
possible causes, on the other hand.  It’s a truism in science that a correlation, by 
itself, does not prove cause and effect, but at least if there’s no correlation then the 
given factor could not have caused the mass extinctions.  The best such evaluation 
I have found in the literature is shown in Figure 9-26 (MacLeod, N., 1998, 
Impacts and marine invertebrate extinctions, p. 217-246, in Grady, M.M., 
Hutchison, R., McCall, G.J.H., and Rothery, D.A., Meteorites; Flux with Time and 
Impact Effects:  Geological Society of London, Special Publication 140, 278 p. 
(Figure 1, p. 219)). 
6.8  In Figure 9-26, Column A shows, for the entire Phanerozoic, the percent 
extinction of marine invertebrates, stage by stage.  (Note 1:  By “stage” here, I 
mean the official time-stratigraphic unit that is a subdivision of a system, in the 
official hierarchy of stratigraphic units.  Note 2:  Owing to the inherent limitations 
on age resolution, all extinctions occurring during a given stage are placed at the 
end of the stage.)  Column B shows data on major impact events, both direct, in 
the form of impact structures, and indirect, in the form of geochemical anomalies 
believed to be caused by the impacts, as well as small, glassy objects, called 
tektites, which are produced as the vaporized material re-condenses immediately 
after an impact.  Column C shows the occurrence of outpourings of continental 
flood basalts, and Column D shows three different versions of the curve of 
Phanerozoic eustatic sea level (see the preceding chapter for more details). 
6.9  As shown in Column A of Figure 9-26, at several times in Earth history 
rates of extinction have been much greater than usual.  The greatest mass 
extinction of all was at the end of the Permian, and the three other largest 
extinctions were at the end of the Ordovician, at the end of the Cretaceous, and at 
the end of the Frasnian stage of the Devonian. 
6.10  Another way of looking at the occurrence of mass extinctions is to 
draw a histogram (a kind of vertical bar graph) that shows percent extinction 
against the numbers of geologic time units that were characterized by that percent 
extinction.  Figure 9-27 shows such a graph, based on stage-level time-
stratigraphic units (or parts of stages).  Also shown in Figure 9-27 are the so-called 
“big five” mass extinctions.  The clear message from Figure 9-27 is that there is 
no real break between the minor, background extinctions, which have 
characterized most of geologic time, and the larger ones, called mass extinctions.

6.11  Still another way of describing mass extinctions is to plot a graph 
(Figure 9-28) that shows percent species extinction, on the vertical axis, against 
the mean waiting time, in years, between extinctions of the given magnitude.  (No 
details here on how the data are derived and massaged to make the graph.) In 
climatology, they do the same kind of thing with floods and rainfall events.  Note 
first of all that the curve is smooth:  there’s no big vertical step between small 
extinctions and large extinctions. Here’s an interesting question that arises from a 
graph like this:  how far out on the horizontal axis would you have to go to find 
the waiting time for a mass extinction that kills all of the species on Earth?  At 
least one researcher thinks that it might be in the ballpark of a billion years—
longer than the history of multicellular organisms!  An important consideration to 
keep in mind when using a graph like this is that the actual recurrence time can 
vary from tomorrow to a billion years plus:  the graph shows only the average.  (In 
the same way, the hundred-year rainstorm might be repeated twice in the same 
year!)

6.10  The results of the comparisons in Figure 9-26 are interesting, and 
perhaps surprising.  There is a clear correlation between the end-Cretaceous 
extinction and the occurrence of a massive impact—but there is also a general 
correlation with both volcanic eruption of flood basalts and a sharp sea-level fall.  
Two of the three other largest mass extinctions were not accompanied by major 
impacts (or, more precisely, none that are known) but were accompanied by sea-
level drops.  As shown by Figure 9-29, the correlation between extinctions and 
flood-basalt eruptions is extremely strong!  Does this mean that the eruptions were 
the direct cause of the extinctions?  (It’s difficult to construct a scenario in which 
the extinctions caused the volcanism—but might both have been caused by a third 
factor?)  That seems like a strong hypothesis, but there is still great difference of 
opinion on that score.

6.11  If you read any of the popular or semi-popular literature on the end-
Cretaceous extinction, the strong message you would get is that the great 
Chicxulub impact was the direct cause of the extinction.  The hypothesis, first 
developed in the early 1980s, was based on anomalously high contents of the 
element iridium in stratigraphic sections around the world at the time of the end of 
the Cretaceous.  Iridium is much more abundant in certain extraterrestrial bodies 
than in terrestrial materials.  Eventually, the culprit impact crater was found, in 
shallow ocean waters off the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, buried beneath 
younger sediments.  Skeptics have pointed out, however, that perhaps the impact 
was only the final nail in the coffin, in the sense that conditions might already 
have been made rather unpleasant for life on Earth already, and the effects of the 
impact pushed so many taxa over the brink of extinction. 
 
 
7.  THE RISE OF LAND PLANTS 
 
7.1  The earliest plants must have been marine organisms.  The invasion of 
the land surface of the Earth by plants was one of the most significant events in 
the evolution of life on Earth.  We don’t know when plants first colonized the land 
surface, because early plants, with their soft tissues, did not fossilize well, 
especially in the largely oxidizing environment of the land surface. 
7.2  Plants must have had to solve a lot of problems to survive on land.  
Most of these problems involve the atmosphere.  Because of the much lower 
 
237

density of the atmosphere than of the oceans, plants had to grow against gravity, 
unless they restricted themselves to low, flat mats.  They had to evolve some 
waterproofing technique, to reduce evaporation from moist outer surfaces.  They 
had to develop ways of circulating water, nutrients, and gases between their upper 
parts, which extended up into the atmosphere, and their lower parts, rooted in the 
soil.  They had to adapt their reproductive strategies to the atmosphere. 
7.3  We can imagine a scenario for the evolution of land plants, starting 
perhaps with green algae that lived in habitats that were subject to temporary 
drying.  These algae must already have spread to freshwater habitats from their 
place of origin in the oceans.  That could have happened most easily in coastal 
areas, where brackish-water and fresh-water environments can naturally developed 
from coastal estuaries and lagoons; you don’t need to envision inland lakes that 
never had any connection with the sea.  They might have evolved spores that 
could be released into the air, where they would have been dispersed much more 
effectively than in water.  There would have been an advantage to projecting part 
of their structure up into the air, because light levels are higher and uptake of 
carbon dioxide is more efficient.  As the plants emerged into the air, they would 
have evolved the coatings and transport systems needed for survival.  Such a 
scenario is only speculative, because there’s no fossil record on which to base it, 
only intelligent deduction. 
7.4  The earliest spores that are thought to have come from land plants first 
appeared in the Middle Ordovician—but there are no fossils of plant tissues 
besides spores until around the middle of the Silurian.  The earliest spores of land 
plants look like those that come from living liverworts.  Liverworts, a kind of 
primitive plant, together with mosses, form the division Bryophyta, one of the 
main divisions of the plant kingdom.  (Botanists use the term “division” for a 
taxonomic unit that’s equivalent to the “phylum” of zoologists.)  Indeed, recent 
molecular evidence suggests that all land plants today are descended from early 
liverworts. 
7.5  We know that a land flora was well established by the end of the 
Silurian.  By that time, vascular plants had made their appearance.  Vascular plants 
are those with tubular structures for efficient internal transport of fluids.  Land 
plants then became much more diverse in the Early Devonian.  As the efficiency 
of vascular systems improved and as structural stiffening material evolved, plants 
were able to grow taller.  By the Middle Devonian, there were fernlike plants with 
well developed leaves, and trees that grew to over ten meters in height, judging by 
the tree trunks we see as fossils.  By the end of the Devonian, all of the major 
innovations of land plants had appeared except for flowers and fruit.  By 
Carboniferous time, diversity and sophistication of land plants had increased to a 
level not exceeded until late in the Mesozoic. 
7.6  The rise of land plants, in the Silurian, made for some fundamental 
changes in the nature of Earth surface processes.  As you know, plants play a 

 

238

major role in stabilizing the soil surface.  Before the establishment of land plants, 
erosion by running water must have been much more efficient at mobilizing and 
transporting the products of weathering.  On the other hand, weathering processes 
must have been less intense, other things being equal, because of the important 
role of plants in promoting weathering.  Plants open up rock by invasion by their 
roots, and the acidic solutions produced by decay of plant material accelerates 
chemical weathering. 
7.7  Another consequence of the stabilization of soils by plant growth is the 
appearance, for the first time in the geologic record, of meandering rivers.  It’s 
well known, from studies of modern fluvial environments, that unless the soils of 
river valleys are well stabilized against erosion the rivers develop a braided 
pattern:  owing to the freely erodible nature of the bank material, the river is able 
to spread widely, leading to a pattern of shallow, shifting channels.  Only when the 
banks are stabilized by a combination of fine sediment and plant cover do rivers 
develop a meandering pattern. 
 

PART V.  TIME CORRELATION BY FOSSILS 

 
1  Recall from the chapter on stratigraphy that one kind of stratigraphic unit, 
time-stratigraphic units, are defined on the basis of time.  In order to define and 
deal with such units in a concrete way, one must be able to make reasonably good 
time correlations among rocks in different parts of the world.  How does one trace 
the boundaries of time-stratigraphic units?  Almost entirely by fossils.  This is 
appealingly simple in principle:  evolution has given us a non-repeating sequence 
of different species in time.  But it is difficult in practice, for a variety of reasons.  
One of the most important reasons is in a way a chicken-and-egg problem:  we 
have to use the same data base—the fossils in the stratigraphic sections around the 
world—to do two things at the same time:  figure out the evolutionary sequence of 
species, and use that sequence to date the strata.  For almost two hundred years 
now it has been a matter of successive approximations, whereby paleontologists 
(or, more precisely, stratigraphic paleontologists, those who are more concerned 
with using the organisms to make correlations than with the paleobiology of the 
organisms themselves; there is a substantial overlap between the two groups) play 
off their existing knowledge of the sequence of species, on the one hand, and the 
stratigraphic record of exposed stratigraphic sections around the world, on the 
other hand, to continually refine our understanding of the fossil record. 
2  The easiest way to appreciate this problem is to imagine yourself to be the 
first stratigraphic paleontologist ever to take a modern approach to a stratigraphic 
section.  (You might try to assume the role of William Smith, the canal engineer 
mentioned in the preceding chapter.)  You work out a sequence of fossil 
assemblages in that stratigraphic section and define time-stratigraphic units on the 

 

239

basis of that succession, and then, armed with that information, go to another 
stratigraphic section and try to recognize your time-stratigraphic units there by 
looking at the fossils.  Just your common sense tells you that there are factors at 
work that will make matters difficult for you.  For example, the number, duration, 
and position of diastems (breaks in the record) are likely to be different in the two 
sections.  So, even aside from such things are imperfect preservation or regionality 
of species, you are likely to find certain of your time-stratigraphic units missing in 
the new section, and by the same token you will discover new time-stratigraphic 
units in your new sections, which will force you to redesign your whole scheme of 
time-stratigraphic subdivision.  By now there has been so much work that this 
effect is felt only at the finest level o time-stratigraphic subdivision, but it will 
always be with us. 
3  Here are some practical things about correlation by fossils: 
 
imperfect preservation 
no organisms lived there 
breaks in the record 
facies control 
slow evolution 
geographic provinces 
finite spread time 
 
4  From the standpoint of the practicing stratigraphic paleontologist, the 
ideal fossils species is one that spread rapidly into a wide range of depositional 
environments in all regions of the Earth, built rugged and highly preservable 
skeletal materials, lived in great abundance, and then became extinct after only a 
short time.  The worst kind of fossil species, on the other hand, is one that evolved 
to fit a very narrow ecological niche, lived in only a small part of the world, and 
was so well adapted to its environment that it existed for a long period of geologic 
time.  (Stratigraphic paleontologists refer to fossil species that lived in very 
specialized and restricted environments, often with a disparaging tone in their 
voice, as facies fossils.  Ecological paleontologists, on the other hand, love to see 
such fossils.)  Most fossil species fall somewhere in the middle ground between 
these two extremes. 
5  In general, as you might expect, the finer we try to cut the time cake, the 
less certain the results.  And, of course, it’s to be expected that stratigraphers and 
paleontologists are always trying to push the resolution of the fossil record to its 
utmost.
