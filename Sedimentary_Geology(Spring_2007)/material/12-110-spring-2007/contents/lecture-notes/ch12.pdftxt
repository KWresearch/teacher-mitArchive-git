FOSSIL FUELS 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  I need not remind you that the modern world operates largely on fossil 
fuels, mainly coal and fluid petroleum hydrocarbons.  For almost a hundred years 
much of the practice of geology has centered around exploration for such fossil 
fuels, as well as for the “hard” or metallic minerals.  It seems important in a course 
like this to give some attention to the geology of fossil fuels. 
 
 
 
 

2.  COAL 
2.1  Introduction 
2.1.1  Have you ever had the opportunity to hold a lump of coal in your 
hand?  The average person”s contact with coal has lessened greatly in the last fifty 
years, since the great increase in use of oil and natural gas in home heating.  Only 
if you're associated with the mining of coal or its use in industrial steam plants are 
you likely to have had hands-on experience with coal.  But coal represents the 
world’s greatest remaining storehouse of energy—for better or for worse.  Coal 
represents almost 90% of the world's recoverable reserve of fossil fuels.  The 
United States, with about 20% of the world’s coal supply, is well endowed.  
Figure 12-1 is a sketch map of the coal fields in the conterminous United States 
and adjacent parts of Canada.

2.1.2  Coal is a sedimentary rock!  It could be defined as a combustible rock 
that had its origin in the accumulation and partial decomposition of vegetation.  
That’s akay as far as definitions go, but it’s not very descriptive. 
 
2.1.3  Coal is found to be interbedded with other sedimentary rocks you 
might consider to be ordinary rather than extraordinary:  sandstones, shales, and 
limestones.  Coal itself, however, should be viewed as a rare sedimentary rock, 
albeit widely distributed:  even in the relatively few formations around the world 
in which it is found, coal constitutes only a small percentage of the stratigraphic 
section, rarely more than one or two percent and often much smaller.  But in 
absolute terms, the quantity of coal remaining after centuries of mining is 
staggering:  it has been estimated that there's something like 1015 to 1016 
kilograms of coal locked up in the Earth’s continental crust.     
 
2.1.4  Coal is found in beds (or seams, in coal terminology) ranging in 
thickness from just millimeters to many meters.  Typical thickness of coal beds is 
half a meter to a few meters. 

       

2.2.1 

 
2.2  Properties and Terminology 
Coal varies greatly in its properties, depending in part upon its 
composition but for the most part in the degree of diagenesis or 
even metamorphism it's undergone.  This degree of diagenesis is 
called the rank of the coal.  In terms of extent of diagenesis, coal 
ranges from low-rank (brown, porous, semilithified, and of low 
density, something like 1.0 g/cm3) to high-rank (jet black, hard, 
nonporous, hard, and much more dense, up to almost 2.0 g/cm3).  
Figure 12-2 shows this spectrum, with conventional names along 
the way.  

  
 
 
2.2.2  You can see from Figure 12-2 that the principal way-stations along this 
spectrum are  lignite (brown coal) → bituminous (soft coal) → anthracite (hard 
coal).  Lignite burns readily but with a smoky flame; anthracite is hard to ignite 
but burns with a clean, hot flame.

2.2.3  Material even less diagenetized than lignite is called peat, which is a 
porous aggregate of largely nondecomposed but stable plant residues.  In some 
areas peat is mined as a domestic fuel, in addition to being ground up for 
agricultural and horticultural use.  At the other end of the spectrum, under 
conditions of real metamorphism (the interbedded rocks then being metamorphic 
rather than sedimentary), anthracite coal is converted to meta-anthracite, and 
finally to graphite. 
 

 

 
2.3  Composition 
2.3.1  Almost by definition, coal consists mostly of carbon.  The plant 
materials from which coal is derived are largely carbohydrates of various kinds, 
only the most resistant of which (mainly cellulose and lignin) remain after partial 

 297

 

decomposition after death of the plants.  The initial plant residues that are buried 
to become coal therefore consist largely of carbon even at the very beginning.  But 
coals—even lignites—contain appreciable percentages of other constituents as 
well.  Here’s a list: 
 
 
nitrogen:  a couple of percent; doesn’t vary much.  Probably from the 
organic matter itself, not from entrapped air. 
sulfur:  small percentages, a couple of percent, but undesirable because of 
production of sulfuric acid (the main constituent of acid rain) upon combustion. 
water:  varies with rank from a few percent to as much as 90% 
(conventionally measured after drying at a temperature a little greater than 100 °C, 
to get rid of liquid water in pore spaces). 
gases:  CO2, O2, N2, CH4, variable percentages. 
“ash”:  the solid residue upon combustion:  sand, silt, and clay in variable 
proportions, either carbonate or siliciclastic (mostly the latter).  From fractions of a 
percent in the cleanest coal to such large values that the rock should be called a 
carbonaceous shale or a carbonaceous sandstone rather than coal.  Very impure 
coal is called bone coal. 
 
2.3.2  Figure 12-3 shows one segment of a composition triangle whose end 
members are percent of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.  Only the area nearest the 
carbon corner is occupied by rocks we would call coal. You can see that the 
increase in rank is associated with a progressive decrease in the percentages of 
hydrogen and oxygen, presumably owing to driving off of the volatile constituent 
water.

2.3.3  The plant constituents of coal have been classified both 
macroscopically and microscopically.  The basic idea is that all coal is composed 
of a small number of kinds of fragments of plant debris called macerals, which are 
analogous to the minerals of an ordinary sedimentary rock.   
 
2.3.4  Macerals represent such things as branches, twigs, leaves, bark, interior 
tissue of various kinds, and pollen or spores, among many others.  Study and 
classification of coal macerals is highly botanical and can be done only with the 
aid of a microscope. 
 
2.3.5  The macroscopic study and classification of coals, on the other hand, 
while not as fundamental, is easier to deal with.  Coal has long been recognized to 
consist of just a few macroscopic constituents, usually interlaminated.  These 
constituents form strata that are typically from fractions of a millimeter to tens of 
millimeters thick. 
 
 
vitrain:  brilliant, vitreous (glassy-looking), jetlike coal with conchoidal 
(shell-like) fracture 
clarain:  coal layers that appear silky from the presence of very delicate 
internal lamination 
durain:  dull, lusterless, matte layers of coal with a close or dense texture, 
without internal lamination 
fusain:  friable and highly porous coal, usually appearing as irregular chips 
and wedges lying along the bedding; often called mineral charcoal. 
 
 2.4  Origin 
2.4.1  Coal can form wherever growth of vegetation is abundant enough, and 
accumulation of the sediment is scanty enough, that plant material can accumulate 
in high concentrations and large quantities before complete decomposition.  For 
this, one has to appeal to extensive swamps, usually termed coal swamps, either 
fresh water or sea water (probably mainly fresh water) in climatic conditions 
conducive to lush growth of vegetation and far from sources of siliciclastic 
sediments. 
 

 

 299

 

2.4.2  Most coal seems to have formed in place, by gradual accumulation of 
plant material right where it grew.  You can imagine thick accumulations of 
earlier plant material into which the present crop puts down its roots, only to 
succumb eventually and form the substrate for yet another crop.  Such coal is said 
to be autochthonous.  Some coal, however, seems to consist of plant fragments 
that were transported far from where they grew, presumably by flowing water, and 
deposited in some rather different sedimentary environment—but again one 
without an abundance of “ordinary” siliciclastic sediment.  Such coal is said to be 
allochthonous.    
 
2.4.3  The overall association of other sedimentary facies with coals—mainly 
shallow marine and fluvial sediments—tells us that, broadly, coal accumulates in 
coastal environments of one kind or other.  Perhaps the most common kind of 
environment of this kind could be termed deltaic.  Imagine a broad river carrying 
mud and sand to the shoreline.  The river flow in deltas tends to be well 
channelized, with strong flows carrying sand to the channel mouths.  Mud carried 
by such channels is either spilled widely over the banks of the channels along the 
way or disgorged into the sea at the mouths of the channels.  In certain settings, in 
between the channels are low-lying areas that receive little fluvial sediment and 
are conducive to dense vegetation.  Such areas tend to experience slow 
subsidence, from compaction of earlier-deposited sediments; this subsidence 
makes room for further accumulation of plant materials.  (Keep in mind that there 
must be great compaction of the plant material as it's buried.) 
   
2.5  Cyclothems 
 
2.5.1  The coastal nature of most coal is emphasized by the mode of occurrence of 
late Paleozoic coal.  (You will see below that the Pennsylvanian was one of the 
great epochs of coal deposition around the world.)  Most Pennsylvanian coal is 
found in  distinctive cyclic units called cyclothems.  A cyclothem consists of a 
systematic alternation or cycle of sedimentary deposits that represent a regular 
alternation of depositional environments.  Figure 12-4:  Dunbar, C.O., and 
Rodgers, J., 1957, Principles of Stratigraphy:  Wiley, 356 p. (Figure 52, p. 110) 
shows a schematic stratigraphic column of a cyclothem.  The figure shows an 
idealized cycle, in that there’s lots of variability in the real successions, but it gives 
you a good general idea of the typical succession.   
 
 
 
 
 

 300

 

 

2.5.2  Interpretation of a cyclothem like that shown in Figure 12-4 is clear:  
there’s a cyclic alternation of marine and nonmarine deposits.  The nonmarine 
part of the cyclothem extends from the disconformable base of the sandstone to 
the coal; the rest of the cyclothem represents shallow-marine deposition.  We are 
forced to assume that there was a cyclic rise and fall of sea level relative to land, 
to produce inward and outward migration of the shoreline over the area where the 
deposits were accumulating.  The lowest stand of sea level is represented by the 
sandstone at the base of the cyclothem, which by its features is best interpreted as 
fluvial or deltaic.  The coal represents a time when the sea level was starting to rise 
again, and the flooding of the river system prevented extensive deposition of 
siliciclastic sediment and allowed development of coal swamps.  Eventually the 
site of coal deposition was flooded by the sea, and limestone and shale was 
deposited.  Then, as sea level fell again, the river was rejuvenated, and cut into 
previous sediments to lay down more fluvial sand.   
 
2.5.3  The origin of the fluctuations in sea level were controversial for a long 
time.  It’s now generally agreed that the sea-level fluctuations were not tectonic 
but eustatic:  the late Paleozoic was by good evidence a time of widespread 
continental glaciation, which would have produced substantial and cyclic 
fluctuation of sea level worldwide. 
 
2.5.4  The variability in the nature of the cyclothems from place to place 
provides further evidence for coastal deposition during eustatic fluctuations in seal 
level.  At points on the continent that were at lower elevations and therefore closer 
to the ocean on average, a greater percentage of the cyclothems are represented by 
marine deposits, whereas at points that were at higher elevations, farther from the 
ocean, a greater part of the cyclothems are nonmarine.  Coals are most abundant in 
the cyclothems that were intermediate in position; in the US, the Pennsylvanian 
cyclothems richest in coal are found in Illinois.   
 
2.6  Coal Through Geologic Time 

 
2.6.1  Coal was not common before the spread of plants from the oceans onto 
the land, in the Silurian.  For this reason, the earliest extensive coal deposits date 
from the Devonian.  Since then, the times of most abundant coal deposition were 
in the Pennsylvanian, the Jurassic, the Cretaceous, and the earlier part of the 
Tertiary—most especially in the Pennsylvanian.  Since the Devonian the time of 
scantiest coal, by far, was the Triassic.  The reasons for such a grossly uneven 
distribution of coal deposition through time are not entirely clear:  it must have 
had to do with the extent of climatic and tectonic settings around the world 
favorable to coal deposition.   

 301

 

 
2.6.2  But it might surprise you to learn that there is some coal even as far 
back as the Early Proterozoic!  Proterozoic coal, minor in extent and volume, was 
formed by accumulation and appropriate coalification of algae in certain marine 
environments. 

 
 

 
3.  PETROLEUM 
3.1  Introduction 
3.1.1  Petroleum is in so many ways the cornerstone of modern life.  Even 
those of us who bemoan our overdependence on petroleum find ourselves using it 
in so many ways.  How many environmentalists refuse to drive or ride in 
petroleum-powered motor vehicles?   
 
3.1.2  Fluid petroleum hydrocarbons, crude oil and natural gas, began to be 
exploited on a large scale near the end of the last century.  Up until a few decades 
ago, supplies seemed limitless.  Now we know that they are limited, although we 
are not about to run out.  It’s more a matter of how much we are willing to pay to 
extract petroleum as the more readily recoverable reserves dwindle in the coming 
decades.  More on that later.   
 
3.1.3  Here’s a nutshell prelude to this section:  petroleum in all its forms is 
derived almost entirely from organic matter left over from death and decay of 
plant and animal microorganisms, mostly marine, and deposited along with 
sediments.  As the sediments are buried and subjected to increased temperatures 
and pressures, those organic matter undergo complex chemical changes, leading in 
some situations but not all to mobile fluid hydrocarbons, which, being less dense 
than aqueous pore solutions, tend to rise buoyantly, eventually leaking to the 
surface to be reoxidized.  In some places this rising fluid is trapped by geological 
structures to form concentrated fields, which can be tapped by deep drilling. 
 
3.2  Organic Matter in Sediments 
3.2.1  In geology the term organic matter is generally used for material 
composed of organic molecules derived directly or indirectly from the organic 
part of organisms.  Mineralized skeletal materials, like shells or bones, are by 
convention not included.  Such organic matter is synthesized by living organisms 
and then, upon the death of the organisms, is either oxidized back to its simple 
inorganic constituents (mainly CO2 and water) or in part deposited along with 
inorganic sediments, in usually small but sometimes surprisingly large 
concentrations. 

 

 302

 

 
3.2.2  Because of the relatively high concentrations of oxygen in the 
atmosphere (about 20% by weight) and the relatively low concentrations of 
oxygen in the oceans (a few milliliters per liter), organic matter produced 
subaerially is much more susceptible to oxidation before preservation than is 
organic matter produced subaqueously.  Only in the case of lush woody plant 
growth (with its abundant hard-to-destroy constituents cellulose and lignin) and 
rapid burial can organic matter be abundantly preserved on land (see the earlier 
section on coal).   
 
3.2.3  In the oceans, oxygen-poor bottom environments are common.  Closed 
basins, deep or shallow, large or small, tend to have stable density stratification, 
usually because waters are warmer near the surface than near the bottom, and 
vertical circulation is virtually nonexistent.  In such conditions the rain of organic 
matter to the bottom outstrips the supply of oxygen to oxidize the organic matter, 
and there's not accumulation of non-decayed organic matter in anoxic conditions.  
The organic-matter content of sediments deposited in such environments can be as 
high as 5%.  The Black Sea is an excellent modern example, and is widely used as 
a model for organic-matter-rich anoxic basins by petroleum geologists.   
 
3.2.4  But even ordinary dark shales, so abundant in the sedimentary record, 
contain on average a substantial fraction of one percent organic matter.  A good 
way to explain this is that even in a sea-floor setting that's well oxygenated, any 
organic matter than escapes decay before burial will soon be comfortable as it 
finds itself below the sediment-water interface, because the permeability of muds 
is so small that the subsurface sediment is effectively sealed off from access to 
oxygen upon burial of just a few centimeters.   
 
3.2.5  The great bulk of organic matter is produced in the oceans by single-
celled microscopic organisms of various kinds.  You can forget about clams and 
snails, to say nothing of fish or whales; they play a minor pat on the organic-
matter budget of the oceans and their sediments.  The microorganisms that are the 
most important producers of organic matter are planktonic—that is, they float 
passively, mostly in the near-surface waters of the oceans.  Most such organisms 
are much less than one millimeter in size, and the bulk of the organisms are a 
small fraction of a millimeter in size, often no larger than several micrometers.  
Some are soft bodied; others secrete stiffening material consisting or either 
amorphous silica or calcium carbonate.   
 

 303

 

3.2.7  Systematic consideration of the various kinds of planktonic microorganisms 
today and in the geologic past would be out of place here; suffice it to say that the 
greater part are autotrophic (they produce their own food, mainly by 
photosynthesis) and thus should be considered plants.  They are termed 
phytoplankton.  The main kinds are diatoms, algae of various kinds, and 
nannoplankton (extremely small).  Also important, however, are planktonic 
animals, termed zooplankton, which feed on smaller plankton, mainly 
phytoplankton.  Foraminifera are the most important kind of zooplankton.  
Figure 12-5:  Tissot, B.P., and Welte, D.H., 1984, Petroleum Formation and 
Occurrence, Second Edition: Springer-Verlag, 699 p. (Figure 1.3.1, p. 22) shows 
the kinds of plankton most important in the generation of petroleum.  The kinds 
and relative percentages of plankton have varied through geologic time, but 
because of the varying preservability, it’s difficult to know much about the relative 
importance of the various kinds of planktonic organisms in the past.  It’s 
reasonable to assume, however, that they've been abundant throughout the latter 
part of geologic time, at least since the Precambrian. 
 
3.2.8  All organisms are composed of the same groups of chemical 
constituents:  proteins (highly ordered polymeric molecules built of amino acids), 
carbohydrates (basically monomeric and polymeric sugars:  monosaccharides 
and polysaccharides), and lipids (organism-produced organic compounds 
insoluble in water:  fats, oils, and waxes).  With respect to generation of 
petroleum, lipids are by far the most important, because they are much less 
susceptible to decay by oxidation before, during, or immediately after 
sedimentation.  In addition, lignin (a high-molecular-weight aromatic polymer that 
acts as a structural stiffener in higher plants) is an important and readily 
preservable kind of organic matter, but does not figure prominently in the 
generation of petroleum. 

 

 
 
3.3  Organic Matter to Petroleum 
3.3.1  The conversion of organic matter to petroleum is a complex process of 
chemical change during burial of the sediment that contains the organic matter.  
These changes can be viewed as a series of phases that begin immediately after 
burial and continue to the point of true metamorphism of the sediment, at depths 
of many kilometers.  Broadly speaking, the depth of burial at which most fluid 
petroleum hydrocarbons are generated ranges from about a thousand meters to a 
few thousand meters. 
 
3.3.2 

The series of chemical changes in organic matter upon burial of a 
sediment is conventionally subdivided into three stages:  

 304

 

 

diagenesis, catagenesis, and metagenesis.  (Figure 12-6:  Tissot, 
B.P., and Welte, D.H., 1984, Petroleum Formation and 
Occurrence, Second Edition: Springer-Verlag, 699 p.  Figure 
II.1.1, p. 70) shows schematically the course of petroleum 
evolution during these three stages.)  Remember two things, 
however: 

•  This is a largely arbitrary subdivision, for convenience in thinking and 
communication, and doesn’t reflect any sharp breaks in the nature of the 
process 
•  This use of the term diagenesis is narrower than the way 
sedimentologists in general use the term, for all the changes that happen 
in a sediment upon burial, all the way to what should better be termed 
metamorphism. 

 

 
3.3.3  Diagenesis acts during shallow burial, down to a few hundred meters; 
perhaps a good albeit arbitrary lower limit would be 500 m.  Temperatures rise to 
not much more than 50°C.   
 
3.3.4  Early on in diagenesis, the activity of living microbes of various kinds, 
buried along with the sediment, are the main agents of chemical transformation of 
organic matter.  These are mainly bacteria.   
 
3.3.5  If the sediment was deposited in an oxygenated environment, then the 
earliest stage of microbial decomposition proceeds aerobically, using up all the 
free oxygen.  Then, at greater depths, anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria extract 
oxygen from sulfates (SO4--) and reduce the sulfur to sulfide ions (S--).  The 
sulfide ions then combine with ferrous iron to form various iron sulfides, which 
are slowly converted to pyrite after further burial.  Finally, by fermentation, 
certain other anaerobic bacteria feed on oxidized forms of organic matter, mainly 
carbohydrates, generating methane.   
 
3.3.6  In the later stages of diagenesis, upon burial to tens to a few hundreds 
of meters, the organic matter remaining after microbial activity is progressively 
converted or synthesized into higher-molecular-weight organic compounds that 
are more stable and less water-soluble.  The details of chemistry of these reactions 
is much beyond the scope of this course.   
 

 305

 

3.3.7  The compounds resulting from diagenesis are lumped together under 
the term kerogen.  Kerogen is a kind of wastebasket term for all of the immobile 
and insoluble organic compounds found in shallowly buried sediments (or, 
because other things have been happening to the sediment in the meantime, 
sedimentary rock).  This term kerogen is one of the most important in petroleum 
geology, because it’s the raw material for synthesis of mobile liquid hydrocarbons 
during further burial (see below).  Also by this stage, certain organic compounds 
have been produced that are soluble in organic solvents and can therefore be 
extracted commercially.  Such material is called bitumen.  It’s the material for 
which oil shales can be mined.    
 
3.3.8  Finally, during catagenesis, fluid hydrocarbons are formed by various 
organic chemical reactions from some of the kerogen that was produced at earlier 
stages of diagenesis.  The amount and composition of these hydrocarbons changes 
progressively toward lower-molecular-weight hydrocarbons.  By the time the 
stage of metagenesis is reached, only methane, the lightest hydrocarbon, is 
produced. 
 
3.3.9  The hydrocarbons of relatively high molecular weight are in liquid 
form both in the subsurface and when they are pumped (or flow naturally) to the 
surface.  In a general way, the higher the molecular weight of the hydrocarbon mix 
in the petroleum, the more viscous the liquid.  The hydrocarbon with lowest 
molecular weight, methane, CH4, is a gas even at the high pressures of petroleum-
forming depths.  The hydrocarbons with slightly greater molecular weights 
(ethane, C2H6; propane, C3H8; and butane, C4H10), are liquid under the great 
pressures of petroleum-generating depths but undergo a change of state from 
liquid to gas on the way to the surface, as the pressure decreases. 
 
3.3.10  Natural gas is composed predominantly of methane, with much 
smaller percentages of ethane, propane, and butane.  Natural gas also contains 
variable percentages of carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, hydrogen, 
helium, and argon; these are largely of inorganic origin, and are included in the 
natural gas basically because they were there.  Liquid petroleum consists mainly 
of a mixture of alkanes of various molecular weights (alkanes are organic 
compounds with chains of single-bonded carbon, with hydrogens bonded to the 
carbons along the chains) and aromatics (aromatic compounds are those with 
benzene rings in their structures).  This may not mean much to you unless you 
have had some organic chemistry, but don’t worry about it. 
 

 306

 

 

3.4  The Migration of Petroleum 
3.4.1  Consider a sedimentary rock that started out at the depositional 
interface with a substantial content of appropriate organic matter, some of which 
during burial has been converted to liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons.  These 
hydrocarbons are present as tiny fluid masses in the pores or interstices among the 
mineral constituents of the rock.  Keep in mind that their concentration is small:  
the initial concentration of organic matter might have been of the order of a 
percent or two, and only a fraction of that ends up being converted to fluid 
hydrocarbons.   
 
3.4.2  Since the concentration of organic matter is appreciable only in the 
finer-grained rocks—shales, in a general way—it’s accurate to say that most 
petroleum is produced in shales.  The fine-grained rocks in which petroleum is 
generated in nonnegligible concentrations are called source rocks or source beds 
for the petroleum. 
 
3.4.3  But once the petroleum is produced in the rock, it tends to migrate.  
The migration of petroleum is a critically important topic in petroleum geology, 
because in order for the petroleum to be present in a rock in concentrations great 
enough to be tapped by wells, it must migrate from the source rocks, in which it’s 
present in very small concentrations, into much more porous rocks from which it 
can be extracted in large quantities at practical rates.   
 
3.4.4  The basic pore fluid in all subsurface sedimentary rocks is, of course, 
water, with various dissolved constituents.  At the depths of petroleum generation, 
such pore waters (called formation waters at that stage) are usually very salty, to 
the point where they are best described as brines.  As it’s produced, the petroleum 
exists as little globules within and immiscible with the aqueous pore solutions. 
 
3.4.5  All mobile petroleum hydrocarbons are of lower density than water.  
So the little globules of petroleum tend to make their way buoyantly upward 
through the rock.  That’s a slow process, both because of the relatively high 
viscosity of the liquid petroleum (the natural gas component moves faster) and 
because of the low permeability of shales.  In turn, shales are of low permeability 
for two reasons:  low porosity, and small size of the passageways that connect that 
porosity.  The largely upward migration of newly generated petroleum is termed 
primary migration.  (The movement isn't necessarily strictly upward:  the liquid 
moves in the direction of most rapidly decreasing pressure, which for various 
reasons may be at some angle to the vertically upward direction.) 
 

 307

 

 

3.4.6  If the slowly migrating petroleum encounters much more porous rock 
in its travels, it collects in such rocks in much greater concentrations—in some 
cases up to volume concentrations approaching 30%, the porosity of poorly 
cemented and well sorted siliciclastics—and it travels much faster.  Such 
migration in more porous rock is called secondary migration.   
 
  
3.5  Petroleum Traps and Petroleum Reservoirs 
3.5.1  If not detained somehow, the upward-migrating petroleum ultimately 
reaches the Earth’s surface, as oil seeps.  Natural oil seeps can be seen in many 
places in the world today.  Oil seeps on the sea floor can be detected by the 
occasional release of a large glob or drop of oil from the sediment-water interface, 
from which it rises to the sea surface.  If you are a diver, you can even collect the 
petroleum by inverting a bucket over the seep.  On land, the lighter and more 
volatile fraction of the oil that seeps out the land surface tends to evaporate away, 
leaving only the more viscous bituminous components, which then act as tar pits, 
perhaps to trap unsuspecting animals feeding at the edge of the tar.   
 
3.5.2  For the upward-migrating petroleum to be retained in large 
concentrations in the subsurface, it must encounter a petroleum trap of some kind.  
A petroleum trap is an arrangement of effectively impermeable rocks above 
permeable rocks in a geometry such that the boundary surface or zone between 
the permeable rock below and the impermeable rock above has upward convexity.  
Then there is a non-negligible volume of the permeable rock in which the 
petroleum is detained or trapped (Figure 12-7).

Note that I have shown the gas above the petroleum, which in turn lies above 
the water; you should expect this stable density stratification of the three different 
and immiscible materials.  All you have to do then is drill downward through the 
roof of impermeable rock to tap the detained petroleum.  Such a detained mass of 
petroleum is called a reservoir or a pool.  A pool is the smallest and simplest unit 
of commercial petroleum production:  it’s a single and connected body of oil 
and/or gas that under a single fluid-pressure system.  In horizontal area, a single 
reservoir might cover anywhere from an acre to many square miles.  The closure 
(the vertical distance between the roof of the pool and the lowest level of 
detention) could be anywhere from a few meters to hundreds of meters.  A major 
pool might contain 50 million barrels of oil.   
 
3.5.3  Traps vary enormously in their nature.  They might best be classified 
as structural traps and stratigraphic traps.  A structural trap is a trap whose 
geometry originates by deformation.  Figure 12-8 shows three classic examples.  
In Figure 12-8A, a doubly plunging or canoe-shaped anticline in a stratigraphic 
succession with an impermeable unit or stratum overlies a mass of reservoir rock, 
which in turn overlies source rocks.  In Figure 12-8B, a fault has placed reservoir 
rock below impermeable rock not only in the its own fault block but in the 
adjacent fault block.  If the fault is later sealed by healing, so the petroleum can’t 
leak upward along the fault zone, a trap is formed.  In Figure 12-8C, a salt diapir 
has slowly punched its way up through a sedimentary sequence.  If an 
impermeable unit overlying a permeable unit is in that sequence, a crudely 
doughnut-shaped trap around the salt dome can be formed.

3.5.4  Stratigraphic traps owe their arrangement to sedimentary rather than 
structural processes.  Figure 12-9 shows two examples.  In Figure 12-9A, in a 
stratigraphic succession with some non-negligible regional dip, a permeable unit

lying below an impermeable unit undergoes lateral facies change from permeable 
to impermeable rock in the up-dip direction, thus creating a trap.  In Figure 12-9B, 
an isolated reef developed and was then eventually mantled by fine sediment.  
Reef carbonates are among the most permeable of sedimentary rocks, and since 
they're often in close proximity to fine sediment, this kind of situation makes for 
important reservoirs.  Stratigraphic traps are not usually as voluminous as 
structural traps, and they tend to be harder to find.

3.5.5  An area where a number of pools are related to a single geologic 
setting, structural or stratigraphic, is called a petroleum field.  In a looser way, a 
large area where a number of pools and/or fields are found in a broadly related 
setting is called a petroleum province.

3.6  Petroleum Distribution and Reserves 
3.6.1  Most of the world’s easy-to-find fields have already been found and 
exploited.  Present exploration focuses on major fields in previously unexplored 
areas, which of course are now few and far between, and minor fields and pools in 
already exploited areas.   
 
3.6.2  Is the world running out of petroleum?  That continues to be a hotly 
debated issue.  In a broad way the answer has to be yes, in that much of the 
world’s readily extractable fluid hydrocarbons have already been extracted.  
Proven reserves of such readily extractable petroleum are sufficient to last for 
some decades (althugh how many decades isn’t entirely clear).  But keep in mind 

 310

 

that easily extractable petroleum represents only a tiny fraction of all the 
petroleum hydrocarbons residing in sedimentary rocks around the world.  In an 
important sense, it’s not so much a matter of running out of petroleum as having to 
pay more and more to extract the more and more difficulty extractable petroleum.   
 
3.6.3  This is a good point to mention two other major sources of petroleum:  
tar sands and oil shales.  In some places there are enormous reserves of essentially 
solid petroleum (actually, very high-viscosity liquids which have no appreciable 
tendency toward migration).  These materials are described as asphalt or bitumen.  
They are of two kinds: 
 

•  inspissated (dried-up) deposits left over in rock that was once a pool but 
from which most of the hydrocarbons have drained away, leaving only 
immobile residues in the pore spaces 
•  primary (disseminated) deposits in which sediments were mixed with oil 
or bitumen during deposition, buried and then later exposed by erosion. 

 
The very best example of a primary deposit is the Athabasca tar sands of Alberta.  
It’s the largest known single deposit of oil in the world, something like a few 
hundred billion barrels!  The oil seeped up from Devonian organic-rich limestones 
and then was redeposited in the Cretaceous along with sand, in various protected 
nearshore marine environments.   
 

3.6.4  The other alternative source, oil shales, are widely distributed around 
the world in both time and space.  They are of potentially great commercial 
importance.  These involve several kinds of organic-rich or bituminous shales, 
with varying mixtures of organic matter with the mineral matter of the shales.  The 
organic matter is mainly kerogen (see an earlier section) which never made it to 
the stage of petroleum generation or was left over after petroleum generation and 
migration out of the shale.  One has to mine the shale (usually by surface mining) 
and then distill the kerogen out of the rock to obtain mobile hydrocarbons.  As 
with tar sands, there are enormous reserves of oil shale, especially in the western 
US.  Of course, there’s an environmental cost to the exploitation of oil shales.   
 
3.6.5  One final comment seems in order:  How long the supply of 
petroleum lasts depends on how our consumption grows in the future.  This 
seems obvious, doesn’t it, but differing assumptions about growth can lead to 
spectacularly different estimates.  The most important point to be made has to do 
with the difference between arithmetic growth and exponential growth.  A.A. 
Bartlett, in a thought-provoking paper in the Journal of Geological Education 

 311

 

(1980, vol. 28, p. 4-35) makes a revealing computation in this regard.  We 
paraphrase the key passage: 
 
If the Earth were a spherical tank of oil, the oil 
would last for 4 x 1011 years at the 1970 rate of 
consumption but only 342 years at a 7.04% annual 
rate of growth [the rate that prevailed during the 
century before 1970].
