TRACE FOSSILS 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 

 

1.1  What is a trace fossil?  Any indirect evidence of the lift activities of 
organisms, are recorded in the solid medium, usually sedimentary, in or on which 
they lived.  In the literature, especially the older literature, the synonym 
lebensspuren (in German, “life traces”) is used for trace fossils.  (German 
workers, in the early part of the twentieth century, were among the pioneers of the 
modern study of trace fossils.)  The study of trace fossils is called ichnology. 
1.2  The organisms that leave traces that become preserved as trace fossils 
are in most cases vagile (that is, moving about in the course of their lives, in some 
way) rather than sessile (living in one place)—one important exception being 
rooted plants. 
1.3  You can readily surmise the common kinds of trace fossils:  tracks, 
trackways, trails, burrows, and borings.  Here are some common terms used in 
connection witht study of trace fossils: 
 

track:  an impression in sediment left by a “foot” (more precisely the lower 
end of any appendage that makes contact with the solid substrate in the 
course of locomotion) 
trackway:  a succession of tracks that reflects directed movement of the 
organisms 
trail:  a continuous groove or furrow produced by movement of an animal 
with its body in continuous contact with the underlying sediment 
surface. 
boring:  a tubular excavation by an organisms into a rigid substrate (rock) 
Burrow:  a tubular excavation by an organisms into unconsolidated 
sediment 
shaft:  a dominantly vertical  burrow or part thereof 
249

 

tunnel:  a dominantly horizontal burrow or part thereof 
burrow lining:  a burrow wall constructed by the organisms as a structural 
reinforcement 
burrow cast, burrow fill:  the sediment that infills a burrow (this can 
happen by the life activities of the organisms, or later by sedimentation). 
spreite:  sinuous, U-shaped, or spiraled structure consisting of sets of 
closely spaced, repeated, congruent feeding, dwelling, or grazing traces. 

 

1.4  Trace fossils are in contrast to body fossils:  the actual bodies of once-
living organisms, often in recrystallized or replaced form, or impressions of the 
bodies of the organisms, in the form of casts and/or molds.  The organisms that 
produce the traces can be either animals (usually) or plants.  Traces of plant roots 
are a common kind of trace fossil produced by plant growth. 
1.5   The study of trace fossils has an interesting history.  Long ago, back in 
the nineteenth century, most trace fossils were considered to be fossilized plants—
giant algae, called, collectively, fucoids.  That view took a long time to die out and 
be replaced by the modern view of trace fossils as having been formed by a great 
variety of organisms, both plants and animals.  (There are examples of 
macroscopic alga-like fossils in the sedimentary record, but they are not 
abundant.)   
1.6  Trace fossils are given genus names and, in many cases, also species 
names.  In a sense, this is a holdover from the early time when it was generally 
thought that the traces were body fossils—the preserved remains, or impressions, 
of organisms.  Most trace fossils are referred to be their “genus” names:  as 
examples, Cruziana, Skolithos, Thalassinoides, and Nereites are among the most 
common trace fossils. 
1.7  The uninitiated reader might assume that the number and variety of trace 
fossils would vary enormously, given the extremely large numbers of fossil 
species that have existed during the latter part of geologic time.  Further thought 
should help to convince you, however, that the relatively very small number of 
kinds of traces is a consequence of the fact that the number of modes of life, or 
ecological niches, is far smaller than the number of fossil species.  Throughout the 
latter part of geologic time, various species, even of different phyla, became 
adapted to particular modes of life:  living in vertical burrows, or grazing by 
executing a zigzag path across a sediment surface, for example. That leads 
naturally to the idea that trace fossils can be classified on the basis of the nature of 
the life activity that resulted in the traces:

resting traces:  cubichnia 
crawling traces:  reptichnia 
grazing traces:  pascichnia 
feeding traces:  fodichnia 
dwelling traces:  domichnia 
escape traces:  fugichnia 

 
1.8  In almost all cases, the particular species of organisms that made a given 
trace is unknown!  For that reason, trace fossils are almost entirely useless for 
correlation.  Bu they are extremely useful for paleoecological interpretation.  All a 
body fossil tells us is that the given species lived in the given environment; a trace 
fossil, by contrast, tells us something important about what the organism did.  For 
that reason, ichnology is one of the most useful tools in deciphering depositional 
environments. 
 
1.9  The productive idea that certain kinds of traces are characteristics of 
certain kinds of environment has led ichnologists to try to associate certain kinds 
of traces with certain environments.  Study of modern trace makers has helped 
greatly in doing that. Figure  9C-1; Crimes, T.P., 1975, The stratigraphical 
significance of trace fossils, in Frey, R.W., ed., The Study of Trace Fossils; A 
Synthesis of Principles, Problems, and Procedures in Ichnology:  Springer-Verlag, 
562 p.  (Figure 7.2, p. 118); shows one attempt to associate kinds of traces with 
zones of water depth in marine environments.  Taking this a step further, trace 
fossils have been grouped into trace-fossil assemblages, from the standpoint that  
given kind of trace fossisl might not be a very good guide to environment, but 
characteristic assemblages of trace fossils would be a better guide.

1.11  Here’s an important term for you to know:  bioturbation.  Bioturbation 
is the term used to describe any disturbance of a sediment by the life activities of 
organisms.  It’s closely related to trace fossils, but it’s not exactly the same.  The 
degree or extent of bioturbation can range from what individual, isolated 
organisms do to the sediment, in the process of forming trace fossils, to total 
disruption of the sediment, to the point where all primary sedimentary fabric and 
structures are obliterated.   In particular, one often sees, in a sediment or 
sedimentary rock, a distinctive kind of bioturbation in which numerous and 
pervasive burrows have imparted a kind of mottled appearance to the material.  
That’s called burrow mottling.
