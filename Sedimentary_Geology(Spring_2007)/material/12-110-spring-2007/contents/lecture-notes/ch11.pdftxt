SEDIMENTARY BASINS 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  The official definition of a sedimentary basin is:  a low area in the 
Earth’s crust, of tectonic origin, in which sediments accumulate.  Sedimentary 
basins range in size from as small as hundreds of meters to large parts of ocean 
basins.  The essential element of the concept is tectonic creation of relief, to 
provide both a source of sediment and a relatively low place for the deposition of 
that sediment.   
1.2  Keep in mind that a sedimentary basin doesn’t have to be a place on the 
Earth’s surface with strictly basinal shape, with closed contours, like a washbowl:  
great masses of sediment can be deposited on a surface with a gentle and uniform 
slope.  But implicit in the concept of a sedimentary basin is the existence of 
prolonged crustal subsidence, to make a place for a thick deposit of sediment that 
might well have been deposited in an area without basinal geometry at the surface.  
Tectonics is needed to make sedimentary basins, but the record of the basin itself 
is sedimentary.  
1.3  As with most blanket statements, the one above has exceptions to it.  A 
sedimentary basin can be made just by erecting high land in an adjacent area by 
volcanism. 
1.4  The term “sedimentary basin” is usually not applied to relatively thin and 
very extensive deposits of sandstone, limestone, and shale from epicontinental 
seas on the cratons, many of which have seen no deformation through billions of 
years, but only to relatively thick deposits in tectonically active areas with 
negative relief.  (But intracratonic basins are the exception in this regard.) 
 
2.  TECTONICS AND SEDIMENTATION  
 
2.1  Tectonics is the most important control on sedimentation; climate is a 
rather distant second.  The important effects of tectonics on sedimentation, direct 
or indirect, include the following: 

•  nature of sediment 
•  rate of sediment supply 
•  rate of deposition 

 

 

•  depositional environment  
•  nature of source rocks 
•  nature of vertical succession 

 
2.2  In fact, tectonics affects climate itself, by way of effects as broad as the 
distribution of oceans and continents, and as local as rain shielding by local 
mountain ranges.  And sedimentation itself affects tectonics, although to a much 
lesser extent, mainly by increasing the lithospheric loading in the basin. 
2.3  The other side of the coin is that by far the best way of telling 
paleotectonics is by the sedimentary record in sedimentary basins.  The 
disposition of sediment types, sediment thicknesses, and paleocurrents in a basin 
gives evidence of the existence and location of elevated areas of the crust created 
by tectonism.  

 
3.  QUESTIONS ABOUT SEDIMENTARY BASINS 
 
3.1  Here are some important questions you might ask about a given sedi-
mentary basin: 

 
•  What was the size and shape of the basin, and how did these change as the 
basin was filled? 
•  Is (was) the basin floored by continental crust or oceanic crust? 
•  What were the kinds and proportions of sediments that filled the basin? 
•  What were the sources of the sediment, and by what pathways was it 
transported to the depositional sites? 
•  What was the history of filling of the basin? 
•  How can the original geometry of the basin be distinguished from subse-
quent deformation of the basin? 
•  What was the overall tectonic setting of the basin? 
 
4.  PRACTICAL THINGS ABOUT BASINS 
 
4.1  The only basins that are preserved in their entirety are those that lie 
entirely in the subsurface!  Basins exposed at the surface are undergoing destruc-
tion and loss of record by erosion.  So there’s an ironic tradeoff between having 
more complete preservation in the subsurface but less satisfactory observations.   

 280

4.2  How do you gather data on sedimentary basins?  There aren’t many 
ways, really:  surface mapping; cores; and subsurface geophysics, mainly seismic 
profiling. 
4.3  What kinds of things can you do with the data, to help you answer some 
of the questions posed above?  Here’s a list of some the fairly standard things you 
can do.  These range from very descriptive to very interpretive.  It makes sense to 
do the descriptive things first and then work toward the more interpretive.   
 
master cross sections:  with the present land surface as the most natural 
datum, construct several detailed physical cross sections through the basin 
to show its geometry and sediment fill. 
stratigraphic sections:  construct a graph, with time along the vertical axis, 
showing the time correlations of all the major rock units along some 
generalized traverse across the basin.  Such a section includes hiatuses, 
during which there was nondeposition or erosion. 
isopach maps:  with some distinctive stratigraphic horizon near the top of the 
section as datum, draw a contour map showing isopachs (isopachs are loci 
of equal total sediment thickness) in the basin. 
lithofacies maps:  for one or a series of times, draw a map showing distri-
bution of sediment types being deposited at that time. 
ratio maps:  compute things like sand/shale ratio, integrated over the entire 
section or restricted to some time interval, and plot a contour map of the 
values. 
paleocurrent maps:  for one or a series of times, draw a map showing the 
direction of paleocurrents in the basin at that time (see below for more 
detail). 
grain-size maps:  for the entire basin fill, averaged vertically, or for some 
stratigraphic interval or time interval, draw a map that shows the areal 
distribution of sediment grain size.  This is especially useful for conglom-
eratic basins. 

 
4.4  Another interpretive thing you can do is draw diagrams (qualitative or 
semiquantitative) showing the evolution of depositional–paleogeographic–
paleotectonic setting of the basin, by means of maps and sections.  These could 
range from cartoons to detailed representations drawn to scale.  
4.5  Just within the past ten years, computational techniques known as 
backstripping have been developed to “undo” the deposition in a sedimentary 
basin.  This involves restoring the basin to a whole series of past configurations by 
removing one layer of sediment at a time and adjusting for compaction, 

 281

subsidence, and sea-level change.  This lets you reconstruct the configuration of 
the basin through time, perhaps by drawing palinspastic cross sections for various 
time intervals.  In a way, this is the next best thing to having in your possession a 
time-lapse movie of the entire development of the basin.  
4.6  This is a good place to warn you about vertical exaggeration of cross 
sections of sedimentary basins.  Cross sections are almost always drawn with great 
vertical exaggeration, typically somewhere between 10:1 and 100:1.  This is 
because in true scale most basins are relatively thin accumulations, hundreds to 
thousands of meters of sediment spread over distances of tens to hundreds of 
kilometers.  So to see the relationships adequately in cross sections, the sections 
have to have great vertical exaggeration.  Carefully constructed sections show 
both the vertical and the horizontal scale, but cartoons often don’t show the scales. 
 
5.  PALEOCURRENTS 
 
5.1  Much effort has gone into developing ways of figuring out paths of 
dispersal of sedimentary material in basins.  One of the standard ways is to mea-
sure paleocurrent directions recorded locally in the rocks.  (A paleocurrent is just 
what the term implies:  a current, of water or wind, that existed at some time in the 
past.) Techniques are well established. 
  5.2  Knowledge of paleocurrents is helpful in solving both local and re-
gional problems of sedimentary basins.  Locally, paleocurrent directions can help 
you to figure out or predict, indirectly, the shape and orientation of sediment 
bodies, like channel sandstones.  This has obvious advantages in petroleum explo-
ration.  Regionally, paleocurrent directions can help establish paleoslope and 
source of sediment supply to the basin. 
5.3  You have already heard about a lot of the features that can be used to 
establish paleocurrent directions.  Here’s a list of the most important, with anno-
tations: 

 
Cross-stratification.  Measure the local orientation of laminae in the cross 
sets, on the theory that the local downdip direction, which presumably is 
the direction of progradation of the foreset slope, is likely to represent fairly 
closely the local current direction.  That’s true, however, only if the bed 
forms were reasonably two-dimensional.  If the bed forms were three-
dimensional, resulting in trough cross stratification, measurement of 
foreset dip directions at local places in the cross sets can be very 
misleading; it’s much better to try to ascertain the orientation of the trough 
fills themselves, although it takes good outcrops to do that. Seeing rib and 
furrow is by far the most reliable way of obtaining a paleocurrent direction 

 282

from cross-stratified deposits, but unfortunately it’s uncommon to see on 
outcrop. 
Bed forms.  If you are lucky enough to see bedding planes covered with 
symmetrical ripples or dunes, you can get an excellent measurement of 
current direction. 
Clast orientation.  Long axes of the larger clasts in a clastic deposit, whether 
gravel or sand, are commonly oriented by the current, although the 
orientation may be rather subtle.  The problem is that the orientation 
relative to the current (flow-transverse? flow-parallel?) depends on the flow 
itself in ways not well understood.  So beware of clast orientation in and of 
itself.  Pebble imbrication is an exception, and should always be sought in 
gravels and conglomerates.  (But see below under parting lineation.) 
Sole marks.  Flutes and grooves at the bases of turbidites and other strong-
current-event beds give excellent evidence of the direction of the initial, 
eroding current.  But keep in mind that the later current that did the 
depositing did not necessarily flow in exactly the same direction. 
Parting lineation.  Parting lineation is thought to reflect a subtle anisotropy in 
rock strength caused by a statistical tendency toward alignment of sand 
grains in a sandstone parallel to the current direction.  It gives excellent 
evidence of the orientation of the current, but unfortunately not the direc-
tion. 

 
5.4  The paleocurrent measurements you take from dipping beds are no good 
in themselves:  what you need to do is “undeform” the strata by rotating them 
back to horizontal, taking your paleocurrent measurements with them.  That’s 
straightforward (using a stereonet by hand, or a computer program)provided that 
the strata are not strongly deformed.  But the greater the deformation, the more 
uncertain is the exact way you should be undeforming the strata. 
 
6.  HOW BASINS ARE MADE 
 
6.1  Introduction 
 
6.1.1  In one sense, the origin of sedimentary basins boils down to the 
question of how relief on the Earth is created.  Basically, there are only a few 
ways, described in the following sections. 
 

 283

6.2  Local 
 
6.2.1  On a small scale, hundreds to thousands of meters laterally, fault 
movements can create relief of hundreds to thousands of meters, resulting in small 
but often deep basins (some of these are called intermontane basins; think about 
places like Death Valley).  You might guess that it takes dip-slip fault movements 
to create new relief, but that’s not true:  steps (in the proper sense) along strike-slip 
faults can produce small pull-apart basins; more on them later.  Relief of this kind 
is on such a small scale that it tends not to be isostatically compensated.  It’s like 
setting a block of granite out on your driveway; the flexural rigidity of your 
driveway is great enough compared with the imposed load that the granite block is 
prevented from finding its buoyant equilibrium position.  
 
6.3  Regional 
 
6.3.1  Basin relief can be created mechanically on a regional scale in two 
very important ways:  thermally or flexurally, or by a combination of those two 
effects).  Each of these is discussed briefly below.  Keep in mind that basins can 
also be made just by making mountain ranges, on land or in the ocean, by 
volcanism. 

 
6.4  Thermal 
 
6.4.1  If the lithosphere is heated from below, it expands slightly and thus 
becomes less dense (Figure 11-1).  This less dense lithosphere adjusts isostatically 
to float higher in the asthenosphere, producing what we see at the Earth’s surface 
as crustal uplift.  If the lithosphere cools back to its original temperature, there’s 
isostatic subsidence back to the original level.

6.4.2  But suppose that some erosion took place while the crust was elevated 
(Figure 11-2).  The crust is thinned where the erosion took place (and thickened 
somewhere else, where there was deposition; that might be far away, at the mouth 
of some long river system), so when the crust cools again it subsides to a position 
lower than where it started, thus creating a basin available for filling by 
sediments.

6.4.3  But the magnitude of crustal lowering by this mechanism is less than is 
often observed in basins thought to be created thermally (Figure 11-3).  It has 
therefore been proposed, and widely accepted, that in many cases extensional 
thinning of the lithosphere accompanies the heating.  Then, upon recooling, the 
elevation of the top of the lithosphere is less than before the heating and extension.  
This kind of subsidence has been invoked to explain many sedimentary basins.

6.5  Flexural 
 
6.5.1  Another important way to make basins is to park a large load on some 
area of the lithosphere (Figure 11-4).  The new load causes that lithosphere to 
subside by isostatic adjustment.  But because the lithosphere has considerable 
flexural rigidity, adjacent lithosphere is bowed down also.  The region between 
the high-standing load and the lithosphere in the far field (in the parlance of 
geophysics, that just means far away!) is thus depressed to form a basin.  This 
model has been very successful in accounting for the features of foreland basins, 

 285

which are formed ahead of large thrust sheets that move out from orogenic areas 
onto previously undeformed cratonal lithosphere.

7.  GEOSYNCLINES 
 
7.1  The concept of geosynclines was developed in the last century to deal 
with the existence of thick successions of sedimentary rocks in what we would to-
day call orogenic belts.  A geosyncline is large troughlike or basinlike 
downwarping of the crust in which thick sedimentary and volcanic rocks 
accumulated.  Usually, but not always, such accumulations are deformed during a 
later phase of the same geological cycle in which they were deposited.  You can 
see by the definition that there is a close, although not one-to-one, correspondence 
between geosynclines and what we are discussing here as sedimentary basins.  
7.2  The geosyncline concept was developed in an effort to understand the 
regularities of sedimentation in orogenic belts.  Over the decades, in both Europe 
and North America, the concept was elaborated to an extreme degree, with lengthy 
classifications and polysyllabic terminology.  The problem was that geologists 
were able to recognize distinctive kinds of sedimentary basin fills associated with 
orogenic belts, and characteristic histories of subsequent deformation of those 
sediment fills, but no one really knew the tectonic significance of geosynclines.  
The universal acceptance of plate tectonics has provided a rational framework in 
which to interpret the development and history of sedimentary basins once called 
geosynclines.  Plate tectonics has simply made the geosyncline concept obsolete.  
(I’m mentioning it here just because it played such a large part in thinking about 
tectonics and sedimentation in past times.) 
7.3  About the only term in common use that is left over from the heyday of 
geosynclines is miogeocline, for the prograding wedge of mostly shallow-water 
sediment at a continental margin. The sediment thicken sharply oceanward and 
pass into thinner deep-water sediments. 
  286

8.  CLASSIFICATION OF SEDIMENTARY BASINS 
 
8.1  Introduction 
 
8.1.1  How might one classify sedimentary basins?  Here’s a list of some of 
the important criteria that could be used, ranging from more descriptive at the top 
of the list to more genetic at the bottom of the list: 
 
more descriptive 

 

 

nature of fill 
geometry 
paleogeography 
tectonic setting 

 

 

  more genetic 
 
8.1.2  Nowadays sedimentary basins are classified by tectonic (and, 
specifically, plate-tectonic) setting.  That’s fairly easy to do for modern basins, but 
it’s rather difficult to do for ancient basins.  (By modern basins I mean those still 
within their original tectonic setting; by ancient basins I mean those now separated 
from their original tectonic setting.)  This emphasizes the need for good 
description and characterization, even if some kind of formal descriptive 
classification is not actually used. 
8.1.3  In the following pages is a brief account of the most important kinds of 
sedimentary basins.

tectonic and sedimentary processes:  These basins have no apparent connection 
with plate tectonics.  They are thought to reflect very slow thermal 
subsidence (for times of the order of a hundred million years) after a heating 
event under the continental lithosphere.  But the reasons for depression below 
the original crustal level are not understood.  Erosion during the thermal 
uplift seems untenable, as does lithospheric stretching.  Was the lithosphere 
made more dense in the area under the basin?  Was the lithosphere thinned 
by “erosion” from beneath?  Whatever the reason, the subsequent subsidence 
can be modeled very well by cooling and isostatic adjustment.  
 
Subsidence is so slow that there seems to have been no depression of the up-
per surface of the lithosphere, so depositional environments are mostly the 
same as those in surrounding areas; the succession is just thicker.  These 
successions are also more complete, however—there are fewer and smaller 
diastems—so at times the basin must have remained under water while sur-
rounding areas were emergent. (A diastem is a brief interruption in 
sedimentation, with little or no erosion before sedimentation resumes.) 
 
size, shape:  rounded, equidimensional, hundreds of kilometers across. 
 
sediment fill:  shallow-water cratonal sediments (carbonates, shales, sandstones), 
thicker and more complete than in adjacent areas of the craton but still 
relatively thin, hundreds of meters. 

 
8.3  Aulacogens 
 
location and tectonic setting:  extending from the margins toward the interiors of 
cratons (Figure 11-5). 

 
 tectonic and sedimentary processes:  Aulacogens are thought to represent the 
third, failed arm of a three-armed rift, two of whose arms continued to open 
to form an ocean basin.  In modern settings, aulacogens end at the passive 
continental margin.  An example is the Benue Trough, underlying the Congo 
River Basin in West Africa.   The ocean eventually closes to form an 
orogenic belt, so in ancient settings aulacogens end at an orogenic belt; an 
example is the basin filled by the Pahrump Group (Proterozoic) in Nevada 
and California. 

 
size, hhape:  long, narrow, linear; tens of kilometers wide, many hundreds of 
kilometers long 

 289

 
sediment fill:  very thick (up to several thousand meters); coarse to fine silici-
clastics, mostly coarse, minor carbonates; mostly nonmarine, some marine; 
contemporaneous folding and faulting; the succession often passes upward, 
with or without major unconformity, into thinner and more widespread 
shallow-marine cratonal siliciclastics and carbonates. 
  
8.4  Rift Basins 
 
location and tectonic setting:  within continental lithosphere on cratons (Figure 
11-5). 

 
tectonic and sedimentary processes:  Lithospheric extension on a craton, 
presumably by regional sublithospheric heating, causes major rifts. Some 
such rifts continue to open and eventually become ocean basins floored by 
oceanic rather than continental crust; the basin description here then applies 
to this earliest stage of the rifting.  In other cases, the rifts fail to open fully 
into ocean basins (perhaps some adjacent and parallel rift becomes the master 
rift), so they remain floored by thinned continental crust rather than new 
oceanic crust.  (Keep in mind that we may be doing too much lumping here.)  
A modern example:  the East African rift valleys.  An ancient example:  the 
Triassic–Jurassic Connecticut and Newark basins in eastern North America.  
 
Sediment supply from the adjacent highlands of the uplifted fault blocks is 
usually abundant, although in the East African rifts the land slope is away 
from the rim of the highlands, and surprisingly little sediment reaches the rift 
basins. 

 
size, shape:  long, narrow, linear; tens of kilometers wide, up to a few thousand 
kilometers long 

 
sediment fill:  Coarse to fine siliciclastics, usually nonmarine; often lacustrine 
sediments; interbedded basalts

processes:  This category of basins is transitional between intracontinental rift 
basins, described above, and passive-margin basins, described below.  Basins 
described here have opened wide enough to begin to be floored with oceanic 
crust but are still so narrow that the environment is either still nonmarine or, 
if marine, has restricted circulation.  Modern examples are the Red Sea and 
the Gulf of Aden.  In the ancient, the sediment fill of such a basin is likely to 
underlie passive-margin sediments deposited later in the history of ocean 
opening.

processes:  As an ocean basin opens by spreading, the zone of heating and ex-
tensional thinning of continental crust on either side of the ocean basin sub-
sides slowly by cooling.  Sediments, either siliciclastics derived from land or 
carbonates generated in place, cover this subsiding transition from conti-
nental crust to oceanic crust with a wedge of sediment to build what we see 
today as the continental shelf and slope.  In the context of the ancient, this 
represents the miogeocline.  The subsidence is accentuated by loading of the 
deposited sediments, resulting in a prominent downbowing of the continental 
margin.  Deposition itself therefore does not take place in a basinal geometry, 
but the base of the deposit is distinctively concave upward. 
 
size, shape:  Straight to piecewise straight, often with considerable irregularity in 
detail; a few hundreds of kilometers wide, thousands of kilometers long. 
 
sediment fill:  Overlying and overlapping the earlier deposits laid down earlier 
during rifting and initial opening are extensive shallow-marine siliciclastics 
and carbonates of the continental shelf, thickening seaward.  These sediments 
pass gradually or abruptly into deeper marine fine sediments of the 
continental slope and rise,  often grading or interfingering seaward into deep-
marine coarse and fine siliciclastics or resedimented carbonates in the form 
of turbidites building submarine fans at the base of the slope and filling the 
deepest parts of the ocean basin to form abyssal plains.

tectonic and sedimentary processes:  (1) Open-ocean pelagic sediments (mainly 
abyssal brown clay and organic oozes) are conveyor-belted to the trench, and 
underlie the sediments, thin to thick, deposited in the trench itself.  (2) What 
happens to the sediments delivered to or deposited in the trench?  While still 
within the trench they are little deformed, but they don’t stay that way long.  
They are either scraped off the descending plate to form an accretionary 
wedge, whose structure ranges from chaotically mixed material in a 
subduction mélange to a fairly regular imbricated succession of 
underthrusted sheets dipping toward the arc (note:  the thrust sheets 
themselves get younger downward, but within a given plate the sediments get 
younger upward), or they are dragged down the subduction zone.  The extent 
of the latter process is controversial, but cases have been described.    

 
size, shape:  long and narrow (tens of kilometers wide, thousands of kilomeeters 
long), arcuate, with convex side toward the oncoming subducted plate. 

 

sediment fill:  varies from thin (hundreds of meters) pelagic sediments (fine 
abyssal muds, volcanic ash) to thick (thousands of meters) arc-derived coarse 
 
siliciclastics and volcaniclastics, as local fans built perpendicular to the 
trench axis or oblong fanlike bodies built parallel to trench axis.

8.8  Trench-Slope Basins 
 
location and tectonic setting:  On the inner (arcward) wall of subduction-zone 
trenches (Figures 11-7, 11-8). 

 
tectonic and sedimentary processes:  The basins are formed as low areas, with 
closed contours, between adjacent thrust sheets in the growing accretionary 
wedge.  Near-surface folding of sediment in the accretionary wedge may also 
be a factor in the development of the basins.  These basins intercept some of 
the sediment carried as turbidity currents from upraised older parts of the 
accretionary complex, or from the more distant arc itself. 
 
size, shape:  Small (no larger than kilometers wide, tens of kilometers long, often 
smaller);  linear, and elongated parallel to the trench. 
 
sediment fill:  deep-marine silts and muds sedimented directly into the basins or 
slumped into the basins from higher on the slope; also coarser siliciclastics 
supplied from farther upslope by turbidity currents. 
 
8.9  Fore-Arc Basins 
 
location and tectonic setting:  In subduction zones (Figures 11-7, 11-8); between 
the upraised subduction complex just inboard of the trench and the volcanic 
arc (in the case of ocean-ocean subduction) or the overriding continent (in the 
case of ocean–continent subduction). 

 
processes:  As subduction proceeds, a relatively low area, usually below sea level, 
is formed between the relatively high outer arc upraised by subduction and 
the inner volcanic arc built by subduction magmatism.  Ancient examples of 
such fore-arc basins are likely to be tectonically isolated from the originally 
adjacent areas.  After an arc–continent collision, another variant of fore-arc 
basin can be formed between the outer arc and the overriding continent.  
These basins are likely to be filled mainly from the high land of the 
tectonically active continent.  Later continent–continent collision would 
make direct reconstruction of their tectonic setting difficult. 
 
size, shape:  tens of kilometers to over one hundred kilometers wide, up to 
thousands of kilometers long; commonly arcuate.

sediment fill:  nonmarine siliciclastic fluvial to deltaic deposits at the arcward 
margin pass seaward into deep marine siliciclastics, mainly sediment-gravity-
flow deposits, all interbedded with arc-derived volcanics flows and py-
roclastics.  Section thickness can be many thousands of meters.    
 
8.10  Foreland Basins 
 
location, tectonic setting, processes:  There are two kinds of foreland basins:  
retro-arc foreland basins, which are formed on stable continental crust by 
loading by thrust sheets moving toward the continental interior as a result of 
compression and crustal shortening in an ocean–continent subduction zone, 
and peripheral foreland basins, formed after continent–continent collisions 
by loading of the continental crust of the subducted plate by development of 
thrust sheets in the continental crust of the subducted plate directed back 
away from the subduction zone (Figures 11-7, 11-8).  Both kinds tend to be 
asymmetrical, with their deepest parts nearest the emplaced thrust sheets.  
They tend to migrate away from the arc or suture zone with time.  They are 
filled by sediments derived from the mountainous terrain associated with the 
compression and thrusting.   

 
size, shape:  tens to a few hundreds of kilometers wide, hundreds to thousands of 
kilometers long; often with varying development along their length; 
commonly arcuate or piecewise arcuate, reflecting the geometry of 
subduction. 

 
sediment fill:  Coarse fluvial siliciclastics, mainly as alluvial fans, thinning and 
fining away from the arc or suture, often passing into shallow-marine 
sandstone–shale successions if sea level is high enough to flood the basin.  
Thicknesses are up to many thousands of meters.  The classic molasse facies, 
thick nonmarine conglomerates, is deposited in foreland basins.  
 
8.11  Remnant Basins 
 
location and tectonic setting:  within suture zones formed by continent–continent 
collision (Figures 11-8, 11-9).

processes:  Continental margins and subduction zones are (for different reasons, 
connected with geometry of rifting and geometry of subduction) commonly 
irregular in plan rather than straight, so when continent–continent collision 
eventually comes to pass, certain salients of continental crust encounter the 
subduction zone before reentrants.  With further subduction and suturing, this 
creates isolated basins still floored by residual oceanic crust, which receive 
abundant sediment from adjacent strongly uplifted crust. 
 
size, shape:  many tens to hundreds of kilometers across; irregular in shape. 
 
sediment fill:  very thick and highly varied, with strong lateral facies changes; 
usually fluvial at the margins, commonly passing into deep-marine sediment-
gravity-flow deposits; sometimes the basin becomes sealed off from the 
ocean, so that facies include lacustrine sediments. 
 
8.12  Pull-Apart Basins 
 
location and tectonic setting:  Locally along major strike-slip or transform faults, 
either in continental crust or in oceanic crust (Figure 11-9). 
 
processes:  If a strike-slip fault is stepped or curved rather than straight, 
movement along it tends to produce tension, where the sense of the curvature 
and movement are such that the walls of the fault are pulled apart from one 
another (this kind of regime is described as transtensile), or compression, 

 302

where the sense of the curvature and movement are such that the walls are 
pushed against one another (this kind of regime is described as trans-
pressive).  In the tensional segments, gaps or basins are produced which are 
filled with sediment from adjacent high crust. 
 
size, shape:  There is a strong tendency for pull-apart basins to be rhomboidal.  
They range from approximately equidimensional early in their history to 
elongated later.  Widths are kilometers to a few tens of kilometers, and 
lengths are kilometers to many tens of kilometers.  Some basins are even 
smaller than this. 

 
sediment fill:  The continental-crust basins, which are the most significant 
sedimentologically, are filled by thick nonmarine to marine coarse to fine 
clastics, often as alluvial fans passing into lake deposits or into deposits of 
restricted marine environments.  In some cases thick marine turbidites fill the 
distal parts of the basin.  There is usually sharp variation in facies laterally, 
and the thickness of the lithologic units may be not much greater than the 
lateral extent, or even less.  Deposition is concurrent with elongation of the 
basin, so be wary of total section thickness computed by bed-by-bed 
measurements of the section.  

 
9.  LITERATURE 
 
9.1  Here are some literature sources on sedimentary basins. Some of these 
are textbooks or monographs, others are collections that are outgrowths of sym-
posia.  I haven’t listed individual papers on the sedimentology, stratigraphy, 
tectonics, or geophysics of sedimentary basins, but you can find references to most 
of them in the sources listed below.  These sources thus would provide you an 
efficient entry into the literature on sedimentary basins.
