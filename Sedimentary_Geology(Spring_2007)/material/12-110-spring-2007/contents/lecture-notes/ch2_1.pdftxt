1.  A FLUID DYNAMICS FIELD TRIP 
 
1.1  Introduction 
 
1.1.1    In  dealing with  the  production  and  significance of  flow-produced  sed-
imentary  structures  and  textures,  it  helps  to  know  something  about  the  flows  in 
which  they  were  produced.    On  the  other  hand,  we  can't  assume  that  you've  had 
courses  in fluid dynamics.   So here's some relatively painless background on fluid 
dynamics. 
1.1.2  What we've done here is imagine that we are out looking at the flow in 
a  large  river  and  provide  some  qualitative material  on  the most  important  aspects 
of  the  flow  that  you  could  observe  for  yourselves.    That  should  go  a  long  way 
toward providing important background without spending inordinate time. 
 
1.2  Variables 
 
1.2.1  Two of the most important physical properties of fluids are density and 
viscosity.  The density of a fluid, denoted by ρ, is the mass of fluid per unit volume 
of  fluid.    The  density  of  water  is  very  close  to  one  gram  per  cubic  centimeter  (1 
g/cm3) or one thousand kilograms per cubic meter (103 kg/m3).  The density of air 
at sea level and room temperature is far smaller, by a factor of about 800.   
1.2.2    The  viscosity  of  a  fluid,  usually  denoted  by μ,  is  a measure  of  the  re-
sistance of the fluid to deformation.  Imagine that you sheared a fluid by placing it 
between  two  parallel  plates  and  then  moving  the  plates  parallel  to  each  other 
(Figure  2-1).    The  greater  the  relative  speed  of  the  plates,  the  greater  the  force 
needed  to  maintain  the  shearing  of  the  fluid.    The  viscosity  is  the  coefficient  as-
sociated with  the  ratio between  the  force  (measured per unit area  in  the planes of 
shear)  that  resists  the  shearing,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  rate  of  shearing,  on  the 
other hand.

1.2.3   One more  fluid  property,  the  specific weight,  usually  denoted  by γ,  is 
important when  the  fluid  is  in  a  gravitational  field,  as  on  the Earth's  surface.   The 
specific weight is the weight of the fluid per unit volume of fluid. 
1.2.4    There's  a wealth  of  variables  you  can  use  to  describe  the  flow.    Some 
are more  concrete  and  easy  to  understand  than  others.   On  the  one  hand,  you  can 
think about the velocity of the flow, and on the other hand, you can think about the 
force per unit area the flow exerts on its boundary.   
1.2.5    With  regard  to  velocity,  if  you  occupied  any  point  in  the  flow  that's 
fixed  relative  to  the  boundaries  and  used  a magic  little  velocity meter  to measure 
the  local  fluid  velocity,  you'd  get  some  stable  local  time-averaged  velocity  if  you 
continued  your  measurement  for  a  fairly  long  time.    This  time-average  local  ve-
locity varies continuously from point to point all over the cross section of the flow 
(Figure 2-2); more on what that distribution of local velocity looks like presently. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.2.6    You  can  take  the  average  of  all  the  local  velocities  all  over  the  flow 
cross section  to get a mean  flow velocity U  (Figure 2-3).    In  real rivers  this  is how 
it's  actually  done,  but  in  laboratory  channels,  where  it's  easy  to  know  the  water 
discharge (the volume rate of flow), you can use the relationship Q = U A, where Q 
is the discharge and A is the area of the flow cross section, to find U.

You  could  also  measure  the  surface  velocity  Us  along  the 
centerline of  the  flow  (Figure 2-4).   This  is greater  than  the mean 
velocity, by a  factor of  something  like 1.2 or 1.3;  it's  related  to U 
in  a  rather  complex  way 
that  needn't  concern  us  here.  
Incidentally,  unless  the  channel  is  very  wide  compared  with  the 
depth  of  flow  the  position  of  maximum  velocity  on  the  cross 
section lies a little below the surface.   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

1.2.8  The boundary shear stress τo is a little trickier to deal with than veloc-
ity,  and  is  less  concrete  to  visualize,  but  it's  important  for  the  obvious  reason  that 
it's what exerts forces on the sediment particles on the bed.  
1.2.9    Let's  backtrack  a  little  to  point  out  something  about  the  flow  near  the 
boundary that may seem counterintuitive to you, but stands as a firmly established 
fact  of  observation:    fluid  in  direct  contact  with  a  solid  boundary  has  exactly  the 
same  velocity  as  that  solid  boundary.    That's  called  the  no-slip  condition.    In  the 
context of our river flow, it means that the water right at the bed has zero velocity.  
But of course  there's an  increase  in velocity upward  from  the bed, so all  the water 
above  the  bed,  no  matter  how  small  a  distance  above,  generally  has  a  nonzero 
velocity.   
1.2.10    The  reason  we've  brought  in  the  no-slip  condition  here  is  this:    the 
origin  of  shear  stresses  in  fluids  is  just  the  existence  of  shearing  itself.    The 
stronger  the  shearing,  the  greater  the  shear  stress  that's  generated,  other  things 
being  equal.    And  foremost  among  those  other  things  is  the  viscosity,  introduced 
above:    the viscosity  is  just  the  coefficient  that  relates  the  shear  stress  to  the  shear 
in a given fluid.   
1.2.11  So, back to the boundary shear stress τo.  It's true that if you could get 
right  down  close  to  any  point  on  the  bed,  you  could  (with  the  right  instrument, 
which doesn't actually exist!) measure a local shearing force per unit area the flow 
exerts  on  the  solid  boundary.   That  fits  the  term  "boundary  shear  stress" well,  but 
it's not what's conventionally meant by  the boundary shear stress.   What you have 
to do  is  take a spatial average of  the  local downstream-directed component of  the 
fluid force acting on the bed over an area large enough to include a large number 
of representative "roughness elements" (sediment particles or bed forms).   

 31

 

 

 

 

    

1.2.12    Finally  there's  the matter  of  flow  power.   There's  a  school  of  thought 
(with  which  I  don't  agree)  that  the  flow  power  is  the  most  fundamental  determi-
nant  of  sediment  transport.   We'll  just  state  to  you,  without  further  development, 
that  in  a  channel  flow  like  a  river  the  flow  power  comes  out  to  be  equal  to  the 
product of the boundary shear stress τo and the mean velocity U.  Those of you so 
inclined might try your hand at figuring that out from the first principles embodied 
in Newton's laws; it's not as formidable as it seems at first thought.    
  
1.3  Why Do Fluids Move? 
 
1.3.1    The  movement  of  fluids  is  part  of  the  experience  of  our  daily  lives.  
But  it's  important  to  think  for  a  moment  about  why  fluids  move.    According  to 
Newton's  first  law,  a  body  moves  in  a  state  of  uniform  motion  (changing  neither 
speed  nor  direction)  unless  it  is  acted  upon  by  some  force.    Moving  fluids  are 
always  acted  upon  by  friction,  so  they  come  to  rest  unless  some  other  force  is 
available to offset the friction and keep them in motion.   
 
         1.3.2  Two important kinds of forces drive fluid motions: 
 
θ 
The force of gravity.  In a flow down a sloping channel, the weight of 
an  element  of  fluid  has  a  downslope  component  (Figure  2-5).    This 
downslope  component  of  fluid  weight  counterbalances  the  frictional 
resistance exerted on the fluid by the bottom boundary. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
θ 

Pressure  gradients.    In  a  flow  in  a  horizontal  pipe  or  conduit,  the 
fluid  moves  only  if  there's  a  downstream  decrease  in  fluid  pressure.  
To see why  this causes  the  fluid  to move,  look at an element of fluid 
in  the  pipe  (Figure  2-6).    If  there's  a  downstream  pressure  gradient 
(that is, the pressure decreases in the downstream direction), then the 
force on the upstream face of the element is greater than the force on 
the  downstream  face.    The  difference  in  forces  on  the  upstream  and 
downstream  faces  is  a  force  directed downstream.   This downstream 

 32

 

 

 

 

    

force counterbalances the frictional resistance exerted on the fluid by 
the walls of the pipe.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

  
1.3.3  In a general fluid flow, both of these kinds of forces (downslope gravity 
components and downstream pressure gradients) can be present at  the same  time, 
and the fluid moves under their combined effect. 
 
1.4  Channel Flows 
 
1.4.1  Now let's think about what the flow really looks like in a large channel 
flow  like  a  river.    The  basic  picture  is  as  shown  in  Figure  2-5:    there's  a  balance 
between  the  downchannel  pull  of  gravity  on  the  fluid,  which  acts  throughout  the 
flow  (in  some  physics  course  you  may  have  heard  gravity  described  as  a  "body 
force")  and  the  resistance  force  the  bed  and  banks  exert  on  the  flowing  fluid, 
which  is  equal  and  opposite  to  the  boundary  shear  stress  we  discussed  above.    A 
natural  consequence  of  the  action  of  these  two  different  forces—gravity  acting 
throughout  the  fluid  and  the  resistance  force  acting  only  at  the  boundary—is  that 
the  velocity  increases  upward  in  the  flow,  from  zero  at  the  boundary,  by  the  no-
slip condition, to a maximum at or near the surface.  
  
1.4.2   That's only  the  crudest  first-order picture,  though:    the question comes 
naturally  to  mind:    what  are  the  details  of  the  distribution  of  time-average  local 
flow velocity over  the entire cross section of  the  flow?   That's much  too  intricate a 
question for us to pursue here, so we'll just hit the high points.  
 
1.4.3    It's  simplest  to  think  about  a  river  with  a  large  width-to-depth  ratio, 
which  is  usually  the  case.    Then  we  can  forget  about  the  effect  of  the  banks.    A 
straightforward  application  of  Newton's  laws  shows  that  the  distribution  of  ve-
locity  should  be  parabolic  (Figure  2-7A),  with  the  vertex  of  one  limb  of  a 
parabola located at the surface.

Figure 2-7: Laminar and turbulent velocity profiles in channel flow 
 
1.4.4   But  if  you went  out  and measured  the  local  time-average  velocity  at  a 
series  of  points  along  a  vertical  from  the  surface  down  to  the  bottom,  you'd  find 
the  actual  distribution  to  be  far  from  parabolic:    the  distribution  would  be  much 
more  uniform  over  most  of  the  flow  depth,  and  the  necessary  decrease  to  zero  at 
the  boundary  would  be  in  a  very  thin  zone  right  next  to  the  boundary.    The  dis-
tribution  would  closely  approximate  a  logarithmic  distribution  (Figure  2-7B),  for 
reasons that go way beyond the scope of this course.  
1.4.5    This  discrepancy  has  to  do  with  the  difference  between  laminar  flow 
and  turbulent  flow,  which  we're  sure  you've  all  heard  about  one  way  or  another.  
Channel  flows  that  are  very  shallow  and/or  very  slow-flowing  (like  sheet  flow  or 
overland  flow on  the  land  surface during and after a  rain) are characterized by  the 
regular  and  locally  rectilinear  flow  trajectories  of  laminar  flow  (Figure  2-8A), 
whereas  channel  flows  that  are  deeper  and/or  faster-moving  (almost  all 
channelized  flows  fall  into  this  category)  show  the  irregularly  sinuous  flow  tra-
jectories characteristic of turbulent flow (Figure 2-8B).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4.6    Turbulence  isn't  easy  to  describe.    But  because  it's  such  an  important 
aspect of sediment transport, we'll attempt to give you a qualitative picture of what 
turbulence is like in a flow like in a channel flow.  One way of studying turbulence 
is  to  make  a  continuous  measurement  of  velocity  as  a  function  of  time  at  a  fixed 
point in the flow.  You'd obtain a record that looks something like the graph shown 
in  Figure  2-9:    velocity  fluctuations  with  a  range  of  magnitudes  and  time  scales 

 34

 

 

 

 

    

would  be  present  around  the  time-average  velocity.    Another  way  of  seeing  the 
turbulence  is  to  release  small  neutrally  buoyant markers  from  some  fixed  point  in 
the  flow and watch  them move downstream  (Figure 2-10).   The  trajectories would 
be  irregularly  sinuous,  with  angles  of  deviation  from  the  downstream  direction 
amounting  to no more  than several degrees.   Each  trajectory would be different  in 
detail from all of the others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4.7    The  best  way  to  see  the  turbulence,  however,  is  to  sprinkle  the  flow 
with  magic  powder  that  allows  you  to  see  the  eddies  (Figure  2-11).    You'd  see 
rotating  swirls  of  fluid  that  grade  continuously  into  one  another  and  that  change 
their  shape  continuously  with  time.    Individual  eddies  retain  their  identity  for  a 
certain period of time (larger eddies live longer than smaller eddies) but any given 

 35

 

 

 

 

    

eddy  eventually  becomes  unrecognizable  and  is  replaced  with  newly  developed 
swirls.   The  flowing surface of a  river carrying fine sediment  in suspension shows 
eddies moving up to the water surface to spread out and flatten themselves.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
1.4.8   The maximum vertical  scale of  eddies  in  the  flow  is not much  smaller 
than  the  depth  of  the  flow,  and  the  maximum  cross-flow  scale  is  even  larger.  
There's  a  continuous  range  of  sizes  down  to  very  small  eddies,  of  the  order  of 
fractions  of  a  millimeter.    The  smaller  eddies  are  superimposed  on  the  larger  ed-
dies.  As the large eddies sweep along the boundary they cause periods of stronger 
flow and weaker flow.   When you're standing on a broad plain or on the deck of a 
ship  at  sea,  the  wind  gusts  you  feel  are  a  manifestation  of  these  large  eddies 
affecting  the  flow boundary.   Have you ever watched a broad  field of  tall grass or 
grain  in  a  strong  wind  from  a  point  high  above?    You'd  see  a  striking  pattern  of 
wind gusts moving along in the direction of the wind as they sway the grass. 
1.4.9    Here's  an  interesting  but  incidental  aspect  of  turbulence  in  a  channel 
flow.    In  terms  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  flow,  the  total  kinetic  energy  is  held 
partly in the mean flow and partly in the turbulent eddies that are superimposed on 
that mean  flow.   As  the  large  eddies  keep  forming  from  the mean  flow,  they  take 
some  of  the  kinetic  energy  of  the mean  flow  with  them.    The  natural  tendency  is 
for  the  bigger  eddies  to  subdivide  themselves  into  smaller  eddies—have  you  ever 
seen  it  work  the  other  way  around?—so  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  turbulence  is 
inevitably passed down to smaller and smaller eddy scales, finally to be dissipated 
into heat mainly at the smallest eddy scales, where (it turns out) the local shearing 
is  strongest.    This  is  picturesquely  called  the  energy  cascade.    (In  case  you're 
wondering  how  the  mean  flow  replenishes  its  mechanical  energy,  it  gets  it  from 
the loss of potential energy as the fluid moves downslope.)           

 36

 

 

 

 

    

 1.4.10   Returning  now  to  the  important  qualitative  difference  between  lami-
nar  and  turbulent  velocity  distributions,  in  turbulent  flow  the  velocity  distribution 
is  much  more  uniform  over  most  of  the  thickness  of  the  flow,  but  changes  much 
more sharply very close to the boundary.  It's easy to understand why this is so.  In 
turbulent  flow,  over  most  of  the  flow  depth  the  lateral  motions  of  eddies  tend  to 
even  out  the  differences  in  time-average  velocity  from  layer  to  layer.    This  is 
essentially a matter of diffusion of  fluid momentum.    (Diffusion,  remember,  is  the 
flux of  some property by  random motions  in  the present of a gradient  in  the mean 
value  of  that  property.)   As we move  closer  and  closer  to  the  boundary,  however, 
the  fluid  motions  perpendicular  to  the  boundary  are  more  and  more  restricted—
because  remember  that  right  at  the boundary  the  fluid velocity must match  that of 
the  boundary,  so  there  can  be  no  component  of  velocity  normal  to  the  boundary 
there.  In a thin layer next to the boundary, therefore, the turbulence can't even out 
the  differences  in  velocity  from  layer  to  layer,  so  the  gradient  of  velocity  is  very 
steep.   This  layer next  to  the boundary, where viscous shearing  is more  important 
than  turbulence,  could  be  called  the  viscosity-dominated  layer  (Figure  2-12).    Its 
thickness  is  typically  a  very  small  percentage  of  the  flow  depth,  no  more  than 
millimeters to at most a few centimeters.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.4.11    But  there's  more  to  this  matter  than  meets  the  eye.    The  above  is  a 
good  picture  when  the  roughness  elements  on  the  bed  (sediment  particles  and/or 
bed  forms)  are  small  enough  to  be  embedded  within  this  viscosity-dominated 
layer.    This  is  called  dynamically  smooth  flow—even  though  the  boundary  may 
be  physically  rough  (Figure  2-13A).    But  in  many  cases  the  roughness  elements 
are  taller  than  what  the  thickness  of  the  viscosity-dominated  layer  would  be  if 
there  were  a  continuous  viscosity-dominated  layer  in  the  first  place.    You'll  have 
to  bear  with  that  rather  complicated  verbal  construction,  because  we're  dealing 
now  with  a  situation  in  which  the  roughness  elements  stick  up  into  the  turbulent 
part  of  the  flow  and  there's  no  longer  an  overall,  continuous  viscosity-dominated 
layer.  But keep in mind that there's still a local viscosity-dominated layer, or even 
just a film, at the surfaces of all the roughness elements themselves.   This is called 
dynamically rough flow (Figure 2-13B).

1.5  Oscillatory Flows 
 
1.5.1  Everything in the preceding sections is relevant to unidirectional flow:  
a  current  that  moves  in  one  direction  only,  with  velocity  either  unchanging  with 
time  (steady  flow)  or  changing  somehow  with  time  (unsteady  flow).    Also 
important  in  the  transport of sediments  is oscillatory flow:   a current that reverses 
its direction periodically with time.  The approach in this section will be somewhat 
different  from  the  approach  in  the  preceding  sections:    we'll  concentrate more  on 
the origin and description of oscillatory flows than on their dynamics. 
1.5.2    Except  for  reversing  tidal  currents,  which  technically  are  oscillatory 
flows  with  very  long  oscillation  periods  but  which  are  better  considered  as  re-
versing unidirectional flows, almost all of the important oscillatory flows in nature 
are  caused  by  surface  gravity  waves  which  propagate  on  the  surfaces  of  oceans 
and  large  lakes.    Such  waves  are  called  surface  waves  because  they're  associated 
with  the  water  surface,  and  they're  called  gravity  waves  because  the  dominant 
force  involved  in  their  propagation  (the  force  which  attempts  to  restore  the 
deformed water surface to a planar condition) is the force of gravity.     

 38

 

 

 

 

    

1.5.3    The  generation  of  wind  waves  is  a  complex  process,  even  now  not 
fully understood, that involves both the shear stress of the moving air on the water 
surface  and  on  the  unequal  distribution  of  air  pressure  over  the  windward  and 
leeward  sides  of  geometrical  irregularities  on  the  water  surface.    We'll  note  here 
only that the size of the waves depends on three factors:  the speed of the wind, the 
duration  of  time  the  wind  acts  on  the  water  surface,  and  the  downwind  distance 
(called the fetch) over which the wind acts on the water surface.   
1.5.4  The best way to obtain an idea of the basic nature of the water motions 
produced by  surface gravity waves  is  to watch  the propagation of a  single  train of 
waves  in  a  wave  tank  (Figure  2-14).    You  can  imagine  building  a  long  tank  with 
rectangular cross section, perhaps several meters long, open at the top.  Put a wave 
generator  at  one  end.   A  board  hinged  to  the  bottom  of  the  tank  can  be  rocked  or 
oscillated  back  and  forth  to  produce  a  train  of  waves.    It's  best  to  install  some 
porous material at the other end of the tank to absorb the waves, so that they're not 
reflected to interfere with the propagating wave train. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5.5    Here  are  some  terms  used  to  describe  the  waves  in  a  simple  train  of 
waves  (Figure  2-15).    The  crest  of  the  wave  is  the  highest  point  on  the  wave 
profile,  and  the  trough  is  the  lowest  point  on  the wave  profile.   The  period  of  the 
wave is the time needed for one complete wave form to pass a point which is fixed 
relative  to  the  bottom  of  the  tank.    Surface  gravity waves  in  natural  environments 
have periods that range from less than a second to almost 20 s.  The wavelength of 
the waves is  the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough.  The height 
of  the  waves  is  the  vertical  distance  from  trough  to  crest.    The  heights  of  large 
waves generated by major storms are commonly in the range of five to ten meters, 
but they can be even larger.   
 

 39

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
        1.5.6    If  you  place  a  floating  cork  on  the water  surface  and watch  its motion 
through  the wall  of  the  tank  as  the waves pass by, you  see  that  the  cork  travels  in 
an  almost  perfectly  circular  orbit,  making  one  circle  during  the  passage  of  each 
wave  (Figure  2-16).    The  sense  of  motion  is  such  that  the  cork  moves  in  the  di-
rection of wave propagation while the crest of the wave is passing, and opposite to 
the direction of wave propagation while the trough of the wave is passing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1.5.7  The water below the surface also moves as the waves pass, but the size 
of  the  orbits  of  the  water  particles  decreases  very  rapidly  with  depth  below  the 
surface (Figure 2-17).   The size of  the orbits at a depth equal to half a wavelength 
is only about  ten percent of  the size of  the orbits at  the surface, and  the size of  the 
orbits at a depth equal to one full wavelength is negligible.  Such waves are called 
deep-water waves.    If  the wavelength of  the waves  is much greater  than  the water 
depth,  however,  the  size  of  the  orbits  is  still  appreciable  at  the  bottom  (Figure 
2-18).    Such waves  are  called  shallow-water waves,  and  they  are  common  during 
storms.   Downward from  the surface  the orbits become flattened  into ellipses with 
greater  and  greater  eccentricity,  until  at  the  very  bottom  the  orbits  are  back-and-
forth  straight  lines.    This  should  make  sense  to  you,  because  at  the  bottom  there 
can be no fluid motion perpendicular to the bottom—if the slight flow into and out 
of the porous sediment is ignored.

1.5.8    Now  examine more  closely  the  nature  of  the  oscillatory water motion 
at  the bottom.    If you measured  the  fluid velocity near  the bottom as a  function of 
time  at  a  point  which  is  fixed  relative  to  the  bottom,  you'd  obtain  a  record which 
looks  like  the  graph  in  Figure  2-19:    the  velocity  varies  sinusoidally  with  time.  
The nature of  the motion can be characterized by its period T, or by the maximum 
velocity Um which  is  attained  during  one  oscillation  cycle  (this happens when  the 
water  is at  the central point of  its oscillation path) or by  the distance do moved by 
a  water  particle  during  one  full  oscillation  (this  is  called  the  orbital  diameter).  
Only one of  the  latter  two quantities  is  independent, however, because  the period, 
the  maximum  velocity,  and  the  orbital  diameter  are  related  by  the  equation 
Um T =πdo.  This relation is easy to derive, but we won't do that here.

1.5.9    It's  part  of  the  physical  nature  of waves  that  different  trains of  surface 
gravity  waves  can  be  superimposed  on  each  other  in  such  a  way  that  the  water-
surface height and water motion at a given point  is  the  sum of  contributions  from 
each  superimposed  wave  train.   You might  know  from watching  storms  at  sea  or 
on large lakes that the sea state produced by a strong wind is complicated, because 
it's  a  superposition  of  a  large  number  of  separate  trains  of  waves  with  slightly 
different  periods,  propagation  directions,  and  heights.    Also,  when  the  wind 
direction  changes  as  a  storm  passes,  the  waves  adjust  their  direction  of 
propagation  in  response.    In  such  cases,  the  pattern  of  water  movement  at  the 
bottom  is  no  longer  a  simple  back-and-forth  movement.    Even  the  relatively 
simple  case  of  two  regular  trains  of  waves  moving  in  different  directions,  the 
bottom  water  movement  can  be  surprisingly  complicated,  to  say  nothing  of  the 
really complicated wave conditions produced during storms. 
 
1.6  The Wind 
 
1.6.1    The  large-scale  structure  of  the  lower  part  of  the  atmosphere  is  obvi-
ously  much  different  from  that  of  even  the  largest  river.    The  most  obvious  dif-
ference  is  the  absence  of  a  free  surface  in  the  atmosphere.   An  equally  important 
difference  has  to  do  with  the  much  larger  scale  of  wind  systems.    This  is  impor-
tant  because  the  Earth's  rotation  plays  a  dominant  role  in  determining  wind  di-
rection  but  is  a minor  aspect  of  even  the  largest  of  rivers.    A  third  important  dif-
ference  is  related  to  the  easy  compressibility  of  air,  in  contrast  to  the  incompress-
ibility  of water.    This means  that  the  thermodynamics  of  compressibility  plays  an 
enormous role in the behavior of the atmosphere. 
1.6.2    Despite  these  far-reaching  differences,  it's  fortunate  for  us  as 
Earthbound  sedimentologists  that  the  structure  of  the  wind  in  the  near-surface 
layer,  up  to  hundreds  or  even  a  few  thousands  of  meters  above  the  surface,  is 
usually  not  greatly  different  from  that  of  large-scale  channel  flows,  in  terms  of 
such  things  as  velocity  distribution,  turbulence  structure,  and  boundary  forces.  
Most  of  what  we  said  in  Section  1.4  above  for  channel  flows  of  water  is  largely 
applicable  to  the  wind.    This  is  especially  true  of  eolian  sand  transport  and  the 
shaping of sand dunes—certainly  the most  important aspect of eolian sedimentary 
processes for this course.   
1.6.3   You might  complain  that  the wind  is  so much more gusty  than  the or-
dinarily  turbulent  flow of  rivers.   We would  counter  that by  saying  that your  con-
ception  of  the  gustiness  of  the wind  is  shaped  by  observations made  for  the most 
part  down  in  among  large  and  very  irregularly  shaped  and  irregularly  distributed 
roughness  elements  like  trees,  hills,  and  buildings.    To  the  extent  things  like  that 
occupy river bottoms (hills are certainly  there, and we'll have to deal with them as 
a  really  important  part  of  this  course),  and  you  sensed  turbulence  down  at  their 
level,  flow  in  rivers  would  seem  pretty  "gusty"  too.      (There'll  be  more  on  that 
later,  when  we  talk  about  flow  over  subaqueous  bed  forms.)      If  you've  ever 
experienced  a  strong  wind  at  sea,  you  know  that  the  wind  unimpeded  by  large 
roughness elements is surprisingly steady.

2.  BASICS OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT 
 
2.1  Introduction 
 
2.1.1    It  seems  crazy  to  us  to  start  dealing  with  physical  sedimentary  struc-
tures  before  presenting  some  material  on  how  sediment  is  transported  and  de-
posited  in  the  first  place,  so  we've  included  this  second  background  chapter.    It's 
entirely  qualitative  but  deals  with  what  we  think  are  the  important  topics:    forces 
on  sediment  particles  resting  on  a  sediment  bed:  the  threshold  of  particle  move-
ment;  the nature of  the  sediment  load;  and  just  a bit on  transport  rates  and mixed-
size sediments.   

 
2.2  Forces on Particles 
   
2.2.1    You  saw  in  Chapter  2  that  a  fluid  flow  exerts  forces  on  its  solid 
boundary.    In  particular,  the  flow  exerts  forces  on  all  of  the  sediment  grains  ex-
posed at the surface of a loose sediment bed.  If the force exerted by the flow on a 
given  sediment  particle  is  momentarily  great  enough,  the  particle  is  set  into 
motion.    This  section  presents  a  brief  discussion  of  the  nature  of  fluid  forces  on 
sediment particles resting on the sediment bed.   
 
2.2.2  Look at the flow around an isolated hemisphere on an otherwise planar 
boundary  (Figure  2-20).    This  is  a  simplified  but  qualitatively  representative 
model  for  the more  complicated  forces on particles of  irregular  shape  resting on a 
bed of similar particles. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

        
 2.2.3  The forces acting on the smooth surface of the hemisphere are of two kinds, 
viscous  forces  and  pressure  forces.    Viscous  forces  are  exerted  tangential  to  the 
solid  surface.    They  are  present  because  the  fluid  is  undergoing  shear  next  to  the 
solid  surface  (Figure  2-21A).    Remember  that  whenever  a  fluid  is  sheared,  a 
viscous  resistance  force  is  present.    Pressure  forces  are  easier  to  understand.  
Fluids  exert  pressure  within  themselves  and  also  on  all  solid  boundaries.    On  the 
solid  boundaries  the  fluid  pressure  is  manifested  as  a  force  per  unit  area  acting 
perpendicular to the boundary (Figure 2-21B).

2.2.4    Both  the  viscous  forces  and  the  pressure  forces  vary  from  point  to 
point all over the surface of the hemisphere in Figure 2-20.  To find the total force 
or  resultant  force  exerted  by  the  fluid  on  the  hemisphere,  you  need  to  sum  or 
integrate both kinds of forces over the surface of the hemisphere.  Although this is 
easy  to  do  in  one's  imagination,  in  practice  it's  difficult  even  for  very  large 
hemispheres, and it's impossible for tiny sediment particles.          
 
2.2.5  The nature of the forces on a bed particle depends very strongly on the 
height of  the hemisphere relative  to  the  thickness of the viscosity-dominated layer.  
If  the  height  of  the  hemisphere  is  much  smaller  than  the  thickness  of  the  viscous 
sublayer (Figure 2-22A), the flow around the particle is only weakly turbulent, and 
the  forces  exerted  by  the  flow  are  approximately  the  same  as  in  laminar  flow.    If 
the  height  of  the  hemisphere  is  much  greater  than  the  thickness  of  the  viscous 
sublayer (Figure 2-22B), the flow around the hemisphere is strongly turbulent, and 
also the flow pattern is greatly different.

2.2.6   Figure 2-23 is a cartoon showing the flow and forces around the hemi-
sphere  when  it's  embedded  in  the  viscous  sublayer.    The  flow  pattern  shows 
streamlines  diverging  smoothly  in  front  of  the  hemisphere,  converging  at  the 
midsection, and diverging again behind the hemisphere.  Turbulence in the flow is 
weak,  and  the  presence  of  the  hemisphere  itself  does  not  create  any  new  turbu-
lence.    The  fluid  pressure  is  relatively  high  on  the  front  of  the  hemisphere  and 
relatively  low  on  the  back,  resulting  in  a  net  downstream  pressure  force.    It  turns 
out  that  the  viscous  forces  and  the  pressure  forces  are  of  about  the  same  magni-
tude.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

      
 
   2.2.7    Figure  2-24  is  the  corresponding  cartoon  showing  the  flow  and  forces 
around  the  hemisphere  when  it  protrudes  high  above  the  viscous  sublayer.    The 

 45

 

 

 

 

    

streamlines diverge smoothly in front of the hemisphere, but instead of converging 
again  they  separate  from  the  surface  of  the  hemisphere  at  the  midsection  and 
shoot  off  into  the  flow,  leaving  a  region  of  stagnant  fluid  behind  the  hemisphere.  
This phenomenon  is  called  flow  separation.   Flow  separation  is  inevitable  around 
blunt  bodies  when  the  flow  is  fast  and  the  body  is  large.    Flow  separation  is 
characteristic  of  buildings  in  the  wind  and  trucks  on  the  road,  as  well  as  of  bed 
forms  and  large  sediment  particles.    The  pressure  in  the  stagnant  fluid  behind  the 
hemisphere  is  very  low  everywhere,  so  the  resultant  pressure  force  on  the  hemi-
sphere is very large, much larger than the viscous force.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2.2.8    Note  in  Figures  2-23  and  2-24  that  because  the  pressure  is  relatively 
low  at  the  top  of  the  hemisphere  and  relatively  high  around  its  base,  there's  a  lift 
component  to  the  resultant  force.    This  is  exactly  the  same  kind  of  lift  force  that 
acts  on  airplane  wings.    The  lift  force  can  be  almost  equal  to  the  downstream 
component of the resultant force (which is called the drag). 
2.2.9    Let  us  remind  you  that  the  forces  on  the  hemisphere  would  vary 
sharply  with  time,  because  of  the  passage  of  larger  eddies  near  the  boundary.  
Forces  can  vary  by  factors  of  four  or  even  more  with  time.    The  time  scales  for 
change in forces on a sediment particle can be very short, fractions of a second.

2.3  Threshold of Movement 
 
2.3.1   One of  the classic problems  in sediment transport is that of the thresh-
old  of movement,  or  incipient movement:    how  strong  a  flow  is  needed  to  set  the 
particles of a given sediment bed in motion?  This problem is obviously important 
for  engineering  purposes.    An  equivalent  problem,  which  is  more  relevant  to 
geology,  is  that  of  competence:    how  coarse  a  sediment  can  be moved  by  a  given 
flow? 
2.3.2      The  problem  of  incipient movement  should  be  one  of  the  simplest  in 
sediment  transport mechanics, because  the  sediment hasn't yet  started  to move,  so 
the  structure  of  turbulence  and  the  pattern  of  fluid  forces  are  not  complicated  by 
the  presence  of  moving  grains.    Actually  the  problem  turns  out  to  be  mostly  in-
tractable  theoretically,  and  both  engineers  and  sedimentologists  have  relied  upon 
empirical approaches. 
2.3.3    Our  common  sense  tells  us  that  stronger  flows  are  needed  to  move 
coarser  sediment.    In  this  case,  our  common  sense  is  correct!    (That's  not  always 
true,  especially  in  sediment  transport mechanics.)   But  to  know  just  how  strong  a 
flow is needed to move a given sediment, observation and experiment are needed.   
2.3.4      Obviously  the  sorting  and  particle  shape  are  important,  because  the 
details of the fluid forces on the particles depend both on the particle shape and on 
how  the  uppermost  particles  rest  upon  the  underlying  particles.    In  dealing  with 
the  movement  threshold,  it's  usually  assumed  that  the  sediment  is  naturally  well 
sorted, and equant and subrounded in shape.  Not much work has been done on the 
effect of sorting and shape on the threshold of movement. 
2.3.5   The  threshold conditions  should depend on  independent variables  that 
describe  the  flow,  the  fluid,  and  the  sediment.    Either  the  bed  shear  stress  or  the 
flow  velocity  could  be  used  to  describe  the  flow.    The  trouble  with  using  the  ve-
locity  is  that  it's  not  clear  which  velocity  to  use:    the  velocity  at  the  level  of  the 
tops  of  the  particles,  which  is  impossible  to  measure  or  estimate,  or  some  other 
velocity like the mean velocity of flow.  The problem with using the mean velocity 
is that then the flow depth must also be considered, because many combinations of 
flow depth and  flow velocity are equivalent  to a given boundary shear stress.   But 
it's easier for us to attach concrete significance to the flow velocity than to the bed 
shear stress. 
 
2.3.6    The  best  way  to  approach  the  problem  of  initiation  of motion  empiri-
cally  is  to  decide  which  are  the  most  important  variables  that  govern  whether 
particles  are moved  or  not  by  the  flow  and  then plot  a graph  that  separates  condi-
tions  of  no movement  from  conditions  of movement  (by  a  curve  in  a  two-dimen-
sional graph or a surface in a three-dimensional graph).   
 
2.3.7    In  the  general  problem,  lots  of  variables  might  be  important:    the 
density ρ and  the viscosity μ of  the  fluid,  the diameter D of  the sediment particles 
(to  say  nothing  of  sorting  and  particle  shape),  and  the  strength  of  the  flow,  best 
characterized by the bed shear stress τo.   But for flows of water-density fluid over 
quartz  density  sediment  (and  let's  assume  that  sorting  and  shape  are  of  secondary 
importance, which  is  probably  true  for  "ordinary"  sediments),  then only D  and τo 

 47

 

 

 

 

    

vary.  So we can get away nicely with a two-dimensional graph of boundary shear 
stress  against  sediment  size.    The  curve  that  separates  movement  and  no 
movement is called the threshold curve.   
 
2.3.8    If  you  read  the  literature  on  sediment  movement  you're  likely  to  see 
mention of  the Shields diagram, which  is a similar graph but arranged  in a special 
dimensionless  form  that's  applicable  (in  theory!)  to  all  combinations  of  fluids  and 
sediments.  What we're doing here is a shortcut but essentially the same thing.  
    
2.3.9    Figure  2-25  shows  the  threshold  curve  for  quartz  sediment  in  water.  
There's still the problem of concretely visualizing the boundary shear stress.  Mean 
flow  velocity would  be much  better  for  that,  but  then  the  problem  is  that  there's  a 
slightly  different  curve  for  each  flow  depth,  because  there's  a  whole  range  of 
combinations  of  flow  depth  and  flow  velocity  that  five  the  same  boundary  shear 
stress.   Figure 2-26  shows  three  threshold  curves  for quartz  in water  in  a graph of 
mean flow velocity against sediment size, for flow depths of 0.1 m, 1 m, and 10 m.  
Figure  2-26  should  give  you  a  concrete  idea  of  threshold  conditions  in  water 
flows.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
2.3.10    The  data  that  have  been  used  to  find  the  curves  in  Figures  2-25  and 
2-26  show  quite  a  lot  of  scatter.    This  is  mainly  because  the  range  of  flow 
conditions  for  which  there  is  slight  sediment  movement  is  very  wide.    In  other 
words,  it's  difficult  to  define  the  threshold  of  movement.    You  could  observe  this 
for  yourself  by  preparing  a  planar  sediment  bed  in  a  laboratory  channel  and  then 
passing  a  flow  of  water  over  it.    As  you  gradually  increase  the  flow  strength, 

 48

 

 

 

 

    

eventually  there's  slight grain movement,  in  the  form of pulses or gusts at  random 
points  on  the  bed  where  one  or  more  grains  are  moved  by  a  locally  strong  eddy.  
As you continue  to  increase  the flow strength, the frequency of the pulses or gusts 
increases, and the number of grains moved by each pulse or gust increases as well.  
Eventually there's abundant grain movement. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3.11  One big problem with all of this development is that it applies only to 
incipient movement on a perfectly planar preexisting sediment surface.  When was 
the  last  time  you  saw  a  perfectly  planar  sediment  surface  in  nature?    (They  do 
exist, but  they're  certainly not  common.)   Sediment movement on bed  forms  starts 
at much lower flow strengths, just because the flow is concentrated at the crests of 
the bed forms.    
2.3.12    Incipient movement  is  thus  probabilistic  or  stochastic.    A  good  way 
of  thinking  about  this  is  in  terms  of  the  relationship  between  two  different  prob-
ability  distributions  (Figure  2-27):    the  distribution  of  instantaneous  local  bed 
shear  stress  needed  to  move  the  set  of  particles  in  some  area  of  the  bed,  and  the 
distribution  of  local  bed  shear  stress  which  acts  on  any  small  area  of  the  bed 
through  time.   When  the  two  distributions  don't  overlap,  the  flow  is  never  strong 
enough  to  move  any  of  the  grains  (Figure  2-27A).    When  the  two  distributions 
overlap slightly, a small subset of  the bed particles are moved by  the  flow  (Figure 
2-27B).    With  increasing  flow  strength  the  distributions  eventually  overlap  en-
tirely, and all the bed particles are susceptible to movement (Figure 2-27C).

2.4  The Sediment Load 
 
 
2.4.1  Classification of the Sediment Load  
2.4.1.1  The aggregate of sediment particles that are transported by a flow at 
a given time is called the load.  The load can further be subdivided in two different 
ways.   On  the  one  hand,  the  load  can  be  divided  into bed-material  load, which  is 
that  part  of  the  load  whose  sizes  are  represented  in  the  bed  in  nonnegligible 
percentages,  and  wash  load,  which  is  that  part  of  the  load  whose  sizes  are  not 
present  in  the  bed  in  appreciable  percentages.    The  wash  load,  which  is  always 
the  finest  fraction  of  the  load,  is  carried  through  a  long  segment  of  the  flow 
without any exchange of sediment between the bed and the flow.   
2.4.1.2   On  the other hand,  the  load can also be divided  into bed  load, which 
travels  in  direct  contact  with  the  bed  or  so  close  to  the  bed  as  not  to  be  substan-
tially affected by the fluid turbulence, and suspended load, which is maintained in 
temporary  suspension  above  the  bed  by  the  action  of  upwardly  moving  turbulent 
eddies  (Figure  2-28).    We  hope  it's  clear  from  these  definitions  that  bed  load  is 
always  bed-material  load,  and  suspended  load  is  likely  to  be  partly  bed-material 
load and partly wash  load, although  in particular cases  it could be all wash  load, 
or  all  bed-material  load.   This may  sound  confusing,  but  it makes  sense.     Figure 
2-29 may or may not be of help.

2.4.1.3  Keep  in  mind  that  the  set  of  particles  that  form  the  load  keeps 
changing  from  time  to  time,  because  particles  are  continually 
coming  to  rest  and  being  set  into  motion  again.    The  best  way  to 
make the distinction between the bed and the load is to consider that 
a  particle  in  motion  is  part  of  the  load,  even  if  it  is  still  in  contact 
with  the bed  (Figure 2-30).   When  a  particle  starts  to move,  it  stops 
being  a  bed  particle  and  starts  being  part  of  the  load.    Conversely, 
when  it  comes  to  rest  again  it  tops  being  part  of  the  load  and 
becomes a bed particle again.

2  .4.2  Bed Load 
2.4.2.1    The  movement  of  bed  load  is  sometimes  called  traction.    Bed-load 
movement  can  be  by  rolling,  sliding,  or  hopping  (Figure  2-31).    It's  not  easy  to 
observe  bed-load  movement  in  great  detail,  but  when  you  have  the  chance  to 
watch  a  carefully  made  high-speed  closeup  motion  picture  of  bed  load  (in  flows 
where  the  load  is  not  yet  so  abundant  as  to  obscure  the  view)  you  see  that  the 
particles  characteristically  take  occasional  excursions  downstream,  by  rolling  and 
hopping irregularly with brief stops along the way, and then come to rest for some 
time before being moved again.   The explanation is apparently that once a grain is 
dislodged  from  a  place  of  rest  it's  susceptible  to  continued movement  by  the  flow 
until  it  finally  finds  a  rather  sheltered  position,  and  then  it's  not  dislodged  again 
until  it's  affected  by  an  especially  strong  shear  stress  or  until  one  or  more  of  the 
bed particles sheltering it are themselves put into motion. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 52

 

 

 

    

The  problem  in  discussing  bed  load  is  that  we  know  very  little 
about  the characteristic modes of bed-load movement except  in 
weak  flows  in  which  not  much  sediment  is  moving.    This  is  an 
area  in  which  there  has  been  much  speculation  supported  by 
very  little observational data.   And yet such conditions are very 
important  sedimentologically.    One  popular  theory,  which  is 
intuitively  attractive,  is  that  when  there's  a  high  concentration 
of  moving  bed-load  particles,  the  particles  farther  away  from 
the  bed  are  maintained  partly  or  largely  in  their  motion  by 
collisions with particles moving closer to the bed (Figure 2-32).  
This  involves  a  kind  of  dispersive  effect,  and  the  dispersion  of 
grains  maintained  above  the  bed  in  this  way  has  been  called  a 
traction  carpet. 
  Unfortunately 
the 
importance  of 
this 
dispersive effect is still not known.

2  .4.3  Suspended Load 
2.4.3.1    There's  clearly  a  problem  in  distinguishing  between  bed  load  and 
suspended load:  how far can a grain move up into the flow and still be considered 
bed  load?    The  standard  criterion  is  whether  or  not  fluid  turbulence  has  a  sub-
stantial  effect  on  the  time  and  distance  involved  in  the  excursion.    Although  the 
distinction  between  bed  load  and  suspended  load  is  a  convenient  one,  there's  no 
sharp break between bed load and suspended load.   
2.4.3.2  Keep in mind also that a given particle can be part of the bed load at 
one  moment  and  part  of  the  suspended  load  at  another  moment,  depending  upon 
the  time  history  of  fluid  forces  and  motions  to  which  it  is  subjected.    (And  of 
course at still other times the same particle might not be moving at all.)  Therefore, 
at any given time there's an appreciable overlap in the size distributions of the bed 
load and  the  suspended  load, although clearly  the  suspended  load  tends always  to 
be finer on the average than the bed load. 
2.4.3.3  Particles moving as bed load are susceptible to being carried up into 
suspension when  the maximum  vertical  turbulent  velocity  fluctuations  are  greater 
in  magnitude  than  the  settling  velocities  of  the  particles.    If  the  conditions  of  the 
flow  and  the  settling  velocities  of  the  particles  fulfill  that  condition,  then  some  of 

 53

 

 

 

 

    

the moving bed-load particles will occasionally find themselves caught in a strong 
upward-moving  eddy,  and  the particle will be carried  for  some distance above  the 
bed.    The  particle  will  be  affected  by  a  series  of  eddies  as  it  moves  downstream; 
depending  on  the  motions  of  the  individual  eddies,  the  particle  may  rise  only  a 
short  distance  from  the  bed  and  travel  only  a  short  distance  downstream  before  it 
settles back to the bed, or it may rise high above the bed, even almost to the water 
surface,  and  travel  far  downstream.    Obviously,  the  smaller  the  settling  velocity 
and  the stronger  the  turbulence,  the greater  the average height above  the bed and 
the greater the distance of travel downstream the particle will attain.   
2.4.3.4  The sediment particles are not really suspended above the bed, in the 
way  that  a  painting  is  suspended  on  a  nail  in  the  wall:    they  are  always  settling 
back  toward  the  bed  and  will  eventually  return  to  the  bed.   Only  particles  of  col-
loidal  size, much  finer  than  a micrometer,  can  be  truly  suspended.   Such  particles 
have  such  small  mass  that  Brownian  motions  caused  by  the  random  collisions  of 
molecules against the particle keep the particle in permanent suspension.        
2.4.3.5    The  controls  on  the  vertical  distribution  of  suspended  sediment  in 
steady  and  uniform  flows  are  well  understood.    The  basic  idea  is  that  if  one  con-
siders  a  small  horizontal  unit  area  somewhere  in  the  flow,  there  must  be  a  time-
average balance between the rate at which sediment settles down through that unit 
area  and  the  rate  at  which  sediment  is  transported  up  through  the  unit  area  by 
turbulent  diffusion  (Figure  2-33).    (The  idea  behind  turbulent  diffusion  is  that 
because  there  is  an  upward  decrease  in  suspended  sediment  concentration,  the 
random motions of eddies across the unit area result in a net upward movement of 
suspended  sediment  even  though  the  volumes  of  fluid  exchanged  cross  the  unit 
area are the same.)

2.4.3.6    Prediction  of  the  vertical  distribution  of  suspended  load  in  a  steady 
uniform  channel  flow on  the basis of  the  foregoing  idea  is one of  the  few  theoret-
ical  successes  in  the mechanics  of  sediment  transport.   The  theory  predicts  an  ex-
ponential  decrease  in  suspended-sediment  concentration  with  height  above  the 
bed.    When  the  vertical  turbulent  velocities  are  only  slightly  greater  than  the 
settling  velocities  of  the  particles,  the  suspended-sediment  concentration  is  not 
very  great  even near  the bed  and drops  rapidly  to  essentially  zero  a  short distance 
above  the  bed  (Figure  2-34A).    When  the  turbulent  velocities  are  much  greater 
than  the  settling  velocities  of  the  particles,  however,  the  suspended-sediment 
concentration near  the bed  is high and falls off only slightly with height above the 
bed  (Figure  2-34B).    Laboratory  measurements  of  vertical  profiles  of  suspended 
sediment match the theoretical predictions very well.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          2.4.3.7   The  theory  is only  a qualified  success, however, because  the  it pro-
vides  only  the  distribution  relative  to  some  assumed  reference  concentration  at 
some  reference  elevation  above  the  bed.    You  can  think  of  the  bed-load  layer  as 
forming  the  bottom  boundary  condition  for  the  suspended-sediment  distribution.  
The  key  element—how  the  flow  establishes  the  reference  suspended-sediment 
concentration just outside the bed-load layer—is still not well known.   
2.4.3.8    Although  no  measurements  have  been made,  it  seems  reasonable  to 
suppose  that  in  most  sediment-transporting  flow  systems,  like  rivers  or  storm-
driven  currents  in  the  shallow  ocean,  most  of  the  sediment  transported  past  a 
given  cross  section of  the  flow over a  long period of  time  is  in  suspension.     Even 
though  bed-load  transport  may  be  occurring  most  of  the  time,  the  total  volume 

 55

 

 

 

 

    

moved as bed load is relatively small.  On the other hand, the imprint or signature 
of bed-load transport on the sedimentary record is very great.  
 

2  .4.4  Saltation 
2.4.4.1   All  the material discussed  so  far  in  this  section on  the  sediment  load 
is  relevant  to  the  transport  of  sediment  in  water.    The  picture  for  transport  of 
sediment  by  wind  is  rather  different.    The  reason  is  that  the  ratio  of  sediment 
density  to  fluid  density  is  far  greater  in  air  than  in  water,  so  the  sediment  grains 
have great relative inertia and can travel through the air without their trajectories 
being much affected by the local fluid turbulence.   
2.4.4.2    The  characteristic  mode  of  sediment  movement  in  air  is  saltation.  
Saltation is a mode of particle movement in which particles are launched from the 
bed at moderate  to  steep angles,  follow a regular arching  trajectory, and descend 
back  to  the  bed  at  small  angles.    Figure  2-35  shows  a  typical  saltation  trajectory 
taken  by  a  saltating  grain  of  sand  in  air.    Because  of  the  great  relative  density  of 
the  sediment  particles,  saltation  trajectories  are  rather  regular,  and  show  little  of 
the sinuosity that might be expected from passage through turbulent eddies. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.4.3    Saltation  is  the  dominant mode  of  particle movement when  a  strong 
wind blows over a  sand  surface.   Except  in  the very  strongest winds,  the  saltation 
heights  attained  by  the  saltating  grains  seldom  exceeds  a meter,  and  the  saltation 
lengths  are  mostly  less  than  a  few  meters.    There  is,  of  course,  a  continuous  dis-
tribution  of  jump  heights  and  jump  lengths,  from  zero  to  the  maximum.    There's 
also wide variability in take-off angles:  they range from just a few tens of degrees 
to  vertical.    After  colliding  with  some  particularly  immovable  bed  grain,  a 
saltating grain can even take off with an upstream component to its motion. 
2.4.4.4  If you're lucky enough to be out on a dry sand surface during a strong 
wind, take the risk of getting some sand in your eyes and nose and mouth, and get 
down  on  the  sand  surface  for  a  horizontal  view  at  an  eye  level  of  a  few  tens  of 
centimeters  above  the  surface  (Figure  2-36).    You'd  see  a  hazy  layer  of  saltating 

 56

 

 

 

 

    

grains, which  tails off  imperceptibly upward.   If you then looked downward at the 
sand  surface,  you'd  see  an  abundance  of  surface  grains  being  pushed  along  for 
short  distances,  just  one  or  a  few  grain  diameters  at  a  time,  presumably  by  being 
struck  by  saltating  grains.    That  mode  of  movement  is  called  surface  creep—but 
keep in mind that there's really no sharp break between surface creep and saltation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.4.4.5   Many  aspects  of  saltation  are  not  well  understood.    Among  these  is 
the  mechanism  that  causes  the  initial  rise  of  the  grains.    Two  different  effects 
come  to mind:    lift  forces, as was discussed in an earlier section, and the geometry 
of  collisions  between  already  saltating  grains  and  stationary  grains  on  the  bed.  
Another  problem  is  that  of  the  importance  of  saltation  in  water.    Several 
researchers  have  described  trajectories  of  sand  grains moving  in  trajectories  close 
to the bed in water flows as a kind of saltation.  Such trajectories are not much like 
the  characteristic  saltation  trajectories  of  dense  grains  in  air,  and  whether  what  is 
described  as  saltation  in  water  is  related  to  true  saltation  in  air  is  an  unresolved 
question.   
2.4.4.6   An  interesting feature of saltation is the rotation rates of the saltating 
particles.    Ultra-high-speed  motion  pictures  have  revealed  strikingly  high  spin 
rates of hundreds of revolutions per second!  The sense of spin is such that that the 
top of the particle moves faster in the downstream direction than the bottom of the 
particle (Figure 2-37).  The origin of such high rates of spin is still a mystery.

2.5  Transport Rates 
 
2.5.1    The  rate  at  which  sediment  is moved  past  a  cross  section  of  the  flow, 
called  either  the  sediment  transport  rate  or  the  sediment  discharge,  usually 
denoted  by  Qs,  is  one  of  the  most  important  concepts  on  sediment  transport 
mechanics.   The sediment  transport rate can be measured in mass per unit time, or 
in  weight  per  unit  time,  or  in  volume  per  unit  time.    Often  the  sediment  transport 
rate  is  considered  per  unit  width  of  flow;  then  it's  called  the  unit  sediment 
transport rate, and is usually written qs.   
2.5.2    The  concept  of  sediment  transport  rate  is  most  naturally  applied  to 
unidirectional  flows,  but  even  the  most  nearly  symmetrical  oscillatory  flows  usu-
ally have at  least  slight net  transport  in one direction or another;  this  latter  trans-
port is the difference between the transport in one direction and the transport in the 
opposite  direction  during  one  oscillation,  averaged  over  a  large  number  of 
oscillations. 
2.5.3    There  are  two  different  ways  of  approaching  the  characterization  of 
sediment  transport  rates.    On  the  one  hand,  you  could  take  a  purely  empirical 
approach:   make a  list of all  the variables  that  should affect  the  transport  rate, and 
then make  a dimensional  analysis  to provide  a  rational  framework  for handling or 
organizing measurement data.  If enough good data are already at hand, you'd then 
have some predictive capability.     
2.5.4   What's usually done, however,  is  something different:    think  about  the 
physics  of  sediment  transport  in  a  way  that  allows  you  to  develop  the  form  of 
some  rational  equation  for  transport  rates,  which  contains  within  it  one  or  more 
"adjustable parameters" whose values are assigned by analysis of selected data sets 
already at hand. 
2.5.5   Our  common  sense  tells  us,  correctly  again,  that  the  stronger  the  flow 
the  greater  the  sediment  transport  rate.    And  an  important  first-order  fact  of  ob-
servation is that the sediment transport rate is a very steeply increasing function of 
the  flow  strength.    Perhaps  the  simplest  approach  to  quantifying  qs  is  to  write  an 
expression like 
 

 58

 

 

 

 

    

qs = Aτon  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2.1) 
 
where A  is a coefficient and n  is an exponent much  larger than one.   Better yet, τo 
might  be  replaced  with τo -τoc,  where τoc  is  the  threshold  boundary  shear  stress 
for  sediment  movement.    Such  an  approach  has  no  particular  physical  basis,  but 
with  A  and  n  adjusted  by  use  of  observational  data,  Equation  (2.1)  can  serve  for 
very  crude  estimates  of  qs.    But  the  trouble  with  Equation  (2.1)  is  that  it  has  no 
strong  physical  basis.    The  true  situation  must  be  much  more  complicated  than 
Equation (2.1).  
2.5.6    It's  almost  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  dozens  of  sediment  discharge 
formulas  have  found  their way  into  the  hydraulic-engineering  literature.   And  it's 
an  understatement  to  say  that  the  physical  basis  behind  these  formulas  ranges 
widely.    You  might  think  that  the  ease  with  which  data  can  be  fitted  to  such  a 
formula  should  give  an  idea  of  the  validity  of  the  underlying  assumptions  about 
the  physics  of  sediment  transport.    But  a  skeptic might  point  out  that  an  equation 
of almost any  form can accommodate a given data set  fairly well, so  long as  there 
are two or three adjustable parameters in that equation—as is usually the case with 
sediment  discharge  formulas.    In  the  context  of  this  course,  there's  no  point  in 
pursuing  formulas  for  sediment  transport  rate  any  further,  despite  the  fact  that 
they're so important in engineering approaches to sediment transport.   
2.5.7   Measuring  the  sediment  transport  rate  is  a  notoriously  difficult  task.  
Ideally one would  like  to be  able  to keep  track of  every  single particle  that passes 
across  a  given  cross  section  of  the  flow  in  some  representative  time  interval,  and 
measure  the  mass  of  each  of  those  particles  (somehow  without  disrupting  the 
flow),  and  then  divide  the  total  mass  by  the  time  interval  during  which  it  was 
measured.  Unfortunately there's no good way of doing that. 
2.5.8    In  the  laboratory  it's  often  possible  (although  difficult)  to  arrange  the 
flow so that all the sediment is extracted at some point, for example by means of a 
slot  trap  in  the  bottom  of  the  channel.    Then  the  catch  can  be  weighed  and  put 
right back into the flow immediately.  In a few cases this been done even on small 
rivers, for research purposes.   
2.5.9    Usually  bed  load  is  measured  with  devices  called  bed-load  traps  or 
bed-load  samplers.   They come  in all  sizes and geometries, but  their purpose  is  to 
catch  all  the  bed  load  that  comes  upon  the  trap  from  upstream—without  catching 
too much or too little.  Unfortunately there are many practical problems connected 
with bed-load traps.  Suspended load is easier to measure, by taking water samples 
at a number of points along the vertical and making a numerical integration.     
 
2.6  Mixed-Size Sediments 
 
2.6.1   Until  recently,  almost  all  research work and development of  theory on 
sediment transport has ignored the effect of sorting (the spread of sizes around the 
mean  size).    For  the  purposes  of  much  engineering  work,  the  assumption  that 
sorting  is unimportant has not  caused great difficulties, partly because  the particle 
size  itself  is not an  important consideration and partly because  the uncertainties  in 
theory  and  measurement  overshadow  the  errors  arising  from  neglect  of  sorting.  
But  in  sedimentology  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  sediment  transport  is 
the tendency for fractionation or spatial segregation of different particle sizes:  the 

 59

 

 

 

 

    

particle-size  distribution  of  a  clastic  sediment,  which  is  one  of  the  few  available 
reflections  of  the  paleoflow  environment,  is  in  large  part  the  outcome  of 
fractionation arising from differing rates of transport of different particle sizes. 
2.6.2    Understanding  of  the  phenomena  of  mixed-size  sediment  transport  is 
still  rudimentary.    Much  more  work  needs  to  be  done  before  that  understanding 
can  provide  a  good  basis  for  interpreting  the  information  contained  in  the  size 
distributions  of  clastic  sediments.    In  this  section we'll  only  point  out  some  of  the 
important aspects of the problem.   
2.6.3    Let  us  pose  an  important  question  for  you.    Think  carefully  before 
answering.    Consider  a  planar  bed  of  poorly  sorted  sediment,  with  sizes  ranging 
perhaps  from  sand  size  to  large  pebble  size.    A  strong  current  is  passed  over  the 
sediment  bed,  causing  bed-load  transport.    Think  about  the  fractional  transport 
rates—that  is,  the  transport  rates  of  the  individual  size  fractions  in  the  sediment 
mixture.    The  question  is:    if  you  normalize  those  fractional  transport  rates  by 
dividing the transport rate of each fraction by the percentage of that fraction in the 
total  mixture  (to  take  into  account  the  differing  abundances  of  the  fractions), 
which  fractions  would  have  the  highest  normalized  transport  rates:    the  finest 
sediment, the coarsest sediment, or some fraction or fractions in between? 
2.6.4   This  is  a  situation where  you  have  to  be  careful  about what  your  intu-
ition  or  common  sense  tells  you.    It's  easy  to  adduce  three  important  effects  here:  
particle  weight,  exposure/shielding,  and  rollability.      Even  though  the  large  par-
ticles are much heavier  than  the small particles, and therefore are more difficult  to 
move,  they  project  much  higher  into  the  flow,  and  therefore  the  fluid  forces  on 
them are much greater (Figure 2-38).  But it's easy for a large particle to roll over a 
bed  of  smaller  particles  (Figure  2-39).    On  the  other  hand,  the  fine  particles  are 
much  lighter but  they  tend  to be  sheltered  from  the  force of  the  flow by  the  larger 
particles.  But a smaller particle has a hard time rolling up and over a bed of larger 
particles to be set into motion.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 60

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.5    Interestingly,  available  laboratory  data  show  that  for  bed-load  trans-
port  all  of  these  effects  tend  quite  closely  to  cancel  or  offset  one  another,  so  that 
the  normalized  transport  rates  of  all  size  fractions  are  not  greatly  different.  
However,  the  small  differences  that  do  exist  may  be  important  when  transport 
takes  place  over  long  time  scales  and  for  long  distances.   When  some  of  the  sed-
iment  is  carried  in  suspension,  it  can  easily  outrun  the  fractions  traveling  as  bed 
load,  and  then  there  can  be  large  differences  in  normalized  fractional  transport 
rates. 

 
2.7  More Concentrated Flows 
 
2  .7.1  Dispersed-Sediment Flows and Concentrateed-Sediment Flows 
2.7.1.1    When  viewed  from  a  dynamical  standpoint,  there's  a  continuous 
spectrum  of  concentrations  of  the  sediment  load,  from  vanishingly  small,  in  flows 
which  are  only  a  little  stronger  than  the  threshold  condition,  to  extremely  high.  
The upper limit of sediment concentration is the condition that there's enough pore 
space  between  the  sediment  particles  so  that  the  sediment-fluid  mixture  can  be 
deformed without the interlocking of grains preventing the deformation.  Near this 
upper limit, sediment concentrations can be as much as 60% by volume. 
2.7.1.2    But  from  the  standpoint  of  practical  sedimentology,  we've  found  it 
useful    to  think  in  terms  of  two  different  ranges  of  sediment  concentrations.    On 
the  one  hand,  we  commonly  deal  with  deposits  that  were  made  by  flows  that 
carried relatively small concentrations of sediment.  Concentrations in these flows 
are usually very small, but even though the concentrations might be of the order of 
ten  percent,  the  flows  can  still  be  viewed  as  relatively  "thin"  and  certainly  fully 
turbulent.    All  pressure-gradient-driven  marine  currents,  like  tidal  currents  or 
wind-driven  currents,  as  well  as  most  river  flows,  are  in  this  category.    we'll  call 
such  flows  dispersed-sediment  flows.    You'll  see  that  these  dispersed-sediment 
flows  are  responsible  for distinctive kinds of deposits which  show generally good 

 61

 

 

 

 

    

stratification  and  evidence  of  tractional  transport.   They  tend  to  be  relatively well 
sorted.     
2.7.1.3   On  the other hand, many  flows  that are of great sedimentological in-
terest  have  sediment  concentrations  near  the  upper  end  of  the  possible  range.  
Concentrated sediment gravity flows  like debris flows are  the main kinds of flows 
with  sediment  concentrations  this  high,  although  a  few  rivers  (like  the  Yellow 
River  in  China)  with  what's  called  hyperconcentrated  flow  also  have  extremely 
high sediment concentrations.   we'll call flows of this kind concentrated-sediment 
flows.    The  deposits  produced  by  these  flows  tend  to  lack  clear  stratification,  and 
they're  usually  much  less  well  sorted  than  dispersed-sediment  flows.    Obviously 
there are intermediate cases, not only in rivers but also in sediment gravity flows.    
2.7.1.4  These two terms are very unofficial, and you will not find them in the 
sedimentological  literature.    But  we  think  they're  a  useful  "crutch"  for  thinking 
about the origin of clastic deposits when you're on the outcrop.  When I'm looking 
at  a  particular  bed, we  usually  ask  ourselves whether  that  bed was  deposited  by  a 
dispersed-sediment  flow  or  a  concentrated-sediment  flow,  or  perhaps  by  a  flow 
with intermediate characteristics.     
2.7.1.5    To  our mind,  the main  reason  why  concentrated-sediment  flows  are 
more difficult  to  come  to grips with  than dispersed-sediment  flows has  to do with 
the  related  problems  of  overloading  and  past  history.    Suppose  you  start  with  a 
flow  of water, with  a  given  discharge,  over  a  sediment  bed.    If  the  flow  is  strong 
enough, some of the sediment will be entrained and transported, either as bed load 
or as a combination of bed load and suspended load.  (If the sediment is entirely in 
the  clay  to  fine  silt  range,  the  flow  must  be  so  strong  to  even  begin  to  erode  the 
bed, and the resulting entrained sediment has such a small settling velocity, that all 
of  the  load  might  be  suspended  load.)    But  in  any  case  an  equilibrium  becomes 
established whereby  the  flow  transports  just as much sediment as  it  is able  to, and 
there's  a  balance  between  entrainment  and  redeposition.    You  could  look  at  an 
established flow like that and not be able to say anything about how or when it got 
started.   
2.7.1.6   But  the  range of such  flows by no means exhausts all of  the possible 
sediment-transporting  flows.    That's  because  it's  possible  for  a  preexisting  non-
flowing  mass  of  sediment  and  water  to  undergo  mass  mobilization  of  some  kind, 
by  liquefaction,  for  example,  and  then  flow  as  a  high-concentration  two-phase 
flow  with  a  concentration  much  higher  than  could  have  become  established  by 
starting with a clear-water flow over a bed of the same sediment.  A flow like this 
has  an  important  aspect  of  past  history.    And  it's  likely  to  be  overloaded—
although,  depending  upon  the  particular  conditions  of  flow,  it  may  be  self-sus-
taining until  it eventually  reaches a gentler  slope down which  to  flow.   Of course, 
any  flow,  not  just mass  flows  of  this  kind, will  deposit  its  sediment  as  it  becomes 
overloaded by decelerating.    It's  just  that  the degree of overloading, or  the  rate at 
which the flow loses sediment as it decelerates, is typically much greater and more 
spectacular with concentrated-sediment flows than with dispersed-sediment flows.   
 
2  .7.2  Classification and Discussion of Concentrated-Sediment Flows 
2.7.2.1    At  the  risk  of  oversimplifying  complex  phenomena,  here's  a  very 
crude  and  very  generalized  classification  of  concentrated-sediment  flows  (Table 
  2-1).  The orientation here is practical rather than theoretical.

slumps/slides:    large masses  of  solid material move  downslope  under  the  pull 
of gravity; presence of interstitial fluid may be important but is not essential 
for  the  existence  of  the  flow;  not  usually  viewed  as  "sediment  transport".  
Vertical  mixing  ranges  from  slight  to  substantial;  deposition  is  probably 
usually sudden, by "freezing" of the moving mass. 
debris  flows:    highly  concentrated  mixtures  of  sediment  and  water  with  little 
or no differentiation  that flow as  thick  two-phase fluids;  little or no vertical 
differentiation  in  the  flowing  mass;    vertical  mixing  is  usually  substantial; 
nonturbulent to turbulent; deposition ranges from sudden to incremental. 
hyperconcentrated flows:   moderately concentrated mixtures of sediment and 
water,  with  little  to  perhaps  moderate  differentiation;  vertical  mixing  is 
substantial; weakly to strongly turbulent; deposition is incremental. 
turbidity  currents:    slightly  to moderately  concentrated mixtures of  sediment 
and  water;  moderate  to  great  vertical  differentiation  in  the  flowing  mass; 
vertical  mixing  substantial;  moderately  to  strongly  turbulent;  deposition 
incremental.   
grain  flows:    downslope  flows  of  solid  particles  under  gravity;  importance  of 
interstitial  fluid  negligible  to  slight;  deposition  ranges  from  sudden  to  in-
cremental. 
2.7.2.2   With  the  exception  of  the  last  item,  grain  flows,  the  foregoing  list  is 
approximately  in  order  of  decreasing  solids  concentration,  increasing  turbulence 
and  mixing,  and  a  shift  from  sudden  to  incremental  deposition.    We  emphasize 
that  there  is  great  variability  within  each  of  the  categories,  and  certainly 
gradations  in both physics and    features among categories.    In a way, grain  flows 
are like slumps/slides (or should we make that vice versa?), but in scale and origin 
 
they seem to us rather different.   
 
2.7.2.3    Debris  flows  and  turbidity  currents  are  of  undoubtedly  great  sedi-
mentological importance.  The importance of hyperconcentrated flows is less clear 
but is certainly nonnegligible, and maybe much greater than most workers suspect. 
In  regard  to  grain  flows,  the  only  grain  flows  we've  ever  been  convinced  are 
sedimentologically important are on very small and very local scales, mainly those 
that  transport  sand  down  the  lee  faces  of  dunes  in  both  subaerial  and  subaqueous 
environments.
