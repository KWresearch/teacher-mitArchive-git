3.1  Introduction 
 
 
3.1.1    A  striking  characteristic  of  the  transport  of  granular  sediment  over  a 
bed  of  the  same  material  by  a  turbulent  flow  of  fluid  is  that  in  a  wide  range  of 
conditions  the  bed  is  molded  into  topographic  features,  called  bed  forms,  on  a 
scale orders of magnitude larger than the grains.   Little ripples at one's feet at the 
seashore,  or  on  a  dry  river  bed,  or  in  the  desert;  gigantic  dunes  in  the  desert  and 
(even  more  common,  but  not  apparent  to  the  casual  observer)  in  large  rivers  and 
the  shallow  ocean—all  of  these  are  examples  of  bed  forms.    Generations  of 
scientists  and  engineers  have  marveled  at  the  rich  and  confusing  variety  of  these 
features. 
3.1.2  First we'll introduce some terminology.  The overall bed geometry that 
exists at a given  time  in response  to  the  flow  (the bed configuration)  is composed 
of  individual  topographic  elements  (bed  forms).    The  aggregate  or  ensemble  of 
like  bed  configurations  that  can  be  produced  by  a  given  mean  flow  over  a  given 
sediment  bed  is  the  bed  state:    the  bed  configuration  differs  in detail  from  time  to 
time,  and  the  bed  state  is  a  kind  of  average  over  the  infinity  of  configurations 
possible under those conditions.  The term bed phase can be used for recognizably 
or qualitatively different  kinds of bed  configurations  that are produced over  some 
range  of  flow  and  sediment  conditions  and  are  closely  related  in  geometry  and 
dynamics.   Finally,  the  term bedform  (one word)  is widely used,  indiscriminately, 
for all four aspects of the bed geometry. 
3.1.3   The  flows  that make  bed  configurations  can  be  quite  complex.   Think 
in  terms  of  two  kinds  of  flow  components,  unidirectional  and  oscillatory  (Figure 
2-40).  The simplest cases are steady unidirectional flow, with constant flow speed 
in  one  direction,  and  symmetrical  oscillatory  flow,  with  a  regular  back-and  forth 
oscillation.    But  the  unidirectional  flow  can  be  unsteady,  and  the  oscillatory  flow 
can  be  asymmetrical  (with  the  oscillation  in  one  direction  slower  but  of  longer 
duration than the oscillation in the other direction).

         3.1.4    Also, the  unidirectional  and  oscillatory   components  can  be  superim-
posed  or  added  together,  resulting  in  what's  called  combined  flow.    For  an  ex-
ample,  think  about  the  shallow  sea  floor  during  a  storm,  with  wave-induced 
oscillatory flow superimposed on a storm-induced unidirectional flow.  Also, there 
can  be  more  than  one  oscillatory  component—in  fact,  there  can  be  a  continuous 
spectrum of oscillatory components, each with its own period and amplitude.  This 
enormous  range  of  generating  flows,  together  with  the  complex  dynamics  of  the 
response  of  the  bed,  makes  for  infinitely  varied  geometry  of  the  resulting  bed 
forms.  
3.1.5    Both  engineers  and  geologists  have  been  making  laboratory  experi-
ments  on  bed  forms  for  well  over  a  hundred  years,  as  well  as  watching  their 
movement  in  natural  flow  environments.    Our  understanding  of  unidirectional-
flow  bed  configurations  is  pretty  good  by  now,  although  by  no  means  perfect.  
Work  on  oscillatory-flow  bed  configurations  is  less well  advanced:    some  impor-
tant  ranges of  flow and  sediment  size have been  little studied.   Finally, combined-
flow bed configurations are still very poorly known. 
3.1.6   If  the  flow  changes  with  time,  the  bed  configuration  adjusts  in  re-
sponse.    In  natural  flows,  equilibrium  between  the  bed  and  the  flow  is  the  excep-
tion  rather  than  the  rule;  usually  the  bed  configuration  lags  behind  the  change  in 
the  flow.    Such  disequilibrium  is  a major  element  of  complexity  that makes  rela-
tionships  among bed phases much more difficult  to decipher, but  its  effects  are of 
great importance in natural flow environments. 
3.1.7   Most  bed  forms  are  in  sands ,  but  they're  produced  in  silts  and  gravels 
as  well.    Of  greatest  interest  to  geologists,  oceanographers,  and  hydraulic  engi-
neers are bed forms produced by flows of air or water over mineral sediments, but 
a far wider range, important in many engineering applications, can be produced by 
flows of Newtonian  fluids with other densities  and viscosities over  sediments  less 
dense or more dense than the common mineral sediments. 
3.1.8  Apart from their intrinsic scientific interest, bed forms are important in 
both  geology  and  engineering.    Large  subaqueous  bed  forms  many  meters  high 
can  be  obstacles  to  navigation,  and  their  movement  can  be  a  threat  to  submarine 
structures.    The  rugged  topography  of  bed  forms  in  rivers  and  tidal  channels 
causes  flow  separation  at  the  crests  and  therefore  large  values  of  form  drag;  bed 
forms  are  thus  the most  important determinant of  resistance  to  channel  flow.   The 
bed state is also closely bound up with the sediment transport rate in unidirectional 
flows,  in  that  the  downcurrent  movement  of  the  bed  forms  largely  involves 
recycling  of  bed  load within  bed  forms.   Sedimentologists have given  attention  to 
bed forms mostly because of their role in the development of stratification in sedi-
mentary  deposits;  bed  forms  are  one  of  the  most  useful  tools  available  for  in-
terpreting ancient sedimentary environments.  
3.1.9  The status of observations on bed configurations leaves much to be de-
sired.    It's  easy  to  observe  bed  configurations  in  steady  unidirectional  and  bidi-
rectional  flows  in  laboratory  channels  and  tanks,  and  the  major  outlines  are  by 
now  fairly well known,  at  least  for unidirectional  flows.   But  there's a  lot of  room 
for  further  laboratory  work,  both  because  the  usually  small  width-to-depth  ratios 
of  tanks  and  flumes  tend  to  inhibit  full  development  of  the  three-dimensional 
aspects  of  the  bed  geometry,  and  also  because  virtually  no  work  has  been  done 
with  multidirectional  oscillatory  flows,  with  or  without  a  unidirectional 

 65

 

 

 

 

    

component.   And  even  the  largest  of  laboratory  experiments  are  restricted  to  flow 
depths at the lower end of the range of natural flow depths.  In nature, on the other 
hand,  observations  on  bed  configurations  are  limited  by  practical  and  technical 
difficulties, and the flows that produce them are usually more complicated.  
 
3.2  Unidirectional-Flow Bed Configurations 

 
3  .2.1  Introduction 
3.2.1.1    Bed  configurations  made  by  unidirectional  flows  have  been  studied 
more than those made by oscillatory flows and combined flows.  They're what you 
find  in  rivers,  large  and  small,  and  in  engineering  flows  like  outdoor  canals  and 
channels  of  various  kinds,  as  well  as  in  pipes  and  conduits  carrying  granular 
materials, whether by design or incidentally.   
3.2.1.2    But  they're  also  important  in  shallow  marine  environments,  espe-
cially  in  areas  with  strong  tidal  currents.    Even  symmetrically  reversing  tidal 
currents produce bed forms that look much like those in truly unidirectional flows, 
presumably  because  the  current  in  each  direction  lasts  long  enough  for  the  bed  to 
respond  to  what  it  feels  as  a  unidirectional  flow  (although  there's  some  debate 
about this among the experts).  In asymmetrical tidal currents, the bed forms show 
net movement and asymmetry in the direction of the stronger flow, but they suffer 
interesting modifications by the weaker flow in the other direction.  
3.2.1.3  We'll first describe a home experiment to give you an overall picture 
of  the  kinds  of  bed  configurations  made  by  currents,  and  then  present  a  dimen-
sional  analysis  to  organize  in more  detail what's  known  about  the  hydraulic  con-
ditions  for  the  various  kinds  of  configurations.    Then  we'll  tell  you  some  of  the 
most important things about flow and sediment movement over bed forms.      
 
3  .2.2  A Flume Experiment on Unidirectional-Flow Bed Configurations 
3.2.2.1    To  get  an  idea  of  the  bed  configurations  produced  by  a  steady  uni-
form  flow  of  water  over  a  sand  bed,  and  the  succession  of  different  kinds  of  bed 
configurations  that  appear  as  the  flow  strength  is  increased,  make  a  series  of  ex-
ploratory  flume  experiments on  sand with  some mean  size between about 0.2 mm 
and 0.5 mm.   
3.2.2.2   First of all, you need a flume (Figure 2-41).   You could wangle your 
way into a hydraulics lab, or you could build your own in your backyard (or even, 
we suppose,  in your  room.)   Mainly you need a  long channel  that holds water and 
empties into a tank at the downstream end.  Install a pump and some piping to take 
the  water  from  the  downstream  tank  and  recirculate  it  back  up  to  the  head  of  the 
channel.  You might also mount the whole channel on a set of screw jacks near the 
upstream  end,  so  that  you  can  change  the  slope  of  the  channel  easily.    It  would 
also be nice  to make at  least one sidewall of  the channel out of  transparent acrylic 
plastic, for good viewing.

3.2.2.3    Place  a  thick  layer  of  sand  on  the  bottom  of  the  channel,  and  then 
pass  a  series  of  steady  uniform  flows  over  it.   Arrange  each  run  to  have  the  same 
mean  flow  depth  (as  great  as  the  flume  will  allow,  a  large  fraction  of  a  meter  if 
you're lucky) and increase the mean flow velocity slightly from run to run.  
3.2.2.4    In  each  run,  let  the  flow  interact  with  the  bed  long  enough  for  the 
state  of  the  bed  to  be  statistically  steady;  after  that  the  details  of  the  bed  configu-
ration  are  in  constant  change  but  the  average  state  of  the  bed  remains  the  same.  
The time required for the flow and the bed to come into a new state of equilibrium 
might take from as little as a few minutes to as long as several days, depending on 
the  sediment  transport  rate,  the  size  of  the  bed  forms  being  developed,  and  the 
extent of modification of bed forms left over from the preceding run.   
3.2.2.5   You could speed  the attainment of equilibrium a  little by continually 
adjusting  the  slope  of  the  whole  channel  to  maintain  uniform  flow  as  the  bed 
roughness changes, but these adjustments are not necessary, because the flow itself 
adjusts the bed for uniform flow by erosion at one end and deposition at the other.  
For  example,  if  the  flume  slope  is  too  gentle,  you'll  end  up  with  the  sand  bed 
thinner  at  the  downstream  end  than  at  the  upstream  end,  and  the  slope  of  the  bed 
and  the  flow  will  be  greater  than  the  slope  of  the  channel.    On  the  other  hand,  if 
the  flume  slope  is  too  steep,  the  sand  bed  will  be  thicker  at  the  downstream  end 
than at the upstream end.  This kind of thing is OK so long as the layer  of sand in 
the channel doesn't taper so sharply that the channel bottom is bare in the upper or 
lower reaches.  
3.2.2.6    If  you're  impatient  for  results,  the  way  to  make  bed  forms  develop 
fastest is to start with an irregular sediment bed.  But it's more enlightening to start 
with  a  planar  bed.    (You  can  arrange  one  fairly  easily  by  passing  a  straight 
horizontal  scraper blade along  the bed.    If  the blade  is mounted on something  that 
slides on  the straight upper edges of  the  flume walls, you get a nice planar result.)  
Now turn on the pump and gradually increase the flow velocity.  The beginning of 
sediment  movement  would  be  in  accordance  with  the  threshold  curve  discussed 
earlier  (Figure  2-42A).    Wait  a  while,  and  the  flow  will  build  very  small  ir-
regularities  at  random  points  on  the  bed,  not  more  than  several  grain  diameters 
high, from which small ripples develop spontaneously.

3.2.2.7   You can help  things along by poking your  finger  into  the planar bed 
at  some  point  to  localize  the  first  appearance of  the  ripples.   The  flow  soon  trans-
forms  the  little  mound  you  made  with  your  finger  into  a  flow-molded  bed  form.  
The flow disturbance caused by this bed form scours the bed just downstream, and 
piles  up  enough  sediment  for  another  bed  form  to  be  produced,  and  so  on  until  a 
beautiful  widening  train  of  downstream-growing  bed  forms  is  formed  (Figure 
2-43).   Little  trains of bed  forms  like  this,  starting  from various points on  the bed, 
soon join together and pass through a complicated stage of development, finally to 
become  a  fully  developed  bed  configuration  (Figure  2-42B).    The  stronger  the 
grain  transport,  the  sooner  the  bed  forms  appear,  and  the  faster  they  approach 
equilibrium.  These bed forms, which we'll later classify as ripples, show generally 
triangular cross sections.

3.2.2.8    (We'll  stop  right  here  and  introduce  some  terms  for  ripplelike  bed 
forms;  see Figure 2-44.   The  region around  the highest point on  the  ripple profile 
is  the  crest,  and  the  region  around  the  lowest  point  is  the  trough.   The  upstream-
facing surface of the ripple, extending from a trough to the next crest downstream, 
is  the  stoss  surface;  the  downstream-facing  surface,  extending  from  a  crest  to  the 
next  trough  downstream,  is  the  lee  surface.    A  well  defined  and  nearly  planar 
segment  of  the  lee  surface,  called  the  slip  face,  is  usually  a  prominent  part  of  the 
profile.    The  top  of  the  slip  face  is  marked  by  a  sharp  break  in  slope  called  the 
brink.    There's  often  but  not  always  a  break  in  slope  at  the  base  of  the  slip  face 
also.  The top of the slip face is not always the highest point on the profile, and the 
base of the slip face is not always the lowest point on the profile.

3.2.2.9    The  stoss  surfaces  of  ripples  are  gently  sloping,  usually  less  than 
about 10°  relative  to  the mean plane of  the bed,  and  their  lee  surfaces  are  steeper, 
usually  at or  close  to  the  angle of  repose of  the granular material  in water.   Crests 
and  troughs are oriented dominantly  transverse  to  the mean  flow, but are  irregular 
in detail in height and arrangement.   The average spacing of ripples is of the order 
of  10-20  cm,  and  the  average  height  is  a  few  centimeters.    The  bed  is  said  to  be 
three-dimensional,  rather  than  two-dimensional  as  it  would  be  if  the  ripples  were 
regular  and  straight-crested.    The  ripples move  downstream  (orders  of magnitude 
slower  than  the  flow  itself)  by  erosion  of  sediment  from  the  stoss  surface  and 
deposition of sediment on the lee surface.   
3.2.2.10   At  a  flow  velocity  that's  a middling  fraction  of  a meter  per  second, 
ripples  are  replaced  by  larger  bed  forms  generally  called  dunes.    Dunes  are 
broadly  similar  to  ripples  in geometry  and movement, but  they  are  about  an order 
of  magnitude  larger  (Figure  2-42C).    The  transition  from  ripples  to  dunes  is 
complete  over  a  narrow  range  of  only  a  few  centimeters  per  second  in  flow  ve-
locity.  Within this transition the bed geometry is complicated:  the ripples become 
slightly  larger,  with  ill-defined  larger  forms  intermingled,  and  then  abruptly  the 
larger  forms  become  better  organized  and  dominate  the  smaller  forms.    With 
increasing flow velocity, more and more sediment is transported over the dunes as 
suspended load.  If you had a large enough flume at your disposal the dunes would 
become  large  enough  under  some  conditions  of  sand  size  and  current  velocity  for 
smaller dunes to be superimposed on larger dunes.   
3.2.2.11   With  further  increase  in velocity  the dunes become  lower and more 
rounded,  over  a  fairly  wide  interval  of  flow  velocity,  until  finally  they  disappear 
entirely, giving way  to a planar bed surface over which abundant suspended  load 
as well as bed load is transported (Figure 2-42D).  Judging from the appearance of 
the  bed  after  the  flow  is  abruptly  brought  to  a  stop,  the  transport  surface  is 
strikingly planar:  relief is no greater than a few grain diameters.  Since the bed is 
obscured,  it's  difficult  to  observe  the  mode  of  grain  transport  except  through  the 
sidewall.  
3.2.2.12    As  the  flow  velocity  is  increased  still  further,  subdued  standing 
waves  appear  on  the  water  surface,  and  the  resulting  pattern  of  higher  and  lower 
near-bed flow velocity causes the bed to be molded correspondingly into a train of 
waves  in  phase  with  the  water-surface  waves.    As  the  velocity  of  the  mean  flow 
approaches  the velocity with which  the  surface waves  can propagate upstream,  so 
that  the  waves  are  almost  standing  still,  these  coupled  bed  and  surface  waves 
increase in amplitude and become unstable:  they move slowly upstream and at the 
same  time grow  in amplitude, until  they become so steep  that  they break abruptly, 
throwing  much  sediment  into  suspension  (Figure  2-42E).    The  bed  and  water 
surface  then  revert  to  a  planar  or  nearly  planar  condition,  whereupon  the  waves 
build  again  and  the  cycle  is  repeated.   Because  of  their  upstream movement  these 
forms are called antidunes.  
3.2.2.13    An  instructive  variant  of  this  experiment  would  be  to  increase  the 
flow  depth  by  a  factor  of  two  and  cover  the  entire  flow  with  a  rigid  planar  sheet 
parallel  to  the mean  plane  of  the  bed.    The  flow  structure  in  the  lower  half  of  the 
closed  duct  thus  formed  is  not  greatly  different  from  that  in  the  original  open-
channel  flow,  with  some  differences  caused  by  the  gross  difference  in  roughness 
of  the upper  and  lower boundaries when bed  forms  are present on  the bed.   Make 

 70

 

 

 

 

    

the  same  sequence  of  runs  with  the  top  cover  in  place,  and  you'd  find  the  same 
succession of bed configurations except for one major difference:   standing waves 
and  antidunes  would  not  appear,  and  plane-bed  transport  would  be  observed  up 
to  indefinitely  high  velocities.    This  should  tip  you  off  that  the  dynamics  of  an-
tidunes  is unrelated  to  the dynamics of  ripples, dunes, and   plane bed.   Antidunes 
are dependent upon the presence of the free surface, whereas ripples and dunes are 
independent of the presence of the free surface.  
 

3  .2.3  Bed-Configuration Regimes 
3.2.3.1   It's  extremely  useful  in  physical  sedimentology  to  know  something 
about  the  conditions  of  occurrence  of  the  various  kinds  of  bed  configurations,  in 
large part because a lot of the cross-stratification we see in the ancient sedimentary 
record,  probably  most,  is  an  outcome  of  the  movement  of  flow-transverse  bed 
forms  like  ripples  and  dunes  in  flows  of  water  or  air  in  a  variety  of  sedimentary 
environments.   
3.2.3.2   The idea, elaborated in the rest of this section, is that each bed phase 
exists or  is  formed  in a certain definite range of  the various variables  that govern 
or characterize the development of bed configurations.   The right way to go about 
doing this is to list all of the variables we think are important and then organize or 
recast  them  into  a  set  of  dimensionless  variables  (fewer  in  number  than  the 
original  set)  that  describes  the  phenomenon  in  the  most  useful  and  the  most 
general  way.    Doing  this  would  require  a  considerable  detour  to  lay  the  back-
ground  for  the  technique.   But we can  take a shortcut at  this point, similar  to what 
was  done  in  Section  2  above  for  describing  the  threshold  of  sediment movement, 
without  sacrificing  any  ultimate  usefulness  or  introducing  any  serious  distortion:  
eliminate  from  the  list  of  variables  those  that  don't  vary  much  for  quartz-density 
sand  in  water-density  fluid  on  planetary  surfaces  with  Earth-like  gravity,  leaving 
only a few  important variables, and then plot a multidimensional graph (which we 
hope  will  be  no  more  than  three-dimensional!)  in  which  the  various  bed  phases 
occupy  contiguous  stability  fields  or  existence  fields,  with  boundary  curves  of 
surfaces  separating  the  fields.    You  could  think  of  these  regions  as  "bed-
configuration  regimes"    of  the  kind  you  observed  in  the  backyard  experiment.  
This  is a way of  systematizing and unifying disparate data on bed  states  in a wide 
variety  of  flows  and  sediments.    Such  graphs  are  closely  analogous  to  the  phase 
diagrams thermodynamicists and petrologists work with.   
3.2.3.3    The  variables  that  characterize  the  development  of  bed  configura-
tions fall naturally into those that characterize the fluid, the flow, and the sediment.  
The sediment might best be described by its mean size, sorting, particle shape, and 
density.    In  the  interest  of  a  manageable  exercise  here,  let's  assume  that  the most 
important  of  these  are  mean  size  and  density.    The  flow  can  be  described  by  its 
mean  flow  depth  and  mean  flow  velocity.    (If  you  find  yourself  wondering  what 
happened  to  the  bed  shear  stress,  which  is  what  moves  the  sediment,  see  below.)  
The  fluid  is  described  by  its  density  and  viscosity.    Finally,  the  acceleration  of 
gravity must be  included,  for  two  reasons:    it helps determine particle weight, and 
it figures in the behavior of surface gravity waves.  That makes for seven variables 
altogether. 

 71

 

 

 

 

    

3.2.3.4   Which  of  the  seven  variables  vary  substantially  in  sediment-moving 
flows  of  water  on  the  Earth's  surface?    Only  four  of  them:    flow  depth,  flow 
velocity, mean  sediment  size,  and  fluid  viscosity.   The  viscosity  of water  varies 
substantially  over  the  natural  range  of  wager  temperatures  from  0°C  to  about 
30°C, but  the effect  isn't overwhelming, so you can get most of  the picture  just by 
thinking  about  plotting  data  on  bed  configurations  in  a  three-axis  graph  (which 
we'll  call  the  depth-velocity-size  diagram)  with  flow  depth,  flow  velocity,  and 
sediment  size  along  the  axes.    Such  a  graph  shows  the  bed-configuration  regimes 
in concrete and only slightly fuzzy form.  
     
3.2.3.6   You might  be wondering why  the bed  shear  stress τo doesn't  appear 
in  the  foregoing  analysis,  when  after  all  it's  the  force  of  the  flow  on  the  bed  that 
moves sediment to mold bed configurations in the first place, right?  We can make 
two comments about that: 
 
θ   When  ripples  or  dunes  are  on  the  bed,  most  of τo  is  form  drag  resulting 
from  pressure  differences  between  upstream  and  downstream  faces  of  the  bed 
forms, and the local bed shear stress (what's usually called skin friction)—which is 
what actually moves the sediment—is only a minor part of τo! 
θ 
Using τo  introduces  a  kind  of  double-valuedness  that messes  up  the 
bed-phase  diagrams  by  making  adjacent  existence  field  overlap.  
Here's  why.    Keeping  in  mind  the  series  of  runs  in  your  backyard 
channel,  think  about what happens  to τo  as U  increases over  the bed 
(Figure 2-45).  At first τo increases with U, as ripples and then dunes 
develop.    But  then  when  the  dunes  are  washed  out  to  plane  bed, τo 
decreases,  because  the  form  drag  disappears.    Then  with  increasing 
velocity  over  a  plane  bed, τo  increases  again.    So  there's  a  range  of 
U  for  which  three  different  values  of τo  are  possible.    If  you  use τo 
as  the  flow-strength  variable,  the bed-phase graph  is going  to have  a 
serious  ambiguity  whereby  certain  fields  overlap  one  another.    This 
isn't  a  problem  if  you  use  U:    there's  a  nice  one-to-one  cor-
respondence between bed states and points on the graph.

3.2.3.7   The best way  to visualize  the depth-velocity-size diagram  is  to draw 
two  kinds  of  planar  sections  through  it,  in  the  depth-velocity  plane  and  in  the  ve-
locity-size  plane  (Figure  2-46).    Figure  2-47  shows  depth-velocity  sections  for 
three  different  sediment  sizes,  together  with  cartoon  versions,  and  Figure  2-48 
shows  a  velocity-size  section  together  with  a  cartoon  version.    These  graphs  are 
based on laboratory experiments mainly at flow depths less than a meter.  (It's a lot 
harder  to  get  data  points  from  deeper  natural  flows.)    These  graphs  are  actually 
dimensionless  graphs,  but  they've  been  normalized  or  standardized  to  a  water 
temperature  of  10°C  for  comparability  and  concreteness.    If  you  don't  want  to 
worry about dimensionless variables,  just  think of  the axes as  real depth, velocity, 
and size.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.3.8    The  depth-velocity  graph  for  0.10-0.14  mm  sand  (Figure  2-47A) 
shows  fields  only  for  ripples,  upper-regime  plane  bed,  and  antidunes.    All  the 
boundaries  here  and  in  the  other  two  depth-velocity  sections  in  Figure  2-47  slope 
upward  to  the  right.    The  ripple-plane  boundary  does  so  because  the  deeper  the 
flow  the  greater  the  velocity  needed  for  a  given  bed  shear  stress;  the  plane-an-
tidune  boundary  does  so  because  it's  closely  associated  with  the  condition  for 
which  surface waves can propagate upstream about as  fast as  the  flow  itself  flows 
downstream,  so  that  the  surface  waves  can  interact  unstably  with  the  bed  to  pro-
duce  antidunes.    The  latter  boundary  is  shown  to  truncate  the  former,  because  as 
the  condition  just  mentioned  is  approached,  antidunes  develop  whatever  the  pre-
existing configuration.   This  relation holds  true also, and more clearly,  for coarser 
sediments (Figures 2-47B, 2-47C).

        3.2.3.9    In  Figure  2-47A  (and  in  Figure  2-47B,  for  medium  sands,  as  well) 
there  are  two  kinds  of  boundary  between  movement  and  no  movement.    To  the 
right  is  a  modification  of  the  threshold  curve  for  incipient  movement  on  a  plane 
bed,  appropriately  transformed  into  this  depth-velocity  graph.  To  the  left  is  the 
ripple-maintenance  boundary,  which  defines  the  minimum  velocity  needed  to 
maintain  preexisting  ripples  at  equilibrium.    The  ripple-maintenance  boundary  is 
not well constrained by data, so it's shown only in the cartoon, but it clearly lies at 
lower flow velocities than the plane-bed threshold curve. 
3.2.3.10    The  depth-velocity  graph  for  0.40-0.50  mm  sand  (Figure  2-47B) 
shows  an  additional  field  for  dunes  between  those  for  ripples  and  plane  bed, with 
its  high-velocity  boundary  clearly  sloping  less  steeply  than  the  low-velocity 
boundary.   For depths  less  than  about 0.05 m  it's difficult  to differentiate between 
ripples  and  dunes,  because  dunes  become  severely  limited  in  size  by  the  shallow 
flow  depth.    The  appearance  and  expansion  of  the  dune  field  with  increasing 
sediment size pushes the lower termination of the plane-bed field to greater depths 
and  velocities,  nearly  out  of  the  range  of  most  flume  work  (but  not  of  natural 
flows!).   The antidune  field  truncates not only  the ripple field, as with finer sands, 
but the dune field as well.   
3.2.3.11    In  the  depth-velocity  graph  for 1.30-1.80 mm  sand  (Figure 2-47C), 
a  lower-regime  plane  bed  replaces  ripples  at  low  flow  velocities.    Upper-regime 
plane  bed  is  still  present  in  the  upper  right  but  few  flume  data  are  available.  
Upper-regime plane beds  succeed antidunes with  increasing  flow velocity and de-
creasing  flow depth  in  the  lower  right.    (This passage  from plane bed  to antidunes 
and  back  into  plane  bed  is  sort  of  analogous  to  breaking  the  sound  barrier:    once 
you get past the condition wherein surface waves have the same speed as the flow, 
the  coupling  that  leads  to  antidunes  disappears  again.)   The  boundary  between  no 
movement  and  lower  plane  bed  is  shown  as  the  threshold  curve  for  incipient 
movement  on  a  plane  bed.    Sections  for  even  greater  sediment  sizes  are 
qualitatively similar to that in Figure 2-47C.  
3.2.3.12    In  the  velocity-size  graph  for  flow  depths  of  0.25-0.40  m  (Figure 
2-48),  ripples  are  stable  for  sediments  finer  than  about  0.8  mm.    The  range  of 
velocities  for  ripples  narrows  with  increasing  sediment  size  to  terminate  against 
the  fields  for  plane  beds  with  or  without movement.    Relationships  in  this  region 
are  difficult  to  study  because  in  these  sand  sizes  and  flow  speeds  it  takes  a  long 
time for  the bed  to attain equilibrium.   In medium sands ripples give way abruptly 
to  dunes  with  increasing  flow  velocity,  but  in  finer  sediment,  ripples  give  way 
(also  abruptly)  to  plane  bed.    Although  not  well  constrained,  the  ripple-plane 
boundary rises to higher velocities with decreasing sediment size.   
3.2.3.13   Dunes  are  stable  over  a wide  range  of  flow  velocities  in  sediments 
from  medium  sand  to  indefinitely  coarse  gravel.    Both  the  lower  and  upper 
boundaries  of  the  dune  field  rise  with  increasing  velocity,  and  both  are  gradual 
transitions  rather  than  sharp  breaks.    For  sediments  coarser  than  about  0.8  mm 
there's  a  narrow  field  below  the  dune  field  for  lower-regime  plane  bed;  the  lower 
boundary  of  this  field  is  represented  by  the  curve  for  threshold  of  sediment 
movement on a plane bed.    
3.2.3.14    There's  one  triple  point  among  ripples,  dunes,  and  upper  plane  bed 
at  a  sediment  size  of  about  0.2 mm,  and  another  among  ripples,  dunes  and  lower 
plane bed at a  sediment  size of about 0.8 mm.   The coverage of data around  these 

 75

 

 

 

 

    

two  triple  points  constrains  the  bed-phase  relationships  fairly  closely.    Between 
these  two  triple  points  the  dune  field  forms  a  kind  of  indented  salient  pointing 
toward  finer  sediment  sizes.    The  boundary  between  ripples  and  upper  plane  bed 
seems  to  pass  beneath  the  dune  field  at  the  upper  left  triple  point  to  emerge  again 
at  coarser  sizes  and  lower  velocities  as  the  boundary  between  ripples  and  lower 
plane bed at  the  lower  right  triple point.   We might  speculate  that  the  ripple-plane 
boundary  is  eclipsed  by  development  of  dunes  on  the  bed  over  a  certain  range  of 
flow  velocities  and  sediment  sizes.    This  interpretation  has  some  experimental 
support:    when  the  development  of  dunes  is  suppressed  in  very  short  channels, 
ripples  persist  to  higher  velocities.    The  stability  fields  for  ripples  and  dunes  thus 
seem  to  be  controlled  by  dynamically  separate  effects,  and  the  position  of  the 
boundary is mediated by the interaction between the two competing effects. 
 
 
 
3.2.3.15    The  depth-velocity-size  diagram  shown  in  Figures  2-47  and  2-48 
spans a depth  range of more  than an order of magnitude,  from  less  than a  tenth of 
a  meter  to  almost  a  meter,  with  good  coverage  of  data.        Figure  2-49  shows 
schematic  velocity-size  sections,  superimposed  on  the  same  plot,  for  flow  depths 
of  0.3  m,  1  m,  and  3  m.    The  0.3  m  and  1  m  boundaries  are  well  tied  down  by 
flume  data,  but  the  3 m  boundary  is  just  an  extrapolation  from    shallower  depths.  
But  the  field boundaries are constrained well enough  in  the 0.1-1.0 m depth  range 
that  extrapolation  by  even  another  order  of  magnitude  to  about  ten  meters,  to 
cover  much  of  the  range  of  natural  flow  depths  in  rivers  and  tidal  currents, 
shouldn't introduce any gross distortions in velocity estimates for the various fields 
and  their  boundaries.    You  can  see  from  Figure  2-49  that  with  increasing  flow 
depth,  all  phase  boundaries  shift upward,  the  antidune boundary  the most  rapidly, 
and  the  dune  field  spans  a  greater  range  of  velocities.    The  sediment  sizes 
associated  with  the  two  triple  points  seem  to  change  little  with  flow  depth.    You 
can compare this extrapolation with the "Rubin diagram" (Figure 2-50), assembled 
by Rubin and McCulloch (1980), which shows the depth-velocity-size diagram for 
deeper natural flows.

         3.2.3.16    It's  important  to  know  not  just  the  conditions  for  existence  of 
the  various  bed  phases,  but  also  something  about  how  their  size  and  shape  varies 
within  those  fields.   This  is  a more  demanding  task,  because  you  have  to measure 
the  bed  forms  rather  than  just  discover  their  existence.    Even  in  flumes  that's  dif-
ficult,  to  say  nothing  about  natural  flow  environments.    This  boils  down  to 
knowing  how  the  height  and  spacing  of  dunes  varies with  flow  depth,  flow  veloc-
ity,  and  sand  size,  because  ripples  don't  vary  much  in  size  or  shape  over  most  of 
their  range  of  existence.    Figure  2-51  shows  crude  contours  of  dune  spacing 
(Figure  2-51A)  and  dune  height  (Figure  2-51B)  in  a  depth-velocity  graph,  and 
Figure  2-52  shows  crude  contours  of  dune  spacing  (Figure  2-52A)  and  dune 
height  (Figure  2-52B)  in  a  velocity-size  graph.    Data  are  from  the  USGS  flume 
program in the 1950s and 1960s (Guy et al., 1966).

3.2.3.18    In  the  depth-velocity  section  (Figure  2-51A),  dune  spacing  in-
creases from lower left to upper right, with increasing depth and velocity, although 
the extent of  the data points does not constrain  the slopes of  the contours well.   In 
the  velocity-size  section  (Figure  2-52A),  dune  spacing  increases  from  lower  right 
to  upper  left  with  increasing  velocity  and  decreasing  sediment  size;  the  greatest 
spacings  are  at  the  upper-plane-bed  boundary  and  a  sediment  size  of  between  0.2 
and  0.3  mm.    Dune  height  shows  a  different  and  more  complicated  behavior.    In 
the  depth-velocity  section  (Figure  2-51B),  dune  height  increases  monotonically 
with  increasing  depth  but  shows  an  increase  and  then  a  decrease  with  increasing 
flow velocity  at  constant depth.    In  the velocity-size  section  (Figure 2-52B),  there 
is  an  elongated  core  of  greatest  heights  extending  from  near  the  left-hand 
extremity of  the dune  field,  at  the  finest  sizes of  about 0.2 mm,  rightward  to  sizes 
of  0.5  to  0.6 mm.   Heights  seem  to  decrease  in  all directions  from  that  core, most 
rapidly with decreasing flow velocity.     

 
3  .2.4  Flow and Sediment Movement over Ripples and Dunes 
3.2.4.1  Flow over ripples and dunes is dominated by flow separation, a phe-
nomenon whereby  the  flow separates  from  the solid boundary  in  the region where 
the boundary  curves  away  from  the general upstream  flow direction.   The general 
picture  of  separated  flow  over  a  ripple  or  a  dune  is  shown  in  Figure  2-53,  and  in 
more  cartoonlike  form  in  Figure  2-54.    When  the  flow  reaches  the  crest  it 
continues  to move  in  the  same  direction  rather  than  bending  downward  to  follow 
the  contour  of  the  bed.    Strong  turbulence  develops  along  the  surface  of  strong 
shear,  called  the  shear  layer,  which  represents  the  contrast  between  the  high 
velocity  in  the  separated  flow  and  the  low  velocity  in  the  shelter  of  the  bed  form.  
This  turbulence expands both upward and downward, and at some position down-
stream  of  the  crest  the  turbulent  shear  layer meets  the  sediment  bed.    The  flow  is 

 80

said  to  reattach  to  the  bed  at  that  point.    Downstream  of  reattachment,  the  flow 
near  the  bed  is  directed  downstream  once  again.    Upstream  of  reattachment,  in 
 
 
 
what  is  called  the  separation  vortex,  the  bed  feels  a  weak  flow  in  the  reverse 
direction.

3.2.4.2    Take  a  tour  of  a  ripple  or  dune  profile  by  starting  at  a  crest,  sliding 
down  the  slip  face,  and  then  walking  across  the  trough  and  up  the  stoss  surface 
downstream  (Figure  2-55).    The  flow  you'd  sense  would  differ  greatly  along  the 
profile.  You could actually do this on a big dune in a river or a tidal current, or on 
a subaerial dune.  Refer to Figures 2-53 and 2-54 as you read on.

     3.2.4.3    Turbulence  rapidly  develops  on  the  shear  surface  extending  down-
stream  from  the  separation  point  at  the  ripple  crest.    The  turbulent  shear  layer 
grows  upward  into  the  now-separated  boundary  layer  above,  and  also  downward.  
The  streamline  (defined  only  in  a  time-average  sense)  that  extends  downstream 
from  the  point  of  separation  at  the  crest,  called  the  dividing  streamline,  descends 
gently toward the trough, as the overall flow tries to follow the ripple profile.    
3.2.4.4   At  about  ten  step  heights  or  a  little  less  downstream,  the  shear  layer 
meets the bed at a moderate angle at a stagnation point (also well defined only in a 
time-average  sense).    The  shear  layer  is  said  to  reattach  to  the  boundary  at  that 
point.    (Technically  it's  a  stagnation  line  rather  than  a  stagnation  point.)    At 
reattachment  the  flow  in  the  shear  layer  divides:    some  is  diverted  upchannel,  but 
most continues downchannel, now in contact with the bed.  
3.2.4.5    The  space  below  the  shear  layer  and  upstream  of  the  reattachment 
line  is  called  the  separation  bubble  (although  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  bubbles 
sensu  stricto).    Turbulent  mixing  of  fluid  from  the  top  of  the  separation  bubble 
into  the  lower  part  of  the  shear  layer,  together  with  the  upchannel  diversion  of  a 
part  of  the  shear  layer  at  reattachment,  combine  to  produce  a  weak  vortex  or 
roller,  with  sense  of  circulation  shown  in  Figure  2-54.    As  you  moved  down  the 
lee face and out onto the trough you'd feel a weak, irregular, eddying current in the 
opposite direction.   
3.2.4.6   Near  the  reattachment  line you'd  feel  the  full effect of  the  turbulence 
in  the  shear  layer.    In  the  reattachment  zone  the  strong  eddies  generated  in  the 
shear  layer  impinge  upon  the  bed  and  flatten  out  against  it  to  cause  temporarily 
very high  local  shear  stresses.   You'd  feel  strong puffs of  flow  trying  to push you 
this  way  and  that.    But  even  though  the  shear  stress  is  high  at  certain  points  and 
certain  times,  it's  nearly  zero  on  the  average;  the  time-average  component  of 
velocity  parallel  to  the  bed  is  zero  at  the  reattachment  line,  by  definition,  so  the 
time-average  local  boundary  shear  stress  is  just  about  zero  there  also.    Both  the 
near-bed  velocity  and  the  average  boundary  shear  stress  increase  sharply  down-
stream from reattachment, but the magnitudes of the fluctuations decrease.  
3.2.4.7    The  flow  a  short  distance  downstream  of  reattachment  has  a  very 
complex structure.  There are three layers: 
   
θ  The  shear  layer  developed  by  separation  is  now  flowing  in  contact with  the 
bed.   
θ    Above  the  reattached  shear  layer  is  the  original  boundary-layer  flow  from 
upstream,  which  maintains  its  identity  for  a  long  distance  downstream  of 
separation even as it's consumed from below.   

 82

 

 

 

 

    

θ  As it moves up the stoss surface, the flow in the reattached shear layer has to 
adjust  itself  to  the  presence  of  the  boundary  by  development  of  a  new 
boundary layer (an example of an internal boundary layer) upward from the 
bed.    In  this  way  the  presence  of  the  boundary  eventually  alters  the 
structure  of  the  turbulence  in  both  of  the  other  two  layers  above;  the  dis-
turbed boundary layer is said to relax toward the new equilibrium state.  
 
3.2.4.8    If  a  planar  boundary  extended  far  enough  downstream,  the  new 
boundary  layer  would  eventually  develop  through  the  entire  flow  depth,  and  the 
velocity gradient and therefore the bed shear stress would decrease gradually from 
a  maximum 
just  downstream  of  reattachment 
to  equilibrium  values  far 
downstream.    But  in  flow  over  a  ripple,  redevelopment  is  still  incomplete  where 
the  flow  reaches  the  crest,  so  the  flow  well  above  the  crest  senses  little  of  the 
profound  changes  in  near-bed  flow.    The  flow  throughout  the  growing  boundary 
layer  and  the  degrading  shear  layer  above  it  is  accelerated  as  it's  crowded upward 
over  the  upsloping  stoss  surface.    It  doesn't  take  much  of  a  slope  for  this 
acceleration  to  cause  an  increase  in  both  boundary  shear  stress  and  near-bed  ve-
locity up  the  stoss  surface,  so  the near-bed  flow  is  strongest as  it  reaches  the crest 
to separate again.  
3.2.4.9    The  mode  of  sediment  transport  varies  greatly  from  place  to  place 
over  the  ripple  or  dune  profile.    A  repetition  of  your  traverse,  just  to  watch  the 
sediment  movement,  would  be  good.    See  Figure  2-56  for  a  key  to  what's  dis-
cussed  below.    Start  at  the  reattachment  zone,  where  time-average  bed-load 
transport  rate  is  near  zero.    Strong  eddies  in  the  reattaching  shear  layer  impinge 
upon  the  bed  to  cause  strong  but  sporadic  grain  transport.    At  low  mean-flow 
velocities  sediment  is  shifted  this  way  and  that  on  the  bed  in  local  pulses  that 
strike seemingly at random.  This is the site of first suspension of sediment as flow 
velocity  gradually  increases:    swirls  of  sediment  are  put  into  suspension  in  puffs 
and gusts, and then the grains either settle directly back to the bed or are dispersed 
up into the flow.

         3.2.4.10    Downchannel  from  reattachment  the  pulses  of  movement  are  di-
rected  more  and  more  consistently  downchannel  and  gradually  give  way  to more 
uniform grain movement up the stoss slope.  In the other direction they cease to be 
important  just  a  short  distance  upchannel  from  reattachment,  because  flow  in  the 
separation vortex is relatively weak.  
3.2.4.11    Grain movement  up  the  stoss  surface  is much  like  that  on  a  planar 
sediment  bed:    as  isolated  puffs  at  low mean-flow  velocities,  and  as  a  continuous 
sheet  at higher velocities.   With  increasing velocity  the bed-load movement  is ob-
scured  by  sediment  suspended  from  the  trough  or  from  upstream  ripples.    Dunes 
often  have  ripples  or  even  smaller  dunes  superimposed  on  their  stoss  slopes;  this 
shouldn't  surprise  you,  because  such  bed  forms  are  very  opportunistic,  and  will 
develop wherever they have enough space and the right flow conditions.  
3.2.4.12    At  low  flow  velocities  all  the  sediment  transported  as  bed  load  to 
the  brink  is  dumped  there,  tending  to  build  the  stoss  surface  forward  over  the  top 
of the lee surface.  The sediment slips down the lee surface as a kind of grain flow 
to  try  to  restore  a  stable  angle  of  repose.    Grain  flow  is  localized  and  sporadic 
when  the  rate  of  delivery  is  slow,  but  widespread  and  continuous  at  higher  flow 
velocities.   The  result  is a nearly planar  lee  surface,  the  slip  face, with  a break  in 
slope  not  only  at  the  top  but  also  at  the  base,  where  the  slip  face  builds  forward 
onto the surface of the trough downstream.  
3.2.4.13  At higher flow velocities some fraction of the transported grains are 
carried  beyond  the  crest  above  the  separation  surface,  to  settle  through  the 
complicated  turbulent  flow  field  in  the  wake  of  the  ripple  and  land  at  various 
points  (Figure  2-57):    on  the  slip  face,  in  the  trough,  on  the  stoss  surface  of  the 
next ripple downstream, or even on some ripple much farther downstream.  Where 
the grains  land depends on  several  things:    the  flow velocity,  the  settling velocity, 
the  height  of  the  grains  above  the  bed  as  they  pass  over  the  brink,  and  just which 
eddies the grains happen to fall through.

3.2.4.14   When  the  ripple geometry  is  three-dimensional many  troughs  show 
no well defined  separation vortex, and patterns of  flow and sediment  transport are 
not  as  simple  as  outlined  above.    The  bed  surface  near  the  base  of  the  lee  slope 
nonetheless  usually  feels  flows  that  are  much  weaker  than  over  the  stoss  slope, 
although  these  flows may have a  substantial  cross-stream  component.   Transverse 
flow  in  the  lee of  the dunes often makes  ripples  in  troughs and on  lee slopes, with 
crests oriented at a large and variable angle to the dune crests.  
3.2.4.15    Ripples  and  dunes  move  downstream,  at  speeds  orders  of  magni-
tude slower than the flow speed, by erosion on the stoss surface and deposition on 
the  lee.    It's  surprisingly  difficult  to  characterize  this  downstream  movement, 
partly  because  the  bed  forms  change  their  profiles  with  time,  but  even  more  im-
portantly  because  any  given  bed  form  has  a  finite  lifetime:    it's  formed,  it moves, 
and  it  eventually  dies,  usually  within  a  travel  distance  equal  to  only  a  small mul-
tiple  of  the  bed-form  spacing,  something  like  5-10  spacings.    A  good  way  to  ap-
prehend  the  transitory  existence  of  individual  bed  forms  is  to  take  a  time-lapse 
movie  of  a  moving  train  of  ripples  in  your  flume.   When  you  viewed  the  film  at 
normal  speed  you'd  see  the  ripples  doing  all  sorts  of  crazy  things  that  are  hard  to 
appreciate by  real-time viewing;    the moderately regular arrangement of ripples  in 
still life is deceiving.  

 
3.3  Oscillatory-Flow and Combined-Flow Bed Configurations 
 
3  .3.1  Introduction 
3.3.1.1    Remember  from  the  discussion  of  gravity  waves  that  shallow-water 
waves  propagating  in  water  much  shallower  than  the  wavelength  cause  a  back-
and-forth  motion  of  the  water  at  the  bottom.    If  the  maximum  speed  of  the  water 
(which  is  attained  in  the  middle  of  the  oscillation)  exceeds  the  threshold  for  sed-
iment  movement,  oscillatory-flow  bed  forms  develop.    This  is  common  in  the 
shallow  ocean, where  swell  from  distant  storms  causes  bottom  oscillatory motion 
even  though  the  weather  is  fine  and  calm  locally.    Bottom-water  motions  under 
large  storm  waves  cause  bed  forms  too,  but  then  there's  likely  to  be  a  nonnegli-
gible  current  running  as  well;  we'll  have  something  to  say  about  such  combined-
flow bed forms in a later section. 
3.3.1.2   The  treatment of oscillatory-flow bed configurations here will be  the 
same  as  that  for  unidirectional  flow  bed  configurations  above,  although  not  as 
lengthy:    after  describing  an  exploratory  flume  experiment,  we'll  present  what's 
known about the existence fields of the various kinds of bed configuration. 
 
3  .3.2  A Tank Experiment on Oscillatory-Flow Bed Configurations 
3.3.2.1    There  are  three  different  ways  to  make  oscillatory-flow  bed  config-
urations  in  the  home  or  laboratory.    One  is  to  build  a  big  long  tank  and  make 
waves  in  it  by  putting  a  wave  generator  at  one  end  and  a  wave  absorber  at  the 
other  end  (Figure  2-58).    The  generator  doesn't  have  to  be  anything  more  than  a 
flap  hinged  at  the  bottom  and  rocked  back  and  forth  in  the  direction  of  the  tank 
axis at the desired period.  This arrangement makes nice bed forms, but the trouble 
is that you're limited to short oscillation periods. 

 85

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.2.2   Another  good way  to make  oscillatory-flow  bed  configurations  is  to 
build  a  horizontal  closed  duct  that  connects  smoothly with  reservoir  tanks  at  both 
ends,  fill  the  whole  thing  with  water,  and  then  put  a  piston  in  contact  with  the 
water  surface  in  one  of  the  reservoir  tanks  and  oscillate  it  up  and  down  at  the 
period  you  want  (Figure  2-59).    This  lets  you  work  with  much  longer-period 
oscillations, but there's the practical problem that the apparatus has its own natural 
oscillation  period,  and  if  you  try  to  make  oscillations  at  a  much  different  period 
you have to fight against what the duct wants to do, and that means big forces.

3.3.2.3    The  third  way  should  seem  elegant  and  ingenious  to  you:    place  a 
sand-covered horizontal  tray at  the bottom of a big tank of water, and oscillate the 
tray  back  and  forth  underneath  the  water  (Figure  2-60).    The  problem  is  that  the 
details  of  particle  and  fluid  accelerations  are  subtly  different  from  the  other  two 
devices,  and  it  turns  out  that  the  bed  configurations  don't  correspond  well  with 
those produced in the other two ways.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.2.4    We  suggest  that  you  build  the  horizontal  closed  duct  apparatus,  if 
you still have  room  left  in your back yard.   The only problem, aside from fighting 
leaks,  is  the mechanical  arrangement  to make  the  up-and-down  oscillation.   Have 
you ever seen those weird-looking pump jacks in oilfields?  One of those would be 
just right for the job.   
3.3.2.5  Then you can make an exploratory series of runs to get a general idea 
of  the  nature  of  oscillatory-flow  bed  configurations.   Work  at  just  one  oscillation 
period, in the range from three to five seconds.  Start at a low velocity and increase 
it in steps.  Here's the sequence of bed configurations you'd see (Figure 2-61).

3.3.2.6    Once  the  movement  threshold  is  reached,  a  pattern  of  extremely 
regular  and  straight-crested  ripples  develops  on  a  previously  planar  bed.    The 
ripples  are  symmetrical  in  cross  section,  with  sharp  crests  and  broad  troughs.    In 
striking  contrast  to  unidirectional-flow  bed  configurations,  the  plan  pattern  is 
strikingly  regular:    ripple  size  varies  little  from  ripple  to  ripple.    At  fairly  low 
velocities  the  ripples  are  relatively  small,  with  spacings  of  no  more  than  several 
centimeters, but with increasing velocity they get bigger and bigger.  
3.3.2.7    In  a  certain  range  of moderate  velocities,  the  ripples  become  notice-
ably  less  regular  and  more  three-dimensional,  although  they  still  are  oriented 
dominantly across  the oscillatory flow.   These 3D ripples continue  to grow  in size 
with  increasing  velocity,  until  eventually  they  become  flattened  and  are  finally 
washed out  to a planar bed.   So,  just as  is  true  in unidirectional  flows,  rugged bed 
configurations pass over  into a stable plane-bed mode of  transport with  increasing 
velocity. 
3.3.2.8    We  want  to  make  a  distinction  here  between  what  we'll  call 
oscillatory-current  ripples  and  reversing-current  ripples. 
  Although 
the 
terminology  is  somewhat  infelicitous,  the  distinction  is  significant.    Oscillatory-
current  ripples  are  dynamically  related  to  the  oscillatory  current  itself.    These  are 
the  ripples  that  start  small  and  grow  much  larger  as  oscillation  speed  and  period 
are  increased,  and  are  coupled  in  some  not-well-understood  way  to  the  orbital 
diameter.    Reversing-current  ripples,  on  the  other  hand,  are  dynamically  akin  to 
unidirectional-flow ripples, in that they are formed and maintained by the one-way 
flow  during  each  part  of  the  oscillation.    The  reversal  of  the  current  merely  flips 
their symmetry, and also inhibits their full development.  They live stunted lives in 

 88

 

 

 

 

    

which  they  can  develop  no  further  than  incipient  unidirectional-flow  ripples.  
Significantly,  their  size  is  almost  independent  of  the  oscillation  period  and  veloc-
ity.           

 

3  .3.3  Bed-Configuration Regimes 
3.3.3.1   Let's  assume  again  that  the  sediment  is described well  enough by  its 
density ρs and average size D.   The oscillatory flow is specified by any two of the 
following  three  variables:  oscillation  period T,  orbital  diameter  do,  and maximum 
orbital  velocity  Um;  let's  use  T  and  Um.    As  with  unidirectional-flow  bed 
configurations, we  also need  to  include ρ, μ,  and g.     That makes  seven variables.  
Let's take exactly the same approach as for unidirectional flow:  the only variables 
of  the  seven  that  vary  much  in  water  flows  transporting  quartz-density  sediment 
on  Earth  are  sediment  size,  oscillation  period,  maximum  orbital  velocity,  and 
water viscosity, and we can  safely neglect  the viscosity with only minor  fuzziness 
of  the  results.    So  we  can  examine  relationships  among  bed  phases  in  a  three-
dimensional size-velocity-period graph.   
3.3.3.2   The most convenient and  revealing way of  looking at  the size-veloc-
ity-period  graph  is  by  means  of  several  velocity-period  sections  for  different 
sediment  sizes  (Figure  2-62).    Figure  2-63  shows  two  such    sections,  one  for  fine 
to  very  fine  sands,  with  average  size  in  a  narrow  range  of  0.1-0.2  mm  (Figure 
2-63A),  and  the  other  for  coarser  sands,  with  average  size  in  the  narrow  range 
0.50-0.65 mm  (Figure  2-63B).   As with  unidirectional  flows,  the  axes  are  labeled 
with the 10°C values of orbital velocity and oscillation period corresponding to the 
actual dimensionless variables, but you don't need to concern yourselves with that.

3.3.3.3    In  both  parts  of  Figure  2-63  a  broad  field  of  ripples  of  various  sizes 
and  shapes  is  bounded  below  by  a  field  where  the  flow  is  too  weak  to  maintain 
equilibrium  ripples  and  above  by  a  field  for  transport  over  a  planar  bed.    The 
boundary between ripples and plane bed is clear-cut, but because of the scarcity of 
official  plane-bed  data  points  (not  shown),  is  fairly  well  constrained  only  at 
intermediate  oscillation  periods.    The  boundary  between  ripples  and  no  ripple 
maintenance  is  less well  defined,  owing  to  a  lack  of well  documented  runs.    This 
boundary  is drawn  arbitrarily  to be horizontal. As  in  the unidirectional  case,  there 
actually  are  two  boundaries  in  this  region  of  the  graph,  one  for  development  of 
ripples  on  a  planar  bed  and  the  other  for  maintenance  of  preexisting  ripples  with 
slowly  decreasing  velocity.    The  ripple  field  clearly  broadens  rightward.    The 
minimum  period  for  generation  of  ripples  seems  not  to  have  been  studied,  but  in 
any case is unimportant for natural sedimentary environments. 
 
 
 
3.3.3.4    In  Figure  2-63A,  for  very  fine  to  fine  sand,  ripple  spacings  increase 
from  about  0.05  m  at  periods  of  less  than  2  s  to  well  over  a  meter  at  periods  ap-
proaching  10  s.    Crude  contours  of  spacing,  drawn  where  possible,  are  nearly 
parallel  to  lines  of  equal  orbital  diameter  do,  reflecting  the  well  known  tendency 
for  oscillatory-flow  ripples  to  scale with  orbital  diameter,  but  there  seems  to  be  a 
tendency  for  these  contours  to  be  steeper  than  the  lines  of  constant  do.    The  out-
standing  feature  of  this  graph  is  a  transition  from  regular  and  straight-crested 
ripples  (two-dimensional  ripples)  at  low  oscillatory  speeds  and  small  periods  to 
irregular  (three-dimensional  ripples)  at  high  oscillatory  speeds  and  long  periods.  
This  transition  has  been  reported  in  several  studies  but  hasn't  been  studied  in  de-
tail.    Ripple  spacings  in  some  of  these  three-dimensional  ripple  runs were  not  re-
ported  even  approximately.    At  the  longest  oscillation  periods  typical  of  shallow 
marine  environments,  in  the  range  8-20  s,  large  three-dimensional  ripples  are  the 
stable configuration at oscillation speeds up to about one meter per second.

         3.3.3.5    It's  clear  that  all  of  the  two-dimensional  ripples,  at  relatively  small 
orbital  velocities  are  oscillatory-current  ripples,  as  defined  earlier.    The  onset  of 
three-dimensional  geometry  with  increasing  orbital  velocity  at  any  given  oscilla-
tion  period  seems  to  reflect  the  development  of  reversing-current  ripples  (which 
are  dynamically  akin  to  current  ripples  in  unidirectional  flows,  and  vary  little  in 
spacing)  and  their  increasingly  strong  interaction  with  the  oscillatory-current 
ripples.    At  longer  oscillation  periods  and  even  greater  orbital  velocities  the 
oscillatory-current  ripples  grow  to  be  much  larger  than  the  reversing-current 
ripples,  thus  eliminating  the  strong  interaction  between  the  two;  the  reversing-
current  ripples  are  only  passively  superimposed  upon  these  larger  oscillatory-
current ripples.  We want to emphasize that a lot more work has to be done at rela-
tively  large  orbital  velocities  and  oscillation  periods  before  these  speculative  re-
lationships can be confirmed. 
3.3.3.6  Careful observations of oscillation ripples in the shallow oceans have 
revealed  the  existence  at moderate  to  large  oscillation  speeds  and  long  oscillation 
periods,  in  the  upper  right  of  Figure  2-63A,  of  only  small  2D  ripples,  with 
spacings  almost  without  exception  in  the  range  0.07-0.08  m,  rather  than  large 
three-dimensional  ripples.    These  small  ripples  are  almost  certainly  reversing-
current  ripples,  described  above.    Why  were  large  three-dimensional  ripples  not 
observed?    Was  not  enough  time  available  as  the  oscillatory  flow  waned  from 
plane-bed  conditions?    Or  is  there  something  inherent  in  oscillatory  flow  in  a 
closed flow duct that is conducive to their development?  The ancient sedimentary 
record  of  shallow-marine  environments  gives  incontrovertible  evidence  of  large-
scale  three-dimensional  oscillation  ripples  in  fine  sands,  but  we  have  no  way  of 
knowing  whether  the  oscillatory  flow  was  dominated  by  a  single  component  or 
was  composed  of  a  range  of  components  with  different  periods,  directions,  and 
amplitudes.    Only  observations  of  the  bed  configuration  in  the  shallow  ocean 
during storms can resolve this question.   
3.3.3.7   Relationships of  ripples  in  coarse  sands,  shown  in Figure 2-63B,  are 
simpler  than  in  fine  sands.    Ripple  spacing  again  increases  upward  to  the  right, 
scaled  closely  to  orbital  diameter.    Again  the  crude  contours  of  equal  ripple 
spacing  seem  to  slope  a  little more  steeply  than  the  lines of constant orbital diam-
eter.  Somewhat surprisingly, the lower boundary of the ripple field seems to be in 
about  the  same  position  as  for  the  much  finer  sands.    All  the  ripples  are  two-
dimensional  oscillatory-current  ripples;  for  reasons unclear,  the  instability  leading 
to  three-dimensional  geometry  in  fine  sands  is  not  manifested  in  coarse  sands.  
Neither  are  large  three-dimensional  oscillation  ripples  represented  in  the  ancient 
sedimentary record. 

 
3  .3.4  Combined-Flow Bed Configurations 
3.3.4.1  So far we've looked at just the two "end-member cases" of flows that 
make  bed  configurations.    Even  aside  from  the  importance  of  time-varying  uni-
directional  and  oscillatory  flows,  and  of  purely  oscillatory  flows  with  more  than 
just one back-and-forth oscillation  component,  there's a whole world of combined 
flows  out  there making  their  own  bed  configurations.   Observations  in  the natural 
environment  have  been  scarce,  and  systematic  laboratory  work  is  only  now 
beginning.    

 92

 

 

 

 

    

3.3.4.2   Observations of  combined-flow bed  configurations  are not yet  at  the 
stage where we can draw well organized graphs for you.  Theoretically, we should 
be  dealing  with  a  five-dimensional  graph,  made  up  with  the  variables    sediment 
size, unidirectional-flow velocity component, flow depth, oscillatory-flow velocity 
component, and oscillation period.  We would have great envy of anyone who can 
visualize  a  four-dimensional  graph  as  well  as  a  three-dimensional  graph,  but  we 
don't  know  anybody  who  can.    But  matters  are  not  as  bad  as  they  seem.    For 
oscillation-dominated  flow  we  should  be  able  to  neglect  the  flow  depth,  because 
everything  happens  in  an  oscillatory-flow  boundary  layer  within  a  meter  or  so 
above the bottom whose thickness is limited (in ways we can't discuss here) by the 
nature of  the oscillation  itself.   And in unidirectional-dominated flow we might be 
able to neglect the oscillation period.   
3.3.4.3    What  little  we  know  about  combined-flow  bed  configurations  is 
mostly  from  oscillation-dominated  combined  flow.   We  can  handle  the  four  vari-
ables  by  trying  to  plot  a  series  of  three-dimensional  graphs  for  various  values  of 
the  fourth  variable.    At  this  stage,  which  one  we  choose  as  the  fourth  variable  is 
irrelevant,  because  there's  data  only  for  one  sediment  size  and  one  oscillation 
period!    Figure  2-64,  from  experiments  by  Arnott  and  Southard  in  a  combined-
flow  duct,  shows  a  graph  of  oscillatory  velocity  component  against  unidirectional 
velocity  component  for  a  sand  size  of  about  0.1  mm  and  an  oscillation  period  of 
about 9 s.

3.3.4.4    The  plot  in  Figure  2-64  is  partitioned  into  fields  for  various  in-
tergradational  bed  phases.    In  the  range  of  flows  studied  (oscillatory  velocity  0-
0.80 m/s; unidirectional velocity 0-0.25 m/s)  these bed phases are:   no movement; 
small  two-dimensional  ripples;  small  three-dimensional  ripples;  large  three-
dimensional  ripples;  and  plane  bed.    The  transitions  among  these  bed  phases  are 
gradual;  the partitioning  is only an attempt  to  identify regions with distinctive bed 
geometry,  and  is  not meant  to  imply  sharp  distinctions  among  the various phases.  
But  the  differences  in  bed  configuration  from  region  to  region  in  Figure  2-64  are 
real and substantial.  In particular, the transition from small ripples to large ripples 
seems  to  represent  a  region  of  accelerated  change  in  bed-form  scale  compared  to 
regions above and below, where changes are slower although not negligible.    
3.3.4.5   The sequence of bed phases along  the oscillatory axis is known from 
earlier  work  in  the  same  flow  duct  using  the  same  sediment  size  and  oscillation 
period:    no  movement,  small  two-dimensional  ripples,  small  three-dimensional 
ripples,  large  three-dimensional  ripples,  plane  bed.   Likewise  the  sequence  of  bed 
phases along  the unidirectional axis  is well known  from many studies  in unidirec-
tional  flow:    no movement,  unidirectional-flow  ripples,  plane  bed.    In  the  interior 
of  the  graph,  the  boundary  between  no  movement  and  combined-flow  ripples  is 
not  well  constrained,  and  is  shown  arbitrarily  as  a  straight  line.    The  boundary 
between  combined-flow  ripples  and  plane  bed,  on  the  other  hand,  is  fairly  well 
constrained:    within  the  range  of  unidirectional  flow  velocities  attainable,  it  falls 
sharply  with  increasing  unidirectional  velocity  at  first  and  then  becomes  nearly 
horizontal.   
3.3.4.6  Over a narrow range of oscillatory velocities above threshold and for 
very  small  unidirectional  velocities,  less  than  a  few  centimeters  per  second,  the 
bed  configuration  consists of  regular  ripples with  straight and  laterally continuous 
sharp crests and broad  troughs oriented perpendicular  to  the  flow.   Ripple profiles 
are  only  slightly  asymmetrical.    With  only  slight  increase  in  either  velocity 
component the ripples become increasingly irregular in plan geometry.  Rightward 
from  the oscillatory axis, over  the entire range of unidirectional velocities studied,  
the  configuration  consists  of  relatively  small  ripples  with  more  or  less  sinuous 
although fairly continuous crest lines and with more or less pronounced local lows 
or  scour  pits  in  troughs.    Dips  on  the  upstream  and  downstream  ripple  flanks  are 
not  greatly  different,  but  the  lamination  within  the  ripples  always  dips 
downstream, because the ripples move slowly in the direction of the unidirectional 
component.   Even at small values of oscillatory velocity  the overall appearance of 
the ripples is not grossly different from those in purely unidirectional flows.   
3.3.4.7   As  oscillatory  velocity  increases  beyond  about  0.4 m/s,  the  three-di-
mensional  ripples  become  much  larger.    The  transition  is  gradual,  but  the  rate  of 
change  with  increasing  oscillatory  velocity  is  greater  than  at  smaller  oscillatory 
velocities.    Bed-form  crests  become  less  continuous  and  more  rounded,  resulting 
in forms whose geometry could be described as hummocky.  As spacing continues 
to  increase  to  over  2  m  at  the  highest  values  of  oscillatory  velocity,  detailed 
information  on  plan  geometry  is  lost  owing  to  the  narrowness  of  the  flow  duct 
used,  although  the  ripples  are  still  substantially  three-dimensional.    Except  at  the 
greatest  oscillatory  velocities,  small  reversing-current  ripples  are  prominently 
superimposed.    With  increasing  unidirectional  velocity  the  flow-parallel  profiles 
of  the  three-dimensional  ripples  become  more  asymmetrical,  eventually  attaining 

 94

 

 

 

 

    

lee-side  angles  of  up  to  25°.   A  unidirectional  component  of  only  a  few  centime-
ters per second is need to make the profiles noticeably asymmetrical.  Heights first 
increase with  oscillatory  velocity  and  then  decrease  in  the  transition  to  plane  bed.  
Spacings are a  large percentage of  the orbital diameter, suggesting  that  these  large 
three-dimensional  ripples  are  analogues  of  the  oscillatory-current  ripples  well 
known from oscillatory flows. 
3.3.4.8  These large three-dimensional combined-flow ripples must somehow 
disappear with  increasing unidirectional velocity, because  in purely unidirectional 
flow  small  three-dimensional  ripples  pass  into plane bed with  increasing velocity, 
and  the  upper  boundary  of  combined-flow  ripples  must  connect  with  that 
transition  point  on  the  unidirectional  axis,  as  shown  in  Figure  2-65,  which  is  a 
rather  speculative  extrapolation  of  Figure  2-64  to  greater  values  of  unidirectional 
velocity.    Also  to  be  ascertained  is  the  relationship  between  large  combined-flow 
ripples  in  very  fine  sand,  like  those  described  above,  and  dunes  in  purely 
unidirectional  flow  in  sands  coarser  than  about  0.2  mm.    A  whole  series  of 
intermediate  "sections"  in  the  four-dimensional  graph  of  oscillatory  velocity, 
unidirectional  velocity,  oscillation  period,  and  sediment  size  must  be  explored  to 
establish  this  relationship,  even  for  the  simplest  case  of  combined  flow,  in  which 
the oscillatory and unidirectional components are parallel.  
3.3.4.9    To  summarize  the  first-order  things  about  the  combined-flow  bed 
configurations  shown  in Figures 2-64 and 2-65,  it's clear  that  it  takes only a  small 
unidirectional  flow  component  to  make  oscillatory-flow  bed  forms  noticeably 
asymmetrical,  and  that  even  a  substantial  (but  subordinate)  oscillatory  flow 
doesn't  change  unidirectional-flow  bed  forms  very  much.    Also,  there's  clearly  a 
continuous  spectrum  of  small  ripplelike  bed  configurations  that  stretches  from 
unidirectional-flow  ripples  to  small  oscillatory-flow  vortex  ripples.    The  major 
problems  revolve around how  (if  in  fact at all!) unidirectional-flow dunes connect 
with the large 3D vortex ripples known to be produced by strong oscillatory flows 
at long oscillation periods.

3.4  Eolian Bed Configurations 
 
3.4.1   So far we've addressed only bed configurations formed in water flows.  
Bed  configurations  produced  by  the  wind  are  a  prominent  feature  of  the  Earth's 
modern surface, and by good evidence have been important at various times in the 
geologic past.   
3.4.2    If  we  take  the  most  general  view  in  the  context  of  the  kinds  of  exis-
tence  diagrams  described  in  the  earlier  sections  of  this  chapter, we might  imagine 
trying  to  obtain  the  data  to  construct  a  four-dimensional  graph  with  axes  unidi-
rectional  flow  velocity,  flow  depth,  sediment  size,  and  density  ratio ρs/ρ,  where 
remember  ρs  is  the  density  of  the  sediment  and  ρ  is  the  density  of  the  fluid.  
Probably the best way to deal with such a four-dimensional graph is to picture it as 
a  series  or  continuum  of  three  dimensional  depth-velocity-size  graphs  as  ρs/ρ 
varies.    Only  two  graphs  out  of  this  continuum  are  of  very  much  interest  to  us, 
though:    those  for  quartz-density  sand  in water  and  for  quartz-density  sand  in  air.  
You  also  have  to  sort  of  look  past  the  awkwardness  of  not  having  a  well  defined 
flow depth to deal with in the first place in the case of sand in air.  
3.4.3    Everyone  knows  that  there  are  two  important  eolian  bed  phases:    rip-
ples  and  dunes.   But  be  on  your  guard  against  assuming  that,  just  because we  use 
the  same  terminology  for  these  features  as  for  ripples  and  dunes  in  unidirectional 
water  flows,  the  two  sets  of  features  are  dynamically  related!    Unless  someone 
comes up with an incontrovertible theory for the existence and dynamics of dunes, 
the  only  way  we'll  ever  know  this  is  to  make  a  whole  series  of  observations  at 
intermediate  values  of  the  density  ratio.    (That  would  make  a  great  thesis  project 
for  somebody, wouldn't  it?)   Our  own  suspicion  is  that we would  be  able  to  trace 
the  continuous  existence  of  dunes  but  not  of  ripples  through  the  intermediate 
range.   
3.4.4    The  trouble with  the  organizedly  empirical  approach  (which works  so 
fruitfully for sand in water) in the case of sand in air is that we just don't know very 
much  about  the  existence  fields  for  eolian  bed  configurations,  let  alone  how  the 
size  and  geometry  of  dunes  varies  within  the  existence  field  for  dunes.    Maybe 
some of our eolian colleagues would take exception to that statement, but we think 
we can defend it pretty well.  Here are two factors we think are significant: 
 
θ   Nowhere  on  Earth  does  the  wind  blow  steadily  for  nearly  a  long  enough 
time  to  bring  the  bed  configuration  into  equilibrium  with  the  steady  wind.    There 
are,  however,  places  like  the  Arabian  Peninsula  where  the  sand-moving  winds 
blow mainly from the same direction but with time-varying velocity. 
θ   There aren't many places on Earth where eolian bed configurations aren't 
starved.    (By  starved  we  mean  that  the  thickness  of  wind-movable  sand  is  not 
great enough to prevent exposure of immovable substrate in the troughs of the bed 
forms.)   Actually,  that's  true only of  the  larger bed forms, which are always called 
dunes;  full-bed wind  ripples are of course common, although starved wind  ripples 
are important too. 
 
3.4.5    As  far  as  we  can  tell,  we  don't  even  know  whether  eolian  dunes  are 
self-limiting  in  size  or  whether  they  would  continue  to  grow  in  size  given  a  long 
enough  reach  of  full  sand  bed  exposed  to  the wind.   But we  think  that  in  practice 

 96

 

 

 

 

    

this  is  not  a  big  issue,  because  in  most  situations  dune  size  is  limited  either  by 
starvation or by limited reach length.   
3.4.6    Has  it  ever  struck  you  that  subaerial  types  never  make  duct  experi-
ments  on  subaerial  dunes  the  way  the  subaqueous  types  like  us  make  flume  ex-
periments  on  subaqueous  dunes?    What  would  we  find  if  we  built  a  gigantic 
quonset-hut  racetrack  duct  on  a  full  sand  surface  in  the  desert  and  ran  a  steady 
wind over the sand surface with an aircraft engine?  we suspect that no matter how 
big  we  built  the  duct,  the  dunes  would  grow  to  the  point  where  further  growth  is 
impeded  by  their  feeling  the  roof.    We  could  indeed  make  some  interesting  ob-
servations on: 
 
θ  dune development 
θ  how the fully grown dunes vary in shape as a function of wind velocity 
θ    the  wind  velocity  needed  to  smooth  out  the  dunes  to  a  plane  bed  (not  very 
relevant to the Earth's surface, we suppose!)  
  
3.4.7   We  think  the bottom  line here  is  that most of  the emphasis we gave  to 
the  existence,  size,  and  geometry  under  steady,  full-bed  conditions  in water  flows 
is irrelevant to the real world of eolian bed forms and stratification.  The geometry 
if  not  the  scale  of  most  real  eolian  dunes  (which  is  what  mainly  determines  the 
nature  of  eolian  cross-stratification)  is  shaped  mainly  by  the  time  history  of  wind 
speed  and  direction  in  the  dune  field,  which  as  we  pointed  out  earlier  ranges  all 
over the place.  This is what occupies a lot of the efforts of eolian researchers.  We 
won't  try  to  summarize  here  what's  known  in  this  regard,  partly  because  the 
possibilities are  so varied but mainly because we're not an expert on such matters.  
Eventually, though, we'll have to return to this difficulty when we deal with the         
     
3.5  A Note on Bed-Configuration Dynamics 
 
3.5.1   At first  thought  it might seem  that the natural mode of transport would 
be over a planar bed.  In certain ranges of flow a planar transport surface is indeed 
the stable bed configuration.  Only in laminar flows, however, is this invariably so.  
You've seen  that  in  turbulent flows, plane-bed  transport  is  the stable configuration 
under  certain  conditions, but bed  forms are  the dominant  transport  surface  in both 
oscillatory  and  unidirectional  flows.    This  must  mean  that  over  a  wide  range  of 
flows  and  sediment  sizes  a  planar  transport  surface  is  unstable  to  small 
perturbations,  and  otherwise 
insignificant  geometrical  irregularities,  either 
preexisting or flow-generated, are amplified to become bed forms.    
3.5.2    Can  theories  be  developed  to  account  for  the  existence  and  range  of 
occurrence  of  the  bed  configurations  we  observe?    A  time-honored  way  of  de-
veloping  theories  for  such phenomena  is  to make a stability analysis:   write down 
what  you  think  is  the  governing  equation  of  motion  (or,  in  the  case  of  sediment-
transporting  turbulent  flows,  some  workable  approximation  thereto),  and  then 
introduce  a  small-amplitude  perturbation  to  the  planar  bed  and  see  whether  the 
perturbation  is  damped  out  with  time  (indicating  that  the  plane  bed  is  the  stable 
configuration)  or  whether  the  perturbation  is  amplified  with  time  (indicating  that 
rugged  bed  forms  are  destined  to  develop).    In  the  latter  case,  you  can  also  try  to 
see which wavelength of disturbance grows the fastest, thus presumably indicating 
the scale of the resulting bed forms.   

 97

 

 

 

 

    

3.5.3    There's  been  some  modest  success  with  such  stability  analyses,  but 
there are lots of difficulties.  As the flow molds the bed by erosion and deposition, 
the  bed  geometry  thus  generated  changes  the  structure  of  the  flow  itself  in 
fundamental  ways  that  are  difficult  to  build  into  mathematical  models.    There  is 
thus  a  strong  interaction  or  feedback  between  the  bed  and  the  flow;  this  essential 
element of complexity has hindered  the development of  theory.   Another problem 
is  that  even  if  the  stability  analysis  is  successful,  it  says  nothing  about  the  finite-
amplitude effects that are really important in shaping the growing bed forms. 
 
4.  DEPOSITION 
 
4.1  Introduction 
 
4.1.1    The  topic  of  deposition  is  obviously  an  important  one,  because  every 
sedimentary sequence was deposited somehow.  This section is meant to serve as a 
framework  for  trying  to  make  interpretations  about  deposition  from  the  evidence 
of beds in a sedimentary section in the final section.   
4.1.2    Let  us  pose  a  question  for  you:    "Why  does  deposition  happen?"   We 
wonder whether  this  strikes  you  as  a  trivial  question  or  as  a  difficult  question.    In 
one  sense,  we  can  supply  a  simple  answer:    sediment  is  carried  by  a  flow,  and 
when  the  conditions  are  such  that  the  flow  becomes  overloaded,  the  sediment  is 
deposited.  But in another sense, this is a superficial answer, because it doesn't ac-
count  for  the  conditions  under which  a  flow  becomes  overloaded,  and we  have  to 
look for a more fundamental answer.   
4.1.3    The  most  straightforward  process  involved  in  deposition  is  settling:  
the  downward  fall  of  sediment  particles  through  the  surrounding  fluid  by  the  pull 
of gravity.  But keep in mind that there's far more to deposition than just settling of 
sediment  particles:    you  have  to worry  about where  the  sediment  came  from,  how 
it got to the site of deposition, and how it was deposited at the site of deposition.     
 
4.2  Modes of Deposition 

 
4.2.1  Introduction 
 
4.2.1.1  This subsection examines local modes of sediment deposition.  Some 
of  these  modes  may  be  observable  in  laboratory  experiments  or  in  field  studies.  
Others may  be  difficult  or  impossible  to observe with present  technology,  and we 
can only make deductions or  speculations about  them.    (Keep  in mind  that deduc-
tions can be very dangerous in physical sedimentology, because the physics of the 
phenomena  are  so  complex  that we  can  easily  fool ourselves  into  thinking  that  an 
unimportant  process  is  important  or  that  an  important  process  is  unimportant.)  
The treatment will be entirely qualitative. 
4.2.1.2   Several distinctive modes of deposition, discussed  in  the subsections 
below, can be recognized.  These modes grade into one another; there are no sharp 
boundaries  among  the  various  processes  involved.    Keep  in  mind  also  that  the 
terms  used  for  these  modes  are  only  unofficial;  you  won't  find  them  in  the  pub-
lished  literature  on  sediment  deposition.    See  Figure  2-66  for  cartoons  that  illus-
trate the various modes of deposition.

4  .2.2  Fallout Without Traction 
4.2.2.1      In  the  simplest of depositional modes, sediment particles suspended 
in a flow by some earlier process or event settle to the bed and are not transported 
thereafter,  either  by  traction  or  by  suspension  (Figure  2-66A).    This  might  be 
called fallout without traction.

4.2.2.2    Flows  that  deposit  sediment  by  fallout  without  traction  have  ve-
locities below the threshold for bed-load transport, which ranges from slightly less 
than 0.2 m/s  to well over 0.3 m/s, depending on  the depth of  the flow and  the size 
of  the  sediment  particles.    In  general,  the  weaker  the  flow,  the  finer  the  sediment 
being  carried  and  deposited  in  this mode.     The  flow may  even  be  nonexistent;  in 
that  case,  the  sediment  must  be  supplied  directly  from  above,  as  for  example  by 
fallout of eolian sediment into a standing body of water.        
4.2.2.3   The size of  the sediment deposited by fallout without traction is usu-
ally  very  fine,  seldom  coarser  than  very  fine  sand.    The  reason  is  that  the  flow 
would need to be much stronger to carry coarser sediment in suspension, and such 
flows  would  be  strong  enough  to  move  the  deposited  sediment  as  bed  load  after 
the sediment lands on the bed. 
4  .2.3  Fallout With Traction 
4.2.3.1   Sediment particles may settle onto  the sediment bed  from suspension 
and  then  be  moved  as  bed  load,  or  even  resuspended  temporarily,  before  they 
eventually  come  to  permanent  rest  and  are  buried  by  other  particles  as  the  bed 
builds up (Figure 2-66B).  This might be called fallout with traction.  
4.2.3.2   Flows  that deposit  sediment by  fallout with  traction can have a wide 
range  of  velocities,  from  a  small  fraction  of  a  meter  per  second  to  much  greater 
than a  few meters per  second.   Sediment  size can  range  from silts  to gravels.   The 
only condition is that the flow is not so overloaded with suspended sediment that a 
well defined sediment-water interface cannot be maintained.   
4  .2.4  Differential Transport 
4.2.4.1   A  sediment  deposit  can  be  formed without  any  fallout  from  suspen-
sion.    At  first  thought  this  might  seem  strange,  so  we  need  to  spend  a  little more 
time  discussing  this  mode  of  deposition.    Think  about  the  consequences  of  a 
downstream change in sediment transport rate in a steady flow.   
4.2.4.2    Look  at  a  small  rectangular  reference  area  on  the  sediment  bed  be-
neath a flow that's transporting sediment over the bed (Figure 2-67).  The edges of 
the  reference  area  are  parallel  to  and  perpendicular  to  the  flow  direction.    Since 
volume  of  sediment  is  neither  created  nor  destroyed  on  the  short  time  scales 
associated  with  sediment  transport  by  traction  or  suspension,  we  can  invoke  the 
principle  of  conservation  of  sediment  volume  in  accounting  for  what  happens  to 
the sediment.

4.2.4.3    If  the  total  volume  of  sediment  in  traction  and  suspension  passing 
across the plane extending upward from the upstream edge of the reference area is 
less  than  the  total  volume  of  sediment  passing  across  the  plane  extending  upward 
from  the  downstream  edge  of  the  reference  area  (Figure  2-68A),  then  sediment  is 
somehow being added to the flow in the space above the reference area.  The only 
place  where  that  added  sediment  can  come  from  is  from  the  bed,  and  the  only 
place where it can go is into the flow.  So there must be net erosion of the bed.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 101

 

 

 

 

    

      4.2.4.4   On  the other hand,  if  the  total volume of sediment  in  traction and sus-
pension passing across the upstream plane is greater than the total volume passing 
across  the  downstream  plane  (Figure  2-68B),  then  sediment  is  somehow  being 
extracted  from  the  flow  in  the  space  over  the  reference  area.    The  only  place 
where  that  extracted  sediment  can  go  is  onto  the  bed,  so  there  has  to  be  net 
deposition  on  the  bed.      This  mode  of  deposition  might  be  called  deposition  by 
differential transport (Figure 2-66C).    
         4.2.4.5   The  consequence  of  the  reasoning  presented  above  is  that  there  can 
be  deposition  on  a  sediment  bed  without  any  temporal  change  in  the  picture  of 
sediment  transport:    the  flow  is  steady,  and  the  load  and  the  sediment  transport 
rate  at  every point does not  change with  time.   There  can be deposition, however, 
provided that the sediment transport rate is changing spatially by decreasing in the 
downstream direction. 
4.2.4.6   Deposition by differential  transport can  take place entirely by down-
stream  decrease  in  bed-load  transport  rate,  even  without  any  suspended  sediment 
in  the  flow.    This  happens wherever  the  flow  deepens  slightly  in  the  downstream 
direction  (for  any  one  or  more  of  several  reasons,  which  we  won't  discuss  here), 
causing the flow velocity and therefore also the bed-load sediment transport rate to 
decrease in the downstream direction. 
4.2.4.7   Flows  that deposit  sediment by differential  transport  range widely  in 
flow velocity, from a few tenths of a meter per second to well over two meters per 
second.    Sediment  size  ranges  from  finer  than  sand  size  to  well  into  the  gravel 
size.    Clearly,  the  coarser  the  sediment  the  more  likely  it  is  that  the  process 
involves  differential  bed-load  transport  rather  than  differential  suspended-load 
transport. 

 

4  .2.5  Mass Deposition 
4.2.5.1   When  the  region  of  the  flow  near  the  bed  is  overloaded with  a  high 
concentration  of  suspended  sediment,  the  sediment  settles  to  the  bed  with  little 
space between adjacent sediment particles, and a layer of the flow with a thickness 
that's  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  the  particle  size  becomes  immobilized 
almost  simultaneously  as  the  shearing  of  the  highly  concentrated  sediment-water 
mixture  ceases  (Figure  2-66D).    Such  a mode  of  deposition might  be  called mass 
deposition. 
4.2.5.2   During mass deposition there's no well defined sediment-water inter-
face;  instead  there's  a gradual  transition between  the underlying already-deposited 
bed  and  the  sheared,  highly  concentrated  suspension  above.    Another  way  of 
looking  at  this  is  that  the  pore-water  content  of  the  mixture  varies  continuously 
upward  from  the  already-deposited  sediment  bed  into  the  still-moving  sediment-
water mixture.   
4.2.5.3    Conditions  during  mass  deposition  are  difficult  to  observe,  because 
the sediment concentrations are high and deposition is rapid.  Also, the flows from 
which mass deposition occurs tend to be more powerful and on much larger scales 
than  is  the  case  with  the  other  modes  of  deposition  discussed  above.    Mass 
deposition  is  characteristic  of  strong  sediment  gravity  flows,  especially  in  their 
earlier stages.

4.3  The Relationship between the Load and the Deposit 
 
4.3.1  This subsection makes some fundamental points about the relationship 
between  the  sediment  load  and  the  deposit  in  a  depositing  flow.    We  think  this 
material is fundamental to understanding the texture of a deposit, although it won't 
tell you anything really practical. 
 
4.3.2    Obviously,  whenever  a  deposit  is  being  formed  by  a  sediment-
transporting  flow,  some  percentage  of  the  sediment  load  is  being  extracted  from 
the  flow  and  added  to  the  bed,  by  one  or more  of  the  various  processes  discussed 
in  the  previous  section.    The  ratio  of  sediment  extraction  to  sediment  passage  or 
throughput  can  range  from  nearly  zero,  in  the  case  of  an  almost  uniform  flow 
carrying  fairly  high  concentrations  of  sediment  in  an  almost  nondepositional 
regime,  to  one  hundred  percent, when  a  flow dumps  all  its  sediment  in one place, 
like certain kinds of debris flows.   Just  for convenience, we'll unofficially call  this 
ratio  the  deposition  ratio.    (Don't  worry  about  how  this  ratio  could  be  defined 
quantitatively.)    Although you can't read the value of the deposition ratio directly 
from  beds  in  an  outcrop,  we  think  it's  one more  of  those  things  that  are  useful  to 
think about as an aid in framing your interpretations.     
 
4.3.3   This  section  deals with  the  relationship  between  the  characteristics  of 
the sediment  load and  the characteristics of the deposit left by the flow.   The sedi-
ment  load  always  has  some  joint  probability  distribution  of  particle  size,  particle 
shape,  and  particle  density  (Figure  2-69).    You  can  never  really  characterize  this 
distribution  fully,  even  when  you  can  obtain  a  good  representative  sample  of  the 
load, mainly because of the problem of the infinite variations in particle shape, but 
it's  nonetheless  real  and  important.   When  deposition  takes  place,  some  subset  of 
the  passing  particles  are  selected  from  the  flow  to  become  part  of  the  permanent 
deposit  left  behind  by  the  flow.    Here's  what  we  consider  to  be  the  most 
fundamental  question  of  sediment  deposition:    How  does  the  nature  of  the 
deposit  depend  upon  the  flow  and  the  nature  of  the  load?    If  sedimentologists 
are  ever going  to be  able  to make  interpretations  about depositional  conditions by 
examining  the  texture  of  the  deposit,  they  are  going  to  have  to  answer  this 
question first.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 103

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
      4.3.4    There's  more  to  the  selection  process  than  might  seem  to  you  at  first 
thought.    First  we'd  like  to  divide  the  sediment  bed  into  two  depth  zones  (Figure 
2-70).   The uppermost  zone,  extending  some distance down  from  the bed  surface, 
is called the active layer.  The sediment in the active layer is subjected to repeated 
reentrainment by the flow as the bed elevation at any given point rises and falls as 
a  result  of  local  erosion  and  deposition  that's  superimposed  on  the  long-term  net 
deposition.  A good example of such temporary changes in bed elevation are those 
associated with  the passage of bed  forms.   All  the sediment within  the active  layer 
will  be  recycled  by  the  flow  at  least  once  by  the  flow  before  it's  permanently 
buried.    Below  the  active  layer  is  the  permanent  deposit.    The  sediment  in  the 
permanent deposit  is  below  the  reach of  the  local  erosional processes of  the  flow, 
and  it  will  never  again  be  entrained  by  the  flow  (unless  the  overall  depositional 
regime changes into an overall erosional regime at some later time). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 104

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3.5   The  thickness of  the active  layer may range from  just one or  two grain 
diameters,  on  an  approximately  planar  bed  undergoing  aggradation,  to  many 
meters,  when  the  bed  is  covered  with  very  large  bed  forms  that  deposit  and 
reerode sediment as they move downstream. 
4.3.6  When viewed in terms of the active layer, deposition therefore involves 
the  burial  of  certain  particles  deeply  enough  within  the  active  layer  so  that  they 
are no longer moved by the flow again, so that they become part of the permanent 
deposit. 
4.3.7  Since only a subset of the particles of the load end up becoming part of 
the  permanent  deposit,  there's  the  possibility  of  fractionation  of  the  various  size, 
shape,  and  density  fractions  between  the  load  and  the  deposit.    Obviously,  such 
fractionation can take place only if there's some range of sizes, shapes, or densities 
in  the  load  in  the  first  place.    But  all  natural  sediments  show  at  least  some  varia-
tion in size and shape. 
4.3.8    Here's  an  important  question  for  you.    Think  about  the  ratio  between 
the mean  size  of  the  load  and  the mean  size  of  the  deposit.    As  the  flow  strength 
increases,  does  this  ratio  increase  or  decrease?    In  other  words,  if  other  factors 
remain  the  same,  does  the  deposit  become  coarser  or  finer  as  the  flow 
strength  increases?    We  expect  to  fool  you  with  this  question!    We  fooled 
ourselves  recently  when  we  did  a  laboratory  research  project  on  deposition  from 
strong  flows  carrying  coarse  and  poorly  sorted  sediments.    One's  first  reaction  is 
that the stronger the flow, the coarser the deposit.  But just the opposite is true!   
4.3.9    In  the  strongest  flows,  with  high  concentrations  of  sediment  traveling 
both  as  bed  load  and  suspended  load,  the  coarser  particles  less  commonly  find 
permanent resting places on the bed, so the deposit is much finer than the load.  In 
weaker  flows,  on  the  other  hand,  under  conditions  not  far  above  the  threshold  for 
particle  transport,  the mean  size  of  the  deposit  is  about  the  same  as  the mean  size 
of the load.  Here's yet another example of how deduction or intuition can mislead 
you when it comes to the dynamics of sediment transport by turbulent flows.   
4.3.10    We  think  it's  premature  for  us  to  try  to  draw  useful  conclusions  for 
you  about  the  relationship  between  the  load,  the  flow,  and  the  deposit.    But  we

want  you  to  be  aware  of  the  importance  of  such  knowledge.    As  more  work  is 
done  on  deposition  of  mixed-size  sediment,  there's  a  good  chance  of  obtaining 
some results that will be really useful in paleoflow interpretations.
