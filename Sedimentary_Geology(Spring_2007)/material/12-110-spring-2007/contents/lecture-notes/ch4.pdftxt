1.  SANDSTONES 
 
1.1  Introduction 
 
1.1.1    Sandstones  are  an  important  group  of  sedimentary  rocks.    I  suppose  a 
good  estimate  of  the  percentage  of  sedimentary  rocks  that  would  be  classified  as 
sandstones is about 25%.   
1.1.2   Defining what's meant  by  the  term  sandstone  turns  out  not  to  be  easy.  
Recall  from  Chapter  1  that  all  sedimentary  particles  between  1/16 mm  and  2 mm 
should  be  called  sand,  regardless  of  composition.      But  terminology  for  a  sand 
deposit,  as  distinct  from  sand  grain  size,  is  more  difficult.      For  a  deposit  to  be 
called  a  sand,  "most"  of  the  particles  must  be  in  the  sand  size  range.    But  how 
much  is  "most"?    How  much  finer  and/or  coarser  material  can  there  be  in  a  sand 
deposit?    Various  attempts  have  been  made  to  erect  terminology  for  mixtures  of 
sand and finer/coarser sediment, with quantitative boundaries.  There's no standard 
classification, but nobody seems  to worry much about that.   Figure 4-1 shows two 
ways  of  dealing  with  mixtures  of  sand  and  mud,  one  "rational",    seemingly 
composed with  logicality  and  symmetry  in mind,  and  the  other  reflecting marine-
geological  practice.    And    4-2  shows  two  ways  of  dealing  with  mixtures  of  sand 
and gravel, the first idealized and symmetrical, and the other reflecting field usage.  
The same difficulties in distinguishing between a sandstone and a conglomerate, at 
the one end, and between a sandstone and a siltstone, on the other end, are similar.  
If  the  rock  has  a  lot  of  silt  in  it  as  well  as  sand,  you  can  call  it  a  silty  sandstone, 
and  if  it  has  a  lot  of  gravel  in  it  was  well  as  sand,  you  can  call  it  a  gravelly  (or 
pebbly)  sandstone  or  a  conglomeratic  sandstone.   But  note  this:    the  rock  doesn't 
have  to have much gravel  in  it, perhaps 10-20%, or even  less  in  the view of  some 
people,  before  it  starts  to  get  called  a  conglomerate,  because  of  the  prominence 
and  (presumably)  significance  of  that  small  percentage  of  gravel.    But,  with  all 
that  said,  this  whole  matter  isn't  something  you  have  to  worry  much  about  when 
you're in the field actually working with sandstones.

1.1.3   Sands  (sand  deposits)  can  be   of  any  composition:    siliciclastic,  car-
bonate, or even evaporitic, in the case of wind-blown or water-transported gypsum 
particles  on  playa  surfaces  in  deserts.    But  once  the  deposit  is  lithified  enough  to 
be called a  sandstone  (and you should  realize  that  the boundary between sand and 
sandstone  is  broadly  transitional  and  not  conventionally  established  in  any  way), 
the  term  sandstone  is  applied  only  to  siliciclastic  rocks,  not  to  carbonates;  in  the 
case of clastic carbonate rocks whose particles are of sand size, the term limestone 
takes precedence over the term sandstone.   
1.1.4  Miscellaneous comments about sandstones: 
 
θ    Sandstones  show  an  extremely  wide  range  of  framework  composition, 
from all quartz to not much quartz and lots of feldspar and/or rock fragments. 
θ   Sandstones also show an extremely wide range of textures, from very well 
sorted and well rounded to very poorly sorted and subangular. 
θ   Sorting  and  rounding  of  the  framework  grains  tend  to  vary  together,  but 
there are important exceptions. 
θ   Framework  composition  and  framework  texture  are  strongly  correlated :  
sandstones  with  varied  framework  composition  tend  to  have  poorly  sorted  and 
poorly  rounded  framework  grains,  and  sandstones  with  all-quartz  framework 
composition  tend  to  have  well  sorted  and  well  rounded  framework  grains—but 
again there are important exceptions.

θ   Sedimentary  structures  in  sandstones,  both  primary  and  secondary,  are 
common,  prominent,  and  extremely  useful  in  interpreting  depositional  environ-
ments—more so than in other rocks.   

 
1.2  How Do You Know It's a Sandstone? 
 
1.2.1    Seems  like  a  silly  question,  I  suppose.    Usually  the  situation  is  clear, 
but  the  question  is  sometimes  not  a  trivial  one when  you're  on  the  outcrop.     And 
it's  especially  acute  when  someone  hands  you  a  little  out-of-context  hand  speci-
men  and  you  have  to  perform.    I  don't  want  to  be  too  cookbookish,  but  here  are 
some considerations: 
 
θ   Look  for  detrital  grains  of  sand  size .    Even  in  the  finest  sandstones, 
mineral  oil  and  a  hand  lens  usually  do  a  good  job.    If  the  sandstone  is  fairly  fine 
and  very matrix-rich,  this may  be  difficult  or  impossible,  especially  if  the  rock  is 
on its way toward metamorphism.   
θ  Be cautious about calling it a limestone just because it fizzes in acid.  That 
may well be carbonate cement or a small percentage of carbonate grains or  fossils 
in a true sandstone.   
θ   In  really  difficult  situations,  ov erall  bedding  may  suggest  a  sandstone 
rather  than  some other kind of  rock—but you may  still be dealing with a volcanic 
igneous rock. 
  
1.2.2    Here's  an  annotated  list  of  other  rock  types  with  which  you  might 
confuse sandstone on occasion: 
 
θ   volcanics :    in  the  case  of  felsic  volcanics,  there's  a  true  gradation  in  the 
first  place  (see  later  section  on  volcaniclastic  rocks),  and  many  felsic  volcanics 
look  superficially  like  certain  "ordinary"  sandstones.    In  the  case  of  mafic  vol-
canics, some dark graywackes look a lot like basalts/andesites. 
θ   limestones :    aside  from  the  fact  that  there  are  truly  intermediate  cases,  in 
which  some  of  the  framework  is  carbonate  and  some  is  siliciclastic,  certain  dark 
unfossiliferous  limestones  look  superficially  like  sandstones.    But  if  you  use  the 
right techniques you shouldn't have much trouble with this. 
θ   granites :    in  some  cases,  coarse  well  cemented  feldspar-rich  sandstones 
can  look  a  lot  like  granites  (from  which  they  probably  were  derived  in  the  first 
place).   Careful examination of texture, and a chance to see bedding, usually takes 
care of this confusion. 
θ   low-grade  metamorphics:    here  the  problem  is  one  of  judgment  about 
where to draw the line.  If you want to claim it as a sandstone, go ahead. 
    
1.2.3        Here's  a  list  of  the  properties  of  a  sandstone  you  could  measure  or 
describe. 
 
"fundamental": 
 
"component"  composition  (minerals,  rock  fragments,  fossils,  organic  mat-
ter) 
texture (grain size grain shape, grain arrangement) 
sedimentary structures 

 94

 

 

 

 

   

 
"derived": 
 
chemical composition 
bulk density 
color 
strength (tensile, compressive, shear) 
porosity 
permeability 
elastic wave velocity 
electrical properties 
heat capacity 
thermal conductivity 
etc. 
 
1.2.4    In  addition  to  these,  there  are  a  number  of  other  important  things  you 
can describe that don't fit neatly into the above list: 
 
friability (degree of induration or lithification) 
parting characteristics 
development of rock cleavage 
weathering characteristics 
ledge/cliff-forming tendency 
1.3  Constituents of Sandstones (Partly Review) 
 
framework grains: 
quartz (usually dominant) 
feldspar (Kspar >> plag; usually partly altered; microcline >  orthoclase) 
rock fragments (chert/quartzite act like quartz; others nonresistant) 
heavy minerals (varied; most of minerals; seldom abundant) 
micas (common, never high %; muscovite >> biotite) 
clastic carbonates (mixtures less common than ends) 
glauconite (local, sometimes abundant in quartz-rich ss) 
 
void filler: 
quartz (as secondary overgrowths) 
quartz (as recrystallized amorphous silica) 
chert (amorphous silica) 
calcite (dolomite less common) 
hematite (primary? secondary?) 
exotica (anhydrite, gypsum, barite, halite, siderite, etc.) 
matrix (fine material, not authigenic): 
fine detrital nonphyllosilicates (quartz, feldspar, carbonates) 
fine  detrital  phyllosilicates  (starts  as  clay-mineral  mud,  gets  recrystallized  to 
"sericite", "white mica", chlorite) 
reorganized phyllosilicate-rich coarse rock fragments

1.4  Classification 
 
1.4.1    A  lot  of  effort  has  gone  into  devising  rational  classifications  of  sand-
stones—more  than  for  other  sedimentary  rocks.    Everyone  agrees  that  classifica-
tions  are  important  and  useful,  not  only  for  communication  but  also  for  organi-
zation of thought; a good classification can help reveal underlying regularities that 
need to be explained.   
1.4.2   There  are many  different  kinds  of  classification.   Usually  a distinction 
is  made  between  a  genetic  classification  and  a  descriptive  classification.    In 
classifying rocks, there's general agreement that the best classification is one that's 
descriptive  but  with  a  genetic  basis;  such  a  classification  has  the  advantage  of 
being objective but at the same time oriented toward the genesis of the rock.  (The 
trouble with classifying a sandstone as eolian, say, is that your interpretation of the 
depositional environment is built in, and you may be wrong.) 
1.4.3    Here  are  some  of  the  important  genetically  based  defining  parameters 
that could be used: 
 
provenance 
mineralogical maturity 
textural maturity 
depositional environment 
diagenesis 
 
Almost without exception, classifications have made use of the first three of these. 
1.4.4    A  large  number  of  classifications  have  been  formally  proposed,  in 
print.    All  but  a  handful  of  these  have  seen  little  use.    Most  are  of  no  more  than 
historical  interest  at  this  point.    Probably  the most widely  used  classification  now 
is  that  of  Pettijohn,  Potter,  and  Siever.    It's  shown  as  Figure  4-3,  in  a  three-di-
mensional sketch.

1.4.5    The  main  idea  behind  the  classification  is  that  there  are  two  broad 
textural  kinds  of  sandstones—those,  called  arenites,  without  appreciable  fine 
matrix  along  with  the  framework  grains,  and  those,  called  wackes,  with  appre-
ciable  fine  matrix  along  with  the  framework  grains.    Within  each  of  these  sand-
stone  classes,  names  are  assigned  on  the  basis  of  the  percentages  of  three  major 
framework constituents:  quartz, feldspar, and rock fragments.       
1.4.6  I should emphasize that this the classification in Figure 4-3 can be used 
only  to  a  limited  extent  in  the  field.    It's  designed  for  thin-section  work.    It'll  be 
useful  to  you  in  the  field  only  if  the  sandstone  is  fairly  coarse.    If  you  find  you 
can't apply it in the field, don't worry.   
1.4.7    Sandstone  petrologists  play  lots  of  games  beyond  just  this  classifica-
tion.  They love to make triangular composition diagrams.  To do this, you have to 
make  careful  and  tedious  point  counts  in  thin  section.    Figure  4-4  shows  some 
examples.

1.5  Kinds of Sandstones 
 
1.5.1    Even  aside  from  rational  pigeonhole  classifications  like  the  one  pre-
sented  above,  most  people  would  agree,  at  least  in  a  general  way,  that  there  are 
"kinds"  or  fairly  natural  groupings  of  sandstones,  albeit  with  very  broad  and 
blurred  boundaries  among  them.    Thinking  about  sandstones  like  this  is  often 
useful  in  making  broad  interpretations  of  geological  setting,  but  it  can  be  mis-
leading.  So I want you to be cautious about what I'm going to say next. 
 

quartz arenites: 
Almost  all  quartz  plus  a  little  chert  and  resistant  heavies  in  the  framework; 
silica or carbonate cement; no matrix; very well sorted and rounded;  lightest color 
of  sandstones; planar  lamination or  large-scale cross-lamination;  section  thickness 
low;  thin,  widespread,  patchy  blankets;  associated  with  limestone  and  shale; 
usually marine, craton to miogeocline. 

 

feldspathic sandstones: 
Quartz  variable  but  feldspar  abundant  in  the  framework, mostly  Kspar,  rock 
fragments subordinate, coarse detrital mica common; silica and secondary feldspar 
cement  common;  some  matrix  but  not  a  lot,  mostly  kaolinite;  coarsest  of 
sandstones;  tends  to  be  reddish;  large-scale  cross-stratification  common;  section 
thin  to  thick;  blankets  like  quartz  arenite,  or  thick  wedges  and  prisms;  associated 
with  either  quartz  arenite  or  red  shale,  conglomerate,  volcanics;  craton  to  mio-
geocline (marine), or fault-block basins (nonmarine). 
 

lithic sandstones: 
Quartz abundant,  rock  fragments second,  feldspar variable but  third; variable 
amount  and  composition  of  matrix;  silica  or  carbonate  cement;  color  variable, 
often  salt-and-peppery;  fine-medium  sand  size  common;  cross-stratification 
prominent;  section  thickness  middling;  tabular,  lenticular,  shoestring  shapes;  as-
sociated with  shale, conglomerate, not much  limestone;  fluvial or shallow marine; 
miogeoclinal and post-tectonic basins. 

 

graywackes: 
Quartz  variable,  often  less  than  75%,  feldspar  and  rock  fragments  variable; 
matrix  prominent;  usually  poor  sorting  and  rounding;  color  gray,  darkest  of  sand-
stones;    pelagic  marine  fossils;  graded  bedding,  sole  marks,  small-scale  cross-
stratification;  section  thickness  large;  thick  lenticular  shapes;  associated  with 
shale,  bedded  chert,  submarine  volcanics;  deeper marine  trough  fillings  in mobile 
belts (eugeoclinal).

2.  CONGLOMERATES 
2.1  Introduction 
 
2.1.1    Conglomerates  are  far  less  abundant  in  the  sedimentary  record  than 
sandstones.    But  they're  important  far  beyond  their  abundance.   Why?    For  three 
reasons: 
   
θ    Because  of  what  they  tell  us  about  depositional  environment:    if  you  can 
be sure  that  the gravel was actually  transported (rather  than being  just  the  in-place 
residuum of weathering) then the presence of gravel-size material indicates strong 
currents.    That's  one  of  the  firmest  interpretations  you  can  make  in  sedimentary 
petrology.   
θ  Because of what they tell us about provenance:  to get gravel-size material 
coming  out  of  the  source  area,  there  must  have  been  high  relief,  and  therefore 
strong  uplift.    So  the  presence  of  gravels  in  the  sedimentary  record  is  a  good 
indication  of  tectonism  in  the  source  area.   Here's  another  one  of  those  important 
first-order interpretations that are generally accepted to be fairly reliable.   
θ    Because  conglomerates  present  a  record  of  the  rock  types  present  in  the 
source  area.    It's  sort  of  like  having  little  source-area  outcrops  delivered  to  your 
door.    There's  still  the  problem  of  representativeness  (some  rock  types  are  less 
likely  to  produce  gravel-size  debris  than  others),  but  the  problem  is  not  nearly  as 
severe as for sandstones. 
 
2.1.2    With  regard  to  the  first  point,  the  physical  mechanisms  involved  in 
deposition  of  gravels  are  not  well  understood,  so  detailed  interpretations  of  de-
positional  mechanisms  based  on  study  of  conglomerates  is  much  less  advanced 
than for sandstones. 

 
2.2  Terminology 
 
2.2.1   A  rock  containing  as  little   as  10-20%  gravel-size  clasts  is  usually 
called  a  conglomerate,  although  actually  it  should  be  called  a  conglomeratic 
sandstone or even a conglomeratic mudstone; see the chapter on sandstones. 
2.2.2   Technically,  terminology differs depending on clast  roundness  (Figure 
4-5).   A conglomerate with angular clasts  is called a breccia  (watch out;  there are 
lots  of  other  kinds  of  breccias  besides  sedimentary  breccias),  and  the  unconsoli-
dated equivalent is called rubble.  Breccia is also called sharpstone conglomerate, 
in  contrast  to  roundstone  conglomerate.    But  this  is  not  a  big  deal,  because 
sedimentary  breccias  are  a  lot  less  common  than  conglomerates.    Also  keep  in 
mind  that breccia  is a more general  term for fragmental rock consisting of angular 
fragments.    There  are  many  kinds  of  breccia,  depending  upon  how  the 
fragmentation developed:

2.3  Descriptive Stuff 
 
Figure  4-6  shows  an  unofficial  list  of  size-distribution  types  in 
conglomerates  you're  likely  to  see.    Remember  that  there  are 
three  different  grain-size  components  (gravel,  sand,  mud), 
presumably  with  different  hydrodynamic  significance.    (Never 
mind  that  these  are  to  a  great  extent  arbitrary  categories.)    The 
things  you  have  to  worry  about  are  sorting,  number  of  modes, 
and clast support vs. matrix support.

2.3.2  I think the three most common textural categories are: 
 
bimodal clast-supported with sand matrix 
bimodal  matrix-supported with sand matrix 
unimodal poorly sorted (with abundant mud ) 
 
2.3.3   In  terms of  fabric,  think about  tendencies  toward preferred orientation 
of  crudely  triaxial-ellipsoid gravel  clasts.   Here are  the commonest  fabric  types  (a 
axis is longest, c axis is shortest, b axis is intermediate): 
 
a axis flow-parallel, ab plane imbricated 
a axis flow-transverse, ab plane imbricated 
a axis unordered, ab plane horizontal 
no strong preferred orientation 
 
2.3.4    In  terms  of  stratification,  keep  in mind  that  conglomerates  tend  to  be 
less  well  stratified  than  other  kinds  of  sedimentary  rocks.    Conglomerates  can 
show  planar  stratification  or  cross-stratification,  or  they  can  be  unstratified 
(Figure  4-7).    Planar  stratification  in  conglomerates  tends  to  be  crude,  and  often 
indistinct.  Cross-stratification in conglomerates is always on a fairly large scale (a 
few  tens  of  centimeters  normal  to  overall  stratification),  and  it's  not  nearly  as 
common  as  in  sandstones.    It's  much  more  common  for  conglomerates  to  be  un-
stratified than for sandstones.

2.4  Where Are Modern Gravels? 
 
rivers:    especially  high-gradient  rivers  draining  mountainous  areas;  usually  but 
not  always  braided;  grade  over  into  sand-bed  rivers  with  only  a  small  percentage 
of  gravel  in  the  system.    Typically  gravel  plus  sand,  bimodal,  with  sand  the  sec-
ondary mode; fairly well sorted but not nearly as well as beach gravels. 
alluvial  fans:    just  another  kind  of  braided-stream  environment,  but  the  geo-
graphic  setting  and  the  geometry  of  the  depositional  body  are  different.    In  addi-
tion  to  the  stream  gravels  (fanglomerates)  there  are  debris-flow  deposits  on many 
fans.    Debris-flow  deposits  are  very  poorly  sorted  mixtures  of  gravel,  sand,  and 
mud.  
talus slopes:  local, not very important 
beaches:  high-wave-energy  coasts,  supply  of  coarse  clasts  from  marine  abra-
sion/shore  erosion  or  fluvial  source.    Typically  well  sorted,  well  rounded,  uni-
modal 
glaciers:    tills,  deposited  directly  from  moving  ice,  and    glaciofluvial  deposits, 
from  meltwater.    Tills  are  very  poorly  sorted  mixtures  of  gravel,  sand,  and  mud, 
hard  to  tell  from  debris-flow  deposits;  glaciofluvial  gravels  are  largely  the  same 
texturally as nonglacial fluvial gravels. 
deep  ocean:    both  tractional  deposits,  not  greatly  different  from  fluvial  gravels, 
and  sediment-gravity-flow  deposits,  not  greatly  different  from  subaerial  debris-
flow  deposits.    We  don't  have  a  good  understanding  of  either  of  these  kinds  of 
gravels,  because  we  don't  know  where  and  when  to  look.    Also  glaciomarine  de-
posits with dropstones. 

 
2.5  Gravels vs. Sands 
 
2.5.1   Gravels  and  sands  have  a  lot  in  common .    We  think  of  them  in  the 
same  way  and  in  terms  of  both  texture  and  significance  (provenance,  transport, 
deposition).   Both  are washed  and  physically  transported  residues  of  rock weath-
ering.  But there are some characteristic differences: 
 
Composition:    gravels    are  dominantly  rock  fragments,  sands  are  dominantly 
mineral grains 
Size  distribution:    the  most  common  gravels  are  bimodal,  the  most  common 
sands are unimodal. 
Rounding:    gravels  have  better  rounded  clasts,  because  gravel  clasts  wear  down 
faster than sand clasts 
Size  trends:    in most  transport  systems, gravels  show much  stronger downcurrent 
size decrease than sands  
Stratification:    sands  commonly  show  cross-bedding  and/or well  developed  even 
bedding;  gravels  seldom  show  cross-bedding,  and  are  much  less  commonly 
well bedded than sands. 
Abundance:  gravels are much less abundant than sands 
Extent:  gravels are more restricted in areal extent than sands

2.6  Classification 
 
2.6.1   Table  4-1  shows  a  classification  of  conglomerates.   Keep  in mind  that 
 
 
 
extraformational  epiclastic  conglomerates    are  by  far  the  most  abundant  deposits 
in Table 4-1.  Here are some comments on them.

Table 4-1: Classification of conglomerates 

 
oligomict orthoconglomerates:    simple composition.   The only pebbles are  those 
with  very  resistant  lithologies  (mainly  vein  quartz,  chert,  quartzite).    Residuum 
derived  from destruction of a much  larger volume of  rock  (all  the  rest went some-
where as sand or mud or dissolved material).  Very common in the geologic record 
but not volumetrically abundant.  Thin discontinuous beds and stringers and lenses 
at  the  base  of  a  sedimentary  section  (basal  conglomerate)  and  at  various  points 
within  a  sequence.    The  rest  of  the  section  is  typically  sands,  often  pebbly  and 
cross-stratified.  Environments: fluvial, beach. 
petromict  orthoconglomerates:    Most  of  the  great  conglomerates  of  the  past.  
Tend  to  be  thick  wedge-shaped  basin-margin  accumulations  shed  from  high-ele-
vation, high-relief areas, tectonically rising.  Usually form a substantial percentage 
of  the  section.    Conglomerate  equivalents  of  arkosic  and  lithic  sandstones.   Main 
constituents  are  potentially  unstable  rock  fragments,  usually  several  kinds.    Tend 
to  be  coarse  and  thick.    Clast  rounding  fair  to  good  (but  remember  that  it  takes 
only  kilometers  to  tens  of  kilometers  for  good  clast  rounding).    Largely  alluvial-
fan  or  fluvial  (meandering  or  braided).    Some  are  deep-water  conglomerates, 
apparently deposited in channels by sediment gravity flows, analogous to turbidite 
sandstones. 
paraconglomerates  (also  called  diamictites):  Larger  clasts  "float"  in  a  poorly 
sorted matrix  of mud  plus  sand  plus  finer  gravel.   Almost  always unstratified,  ex-
cept  for  glaciomarine  deposits.    Important  kinds  genetically:    glacial,  nonglacial.  
Nonglacial  paraconglomerates  are  often  difficult  to  tell  from  tillite:    typically  un-
stratified, ungraded, very poorly  sorted,  subangular-subrounded  clasts. Most  seem 
to  be  sediment-gravity-flow  deposits  (high-concentration,  slurrylike  mixture  of 
sediment and water, flowing under influence of gravity,  on land and under water).  
These  are  the  least well  understood  of  conglomerates.    The marine  kinds  are  typ-
ically associated with marine sandstone and shale. 
2.6.2    Intraformational  conglomerates  are  common  too,  but  never  very  vo-
luminous.  Intraformational  conglomerates  are  formed  by  fragmentation  and  re-
deposition  of  sedimentary  material  only  shortly  after  deposition  (at  least  geologi-
cally  shortly,  if  not  in  terms  of  human  time  scales), while  the  sediment  is  unlithi-
fied  or  only  partly  lithified.    Minor  episodes  of  stronger  current,  possibly  also 
uplift to subaerial situation.  Debris very local, little or no transportation.  You can 
see  all gradations between unimportant  ripping up  in place  to  total dispersal.   The 
two  commonest  types  are:  Clasts  of  shale  in  sandstone;  clasts  of  fine-grained 
carbonate rock in coarse-grained carbonate rock.

3.  SHALES 
3.1  Introduction 
 
3.1.1   This  section  really  should  be  entitled  fine-grained detrital  rocks;  see 
the  section  on  terminology  below.    Here  we're  dealing  with  everything  from 
freshly deposited muds to phyllites, and grain sizes from silts to the finest clays. 
3.1.2  Shales are the most abundant of sedimentary rocks, 40-70% by various 
estimates.  And you can easily see why, by considering the products of weathering 
of  source  rocks:    clay minerals  and  fine-grained  quartz  form  a  very  high  percent-
age of everything. 
3.1.3   Shales  tend  not  to  be  as  well  expos ed  as  sandstones,  limestones,  and 
conglomerates,  because  they're  softer  and  more  easily  weatherable.    And  they're 
much  harder  to  study,  because  they're  fine-grained  and  complex  in  composition.  
Only  the coarser  fraction can be  studied easily under  the microscope; methods  for 
studying the finer fractions of shales are highly imperfect. 
 
3.2  Kinds of Fine-Grained Deposits 
 
3.2.1  Basically there are two kinds of fine detrital deposits: 
residual mud:   Deeply weathered  parent  rock  is  transformed  to  largely  clay-min-
eral  and  clay-size  material,  still  in  place.    It's  essentially  a  soil.    Sometimes  you 
can  still  see  relict  textures,  structures,  and  mineralogy  of  the  parent  rock.    This 
stuff  grades  downward  into  fresher  parent  rock.    By  its  very  nature,  there's  not 
much of  it  in  the geologic record (it forms a paleosol, an ancient soil preserved in 
the  sedimentary  record),  but  when  seen,  it's  very  important  for  interpretation.  
When it's rich in aluminum hydroxide minerals, it's called bauxite, and is the main 
ore of aluminum. 
transported  mud:    Fine  detritus  is  eroded  from  source  areas  and  transported, 
mainly  by  water  but  also  by  wind  and  ice,  to  sites  of  deposition,  mainly  in  the 
oceans but also in lakes and rivers.  This is by far the more abundant kind. 
 
3.3  Terminology 
 
3.3.1    Terminology  for  fine-grained  detrital  deposits  and  rocks  is  not  well 
standardized.  Here are several terms you should be aware of: 
clay:  A tricky word.  It's used in three senses:  size, composition, and material.  In 
the  size  sense,  it's  used  for  all  sedimentary  material  finer  than  1/256  mm.    In 
the compositional sense, it's used for clay minerals, a large and varied group of 
minerals, mostly  sheet  silicates,  that are  found  in abundance  in  fine  sediments.  
In the material sense, it's used for the sticky gooey material potters use. 
silt:  sedimentary material 1/256 - 1/16 mm 
mud:    silt  plus  clay  in  approximately  equal  proportions,  or  in  unspecified  pro-
portions. 
shale:  this common term has been used in two different ways: 
   
θ    for  all  detrital  rocks  finer  than  sandstones  (so  that  it's  as  broad  a  term  as 
sandstone, conglomerate, or limestone), and  

 105

 

 

 

 

   

 

θ    for  fine-grained  detrital  rocks  that  show  prominent  fissility  and/or  cleav-
age. 
I'm partial to the first usage myself, and I think it's the majority usage. 
Mudstone (mudrock):  this term has had three usages: 
   
θ    for  all  fine-grained  detrital  rocks,  as  a  synonym  of  shale  in  the  first  sense 
above;  
θ    for  all  fine  detrital  rocks  whose  proportions  of  silt-size  material  and  clay-
size material is not known or cannot be known; and  
θ  for an indurated mud that is like shale (in the second sense above) but lacks 
fissility.  
  
I  suppose  I  practice  the  second  usage.    I'm  not  sure what  the majority  opinion 
is.  
siltstone:    a  mudstone  or  shale  (same  messiness  as  above)  in  which  silt-size  ma-
terial predominates over clay-size material. 
claystone:    a  mudstone  or  shale  (same  messiness  as  above)  in  which  clay-size 
material predominates over silt-size material. 
argillite:    a  fine-grained  detrital  rock  more  indurated  than  mudstone  or  shale  by 
incipient metamorphism and less fissile than most mudstone and shale. 
slate:    a  fine-grained  low-grade metamorphic  rock with  prominent  cleavage;  usu-
ally derived from shale. 
 
3.3.2    For  the  latest  in  detailed  descriptive  classification  of  shales,  and  a 
review of earlier classifications, see the book by Potter, Maynard, and Pryor. 
 
3.4  Grain Size of Muds and Shales   
 
3.4.1    What  can  we  say  about  the  grain  size  of  fine  detrital  sediments  and 
sedimentary rocks?  Not very much.  This is one of the most troublesome problems 
of sedimentary petrology. 
   
muds:    The  usual  method  of  size  analysis  is  settling.    Problems:  (1)  shape  and 
density  of  particles  is  much  different  from  quartz  spheres;  (2)  aggregation  is 
common (even dominant)  in original deposition, so when you disaggregate  the 
sample for size analysis (that's the standard thing to do), your size analysis usu-
ally has little relevance to the original nature of the deposited particles. 
shales:   diagenesis has an  important effect on size distribution.   To  the extent  that 
you  can  see  mineral  grains  under  the  microscope,  you  can  estimate  their  size, 
but  how  do  you  know  the  extent  of  recrystallization  (even  aside  from  the 
problem of aggregation noted under muds above)? 
 
3.5  Typical Constituents of Shales 
 
clay minerals: dominant except  in  the coarser  siltstones.   About 60% on average, 
maybe even more.  Range from 40% to almost 100% typically. 

 106

 

 

 

 

   

quartz:    25%  on  average,  mainly  in  the  silt  fraction.    (Most  shales,  even  seem-
ingly very fine, have a substantial silt fraction.) 
feldspar:  also mainly in the silt sizes; more liable to be affected by diagenesis; 5-
10% typically. 
carbonates:    about  5%  on  average; mainly  calcite,  but  also  dolomite  and  siderite 
(the  last  being  authigenic).    Calcite  can  come  from  biogenic  material  or 
chemically precipitated fine material in the depositional environment; you can't 
tell unless you see fossil fragments. 
iron  oxides:  up  to  5%,  usually  hematite;    iron  is  in  the  form of oxides only when 
the environment is oxidizing; more later. 
iron sulfides:  pyrite is often abundant, if the environment was reducing. 
various other minerals:  lots of them, seldom very abundant. 
volcanic glass:  variable, minor. 
amorphous silica:  variable, usually minor, but abundant in the transition through 
siliceous shale to argillaceous chert. 
organic  material:    ubiquitous;  averages  1-2%,    but  sometimes  up  to  10-15%.  
(Important: most of the organic material in the world is in shales!) 
 
3.6  Kinds of Shales 
 
3.6.1   Here's  a very  unofficial   tabulation  of  "kinds"  of  shales  you're  likely  to 
run  into.    (I  don't  feel  bad  about  presenting  this  to  you,  because  there's  no  gen-
erally accepted classification of shales anyway.) 
  
"common" shales:  clay minerals plus quartz, plus some other minerals, about 1% 
organic  matter;  Fe  is  in  reduced  state,  not  abundant  (about  1-2%).    Usually 
some shade of gray, more or less fissile. 
red  shales:    dominant  fine-grained  part  of  red-bed  sequences.    Notably  unfossil-
iferous.    Most  likely  nonmarine:  occur  usually  in  what  seem  to  be  fluvial 
depositional systems (more later).  Red color is caused by very fine particles of 
hematite.  But not much richer in Fe than common shales: up to 4-5%. 
black  (carbonaceous)  shales:    notably  very  fissile  (often  "papery");  very  rich  in 
carbon  (10-15%);  also  in  FeS2,  usually  pyrite  in  fine-grained  disseminated 
form  (modern  carbonaceous muds  have  several  forms  of  FeS2  usually  lumped 
under the term hydrotroilite).  Often also high concentrations of trace elements: 
V,  U,  Ni,  Cu,  etc.    Deposited  under  anaerobic  conditions.    How  produced  is 
usually  unclear:  deep  marine  silled  basins,  restricted  circulation  of  bottom 
waters;  possibility  of  shallow  closed  lagoons  etc.  also;  Black  Sea muds  are  of 
this kind. 
siliceous shales:  grade over into bedded cherts; high percentage of amorphous sil-
ica.    Very  hard,  durable,  not  easily  weathered,  not  likely  to  be  very  fissile.  
Silica could be from volcanic ash falls or biogenic opaline silica. 
calcareous  shales:    most  shales  have  a  very  low  percentage  of  CaCO3,  but  some 
grade toward limestone (intermediate kinds are called calcareous shale through 
argillaceous  limestone);  rock  gets  less  fissile,  lighter  weathering,  fizzes, 
typically more fossiliferous.

3.7  Practical Things About Structures 
 
3.7.1    I'll  say  some  things  about  structures  in  shales  here,  because more  than 
in most other rocks  they're on a scale small enough to be seen and studied in hand 
specimen. 
3.7.2   Many  shales are  thinly  laminated,   on scales of  the order of a millime-
ter or less.  The laminae tend to be even and regular.  Some likely causes: 
grain size 
organic-matter content 
carbonate content 
 
Each  of  these,  especially  the  last  two,  result  in  alternating  lighter  and  darker 
laminae upon weathering. 
3.7.3    Variations  in  grain  size  might  result  from  slight  variations  in  supply 
from  settling  in  a  quiet-water  environment,  or  from  episodic  influx  of  slightly 
coarser  material  due  to  storms.  Seasonal  differences  in  supply  might  also  be  in-
voked.  Seldom can you really pin anything down. 
3.7.4   Fissility   is  the  tendency  for  shale  (or  any  other  sedimentary  rock,  for 
that matter) to split or part along bedding planes.  This is usually thought to result 
from greater or lesser concentrations of micaceous mineral grains lying parallel on 
bedding  planes.    But  many  shales  show  neither  lamination  nor  fissility,  bioturba-
tion  being  a  possible  reason.    (Bioturbation  is  the  process  of  disruption  of  the 
original depositional nature of a sediment by the life activities of the epifauna and 
infauna.)  Then again, many nonfissile shales are well laminated. 
3.7.5   Slaty  cleavage   (or  rock  cleavage,  or  just  plain  cleavage)  is  a  different 
kind  of  splitting  tendency,  developed  during  either  diagenesis  or  incipient 
metamorphism.    This  is  generally  thought  to  come  about  by  reorganization  and 
realignment  of micaceous mineral  grains  in  a  stress/deformation  field.   Often,  but 
not always, the cleavage is parallel to the axial planes of folds.  
 
3.8  Clay Mineralogy 

 
3  .8.1  General 
3.8.1.1    The clay  minerals   are  a  varied  group  of  silicate  minerals,  mostly 
phyllosilicates  (sheet  silicates),  that  tend  to  be  found  as  very  fine  particles,  of  the 
order  of  microns  to  small  fractions  of  a  micron,  in  fine  sediments.  There  are 
several  important  varieties,  none  of  which  is  dominant.    Their  proportions  vary 
depending  upon  source-rock  composition,  weathering  environment,  and  di-
agenesis.   
3.8.1.2  As you can imagine, clay minerals are not easy to study:  even in the 
coarser  size  range  it's  difficult  to  see  them  microscopically.    Standard  techniques 
for study include electron microscopy, which allows you to see the particle shapes 
beautifully,  and  x-ray  diffraction,  which  allows  you  to  identify  their  mineralogy, 
after  a  fashion.    Probe  techniques  have  been  developed  more  recently.    A 
complicating  factor  is  isomorphous  substitution  among  iron,  magnesium,  silicon, 

 108

 

   

and  aluminum  in  various  ion  sites  in most  of  the  clay minerals,  leading  to  a  great 
range of compositions. 
 
 
 
3.8.1.3   Clay mineralogy  is worth  a whole course  in  itself.   What  I'll do here 
is  just  give  you  a  cursory  account  of  the  most  important  clay  minerals  and  their 
occurrence.    
 
3  .8.2  Structure 
3.8.2.1  Two structural units are involved in clay-mineral structures: 
 
octahedral  sheets:    two  planes  of  closely  packed  oxygens  and  hydroxyls  with  a 
plane  of  Al,  Fe,  and/or  Mg  between.    The  Al,  Fe,  and/or  Mg  are  in  octahedral 
coordination with the O and OH; that is, each of the former is equidistant from six 
of  the  latter,  which  are  arranged  as  an  octahedron  around  the  former.    Figure  4-8 
shows  a  rough  sketch  of  the  arrangement.    Figure  4-9  is  a  more  detailed  view  of 
the  geometry,  perpendicular  to  the  sheet.    The  oxygen-to-oxygen  distance  is  2.94 
Å,  and  the  thickness  of  the  sheet  is  5.05  Å.    If  Al  is  in  the  octahedral  positions, 
only  two-thirds  of  the  positions  are  filled;  if  Mg  and/or  Fe  are  in  the  octahedral 
positions, all of the positions are filled.

tetrahedral  sheets,  in  which  silica  (SiO4)  tetrahedra  are  polymerized  by  sharing 
of  three  of  the  four  oxygens  to  form  a  sheet  structure  with  hexagonal  symmetry.  
Figure 4-10 shows  two diagrammatic representations.   The oxygen-to-oxygen dis-
tance is 2.55 Å, and the thickness of the sheet is 4.65 Å.

3.8.2.2   These  two  layers, or  sheetlike arrangements,  fit  together, one on  top 
of  the  other,  in  such  a  way  that  the  vertices  of  the  tetrahedra  in  the  tetrahedral 
sheet point  toward  the octahedral  sheet.   The unshared oxygens of  the  tetrahedral 
sheet  and  the  oxygens  of  the  octahedral  sheet  are  the  same;  they  are  shared  for 
double  duty.    The  hydroxyls  that  form  part  of  the  octahedral  arrangement  fit  into 
the hexagonal holes of the tetrahedral sheet. 
3.8.2.3    The  dimensions  of  the  two  sheets  are  almost  but  not  quite  right  for 
this  shared  arrangement.   There has  to be  some  strain  in  the  lattices  to make  them 
go  together  to  share  oxygens.    This  seems  to  be  accommodated  by  alternate 
cocking  of  the  tetrahedra,  to  contract  the  tetrahedral  sheet  a  little,  and  stretching 
and  thinning  of  the  octahedral  sheet  to make  it  a  little  bigger.    I'll  schematize  this 
two-layer structure as shown in Figure 4-11.

3.8.2.4    It's  also  possible  to  construct  a  three-layer  arrangement  in  which  a 
tetrahedral layer is sandwiched between two tetrahedral layers.  Figure 4-12 shows 
 
 
 
the highly schematic way I'll represent this three-layer structure.

3.8.3  Classification 
 
3.8.3.1    The  structural  classification  of  sheet-silicate  clay  minerals  is  based 
on the octahedral-tetrahedral layer structure outlined above. 
 

Figure by MIT OCW. 

K  aolinite 
Kaolinite  is  the  main  two-layer  mineral.    It's  fairly  simple  chemically:  
Al4(Si4O10)(OH)8,  with  no  isomorphous  substitutions;  it's  the  purest  of  the  clay 
minerals.   
Only  two-thirds of  the octahedral positions are filled, by aluminum; minerals 
like  that  are  called  dioctahedral.    A  consequence  of  this  partial  emptiness  is  that 
there  can  be  geometrically  different  stacking  arrangements  of  the  layers,  leading 
to  polymorphism.    There  are  two  such  stacking  polymorphs,  dickite  and  nacrite, 
neither  of  which  is  nearly  as  common  as  kaolinite.    The  whole  group  of  like 
minerals,  kaolinite  plus  its  two  stacking  polymorphs,  is  sometimes  called  the 
kandite group.   
There's  no  net  charge  on  the  tetrahedral-octahedral  layers;  the  layers  are 
held  together  only  by  van  der  Waals  bonds.    The  repeat  distance  normal  to  the 
layers  is  7.2  Å,  so  this  group  of  minerals  is  sometimes  called  seven-Ångstrom 
clays.   
The  crystals  can  get  fairly  large,  up  to  tens  of  microns,  because  there's  very 
little stress in the structure; kaolinite is the coarsest of the clay minerals.   
There's  also  a  hydrated  form  of  kaolinite,  called  halloysite,  with  a  single 
layer  of  water  molecules  between  the  layers;  this  disorders  the  stacking  and  in-
creases the interlayer spacing to about 10 Å.   
Kaolinite  is  formed  mainly  by  weathering  of  feldspars;  production  of 
kaolinite is favored by acidic and warm environments. 

 111

 

 

 

 

   

I  llite 
Illite  is  a  hydrous  muscovite-like  clay  mineral.    It  has  the  same  three-layer 
structure as muscovite, but  less  than  the one-in-four replacement of Si by Al that's 
characteristic  of muscovite  (the  figure  is  between  one-in-five  and  one-in-six).    So 
there isn't the same charge deficiency as in muscovite, and not as many K+ ions in 
the  interlayer  positions.    H3O+  ions  are  also  present  in  the  interlayer  positions.  
Also, substitutions in the octahedral layer are greater and more random; there's lots 
of variability.   
Illite is never found well crystallized, only as clay-size particles.  The particle 
size is typically less than one micron.  This is because there's considerable stress in 
the layers.   
As  with  the  other  micas,  there  are  polymorphs  resulting  from  different 
stacking  symmetry  of  the  TOT  layers:    1M  (one-repeat-layer  monoclinic),  2M 
(two-repeat-layer monoclinic), 3T  (three-repeat-layer  tetragonal), etc.   But usually 
these are hard to identify in illites.  
Illite-sericite-muscovite  are  all  similar,  and  called  white  mica;  there's  pro-
gressively  less Al substitution and  therefore  less  interlayer K+ and more  interlayer 
water.    There  are  no  well  defined  boundaries,  but  the  term  muscovite  is  used  for 
metamorphic  stuff,  the  term  sericite  is  customarily  used  for  diagenetic  or  incipi-
ently metamorphic  stuff,  and  the  term  illite  is  used  for  clay minerals  in  sediments 
and also in sedimentary rocks.  There's considerable overlap in usage, however.  
Illite is formed mainly by weathering of Kspar in temperate weathering envi-
ronments.  With increasing intensity of weathering, kaolinite is formed instead. 
 

M  ontmorillonite 
Technically  montmorillonite  is  one  important  mineral  in  what's  called  the 
smectite  group.   Montmorillonite  is  a  clay  mineral  which  like  illite  has  the  basic 
muscovite arrangement but which is able to expand by taking up a lot of water (or 
other polar molecules) in the interlayer positions.  The reason is that the bonds be-
tween  the  TOT  units  are weaker,  because  of  details  of  stacking  of  the  layers,  and 
also because the charge imbalance is located mainly in the interior octahedral layer 
rather than in the outer tetrahedral layers.   When the mineral is collapsed the layer 
spacing is 9.6 Å, but when fully expanded it's almost 20 Å. 
  Montmorillonite has variable percentages of large cations, Ca++ and Na+, in 
the  interlayer  positions.    There's  substitution  of  Al  for  Si  in  the  tetrahedral  layer, 
and variable proportions of Fe++, Mg++, and Al3+ in the octahedral layer.   
Montmorillonite  is  formed by  the weathering of plagioclase,  ferromagnesian 
aluminosilicates,  and  volcanic  glass;  its  development  is  favored  by  alkaline  en-
vironments.  

 

C  hlorite 
Chlorite is the most important regular mixed-layer clay mineral.  Its structure 
is an alternation of trioctahedral TOT layers, with Mg++ and Fe++ in the octahedral 
positions,  and  brucite  layers,  with  the  composition  (Mg++,  Fe++)3(OH)6,  giving  a 

 112

 

 

 

 

   

repeat spacing of about 14 Å.  There's a great range and diversity of ionic substitu-
tions in each of the three ion sites, as well as stacking polymorphs.   
So  chlorites  are  very  complicated.    Bonding  between  layers  is  by  van  der 
Waals  bonds.      Chlorite  is  produced  in  abundance  only  in  relatively  mild  weath-
ering environments, where  it  survives  from  the  source  rocks, although  in  the  form 
of finer particles.  So it's characteristically a high-latitude product.  
 

R  andom mixed-layer minerals 
Several  combinations  of  clay  minerals  will  interlayer  randomly,  because  of 
generally  similar  basic  atomic  structure  of  all  the  sheet-silicate  clay  minerals.  
These minerals  can  be  almost  as  stable  as  the  single-layer minerals;  they're  abun-
dant  in  both modern  sediments  and  ancient  rocks,  although  there's  a  tendency  for 
regularization as diagenesis becomes stronger.  Important kinds:   
illite-kaolinite 
chlorite-kaolinite 
chlorite-vermiculite 

 

A  morphous clay minerals 
These are clay minerals with little or no x-ray diffraction effects, although ap-
parently more  ordered  than  just  glass.    Si  is  in  tetrahedral  coordination with  oxy-
gen, and Al, Fe, and Mg are in octahedral coordination with oxygen, but there's no 
regular longer-range structure.   
There has been considerable difference of opinion about how  important such 
minerals are.  One reason is that they are very difficult to identify, especially when 
mixed with  better-ordered  clay minerals.    In  any  case,  they  readily  become  better 
organized upon burial.  
 3.8.3.2    Figure  4-13  shows  crude  sketches  of  structural  organization  of  the 
clay minerals.

4.  VOLCANICLASTIC ROCKS 
 
4.1  Introduction 
 
4.1.1    Particulate  volcanic  material,  once  out  of  the  ground,  is  in  fact  sed-
imentary material,  so  all  pyroclastic  rocks  could  be  treated  as  sedimentary  rocks.  
(I'm  not  recommending  that  you  do  this,  however.)    And  commonly  they're  in-
terbedded with  strictly  sedimentary  rocks.   Also,  pyroclastic  volcanic  rocks  grade 
over—both  case  by  case  and  also  in  a  given  area—into  sedimentary  rocks  sensu 
stricto composed largely or entirely of pyroclastic material. 
 
4.2  Where are Volcanoes?   
4.2.1  Mainly in the following kinds of places: 
mid-ocean ridges, basalt; sedimentologically unimportant 
subduction  zones  ("mobile  belts"  or  "geosynclines"  in  the  ancient);  andesites, 
felsites; at continental margins; sedimentologically very important. 
cratons, basalts etc.; sedimentologically not very important 
 
4.3  What Comes Out of Volcanoes?   
 
4.3.1   Table  4-2  shows  an  idealized  spectrum of volcanoes.   From Table 4-2 
you should expect that the sedimentologically important volcanic material is felsic 
pyroclastics. 

 
4.3.2    Particulate  components  that  come  out  of  volcanoes  (all  of  which  is 
called tephra): 
volcanic  glass:    shards  (curved  spicule-like  forms,  bubble-wall  fragments), 
pumice (porous gas-filled solidified froth) 
crystals:   mostly phenocrysts  separated out of  the magma; quartz  (euhedral, often 
embayed);  plagioclase  (often  zoned); Kspar;  lots  of  biotite  flakes;  hornblende, 
augite, etc. 
volcanic  rock  fragments:    cognate  (lava  broken  up  by  later  events);  accidental 
(wall-rock blocks, mainly aphanitic felsic rocks). 
4.3.3  Two important terms: 
volcaniclastic:    used  for  all  fragmental  volcanic  rocks,  any  mechanism  of  origin, 
any  depositional  environment,  any  admixture  of  nonvolcanic  components,  but 
usually only if the volcanic component is dominant. 
pyroclastic:    used  for  rocks  produced  by  explosive  ejection  of  volcanic  material 
from a volcanic vent. 

 114

 
4.4  Classification of Pyroclastic Material  
 
4.4.1    The  generic  term  for  solid  particulate  material  that  comes  out  of 
volcanic vents is tephra.  Here's a breakdown of tephra by particle size: 
blocks:  >32 mm fragments, broken from previously consolidated lava; tends to be 
angular 
bombs:   >32 mm objects formed by solidification of  lava  in flight; rounded, often 
with "bread-crust" surface; a deposit of bombs is called an agglomerate. 
lapilli:  4-32 mm volcanic materials; deposit is lapilli tuff 
ash:  <4 mm volcanic particulate materials; deposit is called tuff 
 
4.4.2    The  term tuff  is  used  for  lithified  deposits  of  tephra;  it's  usually  used 
just  for  ash-size  deposits.    Tuff  can  also  be  classified  the  basis  of  nature  of 
particles:  vitric tuff, crystal tuff, lithic tuff. 
 
4.5  Kinds of Volcaniclastic Rocks 
 
pyroclastic  deposits:    sediment  deposited  directly  from  volcanic  emanations,  in 
various  ways.    These  are  commonly  interbedded  with  "normal"  sedimentary 
rocks. 
reworked  pyroclastic  deposits:    newly  deposited  pyroclastic  material  reworked 
by  water  (in  rivers  or  in  shallow-marine  environments);  the  material  is 
pyroclastic,  but  the  structure  is  epiclastic  (produced  by  surficial  processes); 
also  included  are  debris-flow  deposits.    These  grade  continuously  into 
"normal" sedimentary rocks. 
erosional  volcaniclastic  deposits:    sediments  deposited  in  normal  ways  by  ero-
sion  of  volcanic  source  rocks.    These  grade  continuously  into  "normal"  sedi-
mentary  rocks,  and  differ  from  them  only  in  that  most  of  the  material  is  vol-
canic. 
 
4.6  Modes of Deposition of Pyroclastics 
 
Ash  falls:    pyroclastic  material  is  ejected  "loose"  into  the  atmosphere  and  settles 
back  to  earth  particle  by  particle.    The  material  is  dispersed  in  an  oblong  fan 
downwind;  grain  size  and  thickness  vary  regularly.    The  deposit  becomes  fairly 
well  sorted  by  fractionation  by  settling  velocity.    The  deposit  can  cover  hundreds 
to  thousands  of  square  kilometers,  and  forms  key  beds  that  lap  across  different 
geological  provinces.    The material  can  fall  either  onto  land  or  into water  bodies, 
resulting  in  air-fall  and  water-laid  deposits.   How  do  you  tell  these  apart?    If  the 
water-laid  material  experiences  no  currents  greater  than  threshold,  it  would  be 
difficult. 
Ash  flows    (also  called  nueés  ardentes):    Basically  a  subaerial  density  current. 
The  eruption  produces  a  cloud  of  glowing  particles  and  gas,  at  temperatures  of 
500-1000° C, which acts as a heavy fluid and flows down slopes at speeds of  tens 
of  meters  per  second.  Such  flows  travel  tens  of  kilometers  or  even  more.  The 
deposit  often  becomes  welded  after  deposition  (hence  the  term  welded  tuff), 
because  heat  doesn't  escape  immediately,  resulting  in  a  welded  tuff.   Many  rhyo-
lites  turn  out  to  be welded  tuffs when  their  texture  is  examined  closely.   Such de-
posits can also be submarine.  These deposits are also called ignimbrites. 
Base-surge  deposits:    high-velocity,  steam-laden,  horizontally  moving  eruptive 
clouds,  basically  an  explosion  phenomenon;  they're  seen  also  in  large  artificial 
explosions  like nuclear blasts.   They can  leave antidune cross-stratification!   (And 
good  overall  stratification.)    Sometimes  the  deposit  contains  airfall  blocks 
analogous to dropstones in a glaciomarine deposit. 
 115

 

 

 

 

   

 
Tuffs  weather  readily.    They  have  high  porosity,  large  surface  area,  and 
chemically  reactive  volcanic  composition.    Feldspar  weathers  to  kaolinite  as  soft 
earthy masses;  glass weathers  to  silica  in  solution,  zeolites,  clay minerals;  femags 
weather  to  dissolved  silica,  ions,  and  clay minerals.   The  ash  readily  loses  its  dis-
tinctive character.   When completely altered, many ash beds are converted to ben-
tonite  (a  material  usually  consisting  almost  entirely  of  the  clay  mineral  mont-
morillonite). 

 
4.7  Erosional Volcaniclastics 
 
4.7.1    These  are  the  rocks  you're  most  likely  to  deal  with  in  a  sedimentary 
context.    The  nature  of  the  rocks  and  the  range  of  characteristics  are  the  same  as 
for nonvolcaniclastic sediments, but the composition of the particles is distinctive. 
4.7.2  Typical constituents: 
 
volcanically derived crystals:  quartz, feldspar, etc. (even olivine) 
glassy material, but readily weathered 
rock fragments:  gravel size, sand size 
 
4.7.3  This stuff is weathered, eroded, transported by "ordinary" mechanisms, 
and then deposited in rivers, coastal environments,  and marine environments. 
4.7.4    One  very  characteristic  kind  of  volcaniclastic  deposit  is  debris  flows:  
These  are  unusually  important  in  volcanic  areas because of  removal of vegetation 
cover then rapid erosion by heavy rains, and  development of a high-concentration 
slurry.    The  term  lahar  is  used  for  large  debris  flows  generated  by  heavy  rain  in 
an  ash-covered  landscape.    Lahar  deposits  show  no  stratification  or  sorting,  with 
clasts  of  all  sizes  in  a  tuffaceous matrix.   How would you  tell  lahar deposits  from 
ash flows?  No welding; pumice not collapsed; possibly more nonvolcanic stuff. 
4.7.5  Other kinds of volcaniclastic deposits (not especially exciting): 
fluvial deposits 
beach deposits 
offshore sands 
turbidites 
 
4.7.6  Deposits commonly found interbedded in a volcanic area: 
lava flows 
ash flows 
lahar deposits 
erosional volcaniclastics 
other sedimentary rocks 
soil horizons 
 
4.7.7    Away  from  the  immediate  area  of  volcanism,  one  tends  to  find  ash 
beds  representing  ash  falls  (constituting  a  very  minor  proportion  of  the  section) 
interbedded with "normal" sedimentary rocks.
