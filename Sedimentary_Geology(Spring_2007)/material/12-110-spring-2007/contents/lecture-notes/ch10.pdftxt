DEPOSITIONAL ENVIRONMENTS 
 
PART I:  GENERAL 

 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  What does a sedimentologist mean by environment of deposition?  The 
concept is not as easy to define as you might think.  Basically, what the conditions 
were at the site of deposition.  This is usually viewed in terms of an overall 
geographical complex or entity that has a characteristic set of conditions, like a 
river or a beach—but see below.   
1.2  The term environment is really used in two different ways: 
 
THE environment:  the aggregate or complex of physical and/or chemical 
and/or biological conditions that exist or prevail at a given point or in a given 
local area at a given time or for a period of time. 
AN environment:  a distinctive kind of geographic setting characterized by a 
distinctive set of physical and/or chemical and/or biological conditions. 
 
1.3  Important:  you can go out and look at all the surface environments in 
the modern world to help you in your depositional interpretations, but you should 
keep in mind that only a small subset of environments (on land, that is) are 
depositional environments:  most are erosional environments, and they won’t help 
you much (and maybe even mislead you badly) about depositional environments.  
The somewhat strange word actualistic is used in geology to describe situations or 
processes that are represented on the Earth today, as opposed to non-actualistic 
ones, which are interpreted to have existed at a particular time or times in the past 
but are not represented on the modern Earth.   
1.4  Table 10-1 shows a fairly detailed list of depositional environments.  
There are various problems with this list: 
 
•  There’s lots of overlap among the different environments. 
•  It’s still not a complete list. 
•  Some of the environments on the list have been much more common and 
important in the sedimentary record than others. 
•  The divisions are not entirely natural. 
•  The extremely important effect of tectonic setting is taken into account to 
some extent but seriously inadequately. 

 

 
2.  MAKING INTERPRETATIONS 
 
2.1  Here’s a seemingly obvious but important point:  interpreting 
depositional environments involves interpretation.  You take note of objectively 
observable things in the rocks, and then you use your knowledge, your experience, 
and your intuition to make interpretations, specific or general.  You can be right in 
your observations and wrong in your interpretations, and you’re not doing any 
great damage.  But if you are wrong in your observations, you are not going to be 
right in your interpretations.   
2.2  Don’t make the mistake of mixing up observation and 
interpretation.  Don’t walk up to an outcrop and call the rock a beach sandstone 
or a point-bar sandstone.  First of all, describe it, and then add an interpretation if 
you want to.   
2.3  At the risk of being too synthetic, I’ll point out that two kinds of 
interpretation are possible (although they are not entirely distinct): 
 
Interpret specific conditions at a point in space and time.  Example:  look at 
geometry of cross stratification and say something about current velocity. 
Interpret general conditions in a local area with time, in the framework of 
broad kinds of depositional environments you think you understand.  
Example:  Look a sandstone–shale succession and decide that it represents 
deposits of a large meandering river. 
 
2.4  Here’s a list of what you can look for in a sediment rock or a 
sedimentary bed that might tell you something about depositional environment: 
 

grain size 
grain shape 
grain surface texture 
grain fabric 
sedimentary structures 
composition (siliciclastic; carbonate, evaporite, coal, chert) 
fossils (body fossils, trace fossils) 
stratification sequence 
sediment-body geometry/architecture 
 
2.5  What are environmental interpretations based on?  Three different kinds 
of things, basically: 
 
•  Study of modern environments 
•  Inferences about the results of known sedimentary processes 
•  Deductions about the causes of features seen in the ancient 

 253

 
2.6  It takes a lot of experience to get to be state-of-the-art in environmental 
interpretation, and nobody gets really good in all environments, just some.  People 
who are best equipped to interpret ancient depositional environments are those 
who have experience in modern environments but also experience in dealing with 
ancient rocks and sequences.  It’s hard to do a good job without a combination of 
both. 
2.7  A big problem:  things that are easy to study in the modern are hard to 
study in the ancient, and vice versa.  In the modern, it’s fairly easy to observe 
currents and study areal distributions of sediment types at the sediment–fluid 
interface,  but it’s difficult or impossible to study vertical sequences.  In the 
ancient it’s impossible to study directly the depositing medium (although 
inferences can be made), and it’s usually difficult or impossible to get an areal 
view of the depositional surface; on the other hand, it’s easy to study the vertical 
sequence. 

 
3.  FACIES AND FACIES MODELS 
 
3.1  You should be familiar with the idea of facies.  It’s a word that has had a 
long and varied use in sedimentology and stratigraphy, and I won’t attempt to 
review its history here.  I’ll use the term facies for a distinctive kind of 
sedimentary deposit, which was deposited in a distinctive setting.  Usually a 
stratigraphic section shows a small to large number of facies, stacked up with 
some degree of order or succession.  This degree of order ranges from seemingly 
nonexistent to strikingly strong, depending on both the inherent succession of 
conditions in the depositional environment and the existence of diastems in the 
record. 
3.2  It’s your task to recognize or perceive or establish the facies.  There is no 
official list.  Usually there are naturally recognizable kinds, with variations on a 
theme, although commonly what you are inclined to call different facies grade into 
one another without strong breaks.   
3.3  Also, keep in mind that there are many criteria you could use to 
recognize facies, so different people, with different interests, may come up with 
rather different lists of facies. 
3.4  Finally, how many facies you prefer to work with depends on whether 
you tend to be a “lumper” or a “splitter”.  There is usually some happy medium:  if 
you are too much of a lumper, you have too few facies to reflect the major aspects 
of variety in the environment; if you are too much of a splitter, you end up with a 
confusion of only slightly different facies which do not reveal the major aspects of 
variety in the environment.   
 

 254

3.5  How do you deal with facies on the outcrop?  At the risk of being too 
prescriptive or “cookbookish”, here is a set of steps you might take: 
 
•  Cruise up and down the section a few times, slowly, examining it bed by 
bed. 
•  Let ideas about facies grow in you mind. 
•  Develop a tentative list of facies. 
•  Refine the list by looking at the section again. 
•  Describe your facies. 
•  Record the vertical succession of facies in the section, in case that might 
reveal some characteristic kind of upward transition. 
 •  Think carefully about the environmental significance of the facies and 
their succession. 

 
3.6  This is a good place to say something about facies models or 
depositional models (and make a warning about their use).  Over the years, 
various general models of how certain depositional environments work have been 
developed.  This involves a distillation of the facies and facies successions in a 
number of related environmental settings into a widely applicable model, which, 
with variations, helps you to categorize your own section.   
3.7  The danger about facies models is that only a few have been well worked 
out, and you may end up trying to fit your square-peg depositional environment 
into a round-hole facies model, and doing more harm than good. 
 
4.  MARINE OR NONMARINE? 
 
4.1  The broadest, and probably the most important, question of 
environmental interpretation that confronts you when you look at rocks is this:  
Are the rocks marine or nonmarine?  If you don’t know that, how can you 
speculate about specific settings?  Below are some guidelines for your 
consideration.  Again I don’t want to be too cookbookish about this, but an 
annotated list seems advisable.  None of the items on this list is infallible (although 
the first is about as close to it as you're going to get in sedimentology); consider 
these items to be pieces of evidence that can sway your opinion, without really 
proving anything.  
 
Marine fossils   
Your best bet is to find marine fossils.  Of course you might ask:  How does 
one know that fossils considered marine fossils really represent organisms that 
lived in the ocean?  You can safely consider that to be a settled matter.  Then it’s 
up to you to identify the fossils.  Don’t forget that trace fossils are as useful as 

 255

body fossils in this regard.  You usually don’t have to worry about marine fossils 
being reworked from earlier deposits and incorporated into a nonmarine deposit, 
and vice versa, although it’s possible.  
 
Carbonate rocks   
There are some fresh-water limestones around (and some fresh-water 
dolostones, too), but most of the carbonate rocks you are likely to see are marine.  
This is a suggestive piece of evidence, but clearly it’s not definitive. 
 
Red beds   
Red beds are rocks (usually sandstone–shale successions) in which at least 
the finer sediments, if not the coarser, contain a small percentage of hematite, a 
potent rock pigment that imparts the characteristic red color.  The origin of the 
hematite pigment has been controversial, but it’s widely agreed that the iron gets 
in the sediment at the time of burial detritally as hydrous ferric oxides which later, 
during early diagenesis, get converted to hematite, provided that there is not so 
much organic matter to be oxidized that the iron ends up in the ferrous state.  
That’s far more likely to happen in nonmarine, especially fluvial, environments 
than in marine environments, so red beds are good suggestive evidence of 
nonmarine deposition.  But again there are important exceptions.  
 
Evaporite chemistry   
If your succession contains evaporite minerals, you can often make a good 
case for marine or nonmarine on the basis of the suite of evaporite minerals 
present.  As you learned in the earlier chapter on evaporites, the ionic composition 
of sea water changes very little, so there’s a rigorous regularity in the evaporite 
minerals formed.  On the other hand, evaporites in nonmarine basins, which 
usually have closed drainage, can vary widely in their chemical composition, 
because the salt content depends atr least in part on what’s weathered out of the 
particular source rocks and carried into the basin.  
 
5.  PALEOFLOW INTERPRETATION 
 
5.1  Probably the most important kind of specific environmental 
interpretation you can try to make is to figure out the nature of the depositing fluid 
flow.  (Most. but not all, sediments are deposited by flowing fluids.)  This deals 
with some possibilities for making paleoflow interpretations by examining ancient 
clastic sedimentary sequences.  When such interpretations can be made, they serve 
as guides or constraints in framing a broader picture of the depositional 
environment.  The possibilities for making such interpretations are numerous and 
varied, but nonetheless they are still limited.  Further work is going to reveal a lot 
of useful interpretive approaches based on features of beds we still don’t know 
how to interpret.   

 256

5.2  This section has a practical approach:  the focus will be on what you can 
actually do, or try to do, when you are on the outcrop.  The philosophy here is to 
examine a sedimentary succession bed by bed to try to draw conclusions about 
water movements, transport modes, and overall sediment budget, to the extent 
possible.  The sedimentary record holds many keys to the interpretation of these 
aspects of the depositional environment.  Sedimentologists have a good 
understanding of some of these keys, and these will be emphasized here.  There 
must also be many other features of sedimentary beds which have potential for 
interpretations but we don’t yet know how to interpret them.   
5.3  Other kinds of interpretive approaches can be brought to bear on 
sedimentary sequences as well.  One can consider the whole complex of 
sedimentary features and arrangements of a deposit, with the hope of applying or 
developing a broad depositional model which more or less closely describes the 
overall depositional environment.  (That’s what the earlier section of this chapter, 
on facies models in general, and the last section of this chapter, on specific 
environments, are about.)  Many such models have been developed.  Two 
outstanding examples are the meandering-river model and the submarine-fan 
model.  One danger of such an approach is that a complex and distinctive 
depositional environment is unnaturally fitted into an inappropriate model.   
5.4  My own preference is to try to make small-scale interpretations first, and 
then use those results as constraints on the choice of a broad depositional model.  
In a certain sense, to do otherwise is to put the cart before the horse.  In some 
cases, one is forced to conclude or admit that the small-scale results don’t add up 
to any of the standard depositional models.  This might be because not enough 
small-scale information can be obtained, or because we don’t understand its 
significance well enough.  But keep in mind that you may be looking at a 
nonactualistic environment, one that’s not even represented on the modern Earth!  
This is especially true of lower Paleozoic and older deposits, before land plants 
changed the face of the Earth. 
5.5  The main kinds of features of beds you can study are stratification, 
texture, bed thickness, bed geometry, and nature of contacts.  Of these, 
stratification offers the most valuable possibilities for interpretation.  
Fundamentally this is because stratification is a fairly direct reflection of the bed 
configuration that existed at the time of deposition, and, as you learned in an 
earlier chapter, the bed configuration varies greatly as a function of flow 
conditions.  On the other hand, texture has always been considered to hold great 
interpretive potential, but we don’t yet know very well how to make 
interpretations from textural features.  Bed thickness and bed geometry are more 
difficult to interpret because they reflect aspects of the depositional environment 
on a scale which to a great extent is broad or regional rather than local. 
 

 257

5.6  This would be as good point at which to go back to the earlier chapters 
on particle size and, especially, on bed forms and stratification to review the 
potential “fodder” for paleoflow interpretations.  Below are just two additional 
matters that you should be aware of. 
cross stratification:  It is all to easy to walk up to an outcrop with a cross-
stratified bed and measure the direction of dip of the cross-strata, and then assume 
that the result is a good indication of the overall paleoflow direction.  The problem 
is that in most cases the geometry of the cross sets is far from being uniformly 
dipping planar strata.  You saw that in the earlier sections on small-scale trough 
cross-stratification and large-scale cross stratification generated by the movement 
of three-dimensional dunes.  At the very least, you need to take a large number of 
dip measurements in a way that is unbiased by the geometry of the outcrop surface 
itself—commonly an impossible task in practice.  Rib and furrow, although 
uncommon to see in outcrop, is the very best way of obtaining a paleoflow 
measurement from cross stratification. 
parting lineation:  Commonly, when a sandstone parts along a stratification 
plane, there is a subtle (or often not so subtle) “grain” or anisotropy of the parting 
surface, in the form of irregular steps, all approximately parallel, and usually only 
a fraction of a millimeter in height, which reflects an anisotropy in rock strength 
caused by preferential alignment of the sand grains parallel to the paleoflow.  It’s 
is often called, alternatively and more accurately, parting-step lineation.  
Presumably, it’s a reflection of upper-regime plane-bed transport. 
 
 
PART II.  SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS 

 
 
1.  FLUVIAL ENVIRONMENTS 
 
1.1  Introduction 
 
1.1.1  Rivers are the main routes by which sediment derived from weathering 
on the continents reaches the ocean.  (Remember that this sediment includes 
dissolved material as well as particulate material; the discussion here deals only 
with the particulate material.)  Most of this sediment indeed reaches the ocean, but 
a certain smaller percentage is deposited either within the rivers themselves or 
where rivers end in basins of interior drainage.   
1.1.2  In a sense such storage is temporary, in that it eventually is remobilized 
in a later geologic cycle, but commonly it is stored for geologically long times, 
tens to hundreds of millions of years and sometimes even billions of years—long 
enough for it to be deeply buried and lithified, even metamorphosed.   

 258

1.1.3  Rivers are enormously varied, in size, geometry, and dynamics.  When 
someone speaks of rivers to you, what image comes to your mind?  A rushing 
mountain stream?  The broad and placid Mississippi?  These are only two of a 
great many common manifestations of rivers.  So it should not surprise you that 
fluvial sediments and sedimentary rocks are highly varied as well.   
1.1.4  It’s usually considered that most rivers are either meandering or 
braided; straight rivers are not very common.  But meandering and braiding are 
not mutually exclusive tendencies:  either or both can be in evidence in a given 
river, with each with varying degrees of prominence.  And both meandering and 
braiding show great diversity.  This should suggest to you that it's not easy to 
compartmentalize the sedimentological behavior of rivers into a few neat models.   
1.1.5  Meandering rivers lend themselves to fairly easy description or 
characterization, and a widely accepted facies model for the deposits of 
meandering rivers has been around for a long time.  Braided rivers are much more 
variable and less easy to characterize; there have been attempts to develop facies 
models for braided rivers, but these have not been nearly as successful or widely 
used as the meandering model.   
1.1.6  This is not the place to present an account of the dynamics and 
geomorphology of rivers, although I want you to appreciate that understanding of 
the geomorphology of rivers is crucial to understanding and interpretation of 
fluvial deposits.  The major factor in how a fluvial deposit looks is the 
geomorphology of the river:  the arrangement of channels and overbank areas, and 
how they change with time during slow buildup of the floodplain.  All I’ll do here 
is present some basic things about fluvial deposition and fluvial deposits, and then 
outline the meandering fluvial model, with appropriate caveats on its application. 
1.1.7  Keep in mind that the same problem of the modern versus the ancient 
that holds for marine deposits holds for fluvial deposits as well:  It’s relatively 
easy to study sediment movement and disposition in modern rivers, but it’s rather 
difficult to study the vertical sequence of deposits, because of the generally high 
water table.  In ancient rocks, on the other hand, it’s easy to study the vertical 
sequence of deposits, but it’s usually impossible to establish the geomorphology 
of the depositing river itself.   

 
1.2  Why Are There Fluvial Deposits? 
 
1.2.1  It’s not obvious why fluvial deposits are an important part of the 
ancient sedimentary record.  After all, rivers drain areas of the continents that are 
undergoing erosion.  It’s true that most rivers, except the smallest, are alluvial 
rivers:  they have a bed, and a floodplain, composed of their own sediments.  But 
in most cases this alluvial valley sediment isn’t very thick.  Only in certain cases 
does the alluvial valley fill become thicker.   

 259

1.2.2  Two effects are conducive to deposition in rivers:  progradation and 
crustal subsidence. 
Progradation.  As a river wears down the land and delivers sediment to the 
sea, the mouth of the river builds seaward (Figure 10-1).  Because the longitudinal 
profile of a river is anchored by base level at the mouth, this means that there has 
to be a slight upbuilding in the lowermost reach of the river.  This may not seem 
like a big effect, but even a hundred meters represents a lot of sediment.

Crustal subsidence.  The only way to get a really thick sequence of fluvial 
sediment is to drop the crust beneath the river (Figure 10-2).  As this happens, 
slowly, along some reach of the river, there develops a very slight expansion of 
flow and a decrease in flow velocity and therefore in sediment-moving ability.  
Just by simple bookkeeping, this must lead to sediment storage along the river:  if 
what comes into a given area of the bed is greater than what goes out, sediment is 
stored in that area, and the bed builds up.  From an anthropomorphic standpoint, 
the river tries to maintain its longitudinal profile while the bottom drops out from 
under it, and it does so by leaving a little of the passing sediment to build up its 
bed.

1.3  How Do You Know It’s Fluvial? 
 
1.3.1  By what criteria might you tell that a sedimentary sequence is fluvial?  
Here are some, but remember that none is incontrovertible, because each applies to 
other environments as well. 
 

absence of marine fossils 
presence of plant fossils 
red beds 
scoured channels 
unidirectional-flow cross-stratification 
broadly unidirectional paleocurrents 
paleosols 
desiccation cracks 
plant fossils 

 
1.4  The Meandering-River Facies Model 
 
1.4.1  Rivers carry mud, sand, and gravel.  In meandering rivers, sand (and 
some gravel) is stored in channel beds and especially in point bars, and mud is 
stored in floodplains.  So meandering-river deposits end up as large sand bodies, 
shaped like lenses and shoestrings, partly connected but often mostly isolated from 
one another, enclosed in mud.  (In braided rivers, sand and gravel in various 
proportions becomes interbedded very irregularly in lenses, sheets, and channels 
as the individual anabranches of the stream system shift irregularly and leave bars 
and islands.)  Figure 10-3; Walker, R.G., and Cant, D.J., 1984, Sandy fluvial 
systems, in Walker, R.G., ed., Facies Models, Second Edition:  Geological 
Association of Canada, Geoscience Canada Reprint Series 1, 317 p.  (Figure 1, p. 
72); shows a simplified sketch of the plan-view arrangement of a typical 
meandering river. 
1.4.2  With time, an individual meander loop tends to become "loopier" or 
more accentuated by outward progradation of the point bar and erosion along the 
concave or outer bank.  At the same time the entire meander loop tends to shift 
downvalley.  Often you can see low curving ridges, called meander scars or 
meander scrolls, inside the meander loop that record the earlier positions of the 
point bar.   
1.4.3  As time goes one, the meander loop also narrows at its neck.  
Eventually during some flood the river breaches the neck and straightens itself by 
establishing a new course across the neck, thereby abandoning the meander loop.  
This process is called neck cutoff.  The ends of the abandoned loop soon become 
plugged by fine sediment to form an oxbow lake.  The floodplains of meandering 

 261

rivers show a complex pattern of several generations of truncated meander scars 
and partly or wholly filled oxbow lakes recording a long history of meandering. 
1.4.4  Every now and then, probably during a really  big flood, the river 
breaks out completely from its meander belt to reestablish its course along some 
distant lower part of its floodplain, leaving the entire meander belt to be eventually 
filled and covered by fine floodplain sediment.  Such a catastrophic change in 
course is called avulsion.  
1.4.5  In a subsiding reach of a meandering river, the shifting and 
abandonment of meander loops (and, every now and then, of the whole meander 
belt) leads to a characteristic vertical arrangement of sand bodies encased in 
floodplain muds.  This is because the sand carried in the main channel is deposited 
on the sloping surfaces of the point bars as they accrete laterally, and is then left as 
an irregular but not grossly inequidimensional mass whose thickness is about the 
same as that of the bankfull depth of the river.  Such deposits are called lateral-
accretion deposits (Figure 10-4). 

POINT-BAR SAND

FLOODPLAIN MUD

1.4.6  Sometimes you see a kind of large-scale low-angle cross stratification, 
reflecting the channelward slope of the point-bar surface, produced by the episodic 
accretion onto the point bar-surface (it’s called, infelicitously, epsilon cross 
stratification), but usually such cross stratification is masked by the smaller-scale 
structures (planar lamination and especially large-scale cross stratification) 
produced by sediment movement on the point-bar surface. 
1.4.7  As the channels shift to leave point-bar sand bodies while the 
floodplain gradually builds up by deposition of muds (called vertical-accretion 
deposits), a characteristic three-dimensional arrangement of sand bodies 
surrounded by muds is formed.  The geometry of such a fluvial deposit is termed 
alluvial architecture.  Figure 10-5 is a simplified sketch. 

 262

a fluvial deposit left by a meandering river in an aggrading regime. Left: aggradation rate

lateral shifting 
1.4.8  What you are likely to see in outcrop is one or a few point-bar sand 
bodies, restricted in lateral extent, interbedded with muds.  If you are lucky, you 
will see some epsilon cross stratification to suggest lateral accretion on a point-bar 
surface, and/or termination of the point-bar sand body against muds as a record of 
channel abandonment by cutoff.  Only by wider mapping of favorable outcrops, 
though, can you perceive something of the architecture of the deposit as a whole.  
1.4.9  One of the biggest problems in dealing with fluvial deposits that are 
interbeddings of sands and muds is telling whether a given sand body is the result 
of lateral accretion of a point-bar surface or widespread deposition of a sand sheet 
by non-channelized flood water.  In the one case, deposition is incremental and 
local, and in the other case it’s all at once and widespread.  The only way to know 
for sure is to see evidence of lateral accretion, like epsilon cross stratification or 
channel abandonment, and you are usually not that lucky.  Usually you have to fall 
back on the idea that if the sand body is very thin, less than a meter or two, it was 
probably a sheet-flood deposit, whereas if it's thicker, it’s likely to be a point-bar 
deposit. 

 
2.  SEDIMENT GRAVITY FLOWS AND THEIR DEPOSITS 
 
2.1  Introduction 
 
2.1.1  Sediment gravity flows are turbulent flows of sediment–fluid mixtures 
which are driven by the downslope component of the excess density of the mixture.  
This is not an entirely satisfactory definition, and some words of explanation are 
in order.   
2.1.2  The sediment–fluid mixture flows beneath a body of fluid, usually 
taken to be sediment-free; the density of the sediment–fluid mixture is greater than 
that of the overlying fluid, and that’s what provides the downslope driving force.  
One of the intentions of the definition is to exclude rivers from the concept; after 
all, rivers are downslope flows of sediment–fluid mixtures under gravity, so why 
aren’t they sediment gravity flows?  But rivers flow even if they carry no 

 263

sediment, whereas the presence of sediment is essential to the existence of 
sediment gravity flows.   
2.1.3  Another sticky point about the definition is that in grain flows, 
universally considered to be one kind of sediment gravity flow, a sheared 
dispersion of sediment particles moves downslope under the pull of gravity 
without the necessary presence of fluid at all, either interstitial or supernatant.  
There can be grain flows even in a vacuum!  But for almost all the sediment 
gravity flows of sedimentological interest, the concept is clear and useful. 
2.1.4  Relatively small turbidity currents have been observed and studied in 
lakes and reservoirs since late in the nineteenth century, but the existence of large 
marine turbidity currents came to light only by deductions made by geologists 
about features seen in the ancient sedimentary record.  Soon after the existence of 
large marine turbidity currents was hypothesized, instances of their occurrence in 
recent times were recognized and studied, and small-scale laboratory experiments 
(mainly by geologists!) to study their motion and deposits, together with the 
evidence from the ancient, convinced most geologists of their existence and 
importance.  Interpretation of turbidity-current deposits was well established by 
the early 1960s. 
2.1.5  Recognition of more “exotic” sediment gravity flows, which would 
generally be classified as submarine debris flows, was longer in coming.  
Although subaerial debris flows were well known, it was not until the 1970s that 
the concept of submarine debris flows was widely invoked to explain the coarse, 
poorly sorted,  and seemingly deep-marine deposits so common in the sedimentary 
record.  Even now our understanding of the dynamics and depositional effects of 
debris flows does not match that of turbidity currents.  Many important questions, 
among them the following, remain unresolved:  
  
 
•  What’s the nature of flows transitional between turbidity currents and 
debris flows?   
•  At what rate do sediment gravity flows lose sediment by deposition as they 
move?   
•  How does one distinguish between slowly deposited and rapidly deposited 
sediment-gravity-flow deposits?   
•  More generally, how does one interpret the nature of the sediment gravity 
flow from the record of the deposit?    
 
2.2  Dynamics 
 
2.2.1  This is not the place for detailed consideration of the dynamics of 
sediment gravity flows; I’ll just make some brief comments.  Sediment gravity 
flows are generated, flow for some distance, and eventually dissipate by 

 264

deposition of the sediment.  The origin of sediment gravity flows is their least well 
understood aspect:  one has to appeal to the existence of unstable sediment resting 
on some slope, and its mobilization by either spontaneous failure or some sudden 
or cyclic disturbance like shaking by an earthquake or repeated loading and 
unloading by passage of surface water waves.  If the sediment is sufficiently rich 
in water, liquefaction by rearrangement of grain packing can provide mobility 
without introduction of additional water, but for the thinner kinds of sediment 
gravity flows one might have to invoke initial incorporation of water from above 
as the movement starts.  
2.2.2  Sediment gravity flows accelerate and then decelerate again, but for 
most of their history this acceleration and deceleration is small, and the motion is 
nearly uniform.  There is thus an approximate balance between the driving force, 
the downslope component of the excess weight per unit volume of the mixture, 
and a resisting frictional force, exerted mainly by the substrate on the bottom of 
the flow but also by the overlying fluid on the top of the flow.   
2.2.3  The motion of sediment gravity flows, described briefly below, is an 
outcome of the interplay among three factors:  the downslope component of 
excess weight, which acts throughout the flow; the resisting forces exerted at the 
upper and lower surfaces; and the local resistive properties of the mixture, which 
can be characterized, approximately at least, by its viscosity (to the extent that it 
behaves as a fluid) and its shear strength (to the extent that it behaves as a plastic).  
Except in a very simplified way, it’s not even possible to write down the 
governing equations of motion, let alone solve them, largely because of the 
problem of deciding upon the basic mechanical nature of the material in order to 
write down what are called the constitutive equations, which relate the 
deformation to the applied stress.  So any treatment of the motions of sediment 
gravity flows, overall and internal, must still be semiquantitative at best.  
 
2.3  Classification 
 
2.3.1  Classification of sediment gravity flows is based on the nature of the 
mechanism or mechanisms by which the sediment is kept supported in the flow.  
There are considered to be four such mechanisms: 
 

fluid turbulence 
matrix strength 
dispersive grain collisions 
fluidization 

 
 
 

 265

2.3.2  Sediment gravity flows are accordingly classified into four kinds (with 
various intergradations) on the basis of the dominant support mechanism: 
Turbidity currents (mainly fluid turbulence; grain dispersion might be 
important near the base, and fluidization by dewatering of deposits from 
an earlier part of the same turbidity current is certainly important in many 
cases) 
Debris flows (mainly matrix strength; fluid turbulence is presumably 
important in less concentrated debris flows, and I myself am inclined to 
think that there is a continuous gradation from turbidity currents to debris 
flows) 
Grain flows (grain dispersion; fluid turbulence may contribute to grain 
support in some grain flows) 
Fluidized flows (fluidization—that is, the suspension of sediment from 
uprise of fluid from a source below the flow) 

 
2.3.3  Fluidized flows, except as part of a turbidity current, are not 
considered to be of great sedimentological importance.  Turbidity currents and 
debris flows are certainly important.  The role of grain flows has been 
controversial:  some see them everywhere, whereas others think that except for 
very local situations, like the avalanche faces of dunes, they are not of great 
sedimentological importance.  No one has yet gotten a good “handle” on grain 
flows, in the sense that they have developed widely accepted criteria for their 
recognition in sedimentary deposits.  
2.3.4  Figure 10-6 shows the standard diagram, originating with G.V. 
Middleton in the early 1970s, showing classification of sediment gravity flows.

2.4  Motion 
 
2.4.1  All the sediment gravity flows I have seen, or have seen movies of, 
have a fairly well defined head or front, where the flow is thickest and where 
velocities are highest, and a long body, and a tail, where velocities are lower 
(Figure 10-7; Walker, R.G., 1984, Turbidites and associated coarse clastic 
deposits, in Walker, R.G., ed., Facies Models, Second Edition:  Geological 
Association of Canada, Geoscience Canada Reprint Series 1, 317 p.  (Figure 1, p. 
171)).  The implication of this is that sediment gravity flows tend to be dispersive:  
the head outruns the tail, and the flow stretches out and becomes more diffuse as it 
flows.  Debris flows sometimes show pulses of more active movement along their 
length:  the flow thins and slows or even stops for a while, and then thickens and 
speeds up again as a pulse from upstream moves by.   
2.4.2  Sediment gravity flows may at first incorporate more sediment, by 
erosion of the substrate, but even if they do (and presumably some are 
depositional almost from the beginning), when they reach a gentler slope they 
eventually lose sediment by deposition and therefore weaken.  The velocity 
picture in sediment gravity flows is thus complicated:  velocity varies both along 
the flow at a given time, and with time at any point that’s followed along with the 
flow.  Of course, at any point on the bottom the velocity increases and then 
decreases as the flow passes by.     
2.4.3  The state of internal motion in sediment gravity flows is complex and 
varied.  The low-concentration kinds of sediment gravity flows, like turbidity 
currents, are certainly turbulent, whereas the higher-concentration kinds of 
sediment gravity flows, like debris flows, tend to be laminar.  Relatively low-
concentration sediment gravity flows behave approximately as Newtonian fluids, 
but relatively high-concentration sediment gravity flows must be non-Newtonian; 
in fact, very high-concentration flows are thought to have matrix strength 
(meaning that the applied shear stress must reach a certain value before the 
mixture starts to deform by shearing), so they may behave as plastics.   
2.4.4  Matrix strength is significant for the flow behavior of debris flows:  in 
the interior of the flow, where shear is least, there is likely to be a rigid plug, and 
as the flow decelerates and the shear within the flow becomes weaker, the rigid-
plug zone expands upward and downward, until the flow grinds to a halt by total 
rigidification.  Many lower-concentration debris flows can be seen to be turbulent, 
however, so matrix strength must be a much less important effect in them.  
 
2.5  Sediment-Gravity-Flow Deposits 
 
2.5.1  Features.—Most sediment-gravity-flow deposits are event beds:  
relatively coarse beds, sandstones or conglomerates, underlain and overlain by 
finer deposits, siltstones and mudstones.  They are mostly marine, although 
lacustrine sediment-gravity-flow deposits are of non-negligible importance. 

 267

2.5.2  The lower contacts of sediment-gravity-flow beds are almost always 
sharp, and often erosional, reflecting the initially very strong current.  Upper 
contacts are usually gradational, although the gradation is often complete over a 
small thickness, of the order of a centimeter.  Normal grading is characteristic of 
turbidity-current deposits, reflecting temporal decrease in current velocity, and 
therefore size of sediment carried.  Inverse grading is common at the base of both 
turbidity-current deposits and debris-flow deposits; the mechanics of its 
development is not clear.   
2.5.3  Thickness of sediment-gravity-flow deposits ranges from a few 
millimeters, in the case of feather-edge distal turbidites, to well over ten meters, in 
the case of deposits from the largest debris flows or flows intermediate between 
turbidity currents and debris flows.   
2.5.4  Sediment-gravity-flow deposits range from well stratified (as in most 
turbidity-current deposits), to wholly nonstratified (as in many debris-flow 
deposits).  Structures range from nonstratified through parallel-laminated to cross-
stratified, usually but not always on a fairly small scale; soft-sediment deformation 
is common as well.  Because sediment-gravity-flow deposits are deposited rapidly, 
you might expect them to have rather loose packing and excess pore water; 
dewatering structures, mainly dish structures and vertical pipelike structures, are 
common.  
2.5.5  Interpretation.—How do you know that you are dealing with a 
sediment-gravity-flow deposit?  Remember that it’s always an interpretation, 
because it’s a matter of genesis rather than just description.  You have to use some 
or all of the above features, and more, to make that kind of interpretation on the 
outcrop.  The broader stratigraphic context (what’s the overall nature of the 
section?) is also useful in making such an interpretation.  You need practice on the 
outcrop. 
2.5.6  The Bouma Sequence.—Working on turbidites in Spain in the late 
1950s, the Dutch (now American) sedimentologist Arnold Bouma perceived a 
characteristic vertical sequence of sedimentary structures in turbidites, which he 
thought to reflect the temporal sequence of depositional conditions at a point on 
the bed as the turbidity current flowed by and deposited sediment from a waning 
current.  Since then this sequence has been called the Bouma sequence.  (It’s 
unusual for someone to be so immortalized even before one's death!)  The 
distinctive parts of this sequence are called divisions; Bouma designated them A 
through E.   
2.5.7 Figure 10-8; Walker, R.G., 1984, Turbidites and associated coarse 
clastic deposits, in Walker, RG., ed., Facies Models, Second Edition:  Geological 
Association of Canada, Geoscience Canada Reprint Series 1, 317 p.  (Figure 4, p. 
173); is a sketch of a representative turbidite showing a complete Bouma 
sequence, followed by a brief account of the genesis of the various divisions, 
according to modern interpretation. 

 268

 
A division (coarse nonlaminated):  rapid deposition of the coarsest 
sediment,  involving sediment accumulation near the bed and then dewatering, as 
the current first passes; absence of lamination reflects nonexistence of a well 
defined sediment–fluid interface upon which traction takes place.  
B division (parallel-laminated):  High-velocity flow over a well defined 
sediment–fluid interface; abundant fallout of sediment from suspension, followed 
by active traction; the bed phase is high-velocity plane bed. 
C division (rippled):  Lower-velocity flow over a well defined sediment 
fluid interface; abundant fallout of sediment (commonly very fine to fine sand) 
from suspension, followed by active traction; the bed phase is ripples.  Climbing-
ripple cross lamination is produced by downcurrent movement of the ripples in the 
presence of overall aggradation of the bed by sediment fallout. 
D division (draped fine sediment):  delicate interlamination of very fine 
sand, silt, and mud draping the underlying tractional deposits; draping of sediment 
results from fallout while the current is not strong enough to produce traction. 
E division (residual mud):  deposition of mud brought into the area by the 
turbidity current and left behind as the turbidity current passed by; deposition is 
from very slowly moving fluid, and leaves no structures.  The turbidite mud passes 
gradually up into interturbidite “background” mud. 
 
2.5.8  Here’s something extremely important to remember about the Bouma 
sequence:  it’s a distillation of observations of a large number of turbidites, and 
most turbidites show deviations from it.  This is only to be expected, because all 
three of the factors that govern the vertical sequence of grain size and structure 
within a turbidite (current velocity, bed aggradation rate, and size of deposited 
sediment) can vary independently of one another.  There’s an infinity of possible 
temporal sequences of variation of these three factors, and each produces a 
different vertical sequence.   
2.5.9  It was recognized long ago that the characteristic sequence (as well as 
the thickness and mean grain size of the bed) varies as one passes from the 
proximal to the distal depositional area.  Proximal turbidites are likely to show lots 
of ABC beds, or AB beds, or even just A beds.  More distal beds might be 
expected to be BC beds, or BC beds or just C beds.  (The D and E are left out here, 
because they are seldom prominent except in sometimes in distal beds.)  But even 
this is too superficial:  the mechanics and microenvironments of turbidite 
deposition are so varied that a great variety of combinations of thickness, grain 
size, and structure sequence can be found.  Some of this variability can be 
accounted for by what’s known about how turbidity currents work in natural 
environments, but a lot hasn’t been rationalized very well.  
 

 269

2.5.10  A particularly important example of the foregoing point is this:  one 
often sees thin but coarse sediment-gravity-flow beds showing evidence of strong 
traction in the form of planar lamination.  The natural assumption is that such beds 
record passage of strong turbidity currents through channels in the proximal to 
intermediate environment, with each turbidity current leaving little or even no 
deposit.  In such situations large-scale cross stratification, so uncommon in 
“classical” turbidites, is not uncommon as well.  One assumes that the sediment 
(presumably abundant) that passed by the given point was deposited as thicker but 
finer beds downslope. 
6.5.11  Submarine Fans.—It stands to reason that the deposit formed by 
repeated sediment-gravity-flow depositional events at the base of a submarine (or 
lacustrine) slope would be broadly fan-shaped or cone-shaped—although outcrop 
in the ancient is seldom if ever good enough to pin down the three-dimensional 
geometry of the fan.  On the other hand, submarine fans, large and small, are well 
known in the modern; marine geologists have been studying their geometry and 
surface sediment for many years.  (But it’s almost as difficult to study the thick 
vertical succession of deposits in a modern fan as it is to study the geometry of an 
ancient fan.)  Nowadays, sophisticated seismic reflection techniques allow great 
insight into the innards of deeply buried submarine fans 
2.5.12  During the 1970s, Italian sedimentologists were active in developing 
a model for the deposition of sediment-gravity-flow deposits as submarine fans.  
That work drew mainly upon studies in the ancient, but other sedimentologists 
later integrated that model with what’s known about modern fans.   
2.5.13  Keep in mind that, as with any depositional models, application of the 
submarine-fan model involves a certain leap of faith, because there’s nothing from 
the outcrop that tells you directly that you are dealing with a fan, only indirectly.   
2.5.14  How do submarine fans operate?  There is good evidence from the 
modern that the sediment gravity flows are usually carried by a network of 
distributary channels, which change and shift irregularly with time (Figure 10-9; 
Stow, D.A.V., Reading, H.G., and Collinson, J.D.,, Deep Seas, in Reading, H.G., 
ed., Sedimentary Envbironments; Processes, Facies and Stratigraphy, Third 
Edition:  Blackwell Science, 688 p.  (Figure 10.46, p. 430, and Figure 10.51, p. 
432)).  Some aspects of this change are closely analogous to meandering of 
surface rivers, and some aspects are closely analogous to braiding of surface 
rivers.  The essential similarity between alluvial fans and submarine fans is that 
upbuilding is localized on one part of the fan for a long while, until the 
channelized flow breaks out at some point to seek a lower elevation on some other 
part of the fan that hasn't been active for a long time.   
2.5.15  The irregular shifting of distributary channels on a fan surface gives 
rise to a signal in the event-bed succession, whereby some parts of the section 
consist mostly or entirely of coarse event beds (this represents the active 
upbuilding of the fan by the channelized flow) and other parts of the section 

 270

consist mostly of finer background deposits (this represents interchannel or 
overbank deposition away from the areas of active upbuilding by channelized 
flow).   
2.5.16  Packets of event beds in the submarine-fan setting often show a 
tendency, subtle or pronounced, for thickening and coarsening upward, or thinning 
and fining upward.  Such packets are typically several meters to a few tens of 
meters thick.  The model accounts for this by assuming that as a new area of the 
fan is being constructed, the event beds become thicker and coarser for two 
reasons:  the new distributary channel gathers discharge slowly, and the local 
environment becomes more proximal as the deposit progrades.  On the other hand, 
if flow in a given distributary channel is gradually choked off, the sequence of 
event beds would show a tendency to be thinner and finer upward.   
2.5.17  The submarine fan model has been refined to the point where many 
sub-environments are recognized.  I won’t elaborate except to mention three such 
sub-environments;   
•  The basin plain, the most distal environment, where the waning sediment 
gravity flows are no longer strongly channelized but can spread widely to the side, 
to leave beds that are traceable for long distances in two lateral directions, not just 
one.    
•  Throughput channels, where strong sediment gravity flows in fairly 
proximal positions transport large quantities of sediment past a given reach but 
leave little or no thickness of sediment.  It’s in such environments that thin, coarse, 
and amalgamated sediment-gravity-flow deposits are common. 
•  Overbank areas lying adjacent to active distributary channels, where 
especially large flow events spill over the channel banks to deposit finer 
suspended sediment (silts and fine sands) from currents of moderate velocities to 
build broad natural levees.  

 
3.  OPEN SHALLOW MARINE DEPOSITS 
 
3.1  Introduction 
 
3.1.1  Today several percent of the area of the world’s oceans is floored by 
the continental shelves:  the submerged shallow margins of the continents.  Water 
depths are seldom greater than about 200 m even at the shelf edge, and relief is 
subdued, except where submarine canyons cut into the shelf.  Widths range up to a 
few hundred kilometers.  Average bottom slopes are so small that if they drained 
the ocean and parachuted you blindfolded onto the middle of the continental shelf, 
you wouldn’t know which way to walk to get back home, just from the lay of the 
land.   
3.1.2  The total area of continental shelves in the world is a very sensitive 
function of world sea level, because along tectonically stable, passive-margin 

 271

coasts at least, the inland area is usually a gently sloping coastal plain.  Sea level 
today is not as low as it has been in the geologic past, but not as high, either:  at 
certain times of high eustatic sea level stand, a much larger percentage of the 
continents was flooded by shallow seas, giving rise to what are called epeiric seas 
or epicontinental seas.  For example, during the Cretaceous, the greater part of the 
area of North America was covered with water!  Today we have no models for 
such vast shallow seas—so reconstruction and interpretation of depositional 
environments is hindered by the impossibility of studying them in the modern.       
3.1.3  It stands to reason that shelf deposits are generally coarser than deep 
marine deposits, because coarse sediments (sands and gravels) delivered to the 
shoreline by rivers, or derived by coastal erosion, need strong currents for 
dispersal, and such strong currents are generally restricted to shallow water, where 
the tides and the winds can cause strong water movements throughout the water 
column.  (Sediment gravity flows, are a notable exception to this generalization.) 
 
3.2  Hydrodynamic Classification of Coasts 
 
3.2.1  Coasts can usefully be classified in many ways, but one way that’s 
especially useful for sedimentology is by the dominant hydrodynamic effects that 
give rise to sediment-moving currents.  Here’s a list of types of coasts by 
hydrodynamics: 
 
Tide-dominated coasts.  Along coasts with a large tidal range of a few meters 
of more, strong tidal currents, often exceeding a meter per second near the bed, 
move sands and even gravels along complex transport paths governed by coastal 
and sea-floor topography.  Thick accumulations of sand can be deposited even on 
the outer shelf. 
Storm-dominated coasts.  Along coasts exposed to passage of intense storms 
(hurricanes and migratory extratropical cyclones), combinations of strong currents 
and powerful wave motions affect the sea floor now and then. 
Current-dominated coasts.  Some coasts lie in the path of the margins of 
major deep-ocean currents, which produce steady movement of coastal sediment 
parallel to the coastline. 
Wave-dominated coasts.  Along some coasts, the strongest water movements 
are nothing more than oscillatory flows produced by impingement of swell from 
distant ocean storms.  This has a strong effect on beaches, where the large waves 
finally break, but much less effect on offshore areas of the shelf.   
Of these four types, the first two, tide-dominated and storm-dominated, are the 
most important in the sediment record. 

 

 272

3.3  Deposits of Tide-Dominated Coasts 
 
3.3.1  Two things you should know about tidal currents are that: 
 
•   in nearshore areas (and in offshore areas too, if there's any large-scale 
relief) tidal currents tend to be channelized into largely bidirectional 
currents rather than rotary, as tidal dynamics would predict, and 
•   such bidirectional tidal currents almost always show some degree of 
asymmetry, in that the flow in one direction is stronger than the flow in the 
other direction during the tidal cycle.   

 
3.3.2  These two facts together imply that sand deposits shaped by tidal 
currents tend to show one-way cross-stratification—especially because sediment 
transport rate is such a steeply increasing function of current strength.  The 
moderately high current velocities, together with the fairly deep water depths, lead 
to large-scale cross stratification, ranging from planar-tabular (resulting from 
movement of 2D dunes) to trough (resulting from movement of 3D dunes).  Dunes 
in modern tidal currents can be up to tens of meters high; set thickness in ancient 
sands thought to be of tidal origin are usually less, but in some cases can be up to 
several meters, or even more. 
3.3.3  Several special features of cross stratification produced by tidal 
currents are characteristic: 
 
Herringbone cross stratification (Figure 10-10):  It seems logical that if 
currents reverse, then the cross stratification produced by bed forms moving under 
the influence of the reversing current should show vertical sequences with cross 
sets dipping opposite each other.  And that’s true, especially on fairly small scales 
of up to a few decimeters within the deposits of larger bed forms that on average 
move in one direction.  But beware of making such an interpretation just on the 
basis of an outcrop face that seems to show 180° reversal of current direction:  
usually in such cases, the angular difference is much less, and the visual effect is 
caused by the section view.

 273

Reactivation surfaces (Figure 10-11):  the time-varying flow strength can 
cause periodic degradation and then reconstruction of the crests of large bed 
forms, resulting in characteristic internal truncation surfaces called reactivation 
surfaces.  Beware of automatically making a tidal interpretation, however, 
because similar reactivation surface can be produced by changes in bed-form 
geometry in a flow that’s steady in the large, probably because of the mutual 
interactions among neighboring bed forms in a train of inherently changeable bed 
forms.

wise cross section through a subaqueous dune, showing a

Tidal bundles (Figure 10-12):  The two-week spring–neap cycle causes 
substantial periodic changes in tidal current velocities, and, a fortiori, sediment 
transport rates.  A large tidal dune that feels effectively one-way flow and sand 
movement might therefore be expected to show different surface features at 
different times in the spring–neap cycle.  This spring–neap inequality is great 
enough in many cases that sand movement is strong during the spring part of the 
cycle but ceases entirely during the neap part of the cycle, causing the dune to be 
draped or mantled with finer sediment, most but not necessarily all of which is 
stripped from the dune surface during the spring part of the cycle.  The resulting 
cyclic interbedding of sand and mud, especially on the lower and middle parts of 
the lee sides of the dunes, is called tidal bundling, and is considered to be 
definitive evidence of tidal origin.

3.3.4  Tidal deposition is just as important, and probably more so, in 
protected nearshore environments than on the open shelf.  There will be more to 
say in a later section about tidal deposits in protected environments. 
 
3.4  Deposits of Storm-Dominated Coasts 
 
3.4.1  On shelves unaffected by really strong water movements except during 
occasional strong storms, one might expect that most areas, except fairly near 
shore, would be floored by mud.  Think of that mud as the normal quiet-water 
deposit, building up very slowly by fallout from suspension during long periods 
between unusually large storms.  Many deposits interpreted as offshore shelf 
deposits show only such muds.  The sediment may be well stratified, or it may be 
partly or entirely homogenized by bioturbation.   
3.4.2  Many shelf sequences show an interbedding of quiet-water muds and 
sand beds interpreted to be event beds deposited by major, even catastrophic 
storm-generated flow events in which enormous quantities of sand, usually very 
fine to fine, are transported from sites nearer shore and spread as an extensive 
mantle over shelf muds.  These sand beds characteristically show hummocky cross 
stratification, suggesting strong and complex oscillatory flows.  The sand beds 
may be amalgamated, especially in areas nearer shore, where the frequency of 
strong bottom water movements is greater than farther offshore. 
3.4.3  The nature of the sand-transporting currents and the mechanisms and 
site of sand entrainment by the current are still controversial:   
•  Some people are believers in shelf turbidity currents.  In this view, great 
masses of sediment and water are mobilized at the shoreline during certain major 
storms, perhaps by liquefaction caused by cyclic loading by storm waves, and then 
move offshore as a density underflow.   
•  Other people deny the existence of such shelf turbidity currents, and appeal 
instead to a kind of current that might be called a storm-surge-relaxation 
current, whereby water piled against the coast by strong winds tries to flow 
seaward, only to be turned parallel to shore by the Coriolis force.  Such shore-
parallel currents, which are in the nature of geostrophic currents, are commonly 
observed along modern shelves, and can attain speeds in excess of a meter per 
second. 
3.4.4  Various problems remain unresolved.  Here are what we consider three 
of the most difficult problems: 
 
•  How is the sand moved offshore?  
•  How can the currents carry enough sand to deposit extensive  beds that are 
in some cases over a meter thick?  

 275

•  How can the necessary unidirectional delivery of the sand be reconciled 
with the existence of sedimentary structures that seem to be produced by 
dominantly oscillatory flows? 

 
4. TIDAL FLATS 
 
 
4.1  Tidal flats occur on open coasts of low relief and relatively low energy 
and in protected areas of high-energy coasts associated with estuaries, lagoons, 
bays, and other areas lying behind barrier islands.  The conditions necessary for 
development of tidal flats include an effective tidal range and the absence of 
strong wave-induced currents. 
4.2  The extent of tidal flats along modern coastlines varies greatly and 
includes small, locally restricted areas of several hundred square meters or 
regional features extending over hundreds of square kilometers.  One of the best 
studied siliciclastic depositional environments that has extensive tidal flats is the 
coastline of the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany.  In the case of carbonates, 
the best developed tidal flats occur along the coast of the western Persian Gulf and 
on the western, leeward flank of Andros Island in the Bahamas. 
4.3  Some confusion in terminology occurs because tidal flats may carry local 
geographic names such as lagoon, bay, or salt marsh.  Studies of tidal flats became 
very popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s and helped to clarify this confusion.  
It is clear that there is great variability in tidal flats, depending on sediment types 
and availability, presence or absence of vegetation, tidal range, and coastal energy 
and morphology. 
4.4  Tidal flats are subdivided into intertidal and subtidal environments 
which control facies distribution.  Parts of the tidal flat lying between high and 
low tide range, the intertidal zone, make up the major areal extent of the tidal flat.  
If a noticeable variation in sediment type is present throughout the flat, for 
example muds and sands, the intertidal area commonly possesses alternating 
layers of both textures.  Where sand forms lenses in mud, the texture is called 
lenticular bedding, and where mud forms lenses in sand, the texture is called 
flaser bedding.  Most tidal flats have a third zone, developed above the intertidal 
zone, called the supratidal zone.  Supratidal sediments are deposited above normal 
or mean high tide and exposed to subaerial conditions most of the time because 
they are flooded only by spring and storm tides; spring tides occur twice each 
month, and storm tides, the largest of all, occur occasionally during certain 
seasons.   
4.5  Subtidal areas are important to the understanding of this environment 
because they are the part of the tidal flat most likely to be preserved.  Most tidal-
flat deposition results from lateral accretion in association with progradation of the 
flat and the point bar associated with meandering tidal channels.  Therefore, a 

 276

major part of the sedimentary record for most tidal-flat successions includes 
features associated with channel fills and tidal point bars. 
4.6  Animals and plants play a significant role in tidal-flat environments.  
They are influential in trapping sediment, forming sediment particles as fecal 
pellets, and generating biogenic sedimentary structures as a result of the processes 
of feeding, dwelling, and moving.  Tidal flats commonly preserve the details of 
sedimentary structures owing to the alternation of sand and mud layers. 
4.7  Intertidal and subtidal parts of tidal flats are continuously affected by 
tidal currents as well as wind-induced wave currents.  Current velocity can be 
highly variable in different settings of in the same area under different conditions.  
Regional and local geomorphology, tide range, and strength and direction of local 
winds are factors controlling waves and currents.  For example, consider the 
difference between the U.S. Gulf Coast, where the tidal range is less than 0.5 m 
(microtidal) and the Bay of Fundy, where a normal tide may range greater than 10 
m (macrotidal).  Mesotidal ranges are intermediate, and range from one meter to a 
few meters. 
4.8  Tidal flats that developed under progradational conditions, as in the case 
of shallowing upward cycles in carbonates, are characterized by a fining-upward 
succession, consisting of coarse sediments at the base and progressively finer 
sediments toward the top in an uninterrupted vertical sequence.  This common 
relationship reflects decreasing energy in a progression from subtidal to intertidal 
parts of the tidal flats.  Tidal channels are commonly substantially coarser than 
laterally equivalent parts of the tidal flat system.  Where best developed, facies 
progression in a vertical sequence can be represented by: (1) a dominantly sandy 
subtidal zone of channel-fill, point-bar, and shoal sediments; (2) a mixed sand and 
mud intertidal flat deposit; (3) a muddy upper intertidal flat or salt-marsh deposit. 
4.9  Certain sedimentary structures are characteristic of tidal-flat 
environments:  desiccation cracks, thin lamination, commonly disrupted to some 
extent by bioturbation, and microbial laminites, often with fenestrae (owing to the 
exclusion of grazing snails in the tidal zone, microbial communities are free to 
flourish), and intraclasts. 
 

5. BARRIER ISLAND, BEACH, AND LAGOON ENVIRONMENTS 
 
 
5.1  Introduction 
 
5.1.1  Wave-dominated sandy shorelines in interdeltaic and nondeltaic 
coastal regions are characterized by elongate, shore-parallel sand deposits.  
Barriers and beaches are prominent depositional features of modern coasts, and 
sandstone bodies of similar origin are represented in the stratigraphic record.  In 
contrast to rivers and deltas, the geometry of barrier islands is molded almost 
entirely by marine processes.   

 277

5.1.2  For our purposes, barriers are defined as sandy islands or peninsulas 
elongate parallel with the shore and separated from the mainland by lagoons or 
marshes.  Some major environments associated with barrier island systems are: (1) 
beach and shoreface environments on the seaward side of barriers and strand 
plains, (2) inlet channels and tidal deltas, separating barriers laterally, and (3) 
washover fans on the landward or lagoonward side of barriers.  Seaward or 
longshore migration of these environments results in facies successions 
constituting much of the volume of many coastal sand bodies.  For example, the 
emergent parts of many barrier-island successions are often underlain by 
progradational beach and shoreface facies. 

 
5.2 Beach and Shoreface Deposits 
   
5.2.1  Successions formed by the seaward progradation of beach and 
shoreface (nearshore) deposits account for a major part of the volume of Holocene 
barriers and strandplains.  One famous example is Galveston Island, located along 
the Texas portion of the U.S. Gulf Coast.   
5.2.2  The beach is commonly divided into a backshore, which consists of a 
nearly level berm, and a foreshore, which slopes seaward from the berm edge or 
crest.  The foreshore includes the beachface and, on some beaches, one or more 
elongate bars and intervening troughs called ridge-and-runnel systems.  The 
shoreface, as is commonly thought of, extends from the beach offshore to a depth 
of 5 to 20 m, where there is commonly a change of gradient from the gently 
sloping shoreface to the nearly level shelf. 
5.2.3  Sediment transport on the beach and shoreface is dominated by waves 
and wave-induced currents, although tidal currents may be locally important near 
tidal inlets and estuaries.  As waves move toward the shore they begin to “feel 
bottom” on the seafloor near the base of the shoreface, become progressively 
oversteepened, and collapse to form breakers on the upper shoreface.  As the surf 
runs up the beach, it forms a thin rush of water called the swash, followed by an 
even thinner return flow called the backwash.  When waves approach the 
shoreline with an oblique orientation, one direction of longshore current 
predominates.  Sand is transported very rapidly along shore under such conditions, 
a situation which no jetty can help remedy. 
5.2.4  Beachface and foreshore deposits commonly consist of low-angle, 
seaward dipping, planar lamination, formed by the swash–backwash process, 
which occur as wedge-shaped sets (Figure 10-13).  Upper-shoreface deposits are 
commonly highly variable, owing to the extremely complex hydraulic 
environment of the surf zone.  Such a regime gives rise to a complex sequence of 
multidirectional sedimentary structures and variable sediment textures 
characteristic of these deposits.  Gravels are often concentrated in this zone, 
because of winnowing of finer-grained deposits.  Trough cross bedding is also 
developed, but low-angle bidirectional planar cross-bedded sets and subhorizontal 

 278

plane beds may also occur.  The lower shoreface may include abundant plane 
beds, wave-oscillation ripples, intercalated with finer silty or muddy layers.  
However, structures are commonly obliterated by bioturbation.

5.3 Tidal-Inlet Deposits 
   
5.4.1  Tidal inlets are more or less permanent passages between barrier 
islands that allow tidal exchange between the open sea and lagoons, bays, and tidal 
marshes behind the islands.  Inlet channels are generally deepest between the tips 
of the islands and shallow into tidal deltas both lagoonward (flood delta) and 
seaward (ebb delta).  The length of barrier is commonly increased by accretion 
along the tip of one island and erosion of the tip of the adjacent island.  Lateral 
accretion results in growth of spits.   
5.4.2  The spacing of tidal inlets is closely correlated with tidal range.  As 
you might expect, macrotidal zones produce barrier-island systems with many 
inlets, whereas microtidal regimes generate very continuous barriers, as along the 
U.S. Gulf Coast.  Also, the wave energy of the coastline determines whether or not 
ebb tidal deltas are as well developed as flood tidal deltas.  The higher the energy, 
the more destructive the system, and the less likely that an ebb tidal delta 
projecting out into the open ocean is developed. 

 279

5.4.3  Tidal inlets migrate laterally as the spit on the end of a barrier island 
grows.  The thickness of sediments deposited by migration of tidal inlets and 
associated environments may be as great as the depth of the tidal channel itself 
(Figure 10-14).

5.4.4  Sedimentary structures in tidal inlets are often very complex, owing to 
the alternating flow directions created  during one tidal cycle (Figure 10-15).  
There is much variability among different tidal channel complexes that have been 
studied.  However, there is some evidence that in the deeper parts of channels, say 
below about 4–5 m, sands are coarsest and characterized by mainly ebb-oriented, 
tabular, planar cross strata, with reactivation surfaces formed by flood-oriented 
tidal currents.  Sands of the channel margin have trough-shaped sets of cross strata 
formed by both flood-oriented and ebb-oriented dunes, as well as large foresets 
formed by the lateral migration of the spit.  The uppermost part of the channel 
profile is flattest and exhibits swash stratification, similar to the beachface, but 
oriented generally along the longshore dip direction.

5.4 Lagoonal Deposits  
 
5.5.1  Lagoonal successions commonly contain interbedded sandstone, shale, 
siltstone, and coal facies characteristic of a number of overlapping depositional 
environments.  Sand facies include washover sheet deposits and sheet and 
channel-fill deposits of flood-tidal-delta origin.  Fine-grained sediments include 
those of the lagoon and tidal flats, which are situated adjacent to the barrier or on 
the landward side of the lagoon abutting the hinterland marsh and swamp 
flatlands. 
5.5.2  Generally the lagoon is fed with marine waters that run through the 
numerous channels in the barrier-island system.  However, where lagoons are 
developed adjacent to rivers and estuaries, lagoonal waters may often be brackish 
to nearly fresh. 
5.5.3  Because of the inherent low energy of most lagoons (little current 
activity of any kind), fine-grained sediments are common.  Often lagoons are the 
site of prolific production of plants and burrowing organisms that feed on the 
decaying organic matter.  As a result, lagoonal sediments are rich in organics, are 
highly bioturbated, and may form coal seams in the geologic record. 
5.5.4  Other than the sands that are swept into the lagoon adjacent to ebb tidal 
deltas, the only dominant source of sand is from the growth of washover fans 
(Figure 10-16).  These form during storms, when water is piled up against the 
beachface on the oceanic side of the barrier island.  Commonly, the barrier island 
is breached at low points between the dune fields that form the top of the island, 
the water pours through and entrains abundant sand en route to flushing it through 
to the lagoon.  Over the course of several storms, washover fans may actually 
prograde out into the lagoon.
