THE NATURE, DESCRIPTION, AND 
CLASSIFICATION OF SEDIMENTS 
 
 
 
1.  SIZE 
 
1.1 Introduction 
1.1.1  If all sedimentary particles had the shape of regular geometrical solids, 
like a sphere or a triaxial ellipsoid or a square, both the concept and the 
measurement of grain size would be straightforward.  But sedimentary particles 
are almost always irregularly shaped.   
1.1.2  Some sand grains are almost perfect spheres, and many well rounded 
pebbles can be approximated well by triaxial ellipsoids, which are described by 
the lengths of the longest (a), shortest (c), and intermediate (b) major axes (Figure 
1-1).  But most sediment particles are so irregular that at best they can be 
represented only approximately in this way.  The problem is worst with very fine 
particles.  We thus run immediately into the difficulty of what we mean by the size 
of a representative sedimentary particle.   

1.1.3  In theory, a good way out of this problem is to characterize the size of 
the particle by its nominal diameter, the size of the sphere with volume equal to 
that of the given particle.  This is a nice concept, but it’s hard to put into practice. 
(How would you measure the nominal diameter of a given sedimentary particle?)   
1.1.4  So there’s no single unique dimension we can measure readily that 
would suffice to characterize the size of the particle.  We get around this in two 
ways, principally: 
 

1 

•  Let our choice of characteristic dimension be operationally defined.  
That is, how we measure size defines what we mean by size.  The standard way of 
measuring size in the coarser-grained rocks (coarser siltstones and upwards, above 
several tens of microns) is by sieving.  How does a sieve discriminate by size?  It 
more or less chooses the largest dimension in the least cross-sectional area.  This 
might not seem like a very satisfactory measure of size, but remember that most 
sediment grains coarser than clay size are equigranular, and so exactly how we 
discriminate is not too important as long as it is standardized.   
•  Relate size to some other more easily measurable property.    The 
standard way of measuring fine-grained material is by settling.  (The size of sand-
size material is often measured this way, too, in devices called settling tubes.)  For 
small spheres there’s an exact solution for settling rate.  The difficulties of 
nonsphericity are even greater for clay-size sediment particles than for sand, but 
because there’s no other way, we assume that they are spheres for the sake of 
definiteness. 
  
1.1.5  All you need to know about fluid dynamics in order to use it for size 
measurement is this: 
 

for a particle of a given shape exposed to a steady and 
uniform flow of fluid around it, the drag force exerted 
by the fluid depends on the velocity of flow, the size of 
the sphere, and the fluid properties density and 
viscosity. 
 
   1.1.6  When you release a particle in a body of still water, the particle 
accelerates in response to the downward force of its weight, and the drag force 
builds up until it balances the weight; then the particle settles at its terminal 
settling velocity (Figure 1-2).

1.1.7  For a given fluid, like water, this means that there is a function that 
relates size to velocity.  Once the function is known, all you have to do is measure 
the settling velocity, go to a curve or table, and find the size.  There are exact 
solutions for this function only for small particles with a few regular shapes, like 
spheres or triaxial ellipsoids, but all you really need to know is the empirical 
function.  Figure 1-3 shows a cartoon of this function; it's only qualitatively 
correct.  For a real version, see the next chapter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1-3: Cartoon version of 
 
 
1.1.8  The trouble with this approach is that particle shape varies all over the 
place.  One way around this is to develop empirical functions for a wide range of 
shapes, but this isn’t very workable because there are so many shapes.  What’s 
usually done is to work with the fall diameter or sedimentation diameter:  the 
diameter of a quartz sphere with the same settling velocity as the given particle, in 
a standard fluid (water) at a standard temperature (20° C).   
1.1.9  So when it comes to measuring size, we have to live with an imperfect 
world.  What’s done in actual practice for the various size ranges is as follows: 
 
gravel:  usually sieving, or for special studies, direct measurement with 
calipers; the coarsest sizes usually aren’t even measured. 
sand:  sieving is the standard method, but various kinds of settling tubes are 
also in common use. 
mud:  down to about 40–50 μm, sieving (wet sieving is better in the fine 
sizes), and for all mud sizes, settling techniques. 
 
1.1.10  These techniques work only for unconsolidated sediment.  What do 
we do to measure grain size in rocks?  Typically, cut a thin section, measure sizes 
with a micrometer ocular, and then make a point count at the same time to get the 
distribution.  The obvious difficulty with this is that the sectioning usually doesn’t 
cut through the center of the particle.  There have been studies, both theoretical 
 3

and empirical, aimed at getting around that problem  If the rock is not too 
indurated, gentle disaggregation and then sieving is often possible. 
   
 
1.2  Grade Scales 
1.2.1  It’s natural to split up the continuum of sizes into conventional 
divisions, to facilitate both communication and thought.  Such a split is called a 
grade scale.  Several grade scales are in use, depending upon field of study and 
where you’re working.  English-speaking sedimentologists use the Udden-
Wentworth grade scale, built around powers of two.  It’s a geometric or 
logarithmic rather than an arithmetic scale.  (This is desirable for largely obvious 
by partly inexplicable reasons.)   
1.2.2  It’s easiest to work directly with a linear or arithmetic measure of the 
log scale rather than the logs of the actual sizes.  For this reason, the famous 
(infamous?) phi scale was introduced:

1.3  Statistical Analysis of Particle Size 
1.3.1  Statistics is an important part of sedimentology.  A great many 
variables sedimentologists measure and deal with are random variables, in that 
why they take a given value seems to be random, even though there may be 
underlying laws we can’t sort out.  You have to deal with these variables 
statistically.  Sediment size is only one example of such a random variable.  What 
follows is a brief account of the statistics of random variables applied to 
sedimentology.

(1.2) 

1.3.2  For a given sediment, why do we see the percentages we see in each of 
the class intervals or fractions?  Usually we can’t answer that, but we can at least 
develop a rational way of describing what we have.   
1.3.3  The raw data, obtained from size measurement by sieving or settling 
analysis, is usually in the form of weight percent of total sample in each of the 
various size classes defined by the grade scale.  These percentages add up to 
100%.  (If they don’t quite add up to 100% when you make the measurements, 
just distribute the small error among all the fractions to make the total come out to 
100%.)   
1.3.4  Probably the most important size characteristic of a sediment is the 
“average” size.  A natural way of expressing this is the mean size.  (But there are 
other ways; see below.)  The mean of a number of values is defined as 
 
M = Σx
N     
 
where x is a value and N is the number of values.  The mean of grouped data (the 
kind we get in sediment size analysis, by either sieving or settling) is 
 
M = Σ(f x')
N       
 
where f is frequency in a class, x' is class midpoint, and N is number of values. 
1.3.5  The most meaningful mean in our case is the logarithmic mean. You 
get it by: 
 
using the phi values of the midpoints of the class intervals, 
multiplying these phi values by the frequencies in the size classes,  
summing over all the values, and  
dividing by the number of values. 
 
Then you can get the mean size by converting from phi to mm.   
1.3.6  One problem with the mean is that the tails of the size distribution, 
which are hard to measure accurately (fine stuff gets lost; big stuff is too “lumpy” 
statistically) have a strong effect on the computation. 
1.3.7  You also need a measure of how clustered or spread out the 
distribution is around the mean. This idea is expressed by the word dispersion.  
Dispersion expresses the sorting of the sediment:  a sediment whose sizes tend to 
fall near the mean is said to be well sorted (or, in engineering terminology, poorly 
graded; engineering usage is opposite to sedimentological usage!), and a sediment 
whose sizes range widely around the mean is said to be poorly sorted. 
1.3.8  Here’s the best way to find the true standard deviation σ:

1.3.9  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, the sum of 
the squares of deviations of frequencies in each class interval from the mean, 
divided by the number of values.  Again this is most easily done using the phi 
scale.  We have the same problem here as with the mean:  the tails of the 
distribution are important. 
1.3.10  In theory we could also compute the so-called higher moments of the 
distribution.  (The mean and variance are the first two moments of the 
distribution.)  Although I don’t expect you to make use of it, here’s the expression 
for pth moment of the distribution: 
 
∑

m p =
N
 1.3.11  What do these higher moments mean?  It turns out that an expression 
involving the second and third moments describes the degree of asymmetry of the 
distribution (skewness), and an expression involving the second and fourth 
moments describes the ratio between the spread in the middle part of the 
distribution and the spread in the tails (kurtosis).  Figure 1-5 shows them, just for 
your reference.

1.3.12  Skewness seems to be sedimentologically significant, but the 
significance of kurtosis is unclear.  With these higher-moment measures, errors in 
sampling and measurement get highly magnified.  For meaningful and 
reproducible results, standardized and calibrated sieves at narrow size intervals 
 
have to be used. 
 
1.4  Graphing Size Distributions 
1.4.1  How do you express graphically the data of size analysis?  The 
simplest way, but not the most meaningful, is to plot a histogram, a vertical bar 
graph of weight of sediment sample by size classes (Figure 1-6).  Obviously, the 
heights of the bars depends on the size of the sample you use.

  1.4.2  Or, you could normalize the histogram by plotting percent of total 
weight vs. size class interval (Figure 1-7).  Then, no matter how large or small the 
class interval, the total area under the histogram bars is unity (100%).

1.4.3  But still the height of the bars varies with the fineness of division of 
the size scale.  Better yet: make the vertical axis be weight percent divided by size 
interval.  Then the overall course of the tops of the bars is the same regardless of 
 
the fineness of subdivision (Figure 1-8).

 1.4.4  As you progressively decrease the size class interval, the bars get 
thinner, but the overall shape and size of the histogram stays the same.  This is 
best visualized in a vertical line graph, with data plotted as vertical lines from the 
midpoints of the class intervals (Figure 1-9).  This kind of graph also lends itself 
better to thinking about a limiting process.

  1.4.5  This suggests the possibility of performing a limiting process to 
obtain a smooth curve from the histogram: as the number of class intervals 
increases without limit, does the stepped curve connecting the tops of the vertical 
lines tend toward a smooth curve?  In principle, NO, because there are only a 
finite number of sand grains in a sample, and “most” sizes are missing.  Past a 
certain point in the fineness of subdivision the histogram blows up and does funny 
things.   

1.4.6  But this is being overly pedantic; you don’t need to worry about this 
operationally unless you have only a very small number of grains to work with.  
You have to assume that your dependent variable, weight of sample in a given size 
class, which is quasi-continuous on a large scale but definitely discrete on a small 
scale, is actually a continuous variable.  If you performed the limiting process for a 
 
smoothly continuous variable, you would get a limiting continuous curve toward 
8

which the successively finer histograms would tend.  This is called the frequency 
distribution curve or frequency distribution function (Figure 1-10).

1.4.7  The physical meaning of the vertical coordinate is seen most clearly by 
considering two different sizes and saying that the percent of the total sample 
between these two sizes is gotten by integrating the frequency distribution 
function between the size limits chosen (i.e., find the area under the frequency 
 
curve between these two sizes).

1.4.8  There’s no easy way to find the frequency distribution directly.  It 
might occur to you to plot the histogram and then fit a smooth curve through the 
tops of the histogram bars.  But that provides only a crude estimate of the 
frequency distribution, unless you make the number of class intervals unworkably 
large.  The way sedimentologists get around this problem is to work with a 
different kind of distribution, called the cumulative distribution.   
1.4.9  Both the concept and the practice of the cumulative distribution are 
fairly simple.  Suppose that you have sieved a sample of sand and have weight 
percents for each size class.  You can easily accumulate your data by computing a 
running cumulative total that gives you weight percent finer than (it could also be 
weight percent coarser than) for each size class boundary.  Then plot a graph with 
weight percent finer than (arithmetically) on the vertical axis and size 
(logarithmically, or, what’s the same, arithmetically in phi units) on the horizontal 
axis.  You get a curve that starts at zero at the finest size in your sample and 
increases (monotonically!) to one hundred percent at the coarsest size in your 
sample (Figure 1-11).  The curve is usually at least crudely S-shaped, as in the 
figure.

1.4.10  The nice thing about the cumulative curve is that it’s easy to find just 
by plotting the cumulative data points and fitting a smooth curve.  By sieving your 
same sample using several different stacks of sieves, with different size class 
boundaries, you could demonstrate to yourself that the curve you get is almost 
insensitive to the particular choice of size intervals.     
  
1.4.11  Following up on Equation 1.7, the cumulative distribution function 
can be written as the following definite integral:

 The frequency curve and the cumulative curve are thus related as derivative and 
integral.  Figure 1-12 shows the correspondence between the frequency curve and 
the cumulative curve.  Both are useful and common in size analysis, as in many 
other applications of statistics.

1.4.11  The frequency curve is not as easy to obtain as the cumulative curve.  
You have to resort to things like graphical differentiation, or approximation of  the 
cumulative curve by an analytical function (polynomial, power series, Fourier 
series, etc.) and then differentiation at various points.  This used to be tedious 
before the advent of computers, but now it’s easy.  Various standard programs 
have been developed.  This isn’t something we’ll pursue here.   
 
 
1.5  More on the "Average" 
1.5.1  In light of the frequency curve and cumulative curve, here’s more 
detail the average (or the so-called “central tendency”, in the parlance of statistics) 
of a size distribution.  I’ve already defined the mean, but in addition to the mean, 
two other measures of the average properties of the distribution can easily be 
obtained from the cumulative and frequency curves. 
  
Mean:  On the frequency curve, the mean size is that for which the center of 
gravity of the area under the curve lies.  On the cumulative curve, it’s the point at 
which there are equal areas, above and below, out to the limits of the distribution. 
Median:  The size that cuts the distribution in half, 50% finer, 50% coarser.  On 
the frequency curve, it’s the point at which there are equal areas on each side; on 
the cumulative curve, it’s the point at which the curve crosses the 50% figure. 
Mode:  The most abundant size in the distribution.  On the frequency curve, this is 
the highest point.  On the cumulative curve, it’s the point at which the curve has 
the steepest slope. 
   
1.5.2  It’s hard to say which measure is the most significant.  The median is 
the easiest to find but probably the least valuable. 
 
 
1.6  Analytical Distributions 
1.6.1  To what extent are actual size distributions approximated by analytical 
distributions?  It is commonly assumed that sediment size distributions tend to be 
normally (Gaussian) distributed.  Figure 1-13 shows the familiar bell curve of the 
normal distribution.  And here’s the equation for the normal distribution:

⎡

of the distribution.

1.6.2  Properties of the normal distribution: 
 
•  Symmetrical about the mean; 
•  Distribution extends to +∞ and -∞,      → 0 asymptotically; 
•  68% of distribution lies between ± one standard deviation of the mean; this 
is at 16th and 84th percentiles.  The inflection points in the frequency distribution 
are at these points. 
 
1.6.3  A great many sedimentological variables tend to be normally 
distributed.  (Or, more precisely, lognormally.) There’s usually no evident reason 
why, and it’s rarely exactly so.  It seems to turn out that many if not most natural 
sands have a long straight-line segment on a graph like this, with tails that curve 
away.   
1.6.4  Size distributions are commonly plotted on graph paper (called 
probability paper) with the frequency axis rubber-sheeted so that a normal 
distribution plots as a straight line (Figure 1-14).  This has become a reference 
standard.

1.6.5  Some sediments have two peaks on the size-frequency curve; these are 
called bimodal distributions, in contrast to the more common unimodal 
 
distributions (Figure 1-15).  They are fairly common.  Usually one of the maxima

                   1.7.1  The size of material in a sediment is governed by two things, basically:
                            •  the size of material available, and 
•  what has happened during transportation and deposition (complicated).

 If only fine material is available, even an energetic transporting medium won’t
have sand or gravel to transport.  One of the firmest interpretations we can make in
 
sedimentology is that the presence of a sand deposit indicates a relatively energetic 
 
transporting medium, and a gravel deposit, even more so.  (Assuming that the
           material really was deposited, and is not weathered in place.) 

13

1.7.2  In many river systems it’s observed that sediment size decreases 
progressively downstream.  (This is called downstream fining.)  Why?  
Possibilities: 
 
•  permanent storage (sometimes certainly the case, sometimes certainly not 
the case), together with size-selective deposition..  Laboratory experiments have 
shown that this can be a substantial effect, at least under certain conditions.  It 
makes sense, too, from the standpoint that the coarser particles are likely to be the 
ones that are preferentially extracted from the through-going sediment to be 
deposited. 
•  All particles are transported start to finish, all are progressively abraded.  
This certainly happens to some extent in gravel-size material, but there must be 
other factors involved too; it's unlikely that a boulder is continuously reduced to a 
sand grain.  Probably much more important is:  
•  fracturing of coarser particles to form lots of fine particles.  Also probably 
important in some if not most cases:  
•  weathering of sedimentary material as it resides in temporary alluvial 
deposits awaiting further downstream transport (but this probably doesn’t affect 
quartz debris very much).  Also important in many cases:  
•  dilution by fine material from tributaries. 
 
1.7.3   A case could be made for nature providing us with three dominant 
sediment sizes: gravel, sand and coarse silt, and clay, resulting respectively from 
breaking along joints and bedding planes, granular disintegration and abrasion, 
and chemical decomposition.  Many have proposed that there are indeed two 
distinct gaps or dearths in natural size distributions, around 2 mm and at several 
microns.   
1.7.4  Mean size is seldom in the range 1–4 mm, and the feeling is that 
there’s an absolute volumetric deficiency of this size (but this isn’t easy to prove). 
Also, some have claimed to recognize a break around the medium to coarse silt 
size.  What might be the reasons for the suspected gaps? 
 
•  not produced by rock disintegration or decomposition;  
•  less stable chemically or mechanically in weathering and transportation. 
 
It’s also possible that hydraulic effects cause some sizes to be scarce as modal 
sizes, although volumetrically no less abundant overall.  
1.7.5  In summary, I think it’s fair to say that although sediment size must 
have great potential for interpreting the origin and deposition of sediments, it has 
not yet become useful, because we don’t yet fully understand its controls.

2.  SHAPE 
 
2.1  Introduction 
2.1.1  The other important textural aspect of individual grains is shape.  
Sedimentologists have for a long time made a point of drawing a fundamental 
distinction between two different aspects of shape: 
 
 shape (sensu stricto):  the whole-particle aspect of shape; this is usually 
viewed with reference to a sphere, so it’s termed sphericity. 
roundness:  the local aspect of shape, involving the sharpness, or lack 
thereof, of edges and corners. 
 
 
2.2  Sphericity 
2.2.1  It would be nice to have a unique and well-defined shape parameter 
that can be assigned to any sediment particle.  One good way of doing this is to 
work from some reference shape.  A sphere is often considered to be the best such 
reference shape, because it’s claimed that the limiting shape assumed by 
homogeneous and isotropic rock and mineral grains upon prolonged abrasion is a 
sphere.  (But I’m not really sure this is true.) 
2.2.2  Sphericity is defined as the ratio of the nominal diameter of the 
particle to the diameter of the circumscribed sphere.  A sphere has a sphericity of 
one, and particles of all other shapes have sphericities less than one. 
2.2.3  You can imagine, however, the difficulties of measuring the sphericity 
of a large number of sedimentary particles according to this definition—especially 
tiny sand grains! 
2.2.4  Another trouble with sphericity is that it doesn’t distinguish among 
different nonspherical shapes.  A more specific thing to do is compare the shape of 
the particle to that of a triaxial ellipsoid.  This might still seem very artificial to 
you, but lots of fairly well rounded sediment particles don’t deviate greatly from 
triaxial ellipsoids.   
2.2.5  Figure 1-17 shows the standard and time-honored way of classifying 
particle shapes with reference to triaxial ellipsoids (or their equivalents in terms of 
rectangular solids).  It was first proposed by Zingg, so the graph is called a Zingg 
diagram.  It’s based on the three ratios of the principal axes of the triaxial 
ellipsoid: 
 

L (or a):   Long axis 
I (or b):    Intermediate axis 
S (or c):   Short axis

2.2.6  When you try measuring the long, intermediate, and short axes of real 
sediment particles for yourself, you’ll find some ambiguity in defining these axes 
for irregular particles.  What’s usually done is to define L as the longest dimension 
through the particle, I as the longest dimension through the particle and 
perpendicular to L (but not necessarily intersecting L), and S as the longest 
dimension perpendicular to both L and I (but not necessarily passing through 
either L or I).  In practice this works fairly well except for really weird shapes.   
2.2.7  The Zingg diagram (or its more recent refinements) is about the best 
that can be done for description, but it still doesn’t deal adequately with the 
hydrodynamic aspects of shape.  It would be nice to have a measure of shape that 
correlates well with the settling behavior of the particles.   
2.2.8  A sediment particle has a strong tendency to fall with its largest cross 
section approximately horizontal, for reasons having to do with the distribution of 
fluid pressure over the surface of the particle.  The resistance to fall is governed by 
the difference in fluid pressure between the front (downward-facing) and back 
(upward-facing) surfaces and therefore by the largest cross-sectional area of the 
particle.  On the other hand,  the weight of the particle, which is the driving force 
 
for the settling in the first place, is proportional to the volume of the particle. 
17

2.2.9  With this physics as a basis,  Sneed and Folk long ago proposed 
something called the Maximum Projection Sphericity (MPS).  It’s defined as the 
ratio of the maximum cross-sectional area of the volume-equivalent sphere to the 
maximum cross-sectional area of the particle itself.  For a triaxial ellipsoid, here's 
the mathematics: 
Maximum cross-sectional area of particle: 
π
4  LI 
Volume of particle: 
π
6  LIS 
Diameter of volume-equivalent sphere:

Maximum cross-sectional area of volume-equivalent sphere:

π
Maximum Projection Sphericity: 
3 S2
4 ( 3 LIS) 2/π
4  LI = 
π
LI    
(1.10) 
2.2.10  For a wide variety of regular shapes, there’s a far better correlation 
between the MPS and settling velocity than between the sphericity defined above 
and settling velocity. 

    
 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
2.3  Roundness 
2.3.1  Roundness has to do with the sharpness of edges and corners of a rock 
or mineral particle, and is almost entirely independent of shape defined above. 
2.3.2  The official definition of roundness is this: the ratio of average radius 
of curvature of edges and corners to the radius of the largest inscribed sphere.  A 
much more convenient alternative is to use the average radius of curvature of the 
corners of the projected grain image, and an even easier alternative is to use the 
radius of curvature of the single sharpest corner around the projected grain image. 
2.3.3  But as you can easily imagine, even with simplifications this definition 
of roundness presents a formidable challenge to the measurer.  When it’s actually 
done, it’s done by projecting or enlarging a grain image, fitting radii somehow, 
measuring, and computing.  With the advent of high technology, one can use all 
sorts of automated border-tracing programs to speed things up enormously, but 
measurement of roundness still is not (and may never be) a standard 
sedimentological procedure. 
2.3.4  Traditionally a series of five qualitative roundness grades has been 
used:  angular, subangular, subrounded, rounded, and well rounded.  Here are 
word descriptions of these grades: 
 
 18

angular:  little evidence of wear; edges and corners sharp 
subangular:  some evidence of wear; edges and corners rounded to some 
extent; original faces only slightly modified 
subrounded:  considerable wear; edges and corners rounded; area or 
original faces reduced 
rounded:  original edges and corners smoothed to broad curves; original 
faces almost gone; original shape still apparent 
well rounded:  no original edges, corners or faces; original shape only 
suggested by present shape 

But nobody actually applies these descriptions directly.  What one does is use an 
outline comparison chart.  They even sell little plastic cards, called grain-shape 
comparators, which you can carry with you in the field to use when you’re 
examining grains in a hand specimen with a hand lens, or when you’re looking at 
a loose sediment with a hand lens or through a microscope.    

2.3.5  What might shape and roundness of a sedimentary particle depend on? 

•  Original shape and roundness upon production (crystallization; fracture) 
•  Inherent nature of material (crystal habit; mineral/rock cleavage; abrasional 
anisotropy; fracture anisotropy) 
•  Nature of weathering 
  
•  Transport processes:  distance, mode, medium (abrasion; corrosion; 
breakage) 

 
2.3.6  And don’t forget about the possibility of shape-selective deposition, 
mentioned earlier in connection with downstream fining.  That would affect the 
aggregate shape and roundness properties of transported aggregates of grains, even 
though the shapes of individual sediment particles didn’t change during transport.   
2.3.7  The shape and roundness of clasts (mainly sand and gravel particles) 
have always been thought to hold great potential value for interpreting the source, 
transportation, and deposition of sediments.  But there aren’t many definitely 
established facts.  One would like to know the answers to such important 
questions as: 
 
•  Do beach pebbles differ in shape from river pebbles? 
•  Does wind round grains more effectively than water? 
•  What is the lower size limit (if any) for rounding by wind or water? 
•  Can quartz grains be rounded in one sedimentary cycle (and if so, how)? 
 
Despite lots of effort, so far there are only mixed results on the answers.  There’s a 
large literature on these matters, but I won’t summarize it here.  Suffice it to say 
 
that shape studies have so far not been any more useful than size studies in 
interpreting sediments.

3.  OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE TEXTURE OF DETRITAL 
SEDIMENTS 

3.1  As I hope you know already, the word texture is used in a very specific 
way in sedimentology:  it refers to geometry on the scale of the constituent 
particles.  Two of the most important aspects of texture, size and shape, we’ve 
dealt with already.  The other important aspect of texture comes under the term 
packing or fabric:  the mutual arrangement of grains in the deposit.  This brief but 
important section outlines some things about what might be termed the granular 
organization of detrital sediments and sedimentary rocks. 
3.2  The most natural assumption to make is that the detrital particles are 
originally deposited in a gravitationally stable framework; that is, each grain 
comes to rest on others below and is held there by its own weight.  In aggregate, 
the grains are thus all in mutual contact. 

3.3  Figure 1-20 is a cross-sectional view of a granular deposit.  It’s what a 
thin section of the deposit would look like if you impregnated the deposit with 
something to make it rigid and then cut a thin section.  In such a section, you 
won’t see many actual grain contacts.   

 

 

 
3.4  A simple geometrical property of such a packing arrangement is the 
porosity, defined as the volume of voids divided by the bulk volume for some 
volume of the sediment large enough to be representative (i.e., containing a large 
number of grains).  A somewhat more complicated but no less important property 
is the permeability, which describes the ease with which fluids can be forced 
through the porous sediment or rock under the influence of a gradient in fluid 
 
pressure.  There will be more detail on this important property of sediments and 
sedimentary rocks later in the course. 
 20

3.5  Two complications connected with this idea of a gravitationally stable 
framework are worth mentioning at this point: 
(1)  It’s strictly true only for large particles, larger than something like a few 
tens of microns.  Very fine particles weigh so little that forces of electrochemical 
origin are of equal importance.  These forces have two important effects:  
•  A thin layer or cushion of water molecules may be present around the 
particles, so the solid material of the particles may not really be in contact.  
There’s been considerable debate about the importance of such a water 
layer, but the possibility of its existence should be borne in mind.   
•  If they have any surface electric charge at all (and they typically do), very 
fine particles become surrounded by a layer of ions called the electric 
double layer, which if the salinity is low effectively cushions the particles 
from one another.  The existence and importance of this electric double 
layer is undoubted.  I’ll say a little more about it in the chapter on muds and 
shales. 

 (2)  Just because the particles are packed in mutual contact doesn’t 
necessarily mean that the packing arrangement is a stable one.  The initial 
packing upon deposition is usually somewhat more open than the closest possible, 
and a little jiggling or spontaneous movement can cause the sediment to rearrange 
itself into closer packing.  This might sound innocuous, but consider that while the 
particles are in the process of rearranging themselves they are partly unsupported, 
so the rigidity of the framework disappears and the sediment can flow like a fluid.  
This effect is called liquefaction.  Augmenting this effect is the displacement of 
that part of the pore fluid which all of a sudden finds itself in excess over what is 
needed in the closer packing.  These effects are what give rise to the very common 
and diverse kinds of soft-sediment deformation.  There will be a little more on 
such deformation in the chapter on structures. 
3.6  What happens, in terms of geometry, when the sediment becomes 
lithified, by fairly deep burial?  (Again I’m getting ahead of myself, because there 
will be more detail in this on the chapter on diagenesis.)  
 
•  Deposition of new (authigenic) mineral material in the pore spaces.  This 
authigenic material, finely to coarsely crystalline, is called cement.  It’s 
precipitated from solution, and it is unrelated to what was in the deposit 
before burial. 
•  Reorganization of the detrital framework itself, mainly by three processes: 
 
deformation (change in shape) of the grains by intergranular forces.  You can 
imagine the enormous magnitude of the forces per unit area that are brought 
to bear at grain contacts, in view of the great weight of overlying sediment 
that such grain contacts have to support.  Relatively soft grains, like 
sedimentary rock fragments, can be squashed into unrecognizability (Figure 
 
1-21). 
21

pressure suturing (growing together of grains by solution at contact points 
and reprecipitation nearby; see the chapter on sedimentary minerals) 
recrystallization, a word that gets used for two different processes, both 
important:  (i) reorganization of crystal geometry of a given mineral (think 
in terms of what happens to snow as it sits in a snowbank at temperature 
not far below freezing); (ii) growth of crystals of certain newly stable 
minerals at the expense of crystals of the original detrital minerals which 
now find themselves out of equilibrium 
 
3.7  All these things, both physical and chemical, that happen to a sediment 
during and after lithification, but before what’s considered to be metamorphic, 
when the original sedimentary nature of the rock is largely obscured, is called 
diagenesis.  It covers a great variety of processes that operate from "early" to 
"late".  There will be more on diagenesis later in the course. 
3.8  The practical outcome of all this high-sounding discussion should be:  
how do you look at the geometry of a sediment or a rock by hand lens or in thin 
section?   Figure 1-22 shows the standard way of viewing the granular 
organization of a detrital sediment or rock.  The framework grains are the larger 
detrital grains, which are in contact with one another, leaving voids among them.  
The voids are filled with various kinds of void filler.  The classic distinction is 
between cement and matrix.  The term matrix is used for fine detritus that is 
deposited in the interstices among the framework grains.  Figure 1-22A shows a 
sediment with framework grains surrounded by precipitated mineral cement; 
Figure 1-22B shows a sediment with framework grains set in a matrix of fine 
detrital sediment deposited at the same time as the framework grains.     
3.9  But here are four problems with this approach, in order of increasing 
severity: 
 
•   Cement and matrix can be present together in the same sediment. 
•  If the void-filling material is fine-grained you often have a hard time telling 
matrix from cement. You have to look at some thin sections to appreciate this. 
•  The distinction between framework and matrix becomes unrealistic when 
the sediment is poorly sorted (Figure 1-22C), especially if it’s unimodal rather 
than bimodal.  You just have to live with that.  The distinction between framework 
 
and matrix then becomes just conventional or arbitrary.   
22

•  Soft rock fragments can undergo a combination of deformation and 
recrystallization to the point where their material surrounds the more durable 
framework grains as a uniform "paste" that looks just like matrix.  There’s been a 
lot of controversy over the years about the importance of this effect, but it’s 
generally agreed to be important.  You can see a whole spectrum of intermediate 
cases.  So what you call matrix in a well diagenetized rock may or may not have 
anything to do with recrystallized original fine detritus. 
 
 

4.  SEDIMENTARY MINERALS 
 
4.1  Introduction 
4.1.1  What are the most important sedimentary minerals (or, more 
accurately, sedimentary components, because polycrystalline aggregates of one 
kind or another, rock fragments being the most important, are also common 
constituents of sediments and sedimentary rocks)?  It’s easy to list the common 
components: 
 

 23

quartz 
feldspars 
rock fragments 
calcite + aragonite 
dolomite 
clay minerals 
micas 
heavy minerals 
 
 (Not necessarily in order of importance.) 
4.1.2  Here I’ll give some attention to the terrigenous or siliciclastic minerals 
of this list; the carbonate minerals will come later, in the section on carbonate 
sediments and rocks, and clay minerals in dealing with muds and shales.   
4.1.3  Some miscellaneous general points about sedimentary minerals: 
 
•  Any mineral can be present in a siliciclastic sedimentary rock, but not 
many are important. 
•  There are fewer important terrigenous sedimentary minerals than there are 
important igneous and metamorphic minerals: for terrigenous rocks, weathering 
tends to get rid of them; the same is not true, however, for chemically precipitated 
rocks, because the range of physicochemical conditions in evaporating 
environments is very wide. 
•  Because of the very wide range of temperature and pressure conditions 
under which metamorphic rocks can be generated, and the restrictive regularities 
of crystallization in cooling silicate melts, most minerals in terrigenous 
sedimentary rocks are metamorphic (but this is not saying anything about 
volumes; igneous minerals would certainly be more abundant). 
•  For terrigenous rocks, the same minerals don’t have the same significance 
in a sedimentary rock as in igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The minerals in this 
kind of sedimentary rock are not necessarily in equilibrium with each other or 
with their environment.  Each mineral grain has its own history, and each is an 
independent variable in the total characterization of the rock. 
•  A further complication, which you will inevitably run into when you look 
at clastic sedimentary rocks in thin section, is that the same mineral can be present 
in a rock for both equilibrium and disequilibrium reasons, i.e., the same mineral 
can be present in a rock in both detrital and authigenic form.  (How do you figure 
this out?) 
 
 
4.2  Quartz 
4.2.1  Quartz is probably the single most important sedimentary mineral.  It 
constitutes something like 25% of all sediments in the continental crust.  The 
figure is much higher for most coarse-grained rocks, but very low in fine-grained 
 24

rocks and carbonate rocks.  Here we’re dealing with the relative proportions of 
(nonweatherable) quartz vs. (weathering-product) clay minerals from the source 
rocks; we shouldn’t expect the proportions to differ too much from those in the 
source rocks, in terms of quartz versus clay minerals.  As a group, the clay 
minerals are more abundant than quartz.  The clay minerals are a group that’s 
fairly homogeneous in form, occurrence, and general mineralogy, but no single 
mineral is dominant; more on clay minerals later. 
4.2.2  Two factors contribute to the predominance of quartz as a sedimentary 
mineral: 
 
•  It’s moderately abundant in crystalline source rocks; it  forms perhaps 10–
20% of the average igneous or metamorphic rock. 
•  It’s virtually indestructible by weathering (at least mechanical) and 
transportation, whereas all other important source minerals are much more easily 
destroyed by weathering and/or transportation (mainly the former).  All other 
highly stable igneous and metamorphic minerals, like zircon, are negligible 
volumetrically in source rocks, so even though they pass right through the 
sedimentary cycle unscathed, we don't see much of them. 
 
4.2.3  There are five naturally occurring silica minerals: 
stishovite: ultra-high T and P form, dense (4.3 g/cm3), 1200° C, 105 atm.  Present 
in meteor craters. 
coesite: a high-P, high-T form of SiO2, several 100° C, a few 1000 atm P.  
Producible in the laboratory, and formed under conditions like meteorite impact. 
tridymite, cristobalite: high-T forms of SiO2 found in various volcanic rocks 
(even abundantly, in some cases), but of negligible sedimentological importance 
(because of low resistance to chemical weathering). 
quartz: two forms, high quartz and low quartz, related by a nonreplacive ("flip-
over") inversion at 573°C.  Whether the quartz originally crystallized as high or 
low, all quartz in sedimentary rocks is of course now low quartz.  There's a slight 
change in c/a axial ratio in the high-low inversion, about 0.3%; this promotes 
fracturing.  The two forms have a different crystal habit, but this is 
sedimentologically unimportant. 
4.2.4  Miscellaneous mineralogical points about quartz: 
 
•  Quartz is virtually a pure substance; there isn't even limited isomorphous 
substitution or solid solution.  All quartz contains trace elements, however, and 
this is beginning to be used in provenance studies. 
•  Quartz is stable at surface T and P, and under all T and P conditions of 
sedimentary processes, as well as under almost all igneous and metamorphic 
conditions.  The reason we don’t see quartz in things like basalts is compositional, 
not T and P stability.  Quartz is almost universally stable; it’s not around just 
 25

because of low-temperature metastability.  (But this is not to say there are not 
solution reactions that can eliminate quartz from sedimentary rocks; there are.) 
•  The solubility of quartz in pure water is extremely small, something like 
10-15 ppm.  This is measured indirectly: if we put a chunk of quartz in pure water, 
we would have to wait a prohibitively long time to see this equilibrium 
concentration of SiO2 in solution.  Most silica probably gets into solution by 
weathering of silicate minerals, or solution of amorphous silica in preexisting 
sediments (less important), not by solution of quartz. 
•  As noted in the chapter on shape and roundness, abrasion of quartz during 
transportation is small but nonnegligible.  Transportation by wind reduces quartz 
grains much faster than does transportation by water.  We still don’t know whether 
well rounded quartz grains are mainly the result of (1) extreme multicycle 
subaqueous abrasion (traditional view); (2) desert wind action; (3) slight 
preferential solution of silica at edges and corners while temporarily stored in 
transport (untested possibility).  Or perhaps some mix of these processes. 
 
4.2.5  Because of the very low solubility of quartz, a good general rule in 
sedimentary petrology is that as much quartz should reach sedimentary basins as 
leaves the source area (although not necessarily in the same shape and size). 
4.2.6  What's the provenance of quartz?  (The word provenance is used to 
describe the place and/or the materials from which a sediment is derived.)  The 
provenance of quartz grains is varied:  the ultimate source of detrital quartz is 
igneous and metamorphic rocks, but obviously preexisting quartz-bearing 
sedimentary rocks provide detrital quartz too.  A certain percentage, very high in 
some areas, is recycled from such preexisting sedimentary rocks. 
4.2.7  Here’s a brief rundown on the particulate form of quartz as a function 
of grain size: 
 
•  Most gravel-size quartz clasts are derived from vein quartz; they’re usually 
polycrystalline and milky white.   
•  Sand-size quartz consists mainly of single quartz crystals, but also 
polycrystalline grains, either quartzite grains, recrystallized chert, or 
primary crystalline aggregates from crystalline source rocks.  
•  Silt-size quartz grains are almost exclusively single-crystal grains 
(derivation: fine-grained metamorphic rocks; preexisting fine-grained 
sediments; chipping and spalling of larger grains, perhaps mainly in 
deserts).   
•  There’s not much clay-size quartz around to worry about. 
 
4.2.8  What’s the size of quartz grains in sedimentary rocks?  It ranges from 
middling gravel sizes down into the very coarsest clay sizes.  There’s almost no 
quartz < 2 μm (and unfortunately, the clay–silt boundary is at 4 μm).  I mentioned 
earlier that there seems to be a shortage of terrigenous sedimentary material 
 26

around 1–4 mm.  Because quartz is the predominant clastic component in those 
sizes, this shortage must largely be tied up with the overall size distribution of 
sedimentary quartz grains.  The following line of reasoning seems to be on firm 
ground: 
 
•  The size of quartz grains in sediments is determined largely by the size of 
the quartz grains in the source rocks, as modified by breakage, wear, and solution.  
(I’m unsure in detail about the relative or absolute importance of each of these.) 
•  The quartz-bearing plutonic rocks (mainly granitic igneous rocks, gneisses, 
and schists) are the ultimate source of almost all detrital quartz.  But what is 
meant by ultimate?  Most of the quartz from metamorphic rocks started out as 
sedimentary quartz.  But the distinction between sedimentary and metamorphic 
quartz is significant for provenance studies. 
•  Granitic source rocks produce only a small proportion of grains larger 
than 1 mm:  although perhaps one-quarter of quartz grains in the average granitic 
rock are larger than 1 mm, it’s been estimated that so many of these are fractured 
that only about 10% of quartz grains from granitic rocks are larger than 1 mm (and 
only about 20% larger than 0.6 mm). 
 
4.2.9  But how about silt-size quartz in the sedimentary cycle?  It could be 
either source-dependent (from breakdown of fine-grained quartz-bearing 
crystalline rocks, phyllites being the only obvious possibility), or process-
dependent (formed from coarser quartz particles by some process or processes).  
Here are some possibilities for processes of silt-size quartz production: 
 
•   Spalling of silt-size quartz grains from sand-size quartz grains upon impact 
during wind transport; 
•  Glacial grinding and crushing of quartz sand; 
•  Production somehow in other environments? 
 
4.2.10  Because quartz is such a stable and abundant sedimentary mineral (to 
the extent that in many sedimentary rocks it is the only detrital mineral present in 
appreciable proportions), much effort has been expended in trying to develop and 
apply criteria based on features of detrital quartz grains for determining the 
nature of the source rocks.  Here I’ll discuss, briefly, four major features of this 
kind: shape, inclusions, strain shadows, and polycrystallinity.   
4.2.11  Quartz grains obviously vary a lot in shape, but they tend to be 
equigranular or spheroidal (which term seems better sort of depends on how well 
rounded the grain is).  They always show more or less elongation, however, and 
this tends to be along the sixfold crystallographic axis of the quartz grain.  Why?  
Two possibilities:  
 
•  anisotropic abrasion properties caused by crystallographic anisotropy;  
•  quartz grains of source rocks crystallized elongated in this way.  
 27

 
The latter possibility seems to be the case; quartz seems to be virtually isotropic 
with respect to abrasion even though it is anisotropic with respect to crystal 
structure. 
4.2.12  Quartz forms anhedral grains in most crystalline rocks.  And quartz 
has absolutely no mineral cleavage.  So almost all quartz grains are very irregular 
in shape and roundness from the beginning (neither highly angular nor highly 
inequigranular).  When quartz crystallizes freely, it forms doubly terminated 
pyramids—but such crystals are extremely uncommon in sedimentary rocks; you 
rarely see a euhedral detrital quartz grain.  Crushed quartz looks different; but we 
almost never have to deal with crushed quartz in natural situations. 
4.2.13  There’s conflicting evidence on whether quartz grains from schists 
and gneisses tend to be more elongated than those from coarse-grained igneous 
rocks.  For a long time this was assumed to be so, without any careful and 
extensive and systematic measurements.  But more recent studies have shown that 
this is not strongly the case, if at all.  It seems to be generally thought now that 
nothing much can be said about either provenance or transport history by 
studying the shapes of quartz grains in a detrital sediment. 
 
 
4.3  Feldspars 
4.3.1  Feldspar is the second-most-important coarse detrital mineral in 
sedimentary rocks.  It’s subordinate to quartz in sedimentary rocks, and on the 
average it’s sharply subordinate:  the average sandstone contains something like 
10-12% feldspar (mainly detrital).  (Fine-grained terrigenous rocks contain at least 
this much on the average, but it’s hard to tell how much is detrital and how much 
is authigenic; probably more authigenic than detrital.)  Another important fact is 
that feldspar content is much more variable than quartz content:  some detrital 
rocks contain almost no feldspar, whereas others contain more feldspar than 
quartz.   
4.3.2  Although it’s hard to sample representatively, there’s a real increase in 
the average feldspar content of terrigenous rocks from the early Paleozoic to the 
present:  Pre-Pennsylvanian, about 2%, and Cenozoic, about 25%.  WHY?  There 
are only four logical possibilities for why there’s less feldspar in older sandstones: 
 
•  source:   less got in, because typical source rocks had less feldspar.   [seems 
unlikely] 
•  weathering:  less got in, because typical relief and/or climate was more 
conducive to elimination of feldspar.   [seems unlikely] 
•  preservation:  the same amount got in, but rocks with more feldspar have 
been preferentially destroyed.  [seems reasonable] 
•  dissolution:  the same amount got in, but the rocks have had more chance for 
feldspar to be dissolved out or altered by pore waters.  [seems reasonable]  
 28

 
4.3.3  With regard to composition, every known variety of feldspar in 
crystalline rocks is found also in sedimentary rocks, but: 
 
•  certain kinds of dominant, and others are rare; 
•  the proportions of the various feldspars in sedimentary rocks are markedly 
different from in crystalline source rocks. 
 
Plagioclase is an important constituent of crystalline source rocks, but it’s not 
abundant in sedimentary rocks; it’s strongly subordinate to Kspars, which are the 
dominant feldspars in sedimentary rocks.  Also, the more sodic plagioclases are 
more common than the more calcic plagioclases.  Of the Kspars, microcline is 
somewhat more common than orthoclase, but both are very common.  Sanidine, 
on the other hand, is rare.   
4.3.4  What’s the provenance of feldspar in sedimentary rocks?  The Kspar 
comes mainly from coarse-grained felsic (granitic) igneous rocks and gneisses.  
Plagioclase comes mainly from intermediate to mafic igneous rocks, as well as 
plagioclase-bearing metamorphic rocks. Sedimentary and volcanic sources seem 
to be unimportant. 
4.3.5  The percentage of detrital feldspar in sedimentary rocks is 
significantly less than in the source rocks—something like one-fifth as much.  
This is certainly caused at least in part by chemical weathering of feldspar at the 
source.  It’s observed that feldspars are unstable during weathering in soils, and 
that the various feldspars vary in their resistance to weathering, and that these 
differing resistances correspond to the differing abundances of feldspar in 
sedimentary rocks.  You can further feel confident that if you find a sedimentary 
rock with a lot of potentially unstable feldspar, like calcic plagioclase, there must 
have been some special conditions such that weathering did not have enough 
chance to operate (either not enough time or not enough intensity, or both). 
4.3.6  What about the possibility that the feldspar is eliminated also in part by 
mechanical abrasion during transport (or this plus chemical weathering while in 
temporary storage)?  Careful abrasion experiments have shown that abrasion of 
feldspar is twice as fast as of quartz but still insignificant in subaqueous transport.  
So it seems that the percentage of sand-size feldspar in a river can be reduced only 
by dilution or by chemical weathering along the way. 
4.3.7  It was long believed that for feldspar to survive weathering and 
transportation and be deposited in substantial quantities in a sediment requires 
very special climatic conditions: very arid (not much water to facilitate chemical 
decomposition) and/or very cold (low temperatures retard chemical 
decomposition).  But it gradually became clear that highly feldspathic sediments 
accumulate in very wet and hot climates.  Another piece of evidence is the 
presence of tropical flora in feldspar-rich sandstones.  And the mere presence of 
altered feldspar along with fresh feldspar in the same rock, which is very common, 
indicates something is wrong with “cold dry climate” theory. 
 29

4.3.8  Probably more important than climate is the relief of the source area.  
Climate controls the intensity of weathering, but relief controls the time available 
for weathering.  Even in a climate with intense weathering, if the relief is very 
great the rocks are eroded very rapidly, so there’s not enough time for weathering 
to destroy feldspar.  But if relief is low, the rate of erosion is so slow that if the 
climate is favorable, all the feldspar is destroyed.  The presence or absence of 
feldspar is thus controlled by the balance between rate of weathering and rate of 
erosion.  Detrital feldspar is an index of both climate and relief.  What causes high 
relief?  Uplift.  Thus, feldspar in sediments should indicate tectonic activity in the 
source area.   
 
 
4.4  Rock Fragments 
4.4.1  Petrologically, a rock fragment is a detrital component or clast that is 
large enough relative to the grain size of the source rock so as to be petrologically 
representative of the source rock from which it was derived.   The size limitations 
on rock fragments should be obvious:  a source rock can’t yield rock fragments 
finer than the constituent mineral grains of the rock!  Thus, coarse-grained 
plutonic rocks can produce gravel-size rock fragments but not sand-size rock 
fragments. 
4.4.2  The nice thing about rock fragments is that they are a great way of 
telling provenance:  it’s like having little chunks of source-rock outcrops delivered 
to your door.  The trouble is that the rock fragments that are delivered may not 
(and are usually almost certainly not) representative of all the rocks in the source 
area, because of differing resistance to weathering and/or scale of fragmentation.  
Also, for sandstones, the only rock fragments you will see are very fine-grained, 
and it’s difficult to do careful petrographic work on such fine-grained rock 
fragments. 
4.4.3  Rock fragments are moderately abundant: perhaps 10–15% of average 
sandstone. But percentages vary widely, from almost zero to almost all the 
framework.  Here are the most important kinds of rock fragments of sand size:  
 
•  volcanic igneous. Usually so fine-grained that they are hard to identify.  
Usually felsic rocks, because they are more resistant to chemical 
weathering than mafic rocks.  They are often hard to distinguish from 
impure chert.  Mafic volcanic rock fragments are easier to identify but are 
less common in most sandstones. 
•  metamorphic. The whole range of foliated fragments from the series shale–
phyllite–schist are common.  Usually they show a high percentage of 
micaceous material with preferred orientation, and are therefore fairly easy 
to identify. 

 30

•  sedimentary.  Chert is probably the most common, and is usually easy to 
identify.  Shale and mudstone clasts are also common, and grade over into 
metamorphic rock fragments. 
 
4.4.4  Rock fragments are usually counterposed to feldspars in interpreting 
provenance of sedimentary rocks: both have about the same resistance to 
weathering (to first order), and both are abundant in source rocks (potentially 
produced in large quantities).  Feldspar tends to come from deep-seated rocks, 
rock fragments from shallow-seated rocks.  So  the ratio of feldspar to rock 
fragments is usually considered to be a good first-order guide to source-rock 
composition.   This measure is far from perfect, however, because 
 
•  the proportions of feldspar and fine-grained rocks vary in the source areas, 
and 
•  the weatherabilities of feldspars and rock fragments are not identical. 
 
4.4.5  Also, the ratio of quartz to the aggregate of feldspar and rock 
fragments is a good guide to what could be called the maturity of a sedimentary 
rock.  The maturity of a detrital sedimentary rock is the extent to which the 
sediment approaches the end product to which it is driven by the sedimentary 
processes (like weathering and transport) that operate on it.  The ultimate end 
product is an aggregate of well-sorted and well-rounded quartz grains plus a small 
percentage of highly stable heavy minerals like zircon and tourmaline.  This 
measure isn’t perfect either, however, because the initial proportions of quartz and 
other constituents vary greatly in the source rocks. 
 
4.5  Micas  
4.5.1  With regard to mica particles in detrital sediments, it’s nice to think in 
terms of  
 
•  large detrital mica flakes 
•  fine interstitial clay-mineral particles 
 
But often there’s no break in the size distribution of the micas, or even any 
bimodality in the distribution, so we can’t make this distinction.  Also, there’s lots 
of authigenic clay-mineral material in many sedimentary rocks, and you may not 
be able to distinguish detrital from authigenic.  (Some of the authigenic is derived 
from the detrital, and some is derived from alteration of feldspars.)  I’ll 
concentrate here on the coarse detrital micas, and deal with the fine stuff in the 
chapter on muds and shales.   
4.5.2  Muscovite, biotite, and chlorite are all common, but muscovite is far 
more abundant that biotite or detrital chlorite.  
 
muscovite:  the most stable, both chemically and mechanically. 
 31

biotite:  undergoes chemical weathering fairly readily, largely to fine-grained 
chlorite. 
chlorite:  tends to break down into fine particles and be present as a “clay 
mineral” constituent.  It’s also very common as an incipient metamorphic 
mineral in shales and slates. 
 
4.5.3  In most sandstones, muscovite is a minor constituent, a few percent, 
but it is ubiquitous.  It commonly gets concentrated on bedding planes, by settling 
horizontally onto the sediment surface at times of weaker currents.  This tends to 
facilitate parting at that bedding plane, because the excellent cleavage in the mica 
makes that bedding plane a little weaker when the sediment is lithified.  Much of 
the parting (that is, splitting along bedding surfraces) seen in detrital sedimentary 
rocks is caused just by greater concentrations of muscovite.   
4.5.4  Muscovite characteristically has a much lower settling velocity than 
chunky detrital grains of the same mass.  So you tend to find muscovite together 
with much finer detritus.  The hydrodynamic reason, in a nutshell, is this:  flaky 
particles tend to settle with their planes horizontal, and the fluid drag force is 
about proportional to the "frontal area" of the settling particle.  Figure 1-23 shows 
two particles of the same volume.  The flake has the larger frontal area, and so the 
necessary balance between the weight and the drag force is struck at a smaller 
settling velocity. 
 
 
4.6  Heavy Minerals 
4.6.1  The heavy minerals (often just called heavies) of detrital sedimentary 
rocks are a large and nongenetic mineral group.  The minerals are not necessarily 
related to each other in any way:  it’s the operational procedure in separating them 
from the sediment that defines them as group.  By definition, the density of heavy 
minerals is greater than that of some heavy organic liquid, about 2.9 g/cm3 
(usually bromoform or tetrabromoethane).  It’s a mineralogical fact of nature that 
the major sedimentary minerals (quartz, feldspars, carbonates) are around 2.65 
g/cm3 in density, and the minor minerals are mostly much heavier. 
4.6.2  Operationally, the heavies are usually treated in two different groups: 
opaque ("ore") minerals and nonopaque minerals.  These two groups have to be 
studied by different microscopic techniques.  The nonopaque minerals can be 
studied by transmitted light, just like the light minerals, whereas the opaque 
minerals are studied like ores, in reflected light.  The opaque minerals therefore 
tend to be ignored by sedimentary petrologists. 
4.6.3  Unless you are dealing with a placer deposit (a placer is a sedimentary 
accumulation of heavy-mineral grains rich enough to be economically workable) 
heavies almost always form less than 1% of the sediment, and usually less than 
0.1%.  For this reason, you don’t often even see heavy-mineral grains in thin 
section!  But an important point to remember is that the heavy-mineral fraction of 
 32

a detrital rock contains almost all the minerals present in that rock.  If only for 
this reason alone, they are of more than casual interest. 
4.6.4  The heavy minerals, opaque and nonopaque together, fall into two 
broad categories: 
•  Very stable minor accessory minerals of the source rocks.  These aren’t 
abundant in the source rock, but they are so resistant to weathering and abrasion 
that they get into the sediment anyway.  As with quartz, it’s safe to assume for 
these minerals that as much gets into the sediment as leaves the source area.  
Here’s a list of some of the common stable heavy minerals: 
zircon 
tourmaline 
rutile 
anatase 
brookite 
garnet 
magnetite 
ilmenite 
apatite 
titanite 
•  Surviving remnants of abundant but unstable femags in the source rocks.  
To the extent that these escape weathering, they get into the sediment, so 
depending on the particular conditions they can either be very abundant or (more 
likely) rare or entirely absent.  Examples: olivine, pyroxenes, amphiboles, 
staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite. 
 
Some minerals, like garnet, fall in between these two categories. 
4.6.5  Here are two interpretive uses of heavy minerals: 
 
•  delineation of petrographic provinces:  in coastal marine geology, it’s 
common to study the heavy-mineral content of detrital sediments to delineate the 
different continental source areas of the sediments.  Theoretically this could be 
done for ancient rocks as well, but the difficulties are increased because of loss of 
three-dimensional control.  
•  identification of type of crystalline source rocks:  It would be nice to use 
heavy minerals as a guide to the provenance of a sedimentary rock:  what were the 
source rocks?  To some extent we can do a fairly good job in using the heavy 
minerals to tell what the source rocks were, at least ultimately.  Minerals like 
zircon, sphene, monazite, and pink tourmaline are characteristic of granitic rocks; 
garnet, kyanite, sillimanite, staurolite, and epidote, of medium to high grade 
metamorphics.  But obviously the great variety of source rocks and mixing from a 
number of different sources often makes this kind of approach difficult. 
 

 33

4.6.6  Here are two significant things about heavy minerals: 
 
•  The heavies tend to be in the finest fractions of the detritus.  Their greater 
density means that their settling velocity is greater for a given mass, so finer 
heavies tend to be deposited with coarser lights.  (This is a considerable 
oversimplification of  what’s called hydraulic equivalence of light and heavy 
minerals; you have to worry about traction as well as settling.  I can’t pursue this 
here.) 
•  In a succession of interbedded sandstones and shales, the number of 
heavies is much greater in the shales than in the sandstones; the greater 
permeability of sandstones has allowed dissolution or transformation of the 
heavies, whereas the impermeable shales have retained their original heavy-
mineral content.  So if you are looking for heavies, look in fine-grained rocks. 
 

 
5.  CLASSIFICATION OF DETRITAL SEDIMENTS 
5.1  The fundamental classification of detrital sediments is by particle size.  
That said, however, I think I should point out that such a classification tends to be 
treated rather informally by most sedimentologists.  The major size categories are 
gravel, sand, and mud, the first being subdivided into pebbles, cobbles, and 
boulders, and the last being subdivided into silt and clay.  The boundaries are as 
given by the Udden-Wentworth grade scale, which is now conventional in the 
Earth sciences, at least in English-speaking countries.  The Udden-Wentworth 
grade scale is based on powers of two; each successive power of two coarser than 
the preceding by one phi unit (see Section 1 above).  Figure 1-24 shows this grade 
scale, and its conventional terminology.  Especially in the sand sizes, the 
adjectives, ranging from very fine to very coarse, are heavily used in practice.  
And the finer subdivisions of sand are often split even further—for example into 
upper fine or lower medium—even when working with a hand lens and a grain-
size comparator in the field.    
5.2  The classification shown in Figure 1-24 would be very nice if sediments 
were always very well sorted.  In real life, however, there is always a spread of 
sizes around the mean size.  What does one do about naming a sediment when one 
or both of its size-distribution tails laps over into another size category?  

 34

 

5.3 

 
 

Various classifications of mixed-size sediments have been 
proposed.  Two such classifications are shown in Figure 1-25.  The 
one on the left is very logical and symmetrical but largely ignores 
the real world of naming mixed sediments, and the one on the right, 
while asymmetrical, takes greater account of actual 
sedimentological practice.  I don’t want to denigrate any aspect of 
sedimentary geology in this course, but I think it’s reasonable to 
point out here that not many sedimentologists worry much about 
the precise placement of boundaries in classifications like this:  they 
just use their own judgment or predilections or prejudices in giving 
a name to a mixed sediment.
