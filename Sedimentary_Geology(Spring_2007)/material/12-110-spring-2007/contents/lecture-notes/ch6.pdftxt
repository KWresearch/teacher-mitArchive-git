OTHER SEDIMENTARY ROCKS:  CHERT AND 
EVAPORITES 
 
 
 
1.  CHERT 
1.1  Introduction 
1.1.1  Chert is the general term for very fine-grained and nonporous 
sedimentary rocks that consist mostly or entirely of silica, in the form of either 
amorphous silica or microcrystalline quartz presumably derived from 
recrystallization of amorphous silica. The non-scientific equivalent term is flint. 
1.1.2  Cherts are fairly easy to identify, even though you can’t see the 
constituents with your unaided eye, because of the way they fracture and the way 
they look on fracture surfaces.  Cherts are widespread (they are the last of the 
rocks we’ll consider in this course that you are likely to see commonly), but their 
total contribution to the sedimentary record is probably not much more than a 
percent or two.  
1.1.3  The crystal size of quartz in recrystallized chert is usually in the range 
5–20 μm.  Electron microscopy of fractured surfaces shows the quartz to be 
polyhedral, equant to elongate, and closely fitted to surrounding grains.  
Cryptocrystalline geometries in the transition from amorphous silica to 
recrystallized quartz are complex.  Thin-section studies don’t help much because 
the quartz is too fine.    
1.1.4  Chert comes in two distinct varieties, nodular chert and bedded chert, 
whose sedimentological occurrence is rather different.  The problems with chert 
come in its origin; it’s another one of those rocks whose origin we have a hard 
time observing directly.  The relative importance of nodular chert and bedded 
chert has changed through geologic time:  bedded chert is much more common in 
the Precambrian, and nodular chert is more common in the Phanerozoic. 
 
1.2  Terminology 
1.2.1  Here are a few terms for kinds of amorphous silica and chert: 
 
amorphous silica:  material composed of relatively pure SiO2 but with only very 
local crystallographic order.  Amorphous silica includes various kinds of 
hydrated and dehydrated silica gels, silica glass, siliceous sinter formed in hot 
springs, and (certainly of greatest geological importance) the skeletal materials 
of silica-secreting organisms (see below, under opal). 

 

 

opal (or opaline silica) is a solid form of amorphous silica with some included 
water.  It’s abundant in young cherts, back into the Mesozoic. Its geological 
occurrence is by alteration of volcanic ash, precipitation from hot springs, and, 
by far most importantly, precipitation as skeletal material by certain silica-
secreting organisms (see a later section).  Opal starts out as what is called 
opal-A, which shows only a very weak x-ray diffraction pattern, indicating that 
any crystallographic order is very local.  With burial, during the initial stage of 
diagenesis, opal-A is transformed into opal-CT, which shows a weak x-ray 
diffraction pattern characteristic of cristobalite another silica mineral; see 
below).  Upon further diagenesis, opal-CT is transformed into crystalline 
quartz, resulting in chart that consists of an equant mosaic of microquartz 
crystals.  By that stage, most or all of the fossil evidence of origin is 
obliterated.   
chalcedony is a very finely crystalline form of silica consisting of radiating 
needles or fibers, often spherulitic, of quartz.  There’s probably amorphous 
silica in among the needles, and a variable water content.   This stuff is 
metastable with respect to ordinarily crystalline quartz, but it hangs around a 
long time; it’s found even in Paleozoic cherts. 
flint is the general-language equivalent of chert, usually applied to dark gray chert 
in nodules or as beds.  
jasper:  chert that’s red because it contains hematite (often more than a few 
percent). 
porcelanite (also spelled porcellanite):  a minutely porous form of chert with a 
dull appearance on the fresh surface.  

 

 
1.3  Silica Geochemistry 
1.3.1  The solubility of quartz in pure water is very small, several parts per 
million.  Figure 6-1 shows a graph of quartz solubility as a function of pH.  You 
can see that the solubility of quartz is very low for pH values up to about 8 
(slightly alkaline) but then rises sharply with increasing pH.  It’s hard to measure, 
but it can be calculated.  Moreover, attainment of equilibrium is very slow.  The 
solubility of amorphous silica is an order of magnitude higher, and attainment of 
equilibrium is also slow, but much faster than for quartz; you can do it in the 
laboratory.  The dominant species of silica in solution in natural waters in the 
usual range of pH is silicic acid, H4SiO4, a weak acid.

1.3.2  At room temperature and pressure, amorphous silica is metastable with 
respect to quartz, but precipitates formed from supersaturated solutions are 
always amorphous silica.  This is because the building of the quartz crystal 
structure at low temperatures takes a very long time.  Solutions unsaturated with 
respect to amorphous silica but supersaturated with respect to quartz remain stable 
for many years if not longer.  Clear crystalline quartz can’t be precipitated in the 
laboratory at the low temperatures and pressure of sedimentary environments.  
Presumably nature can do it because of the longer times involved.   
1.3.3  The concentrations of dissolved silica in rivers, streams, and lakes are 
a few tens of parts per million.  Concentrations are also in this range in 
groundwater; the deeper the groundwater, the higher the silica concentration.   
1.3.4  What are the sources of silica in solution? 
 

weathering of silicate minerals:  this is the ultimate source of most of the 
silica in solution in the Earth’s surface waters.   
thermal springs:  the concentration of dissolved silica concentration is 
very high but the absolute volume is small. 
dissolution of amorphous silica:  this must be important in areas underlain 
by silica-containing sedimentary rocks, but it is certainly not as 
important overall as weathering of silicates 
dissolution of quartz:  most natural fresh waters are in the pH range for 
which the solubility of quartz is very low, so dissolution of quartz is not 
an important source of silica in solution.   

 

 137

Here’s the bottom line:  it’s generally agreed that by far the greater part of 
dissolved silica comes from weathering of silicate minerals in source rocks. 
1.3.6  The concentration of dissolved silica in the oceans is surprisingly and 
extremely small:  only a few tenths of a part per million.  In the present oceans, 
there’s no possibility of precipitating silica inorganically.  The reason for this very 
low silica concentration in the oceans is that several kinds of organisms are very 
effective in extracting silica from sea water and fixing it in the form of opaline 
silica in their skeletons.  They do this out of equilibrium, by metabolic 
concentration processes.  

 
1.4  Silica-Secreting Organisms 

 
1  .4.1  Introduction 
1.4.1.1  Several kinds of important marine organisms secrete amorphous 
silica to form part or all of their skeletons:  diatoms, radiolarians, and sponges.  
These organisms play an important part, directly or indirectly, in the deposition of 
chert. 
 
1  .4.2  Diatoms 
1.4.2.1  Diatoms are unicellular photosynthesizing organisms, a kind of 
algae, mostly from 20 to 200 μm in size.  The cell wall of the organism is silicified 
with opaline silica to form what’s called a frustule, consisting of two valves that 
overlap one another like the lid of a shallow dish.   
1.4.2.2  Some diatoms are benthic (living on the sea floor), others (by far the 
most important sedimentologically) are planktonic, living in the photic zone of the 
oceans (the uppermost layer in the oceans, in which there is abundant sunlight), in 
less than 200 m water depth.  They solve the problem of buoyancy by being fitted 
with tiny fat droplets.  They like cool water best, apparently because of greater 
nutrient supply, higher water density, and upwelling.  At certain times of the year 
diatom blooms produce concentrations of up to a billion organisms per cubic 
meter. 
1.4.2.3  Diatoms first evolved in the Cretaceous and have been expanding in 
importance since.  A fairly high percentage of the total number of known diatom 
species are living today. 
1.4.2.4  Like foraminifera, diatoms rain onto the floor of the deep ocean over 
large areas.  The resulting sediment is called diatom ooze.  Fossil diatomaceous 
deposits are called diatomite, or diatomaceous earth if friable.  It’s mined as a 
filtration medium for water filters.  Diagenesis of diatomite leads to diatomaceous 
chert, and if diagenesis is sufficiently intense, most or even all the evidence of the 
originally diatomaceous nature of the rock is obliterated.   

 138

1.4.2.5  Figure 6-2: Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils:  George Allen & 
Unwin, 193 p.  (Figure  7.3, p. 42) shows what planktonic diatoms look like. 
 
1  .4.3  Radiolarians 
1.4.3.1  Radiolarians are planktonic protozoans with approximately spherical 
skeletons generally from 100 to 2000 μm in diameter.  The protoplasm of the cell 
is divided into endoplasm and ectoplasm, separated by what’s called a central 
capsule.  The ectoplasm has frothy gelatinous material in which are embedded 
swarms of symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, in the shallow-water species.  
Radiating outward from the central capsule through the ectoplasm are threadlike 
pseudopods.  The skeleton, situated within the cell, consists of radial and 
tangential elements of highly varied geometry:  spicules, spines, bars, spheres, 
spindles, and cones.  The composition of the skeletal material is either celestite, 
SrSO4 (a strontium sulfate mineral, which is unimportant geologically because the 
celestite dissolves too fast), or opaline silica.  Radiolarians have been around since 
at least the Cambrian.   
1.4.3.2  Radiolarian species live in a wide range of water depths.  They like 
warmer water.  They trap and paralyze passing small plankton with their sticky 
pseudopods.  They maintain buoyancy by fat globules or gas-filled vacuoles.   
1.4.3.3  Like diatoms, radiolarians sink to the bottom and can accumulate to 
form radiolarian ooze if they are not dissolved before burial.  Radiolarian ooze 
tends to be found at greater depths than calcareous ooze, and at low latitudes.  
Fossil deposits of radiolarian ooze are called radiolarite, and chert containing 
radiolarians is called radiolarian chert.  The effects of diagenesis are similar to 
those on diatomaceous cherts. 
1.4.3.4  Figure 6-3: Brasier, M.D., 1980, Microfossils:  George Allen & 
Unwin, 193 p.  (Figure 12.1, p. 81, p. 48) shows what radiolarians look like. 
 
1  .4.4  Sponges 
1.4.4.1  Sponges are filter-feeding organisms that live attached to the bottom 
in shallow and deep marine environments.  They are multicellular but are not 
considered to be true metazoans because they are not organized into tissues and 
they have no nervous systems; in degree of organization they fall between 
protozoans and metazoans. 
1.4.4.2  Here’s how sponges work:  they have an upright body shaped like a 
bag or vase with a hole at the top.  The outer surface of the sponge has tiny holes 
leading inward to small chambers in the wall of the sponge that are lined with cells 
with flagella that whirl continually to create a current flowing inward into the 
central cavity.  Plankton sticks to the surface of these cells, which then ingest the 
material.  Sponges are thus low-pressure water pumps, which can pump a volume 
equal to their body volume in a minute.   

 139

 

1.4.4.3  Sponges have skeletons composed of spongin (an insoluble and 
chemically inert protein, what you buy as a “natural sponge”), calcareous spicules, 
or siliceous spicules.  It’s the siliceous spicules that we’re interested in here.  They 
can be straight, radiating, or irregular in shape, and they range in size from 
microscopic to quite large.  Silica-secreting sponges have been around since the 
Cambrian.

Palaeontology and Evolution:  George Allen & Unwin, 323 p.  (Figure 4.1, p. 49).

Twenhofel, W.H., 1953, Principles of Invertebrate Paleontology:  McGraw-Hill, 
816 p.  (Figure 3-2, p. 76) shows what some sponge spicules look like. 
 
1.5  Nodular Chert 
1.5.1  Chert is widespread as nodules in limestone.   Chert nodules are varied 
in shape, from more or less regular discoidal or egg-shaped bodies (that’s the 
common shape for relatively small chert nodules) to highly irregular knobby and 
warty bodies (the common shape of relatively large chert nodules).  Their size 
ranges from a few centimeters to a few tens of centimeters.  They tend to be 
concentrated along certain bedding planes.  Where abundant, they often form a 
two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally interconnected network.  
1.5.2  Chert nodules are usually structureless, but some show faint traces of 
stratification coincident with that in the enclosing limestone.  If the limestone is 
fossiliferous, the fossils in the chert can be either calcareous or silicified.  And the 
fossils in the rest of the limestone may or may not be silicified themselves.  
Sometimes the boundary between the nodule and the limestone passes right 
through fossils—suggesting that the nodules are a diagenetic feature, not a 
primary feature. 
1.5.3  Although in the past some geologists believed that nodules form by 
direct precipitation of silica gel on the ocean bottom, today the evidence for a 
replacement origin is considered to be overwhelming: 
 
•  irregular shape and interconnectedness of many nodules; 
•  presence of irregular patches of limestone in nodules; 
•  association of chert and silicified fossils in many limestones; 
•  presence of replaced fossils in some nodules; 
•  traces of bedding passing through nodules; 
•  contacts of nodules passing through fossils. 
 

 140

1.5.4  But the source of the silica is a problem.  Did it come from within the 
bed or from somewhere else?  The general feeling seems to be that, in most cases 
at least, the nodules can be explained by the presence of abundant biogenic 
amorphous silica in the original sediment and then diagenetic reorganization.  By 
diagenetic reorganization is meant the process by which the disseminated bodies 
of opaline silica (sponge spicules, diatoms, radiolarians) are dissolved, whereupon 
the silica in solution migrates to certain places in the sediment where it is 
reprecipitated in the form of opal-CT to form the nodules.  This happens because 
the pore fluids are undersaturated with respect to the original biogenic silica, 
which consists of opal-A, but are supersaturated with respect to opal-CT, which 
has lower solubility than opal-A.  Frustratingly (for me, at least), the literature on 
chert nodules never seems to provide the classic “straight answer” for what the 
controls are on the origin of the nodules:  Why do they form where they do?  Why 
is are the size and spacing the way they commonly are, rather than much smaller 
or much larger? 
1.5.5  Where the chert nodules form only a small part of the bulk volume of 
the rock, a good case can be made that the silica that forms the nodules was 
present in the sediment from the time of deposition.  But how about when the 
chert forms the greater part of the rock?  Then a stronger case could be made for 
introduction of silica in solution after deposition, by circulating pore solutions. 
1.5.6  The chert in shallow marine limestones probably comes mostly from 
sponge spicules; that in deep marine cherts probably comes mostly from diatoms 
and radiolarians.  In either case, the limestones that contain chert nodules are 
commonly fine-grained wackestones and mudstones, because the remains of the 
organisms responsible for the silica were deposited in quiet-water carbonate 
environments conducive to the various silica-secreting organisms. 
 
1.6  Bedded Chert 
1.6.1  Chert is also found as continuous beds, from centimeters up to as much 
as a few meters thick,  often, but not always, interbedded with shale.  Bedded 
cherts are also often interbedded with turbidite sandstones and submarine 
volcanics.  Most such bedded cherts show abundant evidence of having been 
deposited in the deep ocean. 
1.6.2  Two scenarios seem most attractive for explaining these cherts: 
 

 

•  Open-ocean siliceous ooze is conveyor-belted to subduction margins 
and incorporated into a subduction mélange; 
•  Siliceous sediment is deposited near a subduction margin, interbedded 
with subduction-zone volcanics and turbidites shed from the island arc, 
and incorporated into a subduction mélange. 

 

 141

1.6.3  Here we need to distinguish between Phanerozoic bedded cherts and 
Precambrian bedded cherts. 
 
•  Phanerozoic bedded cherts usually contain radiolarians, and they can be 
explained by lithification and diagenesis of radiolarian-rich bottom sediments, 
although some may have been inorganically precipitated with radiolarians as a 
nonessential constituent. 
•  Precambrian bedded cherts, on the other hand, show no convincing 
evidence of having started out as biogenic sediment, inasmuch as no silica-
secreting marine organisms are known from the Precambrian.  (Some of the oldest 
and most exotic unicellular organisms are found preserved in Precambrian cherts, 
going way back into the Archean—but that does not mean that the cherts were 
formed biogenically from silica-secreting organisms).  Most Precambrian cherts 
seem have been inorganically precipitated, although the processes involved are not 
entirely clear.  The concentrations of dissolved silica in the Precambrian oceans, 
before the appearance of the silica-secreting organisms characteristic of the 
Phanerozoic, were probably in the range of tens of parts per million, almost an 
order of magnitude greater than today.  It’s common for such cherts to be 
interbedded with chemically precipitated ironstones.  Some of the very oldest 
sedimentary rocks, in greenstone terranes, are bedded cherts.  Chert is 
characteristically interbedded, down to centimeter scale, with Precambrian iron 
formations. 

  
 

 
2.  EVAPORITES 
2.1  Introduction 
2.1.1  Enormous volumes of sediment in the ancient sedimentary record are 
composed mainly or entirely of what are called evaporite minerals:  minerals 
precipitated from a saline solution that has been concentrated by evaporation.  
Most evaporites in the sedimentary record are marine evaporites (solutions derived 
from normal sea water by evaporation are said to be hypersaline), but there are 
also nonmarine evaporites.  There are a great many evaporite minerals, but only a 
few are common.  It’s been estimated that something like one percent of 
Phanerozoic rocks are evaporites, and that a quarter to a third of the area of the 
continents is underlain by evaporite deposits in the subsurface, with thicknesses 
ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters. (Think “salt mines”:  there 
really are such things.)  Figure 6-5 shows areas of the conterminous United Sates 
that are underlain by evaporites, and Figure 6-6 shows the location of the major 
evaporite deposits of the world.

2.1.2  The Permian Period was the time of greatest evaporite deposition—
presumably because much of the great supercontinent of Pangea lay in a low-
latitude belt of continental aridity in what we call, in the present time, the “horse 
latitudes”, where the troposphere experiences widespread subsidence in the 
downgoing leg of the low-latitude Hadley cell of the general circulation of the 
atmosphere.   
2.1.3  If you leave dolomite out of consideration (and some nearly primary 
dolomite must have been associated with hypersaline conditions), the three most 
common evaporite minerals are gypsum (a hydrated calcium sulfate mineral), 
anhydrite (an anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral), and halite, NaCl.  But the only 
evaporite you as field geologists are likely to see is gypsum, because halite 
dissolves so readily in surface waters except in the most arid regions, and 
anhydrite, being the high-pressure anhydrous form of calcium sulfate, is mostly 
restricted to depths greater than tens to hundreds of meters. 
2.1.4  Are you likely to see evaporites in outcrop?  The answer is yes, for 
gypsum, but no, for halite (the two most voluminous evaporite deposits).  Only in 
the driest of climates—in the interior of Iran, for example—is rock salt exposed at 
the Earth’s surface. 
2.1.5  Evaporites are excellent indicators of paleoclimate:  it takes a hot and 
arid climate for major evaporite deposits to form.  As you will see in a later 
chapter on economic sedimentology, evaporites can form seals for the 
accumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in reservoir rocks.  On a more prosaic 
note, gypsum is the mineral that’s used to make plaster and “drywall” (gypsum 
wallboard). 
2.1.6  Evaporite deposits are known from all the continents, with ages 
ranging from Precambrian to Late Cenozoic (although Precambrian evaporites are 
scarce, either because they were not deposited or because they have been 
dissolved away during diagenesis through geologic time).  Unfortunately, 
however, there are no modern evaporite depositional environments representative 
of the extensive areas of evaporite deposition that existed at various times and 
places in the geologic past.  As with dolostones, this has led to great difficulties 
and a diversity of competing theories in interpreting the depositional environments 
of evaporites. 
 

2.2  Evaporite Minerals 
2.2.1  More than eighty naturally occurring evaporite minerals have been 
identified.  The intricate equilibrium relationships among these minerals have been 
the subject of many studies over the years.  But there are only about a dozen major 
evaporite minerals.  Here’s a list of the most important evaporite minerals: 
 

 

 144

anhydrite  CaSO4
calcite  CaCO3
carnallite  KMgCl3.6H2O) 
dolomite  CaMg(CO3)2
gypsum  CaSO4.2H2O 
halite  NaCl 
kainite  KMg(SO4)2.H2O 
kieserite  Mg SO4.H2O 
langbeinite  K2Mg2(SO4)3
magnesite  MgCO3
polyhalite  K2Ca2Mg(SO4)4.2H2O 
sylvite  KCl 
 
2.2.2  But of the above minerals, only three are of paramount importance:  
gypsum, anhydrite, and halite.   
 
Gypsum is a calcium sulfate mineral containing water of hydration.  It’s 
monoclinic with one perfect cleavage, and usually white or colorless but 
sometimes gray or reddish.  It’s one of the softest of common minerals:  you can 
scratch it with your fingernail.  Its specific gravity is relatively low, 2.32.  
Although phase equilibria in the CaSO4–H2O system are far from clear, because 
of the difficulty of studying equilibrium precipitation and dissolution in the 
laboratory, it seems clear that gypsum is the mineral that is stable at surface 
conditions and is virtually always the primary evaporite precipitation product.    
Anhydrite is an anhydrous calcium sulfate mineral.  It’s orthorhombic, has 
one perfect cleavage and two other good cleavages, and is usually white to 
colorless but sometimes gray.  Its specific gravity is relatively high, 2.93.  It is 
usually seen as massive granular aggregates rather as well formed crystals.  It’s 
stable at higher pressures and temperatures than is gypsum, so gypsum is 
converted to anhydrite when the evaporite deposit is buried.  The deepest reported 
occurrence of gypsum is about 1300 m.   
Halite  is a cubic mineral with a perfect cubic cleavage.  It’s colorless when 
pure but can be reddish from iron and various other colors as well.  It’s easy to 
identify by its salty taste.  It forms surface outcrops only in the most arid regions.  
It’s also a relatively low-density mineral:  the specific gravity is 2.16. 
 
2.2.3  Not all evaporites are marine deposits.  Nonmarine evaporites are 
common, although the volume of nonmarine evaporites is not nearly as great as 
that of marine evaporites.  Nonmarine evaporites are common in continental 
extensional basins.  There is a great variety of nonmarine evaporite minerals. 
 

 145

 

2.3  Chemistry of Evaporites 
2.3.1  You know, of course, that the oceans are salty.  The salinity of sea 
water is close to 35 parts per thousand, ppt (parts dissolved materials, by mass, per 
thousand parts of bulk sea water, by mass).  Generally the salinity varies only 
slightly from place to place in the oceans, because of dilution and evaporation, 
although these slight differences are of extreme importance in controlling the 
circulation and also the biology of the oceans.  But in certain unusual situations, 
the salinity can rise to much higher values, giving rise to evaporite precipitation. 
2.3.2  Almost all of the salt in sea water is accounted for by seven ions.  
Here’s a table that lists these ions and their concentration in percent by weight.  
These seven ions account for 99.7% by weight of all the dissolved salts in sea 
water.

Of these, the last is controlled by the equilibrium between sea water and the CO2 
of the atmosphere.  The dominant control on the rest is the dissolved-salt content 
of river runoff.       
2.3.3  Back in 1849 an Italian chemist named Usiglio made a classic, widely 
cited, but somewhat misleading experiment on evaporite deposition.  He took a 
volume of normal sea water and slowly evaporated it, and kept track of the 
composition and mass of precipitated salts as a function of extent of evaporation.  
He found that when the water is reduced in volume to about 50% of the original 
volume, a little iron oxide and some aragonite are precipitated, but precipitation of 
the major evaporite minerals doesn’t begin until the volume is reduced to about 
20%, when gypsum is precipitated.  Then when the volume is reduced to about 
10%, halite begins to be precipitated.  Further reduction in volume then leads to 
the precipitation of various magnesium sulfates and chlorides, and finally to NaBr 
and KCl. 
2.3.4  In terms of volumes of precipitated salts, experiments like that of 
Usiglio show that if a column of sea water 1000 m thick is evaporated to dryness, 
the precipitated salt deposit would be about 15 m thick.  Of this, 0.5 m would be 
gypsum, 11.8 m would be halite, and the rest, 2.7 m, would be mainly salts of 
potassium and magnesium.  But is this how most evaporite deposits are formed?  
No; read on. 
 

 146

 

2.4  Kinds of Evaporite Deposits 
2.4.1  Gypsum rock is usually finely granular but sometimes coarsely 
crystalline.  The mode of occurrence of gypsum is rather variable, because, as you 
will see presently, diagenetic changes are usually far-reaching.  Details of bedding 
are usually not well preserved.  Gypsum is also common as nodules in a matrix of 
carbonate or shale. 
2.4.2  Anhydrite rock is usually bedded, often with delicate lamination that’s 
continuous for long distances.  It’s usually fine grained.  You seldom see anhydrite 
in outcrop, however, for reasons that will become apparent soon. 
2.4.3  Rock salt is a massive, coarsely crystalline, and nonjointed rock.  It 
sometimes shows bedding, especially by alternation of beds with greater or lesser 
concentration of nonhalite impurities (gypsum, anhydrite, carbonates, and 
siliciclastics). 
 

 

2.5  Diagenesis of Evaporites 
2.5.1  Changes in evaporites during burial and unroofing are usually 
substantial, for three reasons:   
 

•  Evaporite minerals in general are very susceptible to solution and 
reprecipitation. 
•  Gypsum is converted to anhydrite upon burial, and then the anhydrite is 
usually reconverted to gypsum as it makes it way to the surface again.  
When gypsum is replaced by anhydrite, there is a 38% loss in volume, 
because of the great difference in density between the two minerals.  So 
there’s great extra compaction on the way down (which, incidentally, is 
conducive to nontectonic deformation, because if the pore water, 
preexisting and newly released, can’t drain away fast enough, the 
reduction in solids volume tends to cause a liquefied state in which the 
pore-water pressure can approach the lithostatic pressure).  Conversely, 
on the way up the anhydrite is reconverted to gypsum, provided that 
extra water is available.  This expansion tends to cause even more local 
deformation of the deposit.  The change from anhydrite to gypsum on 
the way up is usually delayed until the near-surface zone of influence of 
surface groundwater is reached.  This gypsum–anhydrite diagenetic 
cycle is shown in Figure 6-7.

•  Halite tends to flow plastically on a large scale, because it’s relatively 
weak and because its deposits have a substantially lower bulk density 
than the “normal” rocks (carbonates and siliciclastics) with which it’s 
interstratified on a large scale.  A horizontal layer of halite lying 
between layers of denser rock represents a gravitationally unstable 
situation, and even slight preexisting nonplanarity of the layer leads to 
uprise of columns or domes of salt, called diapirs, typically on scales of 
several kilometers.  Hence the term salt tectonics. 

 

2.6  Sedimentary Structures in Evaporites 
2.6.1  Do evaporites precipitate as bottom growths or as discrete mineral 
particles?  The former is demonstrable in some cases, but the widespread 
existence of primary sedimentary structures, like lamination, cross stratification, 
ripple marks, and graded bedding—just as in siliciclastic sediments and rocks— 
gives good evidence that the latter is the more important mode of deposition.  It’s 
clear that once evaporite crystals are precipitated they are susceptible to reworking 
and transportation before final deposition. 
2.6.2  Evaporites are highly susceptible to early and significant diagenesis, 
owing to the extreme solubility of the evaporite minerals.  Most of the sedimentary 
structures in evaporites are diagenetic.  Various kinds of postdepositional folds 
and veins are common.  Veins of gypsum cutting fine siliciclastic rocks (mudrocks 
and fine sandstones), both parallel and oblique to stratification, are common; 

 148

 

presumably the largely siliciclastic sediment contained an admixture of gypsum, 
which was remobilized upon shallow burial. 
2.6.3  A striking and common diagenetic structure in calcium sulfate 
evaporites is nodular anhydrite (Figure 6-8:  Blatt, H., 1992, Sedimentary 
Petrology, Second Edition:  W.H. Freeman, 514 p.  (p. 327, Figure 10-7)), also 
called, picturesquely, chicken-wire anhydrite.   
 
2.7  Theories of Evaporite Deposition 
2.7.1  The great thickness of some evaporite deposits, as well as the common 
dominance of gypsum in the deposit, argue against simple evaporation of a body 
of sea water to dryness.  One has to appeal to a continuous evaporation process 
whereby a water body partially isolated from the open ocean is subjected to net 
evaporation (evaporation is greater than fresh-water runoff into the basin).   
2.7.2  If in such a continuous-evaporation basin there is no outflow of water, 
only inflow, then all of the dissolved salts must be precipitated somehow, 
whatever the ratio of sea-water inflow and fresh-water runoff.  The common 
dominance of one or another evaporite mineral suggests, however, that some 
percentage of the concentrated brine flows out of the basin, somehow, during the 
evaporation process.  Presumably the outflow would contain a disproportionate 
concentration of the harder-to-precipitate salts.  The outflow could be as an 
outgoing underflow of denser, more saline water beneath an inflowing surface 
current of normal sea water (Figure 6-9A).  Or it could be as a gravity-driven 
diffuse flow through a permeable barrier (Figure 6-9B).

2.7.3  If a greater percentage of the water is returned to the open ocean by 
reflux, then gypsum would be the dominant evaporite, whereas if a lesser 
percentage of the water is returned by reflux, then halite would be the dominant 
evaporite.  In the least common situation, where an even smaller percentage of the 
basin water is returned by reflux, the more exotic evaporites would be formed. 
2.7.4  Shallow ocean-margin continuous-evaporation basins of the kind 
described above are a natural way of accounting for the thick and extensive 
deposits of evaporites seen in the sedimentary record, but keep in mind that no 
good examples are known from the modern, so it’s all a matter of deduction rather 
than of observation.   
2.7.5  Many evaporite deposits are relatively thin and intimately associated 
with sediments of other compositions, and show excellent evidence of very 
shallow-water conditions, like desiccation cracks.  An appealing way of 
accounting for such evaporites is to assume that they are sabkha deposits.  A 
sabkha is a low-lying but supratidal surface along a coast with net evaporating 
conditions and little supply of siliciclastic sediment.  (The adjective supratidal 
refers to elevations just above the high-tide level.)  Most of the time the sabkha 
surface is emergent, but occasional storms cover the surface with sea water.  That 
water tends to seep down into the sabkha surface, and during later evaporation the 
water rises again by capillary action, and the dissolved salt is precipitated as 
evaporite minerals.  If the shoreline is prograding, a layer of evaporites some 
meters thick may be deposited in that way.
