SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES 
 
 
 
1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1  You might have heard us define structure in rocks as rock geometry on a 
scale much  larger  than  grains.   This  is  a  singularly  unilluminating  definition,  be-
cause it doesn't conjure up in the mind of the uninitiated any of the great variety of 
interesting and significant geometries that get produced by the physical, chemical, 
and  biological  processes  that  operate  on  sediments  during  and  after  their  deposi-
tion.  
1.2   One qualification  to  the  foregoing definition  is  that  the  term  structure  is 
used in two different senses:  
  
θ   For  features,  on  the  scale  of  hand  specimens  to  large  outcrops,  produced 
within  a  depositional  environment,  during  or  (usually)  not  long  after  de-
position.  These are usually prefaced by the adjective sedimentary. 
θ   For  features,  on  the  scale  of  hand  sp ecimens  to  whole  regions,  produced  by 
deformation  associated  with  regional  rather  than  local  deforming  forces, 
folding and faulting being perhaps  the most obvious examples.   This stuff  is 
not  the province of sedimentologists or stratigraphers, although  they have  to 
be  prepared  to  deal  with  it.    These  could  be  prefaced  with  the  adjective 
tectonic. 
 
1.3    Study  of  sedimentary  structures  is  important  because  they  are  far  and 
away  the  most  valuable  features  for  interpreting  depositional  environment.    We 
know a lot about how most structures are formed, so finding them in the rocks can 
tell  you  a  lot  about  the  conditions  of  deposition.     They're much more  useful  than 
textural things like grain-size distribution and grain shape.    
 
2.  CLASSIFICATION 
 
2.1  It's not easy to classify sedimentary structures, because both their origins 
and  their  geometries  are  so  highly  varied.    Two  reasonable  ways  of  classifying 
them  are  on  the  basis  of:    kind  of  mechanism  that  produces  them  (physical 
sedimentary  structures,  chemical  sedimentary  structures,    and  biogenic  sedi-
mentary  structures)  and  time  of  development  relative  to  time  of  deposition 
(primary sedimentary structures and secondary sedimentary structures). 
2.2    Figure  3-1  is  a  pigeonhole  chart  showing  most  of  the  important  struc-
tures in terms of such a twofold classification.

           2.3   Physical  primary  structures  ar e  certainly  the  most  common  and 
widespread and striking, and  I  think  it's  fair  to say  that  in general  they're  the most 
useful  in  interpretation.   Most are related  to  transportation and deposition of sedi-
ment  particles  at  a  fluid/sediment  interface.    Such  structures  can  be  classified 
further  on  the  basis  of  their  relationship  to  transportation  (the  movement  of 
sediment  past  a  point  on  a  sediment  bed  by  currents)  and  deposition  (the  increase 
in bed  elevation  at  a point with  time).   Figure 3-2  is an unofficial classification of 
this  kind.    It  doesn't  serve  very well  as  a  catalogue,  but  it  should  help  to  get  your 
thinking organized.

3. STRATIFICATION 
3.1  General 

 
3.1.1   Stratification  is  by  far  the  most  important  sedimentary  structure.  
Most,  although  not  all,  sedimentary  rocks  are  stratified  in  one  way  or  another.  
There  are  many  scales  and  geometries  of  stratification.    And  stratification  is 
certainly  the  single most  useful  aspect  of  sedimentary  rocks  in  terms  of  interpret-
ing depositional conditions.  
3.1.2   Stratification   can  be  defined  simply  as  layering  brought  about  by 
deposition,  the  term  layering  being  more  generally  used  for  any  arrangement  of 
rocks  in  bodies  with  approximately  planar-tabular  shape.    I  suppose  it's  obvious, 
but  I'll  say  it  anyway:    stratification  comes  about  by  changes  in  depositional 
conditions with time.  
3.1.3   In dealing with stratification,  there are two separate but related matters 
you have to worry about: 
 
θ  What it was about depositional conditions that changed with time to give rise 
to stratification? 
θ   What  it  is  about  the  rock  itself  that  makes  the  stratification  manifest?   
(Changes in composition, texture, or even other smaller-scale structures?)  
 
3.1.4    Stratification  is  usually  obvious,  especially  on  the  scale  of  large 
outcrops,  but  sometimes  it's  subtle  and  hard  to  find,  either  because  depositional 
conditions  didn't  vary  much  or  because  the  rocks  have  been  messed  up  since,  or 
perhaps  just  because  the  outcrop  is  inadequate.    Finding  the  stratification  under 
such conditions is a skill that has to be sharpened by practice. 
3.1.5    In  looking  for  the  stratification,  always  think  in  terms  of  changes  in 
composition,  texture,  and/or  structure  from  bed  to  bed.    Failing  that,  look  for 
preferred  orientation  of  clasts,  which  although  not  stratification  in  itself,  often 
reveals the stratification.  
3.1.6    Here's  a  list  of  things  that  tend  to  make  stratification  apparent  to  the 
eye: 
 
θ  obvious differences in grain size 
θ  obvious differences in composition 
θ   color/shade  differences   caused  by  slight  differences  in  composition  (subtle 
differences  in  underlying  composition  can  cause  even  greater  color/shade 
differences as large ones); 
θ   differential  weathering   caused  by  differences  in  composition/texture;  these 
range from gross to subtle; 
θ   zones  of  larger  or  smaller  con centration  of  individual  components,  like 
pebbles or fossils in otherwise homogeneous sediment; 
θ   preferred  orientation  of   nonspherical  components  (technically  not  stratifi-
cation  itself,  but  it  can  reveal  the  stratification;  often  useful  in  unstratified 
conglomerates)

3.2  Terminology 
 
3.2.1   Stratification  is officially subdivided  into bedding and  lamination, de-
pending  upon  the  thickness  of  the  strata,  and  bedding  and  lamination  are  in  turn 
subdivided  according  to  thickness.    Figure  3-3  is  a  chart  that  gives  you  all  the 
official  terminology.    Get  used  to  using  this  terminology  in  your  descriptions  of 
strata.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.2   With  that  said,  I  suppose  I  should  point  out  that  in  everyday  sedimen-
tological  and  stratigraphic  usage,  people  commonly  use  the  term  bedding  as  a 
synonym for stratification rather than just in its technically restricted sense. 
3.2.3    Also,  stratification  is  often  hierarchical,  in  that  beds  commonly  show 
internal lamination on a much finer scale.  
3.2.4  One of our little terminological peeves is that people sometimes use the 
term  lamination not  just  for  the phenomenon but for  the object,  instead of  lamina.  
That's  not  good  practice,  and  I  want  you  to  avoid  it.    It  makes  you  sound 
uncultured. 

 
3.3  Parting 
 
3.3.1  Keep clearly in mind the distinction between stratification and parting.  
Parting  is  the  tendency  for  stratified  rocks  to  split  evenly  along  certain  stratifi-
cation planes.    (The word  is also used  for  the plane  itself along which parting has 
developed.)    The  approximately  planar-tabular  units  developed  by  parting  are 
usually just called beds, but it might be better to think of them as parting units.   
3.3.2   There's official  terminology  for parting units, corresponding to that for 
stratification, although it's not in as common use; see Figure 3-4. 
 
 

 76

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3.3    The  problem  with  making  a  big  deal  of  parting  is  that  it  depends  not 
only  upon  the  underlying  existence  of  weaker  bedding  planes  but  also  upon  the 
extent  and  nature  of  weathering:    A  freshly  blasted  outcrop  usually  won't  show 
any parting at all, but if you go back to the outcrop years or decades later, it might 
show well developed parting.  

 
3.4  Origin 
 
3.4.1   Here are  three major  "scenarios"  for  the origin of  stratification.   These 
are the broad ways loose sediments get deposited.   
3.4.2   Quiet-fluid  deposition  of  particles  by  settling:     ocean  bottom  (plus 
lakes)  mainly;  low-velocity  currents  carrying  a  supply  of  suspended  sediment 
from  upcurrent;  usually  fine-grained  but  not  always;  usually  thin  lamination, 
because  deposition  rate  is  slow  relative  to  the  slight  changes  in  settling  regime; 
usually  nearly  or  perfectly  even  and  planar,  unless  later  deformed.    Often  such 
deposits  are  later  bioturbated  to  the  point  that  none  of  the  original  lamination 
remains. 
3.4.3   Deposition  of  particles  by  tractional  currents:     deposition  onto  a 
well  defined  fluid-sediment  interface  during  bed-load  (or  bed-load  plus  plus  sus-
pended-load)  transport  by  moderate  to  strong  currents;  stratification  thick  to  thin 
depending  on  nature  of  variations  in  sediment  supply,  currents,  and  deposition 
rate;  even  stratification  and  cross  stratification  can  both  be  important;  usually 
fairly coarse sediment, coarsest silt size into gravel range. 
3.4.4   Mass deposition of  coarse and  fine  sediment mixtures   (or only  fine 
sediment,  or  rarely  only  coarse  sediment)  by  sediment  gravity  flows  (high-
concentration  sediment-water  mixtures  flowing  as  a  single  fluid)  coming  to  rest 
without  differentiation  or  particle-by-particle  deposition;  usually  thick-bedded, 
with little or no internal stratification.

4.  CROSS STRATIFICATION 
 
4.1  Introduction 
 
4.1.1   Cross stratification   is stratification  that  is  locally at some angle  to  the 
overall  stratification  as  a  consequence  of  changes  in  the  geometry  of  the  deposi-
tional  surface  during  deposition.    (This  definition  leaves  some  uncertainty  about 
what's  meant  by  the  scales  of  "local"  and  "overall".    Usually  "local"  is  on  lateral 
scales ranging from centimeters to hundreds of meters.)  Usually one or more beds 
in  some  part  of  a  section  show  cross  stratification,  which  you  recognize  as  cross 
stratification  because  the  attitude  of  the  stratification  varies  from  point  to  point 
within the beds, or, if it's the same everywhere within those beds, then you can see 
that  the  orientation  is  different  from  that  of  the  bounding  surfaces  of  the  beds,  or 
the  orientation  is  different  from  what  you  know  to  be  the  overall  stratification 
within the outcrop or within the local stratigraphic section. 
4.1.2   The vertical scale of cross stratification varies from millimeters to sev-
eral meters, and the geometry is infinitely varied.  Cross stratification comes about 
by  deposition  upon  a  sediment  surface  that  is  locally  at  an  angle  to  the  overall 
plane  of  the  depositional  surface;  this  usually  but  not  always  involves  erosion  of 
the  depositional  surface  as  well,  either  prior  to  or  concurrent  with  deposition.  
Some  terminology:  small-scale  cross  stratification  is  on  scales  of  up  to  several 
centimeters,  medium-scale  cross  stratification  is  on  scales  from  several 
centimeters  to  several decimeters,  and  large-scale cross  stratification  is on  scales 
from  several  decimeters  to  several  meters.    (But  as  far  as  I  know,  there's  nothing 
official or standardized about these boundaries.)  
4.1.3   Cross  stratification  varies  enormously  in  geometry.     This  is  in  part  a 
reflection of the great diversity of bed configurations produced by fluid flows over 
loose  beds  of  sediment.    But  there's  an  additional  factor  at  work  here  too:    some 
cross stratification comes about not from the movement of individual bed forms in 
a  train,  but  from  solitary  or  isolated  flow-produced  topographical  elements, 
usually large, which usually come under the heading of bars or deltas.    
4.1.4  Interpretation of cross stratification is well advanced, thanks to decades 
of  careful  field  studies of  cross-stratification geometry  in  ancient  rocks,  studies of 
modern  depositional  environments,  and  laboratory  studies  in  tanks  and  channels.  
So  cross  stratification  is  probably  the  single  most  useful  tool  in  interpreting  the 
physical  aspects  of  loose-sediment  depositional  environments.    That's  why  I'm 
devoting  what  probably  will  seem  to  you  to  be  inordinate  space  in  these  notes.  
(Another reason is that cross stratification is one of our own special fields!) 
4.1.5   Because cross stratification is so environment-specific, it seems best to 
give  you  only  a minimum  of  purely  descriptive  terminology  and  classification.    I 
think  it's  better  for  you  to  get  used  to  the  various  "styles"  of  cross  stratification, 
which are closely bound up with mechanics of origin, and then deal with examples 
in  the context of  these styles.   That's  the way  things  tend  to be done  these days by 
the people who actually work on cross-stratified rocks. 
4.1.6    Here's  some  geometrical  terminology.    More  commonly  than  not, 
cross-stratified  deposits  are  arranged  as  packets  or  sets  of  conformable  laminae 
separated  from  adjacent  sets  by  truncation  surfaces.   A  set  (also  called  a 
laminaset)  is  a  succession  of  two  or  more  conformable  laminae  separated  from 
other  sets  (or  beds  without  sets)  by  surfaces  of  erosion,  nondeposition,  or  abrupt 

 78

 

 

 

 

    

change in lithology.  Figure 3-5 shows three common examples.  In each example, 
the  asterisk  lies  within  a  single  set.  The  laminae within  the  sets may  be  planar  or 
curving.    Concave-up  laminae  are  more  common  than  convex-up  laminae.    The 
orientations of the truncation surfaces are usually different from the orientations of 
the  laminae  within  the  sets.    Commonly  the  lateral  scale  of  the  sets  may  be  not 
much  greater  than  the  vertical  scale,  or  it  may  be  much  greater.    In  some  cases, 
there  are  no  truncation  surfaces  within  the  cross-stratified  deposit;  Figure  3-6 
shows a common example. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.1.7    Another  thing  you  should  be  thinking  about  is  one's  view  of  cross 
stratification.    Usually  it's  seen  on  a  fracture  surface,  weathered  or  unweathered, 
nearly  normal  to  the  overall  stratification.    Some  cross  stratification  is  approxi-
mately  isotropic with  respect  to  direction  in  the  plane  of  overall  stratification  (the 
geometry  of  cross  stratification  looks  about  the  same  in  differently  oriented  sec-
tions),  but  most  is  anisotropic  (the  geometry  of  cross  stratification  commonly 
looks  different  in  differently  oriented  sections  normal  to  the  overall  plane  of 

 79

 

 

 

 

    

stratification),  so  try  to  see  the  cross  stratification on as many differently oriented 
planes  normal  to  bedding  as  you  can,  because  it  might  look  quite  different 
depending  on  the  direction.    Sometimes,  but  not  often,  you  get  to  see  what  the 
cross  stratification  looks  like  on  a  plane  within  the  cross-stratified  bed  parallel  to 
overall stratification.  
4.1.8   A  final note on  terminology:    just as with  stratification  in general, you 
can  think  in  terms  of  cross  stratification  as  the  general  term,  and  cross-bedding 
and  cross-lamination  according  to  the  thickness  of  the  strata  within  the  sets.  
People tend not to adhere rigorously to these distinctions, however. 
4.1.9    Often  a  given  cross-stratified  bed  may  represent  not  just  one  deposi-
tional event but two or more separate depositional events, each one superimposed 
on  the  the  previous  one.    Such  beds  are  said  to  be  amalgamated.    Sometimes  it's 
easy  to  recognize  the  individual  depositional  events within  the  amalgamated  bed; 
the  stratification  within  each  part  of  the  bed  can  then  be  studied  separately.    But 
sometimes it's difficult to determine whether or not the bed is amalgamated.   
 
4.2  How Bed Forms Make Cross stratification 
 
4.2.1   In general  terms,  the fundamental  idea about bed-form-generated cross 
stratification is easy to state (Figure 3-7):  as bed forms of one kind or other pass a 
given point on the bed, both the bed elevation and the local bed slope change with 
time.   Consider a short  time  interval during the history of decrease and increase in 
bed elevation.  After a temporary minimum in bed elevation is reached, deposition 
of  new  laminae  takes  place  for  a  period  of  time,  until  a  temporary  maximum  in 
bed  elevation  is  reached.    Then,  as  the  bed  elevation  decreases  again,  there's 
complete or partial erosion of the newly deposited laminae and formation of a new 
truncation  surface.    After  the  next  minimum  in  bed  elevation,  another  set  of 
laminae is deposited. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.2.2  The preceding paragraph is still too general to give you a concrete idea 
about  how moving  bed  forms  generate  cross  stratification.   Now  I'll  be more  spe-
cific.   Take  as  an  example  a  train of downstream-moving  ripples  in unidirectional 
flow.    (The  picture  would  be  qualitatively  very  similar  for  dunes.)    Each  ripple 
moves  slowly  downstream,  generally  changing  in  size  and  shape  as  it  moves.  

 80

 

 

 

 

    

Sediment  is  stripped  from  the  upstream  (stoss)  surface  of  each  ripple  and 
deposited on the downstream (lee) surface.        
4.2.3  In your imagination, cut the train of ripples by a large number of verti-
cal  sections  parallel  to  the  mean  flow  direction  (Figure  3-8).    The  trough  of  a 
ripple  is  best  defined  by  the  curve  formed  by  connecting  all  of  the  low  points  on 
these  vertical  sections  where  they  cut  the  given  trough  (Figure  3-9).    This  curve, 
which  I'll  unofficially  call  the  low-point  curve,  is  generally  sinuous  in  three 
dimensions.    The  low-point  curve  moves  downstream  with  the  ripples,  and  it 
changes  its  shape  as  it  moves,  like  a  writhing  dragon,  because  trough  depths  and 
ripple speeds change with time.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         4.2.4   As  the  low-point  curve  shifts downstream,  it  can be viewed  as having 
the  effect  of  a  cheese-slicing  wire:    it  seems  to  shave  off  the  body  of  the  ripple 
immediately  downstream  for  removal  by  erosion,  and  in  that  way  it  prepares  an 
undulating  floor  or  surface  for  the  deposition  of  advancing  foresets  by  the  ripple 
immediately upstream.   
4.2.5    Depending  on  flow  conditions  and  sediment  size,  the  foreset  laminae 
laid down by an advancing ripple vary widely in shape, from almost perfect planes 
sloping  at  the  angle  of  repose  to  sigmoidal  curves  that  meet  the  surface  of  the 
trough downstream at a small angle (Figure 3-10).  But whatever their shape, these 
laminae  are  always deposited directly on  the  erosion  surface  that's  formed  (as  just 
described above) by the downstream movement of the ripple trough into which the 
foresets prograde.   

 81

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
          4.2.6    If  no  new  sediment  is  added  to  the  bed  while  the  ripples  move,  the 
average bed elevation doesn't change with  time, and  the  invisible plane  that repre-
sents  the  average  bed  surface  stays  at  the  same  elevation.    On  the  average,  the 
foresets  deposited  by  a  given  ripple  are  entirely  eroded  away  again  as  the  next 
trough  upstream  passes  by  (Figure  3-11).    But  if  new  sediment  is  added  every-
where  to build  the bed upward,  the  ripples no  longer move parallel  to  the plane of 
the  average  bed  surface  but  instead  have  a  component  of  upward  movement 
(Figure  3-12).    The  resultant  direction  of  ripple  movement  is  described  by  the 
angle  of  climb,  denoted  by θ  in  Figure  3-12.    The  tangent  of θ  is  equal  to  the 
average rate of bed aggradation divided by the ripple speed.

4.2.7   As  the  ripples  climb  in  space,  as  described  above,  their  troughs  climb 
with  them.    So  the  erosion  surface  associated  with  the  downstream  movement  of 
the  low-point  curve  in  a  given  trough  passes  above  the  erosion  surface  that  was 
formed  when  the  preceding  trough  passed  by.    The  lowest  parts  of  the  foresets 
deposited  by  the  ripple  that  was  located  between  those  two  troughs  are  then  pre-
served  rather  than  eroded  entirely  (Figure  3-13).    This  remnant  set  is  bounded 
both above and below by erosion surfaces.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

4.2.8    Figure  3-14  shows  cross  stratification  in  an  ideally  regular  deposit 
produced  by  low-angle  climb  of  a  train  of  ripples.    The  heavy  lines  are  erosion 
surfaces, and the light lines are foreset laminae.  The profile of the ripple train as it 
existed  at  a  given  time  is  shown  also.   The  upper  parts  of  each  ripple  in  the  train, 
underneath the dashed part of the profile, were eliminated by later erosion.  In real 
cross-stratified  deposits  of  this  kind,  the  erosion  surfaces  are  irregularly  sinuous 
because  trough  geometry  changes  with  time,  and  the  sets  tend  to  pinch  out  both 
upstream  and  downstream  because  the  ripples  exist  for  only  a  finite  distance  of 
movement.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 83

 

 

 

 

    

4.2.9    It's  significant  that what's most  important  in determining  the geometry 
of  this  kind of  cross  stratification  is  the geometry of  the bed  forms  in  the  troughs, 
not near the crests.  I should also point out that the height of the sets is always less 
than  the  height  of  the  bed  forms  that were  responsible  for  the  cross  stratification.  
If  you  compare  the  height  of  the  cross-sets  with  the  height  of  the  ripples  in  the 
dashed  profile  in  Figure  3-14,  you  can  see  that  for  low  angles  of  climb,  the  set 
height is only a small fraction of the bed-form height.       
 
 
4.2.10    The  larger  the  angle  of  climb,  the  greater  the  fraction  of  foresets 
preserved.  If the angle of climb of the ripples is greater than the slope angle of the 
stoss  side  of  the  ripples,  then  laminae  are  preserved  on  the  stoss  sides  as  well  as 
on  the  lee  sides, and  the  full profile of  the  ripple  is preserved  (Figure 3-15).   This 
happens  when  the  rate  of  addition  of  new  sediment  to  the  bed  is  greater  than  the 
rate  at  which  sediment  is  transported  from  the  stoss  side  to  the  lee  side  of  the 
ripple.    The  differences  in  geometry  between  Figure  3-14  and  Figure  3-15  seem 
great,  but  keep  in  mind  that  the  differences  in  environmental  conditions  are  not 
large.  The only difference is in the value of the angle of climb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
4.2.11   The  lamination  produced when  rippl es move with  a  positive  angle  of 
climb is called climbing-ripple cross stratification.  Examples with angle of climb 
so  small  that  the  contacts  between  sets  are  erosional  (as  in  Figure  3-14) might  be 
called  erosional-stoss  climbing-ripple  cross  stratification,  and  examples  with 
angle of climb large enough for preservation of the full ripple profile (as in Figure 
3-15) might be called depositional-stoss climbing-ripple cross stratification. 
4.2.12    To  recapitulate  the  important  points  in  this  section:    cross 
stratification is formed by the erosion and deposition associated with a train of bed 
forms  as  the  average  bed  elevation  increases  by  net  addition  of  sediment  to  some 
area  of  the  bed.    The  angle  of  climb  of  the  ripples  depends  on  the  ratio  of  rate  of 
bed  aggradation  to  speed of  ripple movement.   At high  angles of  climb,  the  entire 
ripple profile is preserved, and there are no erosion surfaces in the deposit.  At low 
angles  of  climb,  only  the  lower  parts  of  foreset  deposits  are  preserved,  and  the 

 84

 

 

 

 

    

individual  sets  are  bounded  by  erosion  surfaces.    The  general  nature  of  such 
stratification  is  common  to  moving  bed  forms  of  all  sizes,  from  small  current 
ripples  to  extremely  large  subaqueous  or  eolian  dunes.    Important  differences  in 
the  details  of  stratification  geometry  arise  from  differences  in  bed-form  geometry 
and how it changes with time.                   
 
4.3  Important Kinds of Cross stratification 

 
4  .3.1  Introduction 
4.3.1.1    Here  I'll  present  the  substance  of  what  the  major  kinds  of  cross 
stratification  in  the  sedimentary  record  look  like.    They  conveniently  fall  into  (i) 
unidirectional-flow  cross  stratification,  on  a  small  scale  corresponding  to  ripples 
and  on  a  larger  scale  corresponding  to  dunes,  and  (ii)  oscillatory-flow  cross 
stratification.    Unfortunately  there's  little  I  can  say  at  present  about  combined-
flow  cross  stratification.    I'll  make  a  few  comments  about  that  in  the  section  on 
oscillatory-flow cross stratification.   

 
4  .3.2  Small-Scale Cross stratification in Unidirectional Flow 
4.3.2.1    Small-scale  cross  stratification  formed  under  unidirectional  flow  is 
associated  almost  entirely  with  the  downstream  movement  of  current  ripples.    In 
accordance with  the discussion of how moving bed  forms produce  cross-stratified 
deposits, discussed above,  the general  features of  the cross-stratification geometry 
depend on (i) the geometry of the ripples themselves, as well as how that geometry 
changes with time as the ripples move, and (ii) the angle of climb. 
4.3.2.2    For  small  angles  of  climb,  the  general  geometry  of  the  cross-strati-
fied  deposit  is  shown  by  the  block  diagram  in  Figure  3-16.    In  addition  to  the 
actual  rippled  surface,  Figure  3-16  shows  a  flow-parallel  section  and  a  flow-
transverse section perpendicular to the overall bedding.  Figure 3-16 is the real-life 
counterpart of Figure 3-14.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3.2.3  In sections parallel to flow (Figure 3-16) you see sets of laminae dip-
ping  mostly  or  entirely  in  the  same  direction  (which  is  the  flow  direction),  sepa-

 85

 

 

 

 

    

rated by  truncation surfaces.   The height of the sets is seldom greater than 2-3 cm, 
because  it's  always  some  fraction  of  the  ripple  height,  which  itself  is  seldom 
greater  than  2-3  cm.   The  set  boundaries  are  sinuous  and  irregular, because of  the 
changes  in  the  ripples  as  they move.   Sets  are  commonly  cut  out  at  some  point  in 
the downstream direction by  the overlying  truncation  surface.   This  is  a  reflection 
of  either  (i)  locally  stronger  erosion  by  a  passing  ripple  trough  or  (ii)  disappear-
ance of a given ripple as it moved downstream, by being overtaken or absorbed by 
another  faster-moving  ripple  from  upstream.    New  sets  also  appear  in  the  down-
stream direction, reflecting the birth of a new ripple in the train of ripples. 
4.3.2.4    In  sections  transverse  to  flow,  the  geometry  of  cross  stratification  is 
rather  different  (Figure  3-16):    you  see  nested  and  interleaved  sets  whose  lateral 
dimensions  are  usually  less  than  something  like  five  times  the vertical dimension.  
Each  set  is  truncated  by  one  or  more  truncation  surfaces.    These  truncation 
surfaces are mostly concave upward.   The  laminae within each set are also mostly 
concave  upward,  but  the  truncation  surfaces  generally  cut  the  laminae  discor-
dantly. 
4.3.2.5  The key to understanding this cross-stratification geometry lies in the 
geometry  of  ripple  troughs.    Remember  that  fully  developed  current  ripples  have 
strongly  three-dimensional  geometry,  and  an  important  element  of  that  three-
dimensional geometry is the existence of locally much deeper hollows or swales or 
depressions  in  ripple  troughs,  where  the  separated  flow  happens  to  become  con-
centrated (because of the details of the ripple geometry upstream) and where scour 
or erosion is much stronger.  As one of these swales moves downstream, driven by 
the  advancing  ripple  upstream,  it  carves  a  rounded  furrow  or  trench,  oriented 
parallel  to  the  flow,  which  is  then  filled  with  scoop-shaped  or  spoon-shaped 
laminae  which  are  the  foreset  deposits  of  the  upstream  ripple.    Eventually  the 
resulting  set  of  laminae  is  partly  or mostly or  even  entirely  eroded by  the passage 
of  a  locally  deeper  swale  in  some  later  ripple  trough.    This  accounts  for  both  the 
geometry of the sets and their irregular interleaving. 
4.3.2.6    On  the  rare  occasions  when  you're  able  to  see  a  planar  section 
through  the deposit parallel  to  the overall  stratification, you see a geometry which 
looks like Figure 3-17, which shows the truncated edges of sets of laminae that are 
strongly concave downstream, separated laterally by truncation surfaces.   This has 
been  called  rib  and  furrow    (not  a  very  descriptive  term).    It's  an  excellent  pale-
ocurrent indicator.

          4.3.2.7    For  large  angles  of  climb,  the  general  geometry  of  the  cross-strati-
fied  deposit  is  shown  by  the  block  diagram  in  Figure  3-18.    In  addition  to  the 
actual  rippled  surface,  Figure  3-18  shows  a  flow-parallel  section  and  a  flow-
transverse  section  perpendicular  to  the  overall  bedding.    Compare  Figure  3-18 
with Figure 3-16.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
       4.3.2.8  In sections parallel to flow, you see mostly continuous laminae whose 
shapes  reflect  the  profiles  of  the  ripples  which  were  moving  downstream  while 
sediment was added to the bed.  The local angles of climb vary from place to place 
in  the  deposit,  because  the  speeds  of  the  ripples  are  highly  variable  in  time.    So 
unless  the  overall  angle  of  climb  is  very  high,  there  are  likely  to  be  a  few 
discontinuous  truncation  surfaces,  where  a  particular  ripple moved  temporarily  at 
a speed much greater than average.   
4.3.2.9  In sections transverse to flow, you usually see just irregularly sinuous 
laminae  which  reflect  the  changing  flow-transverse  profiles  of  the  ripples  as  they 
passed a given cross-section of the flow. 
4.3.2.10    Remember  that  for  intermediate  angles  of  climb,  the  stratification 
geometry  is  intermediate  between  the  two  end  members  presented  above.    As  the 
angle  of  climb  increases,  the  density  and  extent  of  truncation  surfaces  bounding 
the sets decreases, and the average set thickness increases.   
4.3.2.11    For  a  given  sand  size,  current  ripples  in  equilibrium  with  the  flow 
don't  vary  greatly  in  either  size  or  geometry  with  flow  velocity,  so  unfortunately 
there's  little  possibility  of  using  the  details  of  stratification  geometry  to  say 
anything precise about the flow strength.       
 
4  .3.3  Large-Scale Cross stratification in Unidirectional Flow 
4.3.3.1    Large-scale  cross  stratification  formed  under  unidirectional  flow  is 
mostly  associated  with  the  downstream  movement  of  dunes.    Again  the  general 
features  of  the  cross-stratification  geometry  depend  on  the  geometry  of  the  dunes 
and the angle of climb.   
4.3.3.2  Remember that dunes formed at relatively low flow velocities have a 
tendency  to  be  two-dimensional:    their  crests  and  troughs  are  nearly  continuous 

 87

 

 

 

 

    

and  fairly  straight,  and  the  elevations of  the  crests  and  troughs  are nearly uniform 
in  the  direction  transverse  to  flow.    On  the  other  hand,  at  relatively  high  flow 
velocities  the  dunes  are  moderately  to  strongly  three-dimensional,  in  much  the 
same way  that  ripples  are  three-dimensional.   You  should  expect  the  geometry  of 
cross  stratification  to  vary  greatly  depending  on  whether  the  dunes  were  two-di-
mensional or three-dimensional. 
4.3.3.3   Three-dimensional  dunes  produce  cr oss  stratification  that's  quali-
tatively  similar  in  geometry  to  the  small-scale  cross  stratification  produced  by 
ripples.    You  might  reread  the  earlier  section  and  apply  it  to  the  stratification 
produced by three-dimensional dunes. 
4.3.3.4    Figure  3-19  is  a  block  diagram  of  cross  stratification  produced  by 
three-dimensional  dunes  in  unidirectional  flows.    It  shows  the  dune-covered  bed 
surface and sections perpendicular to the overall plane of stratification and parallel 
and  transverse  to  the  flow  direction.    Most  of  what  I  said  about  the  analogous 
section  in Figure 3-16  for  cross  stratification produced by  ripples at  low angles of 
climb  is applicable  to Figure 3-19 as well.   Set  thickness  ranges  from  less  than 10 
cm to as much as a few meters. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
4.3.3.5    Figure  3-20  is  a  corresponding  block  diagram  of  cross  stratification 
produced by almost perfectly  two-dimensional dunes  in unidirectional flows.   The 
stratification geometry is rather different from that in Figure 4-19:  in flow-parallel 
sections  the  sets  extend  somewhat  farther  and  the  set  boundaries  are  less  sinuous, 
but  the  biggest  difference  is  in  flow-transverse  sections,  where  both  the  sets  and 
the  truncational  set  boundaries  are  much  more  extensive  and  show  much  less 
upward concavity.  This is because of the absence of locally strong scour swales in 
the troughs of the dunes.   
 
 
         4.3.3.6   There's a whole  spectrum of  intermediate  cases  for which  the cross-
stratification  geometry  is  less  regular  than  the  extreme  case  shown  in Figure  3-22 
but not as irregular as in Figure 3-19. 

 88

 

 

 

 

    

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

4.3.3.7    In both Figure 3-19 and Figure 3-20,  the angle of climb of  the dunes 
is  very  small.    Dunes  sometimes  climb  at  higher  angles,  but  that's  not  nearly  as 
common  as  for  ripples,  because  it's  uncommon  for  fairly  coarse  sediment  to  be 
settling  abundantly out of  suspension over  large  areas  to build up  the bed  rapidly.  
In  the  very  few  cases  I've  seen,  the  geometry  of  cross  stratification  is  very  much 
like that shown in Figure 3-18.        

 
4  .3.4  Cross stratification in Oscillatory Flow 
4.3.4.1    Remember  that  in  truly  symmetrical  oscillatory  flow  at  low  to 
moderate  oscillation  periods  and  low  to  moderate  oscillation  speeds,  the  bed 
configuration  is  symmetrical  two-dimensional  oscillation  ripples.    Under  these 
conditions,  the  sediment  transport  is  also  strictly  symmetrical  in  the  two  flow  di-
rections. You might expect the ripples to remain in one place indefinitely.  Then if 
sediment is supplied from suspension to build up the bed, symmetrical oscillation-
ripple  cross  stratification  with  vertical  climb  would  be  produced  (Figure  3-21).  
Although  this  kind  of  stratification  is  present  in  the  sedimentary  record,  it's  not 
common,  presumably  because  even  in  purely  oscillatory  flow  there's  usually  a 
minor  degree  of  asymmetry  of  sediment  transport  which  causes  the  ripples  to 
move slowly in one direction or the other.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 89

 

 

 

 

    

4.3.4.2    Figure  3-22  is  an  attempt  to  account  for  oscillatory-flow  cross 
stratification  types produced by  the buildup of  two-dimensional oscillation  ripples 
as  a  function  of  (i)  the  slow  net  rate  of  ripple  movement  and  (ii)  the  rate  of 
aggradation  of  the  bed.    Along  the  vertical  axis,  for  zero  ripple  movement,  is 
symmetrical  oscillation-ripple  cross  stratification,  of  the  kind  I  mentioned  above 
might  be  expected  deductively.    The  chevron-like  interleaving  of  laminae  at  the 
ripple crests, shown schematically,  results  from minor shifts  in crest position back 
and  forth  during  aggradation.    This  is  shown  by  the  first  box  from  the  top  in 
Figure 3-22.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
4.3.4.3    If  the  ripple  speed  is  nonzero  but  slow  relative  to  aggradation  rate, 
the  angle  of  climb  is  steep  and  the  entire  ripple  profile  is  preserved  (see  second 
box  from  the  top  in  Figure  3-22).    If  the  ripple  speed  is  large  relative  to  the 
aggradation  rate,  ripple  troughs  erode  into  previously  deposited  laminae,  and  the 
stratification shows laminae dipping in one direction only, in sets bounded by ero-
sion  surfaces  (see  the  third box  from  the  top  in Figure 3-22).   This  last  type  is  the 
most  common  in  the  sedimentary  record.   Note  that  this  stratification  differs  only 
in  detail,  and  not  in  general  features,  from  low-angle  climbing-ripple  cross 
stratification produced by ripples in unidirectional flows, discussed in the previous 
section.  Finally, if a preexisting bed is molded into slowly shifting oscillation rip-
ples  without  any  net  aggradation  of  the  bed,  the  thickness  of  the  cross-stratified 
deposit is equal to only one ripple height (see the bottom box in Figure 3-22).     
4.3.4.4   In  the real world, oscillation-ripple  stratification  is  likely  to be more 
complicated,  because  wave  conditions  seldom  remain  the  same  for  long.  
Commonly  there  are  a  large  number  of  sets  of  laminae  dipping more  or  less  ran-
domly in both directions.   
4.3.4.5   The origin and classification of stratification produced by oscillatory 
flows  at  longer  oscillation  periods  and  higher  oscillation  velocities  is  much  less 

 90

 

 

 

 

    

well  understood,  because  there  have  been  no  studies  in  natural  environments  in 
which  first  the  bed  configuration  was  observed  while  the  flow  conditions  were 
measured  and  then  the  bed  was  sampled  to  see  the  resulting  deposit.    And  until 
only  recently  there  had  been  no  studies  under  laboratory  conditions.    Another  el-
ement  of  complexity  is  that  in  the  natural  environment  the  oscillatory  flows  are 
likely  to  be  more  complicated  than  the  regular  and  symmetrical  bidirectional  os-
cillatory flows that were assumed above, and essentially nothing is known in detail 
about  the  stratification  types  produced  by  these  more  complicated  oscillatory 
flows.   
4.3.4.6  In the face of this seemingly hopeless situation, I'll take the following 
approach.  I'll describe in a general way a common style of medium-scale to large-
scale cross stratification, called hummocky cross stratification, which is generally 
believed  to  be  produced  by  some  kind  of  oscillatory  flow,  and  I'll  present  what 
evidence  I  can  for  the  kinds  of  flows  that  might  produce  hummocky  cross 
stratification. 
4.3.4.7   Figure 3-23  is a block diagram of one of  the common styles of cross 
stratification  that's  been  called  hummocky  cross  stratification.    It  shows  sets  of 
laminae  that  are  both  concave  upward  and  convex  upward,  bounded  by  broad 
truncation  surfaces  which  themselves  may  be  either  concave  or  convex  upward.  
Two  characteristic  small-scale  features  of  the geometry of  stratification  are  (i)  the 
fanning  of  truncation  surfaces  laterally  into  conformable  sequences  of  laminae 
(Figure  3-24)  and, where  the  thickness  of  the  bed  is  great  enough  to  observe  this, 
(ii) a  tendency  for convex-up sets of  laminae  to be succeeded upward by concave-
up sets, and vice-versa (Figure 3-25).

4.3.4.8   Note  that  the  two normal-to-bedding  faces of  the block are shown  to 
have  about  the  same  style  of  stratification,  and  on  each  face  there's  no  strongly 
preferred dip direction.  In the rare cases where you can make serial sections of the 
deposit  to  ascertain  the  entire  three-dimensional geometry of  the deposit,  it's  clear 
that  there's  no  preferred  dip  direction  in  the  entire  deposit.    This  is  the  kind  of 
stratification I call isotropic. 
4.3.4.9  The upper surface of the block diagram in Figure 3-23 is shown to be 
a bedding  surface with  a bed  configuration  that  could be described  as  a  collection 
of hummocks  (locally positive  convex-up  areas)  and  swales  (locally negative  con-
cave-up  areas).    Sometimes,  but  not  often,  the  upper  surface  of  a  bed  with  hum-
mocky cross stratification can be seen to have just this bed geometry.  The general 
belief  is  that  isotropic  hummocky  cross  stratification  is  produced  by  this  kind  of 
bed configuration, although it's seldom possible to actually demonstrate this. 
4.3.4.10   Very  recent  preliminary  experiments  have  shown  that  bed  configu-
rations which  in  their  general  features  are  like  those  just  described  are  produced 
by symmetrical bidirectional oscillatory flows at long periods and high oscillation 
velocities.  This suggests that at least some isotropic hummocky cross stratification 
is produced by such flows.  But it also seems likely that more complex oscillations 
with  more  than  one  oscillatory  component  would  also  produce  qualitatively 
similar  bed  configurations  and  therefore  similar  cross  stratification.   Much more 
work  needs  to  be  done  before  the  origin  of  hummocky  cross  stratification  is  well 
understood. 
4.3.4.11   This brings us to the problem of combined-flow cross stratification.  
Unfortunately  there's  an  almost complete  lack of observational  information on  the 
origin of combined-flow cross stratification, so we have no actual models to guide 
interpretations.    Up  to  now  the  recognition  of  combined-flow  cross  stratification 
has been a strictly deductive matter.   

 92

 

 

 

 

    

4.3.4.12    It  seems  convenient  to  think  separately  about  the  relatively  small 
combined-flow  ripples  produced  under  combinations  of  relatively  low  oscillatory 
and  unidirectional  flow  velocities,  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  relatively  large  com-
bined-flow  ripples produced under combinations of  relatively high oscillatory and 
unidirectional flow velocities, on the other hand. 
4.3.4.13    When  the  combinations  of  oscillation  period  and  oscillation  ve-
locity  are  such  that  in  purely  oscillatory  flow  the  ripples  would  be  at  about  the 
same  scale  as  current  ripples,  there's  a  kind  of  coherence  in  the  combined-flow 
ripples:    they're  on  the  same  scale  as  unidirectional-flow  ripples,  but more  nearly 
two-dimensional.    Actual  experiments  indicate  that  only  a  very  small  unidirec-
tional component is needed to make such ripples noticeably asymmetrical.   
4.3.4.14    But  for  very  short  periods  or  very  long  periods,  when  the  ripples 
that would be produced in purely oscillatory flow are much smaller or much larger 
than current ripples, the situation is more complicated, because in combined flows 
the bed configuration wants  to be at  two separate scales, and there's a complicated 
interaction  between  the  two  differing  scales.   There  have  been  no  detailed  studies 
of the stratification produced under these combined-flow conditions. 
4.3.4.15    The  large  oscillation  ripples  in  fine  sediments  which  are  known  to 
be produced  at  long periods and high velocities become  asymmetrical  in  the pres-
ence  of  even  fairly  weak  unidirectional  components,  and  the  stratification  they 
produce  during  bed  aggradation  is  probably  what  many  workers  recognize  as 
anisotropic  hummocky  cross  stratification.    But  detailed  interpretations  are  a 
matter for the future. 
4.3.4.16   Also  still unstudied  is  the geometry of  cross  stratification produced 
when  unidirectional-flow  dunes  are  subjected  to  a  nonnegligible  oscillatory  com-
ponent.    This  situation must  be  important  in  natural  environments,  but  systematic 
studies have yet to be made in either the field or the laboratory. 
 

4.3.5  Eolian Cross stratification 
 
4.3.5.1   So  far our account of cross  stratification has  implicitly been directed 
toward subaqueous bed configurations.  Everyone knows that the shifting of eolian 
dunes  produces  large-scale  cross  stratification  too.    To  first  order,    eolian  dune 
cross  stratification  is  similar  in  gross  aspects  to  subaqueous  dune  cross 
stratification.    But  behind  the  gross  similarity  are  real  differences.    These 
differences  are  simply  a  consequence  of  the  differing  details  of  geometry  of  the 
dunes themselves, and of the sediment transport over them.  
 
θ    Eolian  cross  stratification  tends  to  have  a  "swoopy"  look  (pardon  the 
looseness of terminology here) that's difficult to pin down in detail.  We think that 
that  look  reflects  the  tendency  for  the  troughs  of  eolian  dunes  to  be  filled  by 
plastering of new trough laminae not just on the mean-upcurrent side, as is usually 
the  case  in  subaqueous  cross  stratification,  but  on  the  lateral  and  mean-
downcurrent sides as well. 
θ   Eolian  cross  stratification  is more  likely  to  show greater dispersion of dip 
directions  of  cross-sets,  because  of  the  greater  variability  of  wind  directions  than 
of  subaqueous  current  directions.    (But  this  is  not  as  strong  a  tendency  as  you 
might  think,  because  most  of  the  major  eolian  sand  bodies  preserved  in  the 

 93

 

 

 

 

    

sedimentary  record  were  probably  produced  in  sand  seas  swept  by  winds  fairly 
constant in direction.) 
θ  The nature of the lamination  in eolian cross-sets tends to be different from 
that in subaqueous cross-sets.  The three basic kinds of laminae in cross-sets are: 
—   grain-flow  laminae ,  produced  by  the  downslope  movement  of  grain 
flows  to  iron  out  the  oversteepening  of  the  foreset  slope  caused  by  deposition  at 
the brink 
—   grain-fall  laminae ,  produced  by  the  rain  of  sand  grains  onto  the  foreset 
slope after they are carried across the brink in saltation 
—   translatent  laminae ,  produced  by  the  movement  and  very-low-angle 
climb of ripples on sand surfaces that are undergoing net aggradation 
The  first  two  kinds  of  laminae  are  common  to  both  subaerial  and  subaqueous 
cross-sets,  but  they  are  much  more  distinctive  and  better  differentiated  in  sub-
aerial deposits.   Translatent laminae are specific to subaerial deposits, because in 
subaqueous  environments  the  scale  and  movement  of  ripples  in  dune-lee  envi-
ronments  is  such  as  to  produce  recognizable  small-scale  cross-lamination  rather 
than  laminae so  thin  that  the cross-stratified nature  is undetectible, as in the eolian 
case.  

 
4.3.6  Cross stratification Not Produced by Climbing Bed Forms 
 
 
4.3.6.1    After  all  of  the  foregoing  voluminous  material  on  how  to  deal  with 
cross  stratification  produced  by  trains  of  repetitive  bed  forms  that  climb  at  some 
angle owing  to net  aggradation of  the bed,  it's  important  to point out here  that not 
all  cross  stratification  is  produced  by  bed  forms  climbing  at  some  angle—
although  we  think  it's  fair  to  say  that  most  of  the  cross  stratification  you  see  is 
indeed formed in that way. 
4.3.6.2  One case in point is pretty obvious, and has been touched upon in the 
earlier part of this chapter:  
  
a  train  of  flow-transverse  bed  forms  is  produced  by  a 
neutral  flow  (by  "neutral" we mean  that  there's  neither 
net  aggradation  or  net  degradation)  over  a  loose  sed-
iment  bed,  then  the  flow  quits,  and  later  the  train  of 
bed  forms  is mantled  or  draped  by  sediment  deposited 
in  such  a way  as not  to disturb  that underlying  train of 
bed  forms  (by  fallout  without  traction,  for  the  most 
part).  
  
This  kind  of  cross  stratification  might  be  termed,  unofficially,  single-bed-form-
train cross stratification.   It's common in both oscillatory flow and unidirectional 
flow.  Depending on the thickness of movable sediment the flow has to operate on, 
and  the  size  of  the  bed  forms  the  flow wants  to make,  the  train  of  bed  forms may 
be starved (Figure 3-25A), full (Figure 3-25B), or starting to climb up one another 
(Figure 3-25C).

4.3.6.3    Usually  the  material  presented  so  far  in  this  section  on  cross 
stratification  is  relevant  to  small-scale  bed  configurations—ripples  of  various 
kinds—but  sometimes  single  trains  of  much  larger  dunes  are  formed  and  then 
interred  within  different,  or  at  least  differently  structured,  sediment.    When  the 
dunes  have  large  spacings  and  small  height-to-spacing  ratios,  there's  the  added 
complication that you may on the outcrop see a segment of a dune that's very short 
relative  to  the dune spacing, and  the cross stratification looks like a planar-tabular 
set  with  uniform  thickness  (Figure  3-26).    We  know  of  no  way  of  knowing,  just 
from looking at an outcrop like Figure 3-26, what the original spacing of the dunes 
was—or even if I'm really dealing with a train of dunes in the first place!

4.3.6.4  In a situation like that shown in Figure 3-26, there's also the problem 
of whether  the  full height of  the dune  is preserved.   You might find features at  the 
upper  surface  of  the  cross-set  that  gives  evidence  of  its  having  been  the  exposed 
upper surface of a dune, like superimposed smaller bed forms.  Although that's not 
foolproof, it would suggest strongly that the dune was not eroded or shaved off by 
a later strong current after its own driving current ceased. 
4.3.6.5  Finally, cross stratification can be formed by the progradation of the 
sloping surface of an  isolated element of positive relief, like a sand bar or shoal or 
delta body.   Scales of such features can range up  to very  large.   Deciding between 
this  situation  and  the one described  above  (a  small part of  a  single  train of dunes) 
would  be  impossible  without  a  degree  of  lateral  control  not  usually  available  in 
outcrop. 
 

5.  PLANAR STRATIFICATION 
5.1    There  is  not  as  much  to  say  about  planar  stratification  as  there  is  about 
cross stratification—because  its geometry  in  inherently simpler!   That’s not  to say 
that  it  is not  important:    there  is at  least as much planar stratification  in particulate 
sediments  and  sedimentary  rocks  (conglomerates,  sandstones,  siltstones,  shales, 
and  limestones)  as  there  is  cross  stratification,  and  even  more  in  gravels  and 
conglomerates,  in  particular.    Planar  stratification  is  also  common  in  carbonate 
rocks, although less so than in siliciclastics.   It is unfortunately true, however, that 
the possibilities  for  interpretation of depositional conditions are less abundant for 
planar stratification than for cross stratification. 
5.2    We  need  to  make  a  distinction  here  between  planar  stratification  in 
which an entire bed, which might be as much as some meters thick, has an overall 
planar  geometry,  in  the  sense  that  the  lower  and  upper  surfaces  of  the  bed  are 
planar (the geometry of such a bed could also be described as tabular), on the one 
hand  (this  might  best  be  called  planar  bedding),  and  planar  stratification  within 
such  an  overall  planar–tabular  bed,  on  the  other  hand  (Figure  3-27).    The  latter 
kind of planar  stratification usually comprises  strata  that are  sufficiently  thin as  to 
be  called  laminae,  in  which  case  we  talk  of  planar  lamination,  or  a  planar-
laminated  bed.    (Keep  in  mind  the  terminological  distinction  between  beds  and 
laminae.)

5.3  What is the origin of planar lamination? 
•    In  many  cases,  especially  in  fine  siliciclastic  sediments  and  sedimentary 
rocks, it must certainly be the outcome of deposition by fallout without traction in 
which  the  nature  of  the  settling  material  varies,  for  some  reason,  with  time.    The 
differences  might  be  in  particle  size  or  in  composition.    Such  lamination  is 
commonly  way  down  in  the  submillimeter  thickness  range.   Many mudrocks  and 
shales show such planar lamination. 
•   Planar  stratification  is also common  in  successions of  interbedded  thin  (on 
a  centimeter  or  even  a  millimeter  scale)  event  siltstones  or  very  fine  sandstones 
and “background”  (that  is,  fallout-without-traction) mudrocks or  shales.   You will 
learn more about such event beds later.  In brief, an event stratum (usually referred 
to  as  an  event  bed)  is  any  stratum  that  was  deposited  by  a  brief  event,  on  a 
geologically  instantaneous  time  scale,  by  such  things  as  turbidity  currents,  debris 
flows, river floods, or shallow-marine storms. 
•  In many well-sorted coarse siltstones and sandstones, the planar lamination 
is  the  outcome  of  fallout  with  traction  or  of  differential  transport  (See  the 
discussion  of  modes  of  deposition  at  the  end  of  the  preceding  chapter.)    How 
might we  know  that?   Because  of  its  commonly  close  association with  ripple  and 
dune  stratification  In  what  seems  to  be  a  flow  environment  in  which  the  flow 
strength is decreasing with time (from plane-bed transport to ripples or dunes). 
5.4    In  interpreting  planar  lamination,  there  is  a  kind  of  “awkward  range”  in 
particle  size  in  which  the  size  is  not  fine  enough  for  a  confident  interpretation  of 
fallout  without  traction  but  not  coarse  enough  for  a  clear  interpretation  of  a 
strong  flow.   To put that another way, with increasing particle size it becomes less 
and  less  likely  that  the  flow  could  be  carrying  enough  sediment  in  suspension  to 
form  a  planar-laminated  deposit  just  by  fallout  without  traction—because  the 
settling  velocity  increases  rapidly  with  particle  size,  thereby  cutting  down  the 
possible distance over which suspension fallout can occur. 
5.5    In  planar  lamination  in  sands  and  sandstones,  the  differences  in  particle 
characteristics from lamina to lamina are usually subtle, even to the point at which 
it  takes  special  observational  techniques  (like  x-radiography  of  thin  slabs  cut 
normal  to  stratification)  even  to  detect  its  presence.    In  some  cases,  slightly 
varying concentrations of dark particles (heavy minerals; scraps of organic matter) 
highlight  the  lamination;  usually,  however,  there  are  only  slight  differences  in 
mean  size  and/or  sorting.    Such  differences  are  often  detectable  on  a  fresh 
sediment  surface  but  become  accentuated  by  weathering  of  a  rock  surface  or  by 
etching of an unconsolidated sediment surface by drying by the wind. 
5.6    For  a  long  time  the  origin  of  the  slight  differences  in  texture  in  planar-
laminated  sandstones  was  poorly  understood.    Laboratory  experiments  in  recent 
years,  however,  have  revealed  that  much  if  not  most  such  planar  lamination  is 
generated by the downstream movement of very low-amplitude bed waves (akin to 
very low, shingle-like dunes) on an almost planar transport surface.

6.  SOLE MARKS 
 
6.1    Sole  marks  are  another  important  kind  of  sedimentary  structure,  less 
common  than  cross  stratification.    Sole marks  are  geometrical  features  produced 
on a sediment bed by erosion by a strong current  (flute marks), or by mechanical 
disruption of the bed by large objects carried by a strong current (tool marks).   
6.2  The line between bed configurations and sole marks is not entirely sharp, 
but with sole marks we're dealing with a short-lived current acting upon a semico-
hesive  bed,  usually  of  mud.    This  is  usually  a  sediment  gravity  flow  in  a  moder-
ately deep marine environment (if you mention sole marks  to most soft-rock geol-
ogists  they'll  think  of  turbidites),  but  strong  currents  in  other  situations  can make 
sole marks as well. 
6.3   Strong  currents are  known  to produce  erosional  flutes with  characteris-
tic  geometries  on  semicohesive  mud  beds.    The  flutes  range  in  scale  from  just  a 
few  centimeters  across  to  giants  a  few  meters  across.    They  are  narrow,  steep-
sided, and often curled at the upcurrent end, and wider and shallower downstream.  
They  thus make  excellent  paleocurrent  indicators.    Their  origin was  first  deduced 
from  the  ancient  record,  but  they  have  since  been  reproduced  beautifully  in  the 
laboratory.  
6.4    Important:   you almost always see sole marks  in negative relief, because 
usually  the  strong  current  that  makes  the  marks  later  deposits  a  bed  of  sand  (or 
even  gravel).   After  burial,  lithification,  uplift,  and  erosion, what  remains  for  you 
to  see,  usually  in  outcrops  with  steep  dips,  is  the  underside  of  the  sandstone  bed, 
the shale having been weathered away. For this reason you often see the term flute 
cast (although curiously, one never sees the term "tool cast"!).  
6.5    I  won't  illustrate  sole  marks  here,  because  I'll  have  slides  for  you  later.

tures. 

 
7.  SOFT-SEDIMENT DEFORMATION 

  
7.1  Introduction 
 
7.1.1  The only other kind of sedimentary structure I'll talk about here is soft-
sediment  deformation,  also  called  (less  felicitously)  penecontemporaneous 
deformation:    deformation,  usually  of  the  continuous  sort  involving  folding  and 
contortions,  that developed  long before  the sediment was  lithified.   One often sees 
mildly to grossly deformed strata, on scales of centimeters to a few meters, that by 
various  kinds  of  evidence must  have  happened  only  shortly  after  burial, when  the 
sediment  was  still  effectively  noncohesive  and  buried  less  than  a  few  meters.  
Some deformation can be shown to have happened even earlier—during, not after, 
deposition.   
7.1.2    There  are  several  common  styles  of  soft-sediment  deformation,  and  a 
thorough  analysis  of  the  mechanics  involved  would  take  a  lot  of  time  and  space.  
All  I'll  do  here  is  point  out what must  be  the  principal  underlying  reasons  for  the 
occurrence  of  soft-sediment  deformation,  and  some  brief  description  and  illustra-
tion of the most common kinds. 

 98

 

 

 

 

    

7.1.3  Sediments ranging from coarse silt size up into the gravel range can be 
viewed  as  a  packed  framework  of  grains  in  mutual  contact.    Usually,  however, 
grain-by-grain  depositional  mechanisms  are  such  that  the  resulting  deposit  is  not 
packed  as  closely  as  possible:    the  porosity  is  greater,  and  the  number  of  grains 
contacts  smaller,  than  the  ultimate  values  attainable  by  rearrangement  of  the 
grains.    So  any  kind  of  disturbance  to  the  sediment  bed,  like  an  earthquake,  can 
cause  a  sudden  repacking of  the grains:    the grains  fall  into a new, closer packing 
in a kind of wave that sweeps through a more or less large volume of the sediment.  
As  this  happens,  the  repacking  sediment  finds  itself  suffused  with  excess  pore 
water,  which  can  do  nothing  but  drain  more  or  less  slowly  outward  by  flowing 
through  the  surrounding  porous  sediment.    While  there  is  excess  pore  water,  the 
sediment  is  in  a  liquefied  state,  in  that  it  is  not  locked  into  packing  by  being  in 
contact with surrounding grains.  This process is called liquefaction.  Especially in 
finer  sediments,  like  silts  and  very  fine  sands,  the  permeability  is  so  small,  owing 
to  the  smallness of  the pore passageways,  that  the  sediment  remains  in a  liquefied 
state for some time—long enough to deform under the influence of whatever small 
anisotropic stress field happens to be present within the sediment.  
 
7.2  Styles of Soft-Sediment Deformation 
 
Loading.    Sometimes  the  stratification  in  a  sedimentary  sequence  is  gravita-
tionally  unstable,  in  that  a  given  bed  has  a  greater  bulk  density  than  the  bed  un-
derlying  it.   Then,  if  the  sediment becomes mobilized  as discussed  above,  there  is 
a  tendency  for  the material  of  the  overlying  bed  to  sink  down  into  the  underlying 
bed  and  (usually more  diffusely)  for  the material  of  the  underlying  bed  to  rise  up 
into the overlying material.  This phenomenon is called loading (Figure 3-28).   
In  mild  cases,  there  is  just  some  local  and  partial  downward  motion  of  the 
overlying  bed  into  the  underlying  bed,  especially  in  places  where  the  contact 
between  the  two  beds  is  convex  downward  owing  to  deposition.    Loading  of  this 
kind  is  usually  seen where  a water-rich  sand  bed was  deposited  over  a  semicohe-
sive  mud  bed.    Sole  markings,  for  example,  are  often  accentuated,  sometimes 
grossly so, by later loading.

masses  end  up  with  concave-up  stratification  that  is  terminated  abruptly  around 
the  margins  of  the  sunken  mass.    This  called  ball-and-pillow  structure  (Figure 
3-29). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Slump  folding.   Another kind of soft-sediment deformation  is slump  folding 
(Figure  3-30).    When  sediment  on  a  slope  is  liquefied,  it  tends  to  flow  or  slide 
down  the slope, even  if  the slope angle  is only a few degrees.   Various patterns of 
folding  develop,  with  downslope  vergence  of  the  folds.    The  folds  are 
characteristically  tight,  often  even  isoclinal  and  recumbent.    Scales  range  up  to 
some meters.  Sometimes these folds are truncated by erosion and overlain by very 
similar  sedimentary  material,  emphasizing  the  slight  depth  of  burial  of  material 
when  it  is  deformed.    Such  erosion  is  presumptive  evidence  of  penecon-
temporaneity  (but  you  have  to  make  sure  that  what  you're  thinking  is  an  erosion 
surface isn't instead a gently dipping local fault associated with the deformation!).

Convolute  lamination.    Finally,  another  style  of  soft-sediment  folding, 
called  convolute  lamination,  is  characteristic  of  beds  of  fine  sand,  up  to  a  meter 
thick,  deposited  rapidly  by  such  events  as  turbidity  currents  (Figure  3-31).    The 
beds  have  planar  lower  and  also  upper  contacts,  but  the  bed  is  internally  folded 
into  broad  synclines  and  sharp  to  dome-shaped  or  even  mushroom-shaped  anti-
clines, which  usually  die  out  upward  to  planarity  at  the  upper  contact. Sometimes 
it  can  even  be  demonstrated  that  the  folding  developed  concurrently  with  the  de-
velopment  and  downcurrent  movement  of  ripples  on  the  rapidly  aggrading 
transport surface.  
 

8.  OTHER SEDIMENTARY STRUCTURES 
 
Aside  from  stratification,  sole  marks,  and  soft-sediment  deformation,  there 
are  many  other  kinds  of  sedimentary  structures.    In  this  final  “wastebasket” 
section,  I’ll  mention  a  few  other  primary  sedimentary  structures.    Beyond  that, 
there  are  biogenic  sedimentary  structures  (trace  fossils),  which  I  will  describe  in 
more detail in a later chapter. 
 
•    desiccation  cracks:    Also  called,  less  precisely  mud  cracks,  these  are 
tension cracks or fractures that extend downward from a bed top into the sediment 
below.    They  are  arranged  in  a  network,  which  in  some  cases  comprises  nearly 
regular  hexagons  or  rectangles  but  more  commonly  are  of  irregular  geometry.  
Their   characteristic  spacing  ranges  from a  few centimeters  to many decimeters  in 
extreme cases.  They commonly taper downward to a sharp lower end, at depths of 
centimeters  to  as  much  as  a  few  decimeters  in  extreme  cases.    It  is  clear  that  the 
form  during  shrinkage  consequent  upon  drying  of  the  a  surficial  layer  of 
unconsolidated  sediment.    The  sediment  can  shrink  vertically  with  no  cracking, 
but lateral shrinkage causes tensile stresses that result in the cracking. 
The  significance  of  desiccation  cracks  is  the  evidence  they  give  of  subaerial 
exposure  of  the  sediment  surface—that  is,  emergence  of  a  previously  submerged 
depositional  surface.    They  can  also  be  a  top-and-bottom  indicator,  inasmuch  as 
they  commonly  taper  downward,  are  capped  above  by  a  later-deposited  bed,  and 
are  filled  with  that  same  later-deposited  sediment  (Figure  3-31).    In  some  cases, 
when  a  thin bed  is undergoes desiccation  cracking,  the  individual  segments of  the 
cracked bed curl upward, and the later-deposited sediment insinuates itself beneath 
the up-curled edges (Figure 3-32).

Figure 3-32: Desiccation cracks 

•  Raindrop impressions:  When a soft, moist surface of freshly deposited 
sediment is exposed to a brief, light shower of large raindrops, tiny craters, 
circular in outline and with a slightly raised rim, are imprinted upon the sediment 
surface.  If they survive long enough to be buried by later deposition, they can be 
preserved intact in the sedimentary record Figure 3-33:  Shrock, R.R., 1948, 
Sequence in Layered Rocks:  McGraw-Hill, 507 p.  (p. 142, Figure 141).  As with 
desiccation cracks (although they are much less common), they give excellent 
evidence of subaerial emergence and also of tops and bottoms. 
 
•    Graded  bedding:    If  the  particle  size  in  a  siliciclastic  bed  varies 
systematically  upward  through  the  bed,  the  bed  is  said  to  be  graded.    (In  a  sense, 
graded  bedding  lies  somewhere  between  being  a  texture  and  a  structure,  but 
because  I  did  not mention  it  in Chapter  1,  I’m mentioning  it  here.)    If  the  particle 
size  decreases  upward,  the  bed  is  said  to  be  normally  graded;  if  the  particle  size 
increases upward, the bed is said to be reversely graded or inversely graded (both 
terms are in use). 
The  term  “normal”  probably  arose  because  of  the  belief,  commonly  but  not 
always  justified,  that  in  the  normal  course  of  a  depositional  event  the  strength  of 
the depositing  flow,  and  thereby  the particle  size of  the  sediment being deposited, 
decreases.  Accounting for reverse grading is not as simple:  one might appeal to a 
strengthening  flow,  or,  alternatively,  to  collapse  and  immobilization  of  a  highly 
concentrated flow in which, for dynamical reasons that remain unclear, the particle 
size in the moving sediment–water mixture increases upward. 
Some workers have appealed  to a simple kinematic effect  that might account 
for  reverse grading:    the kinetic  sieve effect, whereby  finer particles can  find  their 
way  relatively  easily  downward  among  coarser  particles  but  coarser  particles 
cannot find their way easily down among finer particles. 
A  distinction  can  be  made  between  two  kinds  of  grading:    distribution 
grading, whereby  the entire  frequency distribution of  the sediment shifts  toward a 
finer  or  a  coarser  mean  size,  and  coarse-tail  grading,  whereby  the  frequency 
distribution  of  the  main  mass  of  the  sediment  stays  about  the  same  but  the 
percentage of sediment in the coarse tail of the distribution changes significantly.
