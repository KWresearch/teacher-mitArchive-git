DIAGENESIS 

 
 
 

 

1.  INTRODUCTION 
1.1  Diagenesis is the term used for all of the changes that a sediment 
undergoes after deposition and before the transition to metamorphism.  The 
multifarious processes that come under the term diagenesis are chemical, physical, 
and biological.  They include compaction, deformation, dissolution, cementation, 
authigenesis, replacement, recrystallization, hydration, bacterial action, and 
development of concretions.  (Soft-sediment deformation can be included in 
diagenesis, but not hard-rock folding and faulting.)  You can see from that 
complete, albeit not exhaustive, list that diagenesis involves a wide range of 
disparate, but in many cases related, processes.  If you like, you could think of 
diagenesis as weird and terrible things that happen to sediments when they are 
buried. 
1.2  The two most important diagenetic processes are compaction (the topic 
of a later section), and lithification, the term used for the complex of processes—
including compaction—by which a loose sediment is converted into a solid 
sedimentary rock.  A variety of processes mentioned or described in later sections 
of this chapter contribute to the general process of lithification. 
1.3  The study of diagenesis continues to be an active field of research in 
sedimentary geology, in part because the variety and complexity of the processes 
involved has left many uncertainties, but also because of the importance of 
diagenesis to petroleum geology, inasmuch as diagenesis is a significant control 
on porosity and permeability of deeply buried sedimentary rocks, comprising the 
fine siliciclastic source beds, the coarser reservoir rocks, and the seals that cause 
those reservoir rocks to be petroleum reservoirs.  Diagenesis is an essential aspect, 
although quite different in processes and effects, of mudrocks, sandstones, and 
carbonate rocks. 
1.4  This chapter concentrates on the most important diagenetic features and 
processes in mudrocks, sandstones, and carbonate rocks.  You have already 
learned some things about diagenesis of cherts and evaporites in the preceding 
chapter. 
 

2.  COMPACTION 
2.1  Most sediments deposited under normal surface conditions have primary 
porosities of on the order of 30% to 70%.  The lower values are more typical of 
coarser, sandy sediments, and the higher initial porosities are more typical of finer-
grained, clay-rich sediments.  Porosity in conglomerates and sandstones is largely 

148 

a matter of pore spaces among the framework grains, as modified by later 
cementation together with certain other diagenetic changes (more on those later).  
In muds the initial porosity is commonly higher, owing largely to the tendency for 
clay-mineral particles to be surrounded by envelopes or cushions of tightly bound 
water.  Porosity in carbonate rocks varies widely, depending upon sediment type:  
the porosity of well-sorted carbonate sands is in the same general range as that of 
the corresponding siliciclastic sands, whereas reef carbonates commonly have 
much higher initial porosities. 
 
 
 
BACKGROUND:  FLUID PRESSURE AND ROCK PRESSURE IN THE 
SUBSURFACE 

 
1.  Provided that connected porosity exists between the material at some 
depth and the surface, the fluid pressure in the pore spaces of a sediment or 
sedimentary rock at some depth below the surface is just the hydrostatic pressure.  
It’s the same as filling a tall drinking glass with loose sand and then filling it to the 
top with water.  The pressure at the base of the glass is the hydrostatic pressure—
and is the same as if the sand were not there. 
2.  In the sand-filled drinking glass, at any given horizontal level in the glass 
the entire submerged weight of the sand above that level is borne by the grain-to-
grain contacts at that level.  That’s called the lithostatic pressure. 
3.  Complications come where the pore spaces at a given depth are not freely 
connected upward to the surface.  In that case, the fluid pressure can exceed the 
hydrostatic pressure, by a variety of effects.  Then the lithostatic pressure is less, 
because some of the weight of the overlying sediment is borne by the excess fluid 
pressure. 
4. Fluid pressures greater than hydrostatic are characteristic of sedimentary 
basins.  In depositional settings where sedimentation is faster than compaction, 
fluid overpressure can develop.  This is of great importance in both sediment 
diagenesis and petroleum generation and migration. 
5.  In SI units, the lithostatic pressure might be measured in kilograms per 
square meter.  You could figure that out for any given depth by knowing the bulk 
density of the sediment or sedimentary rock.  Lithostatic pressure within the Earth 
is usually quoted as kilobars.  To convert from kilograms per square meter to bars, 
multiply by 10-4.   
 
 
2.2  Most fine-grained sediments lose pore water soon after deposition by 
consolidation, the process by which clay-rich mud is changed to mudstone.  This 

 149

is largely a consequence of compaction due to overburden pressure (that is, the 
weight, per unit area, of the overlying layer of later-deposited sediment).  The 
compaction of clay at shallow depths has been studied intensively by civil 
engineers because of building requirements.  The effects of compaction at greater 
depths is of interest to exploration geologists because to the need to understand 
porosity occlusion (by that term is meant the partial elimination of pore spaces) 
and its impact on the evolution of possible reservoir rocks. 
2.3  At all depths below the usually shallow position of the groundwater 
table, the pore spaces of all sediments and sedimentary rocks are filled with water 
(or, more accurately, aqueous pore solutions, owing to the presence of solutes).  
Upon compaction, the expelled water has to go somewhere.  The typical direction 
of flow is upward (not necessarily vertically upward; often updip). 
2.4  Generally, depth profiles of compacting sediments show an exponential 
decay in porosity with depth.  Fine-grained sediments often show a reduction of 
porosity from 70% to 20% within the first 2 km of burial (Figure 7-1).  Thereafter, 
porosity is lost at a much slower rate and can be approximated as a linear function 
of depth.  In contrast, curves of sandstone porosity during burial show an approxi-
mately linear porosity loss throughout their entire history of burial (Figure 7-2).  
The extreme compaction of fine-grained siliciclastic rocks is of great importance 
to petroleum geologists, because if those rocks contain mobile petroleum 
hydrocarbons, those fluids are expelled upward into overlying porous rocks, which 
can then become petroleum reservoirs if they are capped by an appropriate seal.

2.5  Compaction commonly involves deformation, on scales ranging upward 
from individual grains. 
•  In thin sections (Figure 7-3) one often sees bent mica flakes or squeezed 
and deformed rock fragments (which, in more advanced stages, leads to 
pseudomatrix; see Chapter 4).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 151

•  Because of the difference in compaction between mudrock and sandstone, 
a sandstone dike emplaced vertically upward or downward before much 
compaction can become contorted because the mudrock undergoes so much more 
compaction than the sandstone (Figure 7-4). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3.  PRESSURE SOLUTION 

 
3.1  Sandstones commonly show solution of grains at grain-to-grain contacts.  
This is especially important for quartz framework grains.  This process is termed 
pressure solution.  In its early stages, pressure solution involves only local areas 
at points of contact between adjacent grains.  In later stages, a large percentage of 
the surface areas of adjacent grains are welded together.  Such boundaries are said 
to be sutured.  Thereby, almost all of the porosity of the rock has been eliminated. 
3.2  How does pressure solution work?  As with most minerals, the solubility 
of quartz increases slightly with pressure.  Upon substantial burial, local grain-to-
grain pressures at grain contacts are enormous, not only because the weight of 
overlying rock is great but also because the surface areas of grain contacts is, 
initially at least, small.  That leads to slight dissolution of quartz at the grain 
contacts.  Consequently, the local concentration of silica in solution is slightly 
greater in the immediate vicinity of the contacts, creating a gradient in silica 
concentration away from the contacts.  The surfaces of the quartz grains adjacent 
to the contacts, where pressures are much less, thus feel a slightly supersaturated 
pose solution, leading to precipitation of quartz on those surfaces.  The action of 
this simultaneous dissolution and reprecipitation causes grain boundaries to 
become broader (Figure 7-5). 
 

 152

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3 Pressure solution also occurs in carbonate sediments.  In addition to 
grain-to-grain suturing, pressure-solution seams commonly develop approximately 
parallel to bedding.  The rock “closes up” along such surfaces, as the carbonate 
minerals (usually calcite) are dissolved and then removed from the vicinity by 
solution flow. Presumably, the reason stylolites are usually parallel overall to 
bedding is that bedding surfaces are usually the paths of easiest flow of pore 
solutions.  Such surfaces of solution are called stylolites. 
3.4  One usually sees stylolites on rock faces at a large angle to stratification.  
They look like a squiggly dark line, a bit like an electrocardiogram.  (My all-time 
favorite graffito, on  the limestone wall of a toilet stall in a men’s room at MIT, 
labeled a stylolite “my electrocardiogram”.  The point, rightward, where the 
stylolite died out into non-dissolved rock, was labelled “entered MIT”.) 
3.5  Of course, the section one is seeing on the rock face is just a section 
through a three-dimensional stylolite surface that extends through the volume of 
the rock.  It is uncommon to see an entire segment of the stylolite surface, but one 
can do serial sectioning to figure out the geometry.  In that way, it’s seen that the 
stylolite surface comprises irregular pillar-like geometries pointing in both 
directions away from the average position of the surface.  The amplitudes of the 
pillars are usually a few centimeters, but in extreme case they can be much larger. 
(Incidental note:  the origin of the term comes stulos, the Greek word for “pillar”.  
A stylite was one of a number of early Christian ascetics who lived unsheltered on 
the tops of high pillars.) 
3.6  Stylolite surface are the sites of accumulation of insoluble residues 
(clays, iron oxides, and others) as the rock closes up.  That’s what makes the 
stylolites dark.  In a very general way, one can estimate the volume of carbonate 
rock that has been removed by solution, by comparing the average concentration 

 153

on insoluble residues in the rock to the amount that has accumulated in the 
stylolite.

3.  PORE FLUIDS 
 
3.1   Pore-Fluid Composition 
3.1.1  Three varieties of pore solutions infill sediment pores: meteoric, 
connate, and juvenile (Figure 7-6).  Meteoric water originates from the 
precipitation or rain and snow from the atmosphere.  Connate water has evolved 
from the original water associated with deposition, and juvenile waters are of 
magmatic origin.

3.1.2  Rain water is oxidizing and acidic.  Acidity is acquired through nitrous 
acid formed during thunderstorms, carbonic acid from solution of carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere, and sulfuric acid from volcanic gases.  As rainwater seeps 
through soil horizons it also acquires humic acids from decaying organic matter.  
Thus, when rain water enters a sedimentary unit it has considerable potential for 
causing chemical reactions. 
3.1.3  Within the shallow sedimentary profile there is an uppermost zone, the 
vadose zone, in which the pores are open to the atmosphere (Figure 7-7).

Below the vadose zone is the phreatic zone, where pores are saturated with 
water. The groundwater table separates the vadose zone from the phreatic zone.  
Bodies of sediment or sedimentary rock that are sufficiently porous and permeable 
to hold large quantities of pore water are called aquifers.  Sands, sandstones, 
gravels, conglomerates, and many carbonate rocks make good aquifers.  Bodies of 
rock with low permeability, which inhibit flow of water, are called aquicludes.  
Muds and shales make good aquicludes.   
3.1.4  Connate water is defined  most simply as the original (normally 
marine) water with which a sediment was deposited.  It is important to realize, 
however, that the chemical composition of these fluids may have changed 
drastically because of various reactions between the sediment and original fluid 
that take place immediately after deposition.  A distinction can be made between 
compactional water, which is evolved connate water moving through the 
sediments as a result of compaction, and thermobaric water, which is hot, highly 
pressured water of deep basinal origin, normally formed by dehydration of clays. 
3.1.5  Connate waters are commonly much different from meteoric waters in 
terms of their temperature, salinity, and chemistry.  The boundary between 
meteoric and connate water is sometimes quite sharp, because fresh (meteoric) 
water floats on more dense, chemical-laden connate water with its greater density 
due to solutes.

3.2  Pore-Fluid Flow 
3.2.1 As with other liquids and gases, as you learned in Chapter 2, pore fluids 
move in response to pressure gradients.  Meteoric waters flow because at any 
point in the porous and permeable medium the fluid pressure varies from place to 
place along an imaginary horizontal plane through the medium.  This is called 
meteoric flow (Figure 7-8).  The essential cause of such horizontal pressure 
gradients is the non-horizontal slope of the groundwater table above.  The slope of 
the groundwater table tends to mimic the slope of the land surface, although the 
topography on the groundwater table is subdued relative to the topography of the 
land surface.  (The pattern of deep groundwater flow is not intuitive, and it would 
take a lot more development of fluid dynamics here to account for it.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1.2  Meteoric flow is most important at shallow depths and in basins that 
have been uplifted above sea level.  Where there are topographic highs along 
marine basins, however, meteoric waters can displace connate fluids down to 
considerable depths.  For example, fresh-water springs discharge at depths of 
several hundred meters beneath sea level in many coastal regions.  Meteoric flow 
is important as a mechanism for generation of secondary porosity in both 
sandstones and carbonates in weathering zones that may be produced beneath 
unconformities.

3.1.3.  Compactional flow (Figure 7-8) results when excess pore water is 
squeezed out of the compacting sediment as the overburden pressure increases 
during burial.  However, as pore fluids move from compacting fine-grained 
sediments into more permeable coarser-grained sediments, hydrostatic pressures 
may be maintained and no further fluid movement need occur.  Consequently, 
compactional flow is generally only a localized process and is not important in 
regional fluid movement. 
3.1.4  At greater burial depths, thermal gradients are sufficiently high as to 
induce convection of fluids through permeable strata.  Because such convective 
flow (Figure 7-8) can develop on the scale of entire basins, it is an extremely 
important process in diagenesis and emplacement of petroleum.  Commonly, 
fluids leach minerals in one part of the basin and deposit them in others as thermal 
gradients or chemical regimes change. 
 

4.  DIAGENESIS OF FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENTS 
4.1  The shallowest diagenetic zone is one of oxygenation.  It is very thin or 
absent in deposited fine-grained sediments deposited in water.  In continental 
environments, like ephemeral lakes on playas, however, subaqueous mud 
deposition may be followed by long periods of dehydration while muds remain 
above the water table.  In such situations organic matter may be oxidized and 
removed.  Iron may be precipitated as limonite and then become dehydrated to 
hematite, a red ferric oxide.  (The term limonite is a general term for mixtures of 
hydrous ferric oxides, most commonly the mineral goethite but also others.)  Often 
hematite develops during initial burial, forming deposits commonly referred to as 
red beds (also spelled redbeds, and pronounced “RED beds”). 
4.2  In subaqueous environments, where the oxygenating zone may be 
absent, sulfate-reducing bacteria are commonly active.  In this situation sulfur may 
react with ferrous iron to form the ferrous iron sulfide mineral pyrite: 
 

 

Fe(OH)2 + 2S  =  FeS2 + H2O 
 
ulfate ions may react with organic matter to form hydrogen sulfide: 
S
 
2- + 2CH2O  =  2HCO3
- + H2S 
SO4

 
 (where CH2O represents, in a simplified way, organic matter) 
 

4.3  Bacterial fermentation of organic matter also takes place during shallow 
burial.  These reactions generate water, carbon dioxide, and biogenic methane.  
This increases the pH of the pore fluids, which can lead to precipitation of 

 157

carbonates.  Carbonate precipitation of this kind often occurs patchily as 
concretions developed intermittently along bedding surfaces. 
4.4  Freshly deposited muds contain a variety of clay minerals—the most 
important of which are smectite, illite, kaolinite, and chlorite, in various 
proportions.  These clay minerals undergo significant diagenetic changes as the 
sediment is buried.  The caused of these changes is not pressure but temperature.  
(Keep in mind the usual geothermal gradient of 25–30° C per kilometer of burial.)  
Smectite is changed to illite, with an intermediate range of mixed-layer illite–
smectite.  K+ ions are incorporated into the smectite structure, and interlayer 
waster is lost.  Smectite begins to disappear at temperatures as low as 70° C.  At 
about the same temperature, kaolinite is replaced by illite and chlorite.  Such 
changes develop upon burial to two to three kilometers.  With incipient 
metamorphism, the illite undergoes further increase in lattice ordering and crystal 
size, to become what is called sericite, which is essentially fine-grained muscovite.   
 
 

5.  DIAGENESIS OF VOLCANICLASTIC SEDIMENTS 
5.1  Fine-grained volcanic ash tends to undergo intense postdepositional 
alteration, producing  bentonites.  Bentonites are mixtures of smectite and 
devitrified glass.  Palagonite is produced during the alteration and rehydration of 
volcanic glass. 
5.2  Volcaniclastic sands may have good porosity if they are deposited on 
beaches or dunes.  They lose porosity extremely quickly, though, because of their 
unstable mineralogy.  During shallow burial they undergo hydration, leading to 
the formation of authigenic carbonate, clays, and zeolite minerals (zeolites are a 
class of hydrous aluminosilicate minerals).  Thus, volcaniclastic rocks are 
generally very poor-quality aquifers or petroleum reservoirs. 
 
 

6.  SANDSTONE DIAGENESIS 
6.1  Unlike in fine-grained sediments, in sandstones the effect of physical 
compaction is subordinate to chemical cementation.  Thus the loss of porosity with 
depth is often not as predictable as it is in the case of finer-grained sediments.  The 
diagenetic history of a sandstone is controlled principally by the chemistry of the 
pore fluids that have moved through its pore system.  The main factors that 
determine mineral precipitation or solution are 
 

•  the chemistry of the sediment, and 
•  the composition, concentration, Eh, and pH of the pore fluids. 

 

6.2  Although many reactions occur during sandstone diagenesis, only a few 
are of major importance in sandstone cementation and porosity evolution:  those 
that control the precipitation of silica, carbonate, and clay minerals (Figure 7-9).

The solubility of calcite and silica are unaffected by Eh but are strongly affected—
and in opposing ways—by pH.  Silica solubility increases with pH, whereas 
calcite solubility decreases with pH.  Thus in acidic pore fluids, like meteoric 
waters, calcite tends to dissolve and quartz overgrowths are precipitated, whereas 
in alkaline waters calcite cements precipitate and may even replace quartz.  For 
mildly alkaline fluids (pH 7–10) both quartz and calcite cements may form.

6.3  Clay minerals are similarly sensitive to pH.  Kaolinite tends to form in 
acid pore waters, whereas illite develops in more alkaline conditions.  Siderite, 
glauconite, and pyrite are all stable under reducing conditions. 
6.4  Quartz-rich sandstones (quartz arenites) are commonly cemented to 
various degrees by silica.  Usually this is quartz; only rarely is it in the form of 
opaline silica (amorphous colloidal hydrated silica)—which occurs in younger 
rocks, often in high-temperature settings, as in some hot springs.  Opal dehydrates 
with age to microcrystalline quartz, termed chalcedony.  Chalcedony is a common 
silica cement in sandstones of various ages. 
6.5  One important mode of quartz cementation is pressure solution; see the 
earlier section in this chapter.  The other important mode of quartz cementation is 
by the development of secondary overgrowths of quartz upon quartz framework 
grains.  The new, authigenic quartz is precipitated in crystallographic continuity 
with the framework grains:  the crystals are enlarged with no difference in 
crystallographic orientation.  The boundaries between the framework grains and 
the overgrowths are commonly marked by thin, “dusty-looking” rims of very fine-
grained mineral material (mostly iron oxides and clay minerals) that was present in 
small nooks and crannies on the original grain surface.  Of course, for overgrowths 
to form, such rims must be patchy and discontinuous.  It’s often, but not always, 
easy to see the dusty rims in thin section.  
6.6  In sandstones with lower percentages of quartz framework grains (lithic 
arenites and feldspathic arenites), however, there is much less cementation by 
quartz.  In such sandstones—and in many quartz arenites as well—the more 
common cementing material is calcite.  In contrast to quartz cements, calcite 
cement tends to be patchy and irregular, suggesting replacement of earlier 
constituents of the sediment.  Much of this replaced material is probably quartz 
itself.  The reason for this seems clear:  the solubility of quartz increases with 
temperature, whereas the solubility of calcite decreases with temperature.  That 
means that, given the substantial geothermal gradient, at sufficient depths of burial 
quartz is dissolved and calcite is precipitated—provided, of course, that there is a 
sufficiently high concentration of calcium carbonate in the pore solutions passing 
through the rock. 
6.7  Both of the modes of cementation of a sandstone by quartz—pressure 
suturing and secondary overgrowths—result in loss of porosity, but pressure 
solution results in decrease of rock volume, whereas secondary overgrowths do 
not.  In the case of secondary overgrowths, silica must be supplied in solution 
from elsewhere; in the case of pressure solution, there is likely to be net loss of 
silica, although suturing does not necessarily result in loss of silica. 
6.8  Here’s a final but important point about cementation of sandstones by 
either quartz or calcite:  the volumes of pore fluids that have to pass through the 
rock to do the cementing is extremely large—hundreds or even thousands relative 
to rock porosity—owing to the low concentrations of the respective solutes.  This 

 160

 

means strong flow (resulting from a combination of high permeability and strong 
pressure gradients) or long times, or some combination of both. 
6.9  Sandstones may in some cases also be cemented by hematite.  In this 
case, iron is released during weathering of detrital iron-bearing minerals (e.g., 
pyroxene, amphibole, biotite) to form a coating of tan- to brown-colored hydrated 
iron oxide (usually mainly goethite, although other hydrous ferric iron oxide 
minerals are involved as well).  Following burial and temperature-induced aging, 
the water is expelled and the transformation to hematite occurs. 
 
7.  A NOTE ON LITHIFICATION OF SILICICLASTIC ROCKS 
7.1  You may be wondering at this point how sands and muds become 
lithified to sandstones and mudrocks.  The crucial element in lithification is close 
and intimate contact between adjacent grains.  This close contact can come about 
by compaction alone, provided that at least some of the constituents of the 
sediment are deformable.  If you go into the laboratory and try to lithify a pure 
quartz sand by squeezing it with a piston (and arranging the squeezing so that 
excess pore fluid can escape), you would fail:  no matter how hard you squeeze, 
the sand stays loose.  If, however, you include some soft rock fragments, or 
interstitial mud, you would end up with an at least partly lithified material:  it 
would not fall apart readily in your hands. 
7.2  To arrive at a more thoroughly lithified rock, you would need more than 
just compaction.  You need cementation, whereby grain contacts are made more 
extensive by precipitation of authigenic mineral material around the original 
grains of the sediment.  You have seen that this can come about in a variety of 
ways:  pressure solution, deposition of cement, or recrystallization of the existing 
mineral constituents.  Commonly, more than one of these processes is at work to 
lithify a sediment during burial. 
 
 
 

8.  LIMESTONE DIAGENESIS 
8.1  Introduction 
8.1.1  Limestones formed on carbonate platforms are particularly susceptible 
to drastic, early diagenetic modification.  Marine carbonate sediments consist of 
metastable carbonate phases, like aragonite and magnesian calcite, which are 
easily dissolved and recrystallized by fresh meteoric waters or mixtures of 
meteoric and marine waters, such as are encountered in surface and shallow 
subsurface conditions.  Because carbonate platforms can be maintained near sea 
level for extended periods, the possibility of fresh-water flushing of the platforms, 
with attendant massive diagenesis, is significant.   
8.1.2  One of the major impacts of meteoric-water diagenesis is the basic 
rearrangement of calcium carbonate by dissolution of grains and the replacement 

 161

of calcium carbonate as cement in pore spaces.  There is a tendency for primary 
porosity in carbonate sequences to be destroyed early by cementation with 
subsequent generation of secondary porosity during the dissolution phase.  This in 
strong contrast to quartz sandstones, which are almost unaffected during early 
burial because of the low solubility and stability of most of the grains under 
surface and near-surface environments.  Porosity in siliciclastic successions in the 
subsurface, therefore, is generally primary, can be tied directly to variations in 
depositional environments, and hence is highly predictable. 
8.1.3  Carbonates not extensively altered during early diagenesis are 
particularly susceptible to chemical processes like grain-to-grain pressure solution 
and stylolitization during burial because of the relatively high solubility of calcium 
carbonate. 
 
 

8.2  Dissolution 
8.2.1 Aragonite and magnesian calcite are stable phases in the marine 
environment, but they are very unstable in other environments (Figure 7-10).  In 
freshwater lakes, or in vadose or phreatic zones, pure calcite is the stable phase.  
Dissolution of metastable phases may often be selective, and originally aragonitic 
parts of shells may be dissolved while magnesian calcites remain intact.

8.3  Cementation 
8.3.1  Cementation by calcite cements commonly occurs in the deeper parts 
of freshwater aquifers in the phreatic zone.  Saturation is achieved with respect to 
calcite as a result of dissolution of more soluble aragonite and magnesian calcite 
in more updip locations, closer to the recharge area of the aquifer.  As fluids move 
progressively downdip, they dissolve more and more aragonite and magnesian 
calcite until the fluid approaches saturation with respect to those phases.  Because 
the solubility of pure calcite is lower than that of Mg-calcite or aragonite, 
however, the fluid at that point is supersaturated with respect to calcite and 
precipitates calcite rim cements.  Rim cements (that is, those that encrust all 
exposed grain surfaces) are characteristic of cementation in the phreatic zone.  
Rim cements generally have a blocky habit. 
8.3.2  Cementation by carbonate cements is not restricted to the fresh-water 
phreatic zone.  In fact, it commonly occurs in pores spaces almost immediately 
after sedimentation of particles while fluids are still marine in composition.  This 
mode of cementation, termed early marine cementation, is the process whereby 
reefs are made hard as rocks. 
8.3.3  Marine cements may occur as magnesian calcite or aragonite drusy 
cements.  Generally, the morphology of the crystals favors aragonite forming fine, 
fibrous fringes, whereas Mg calcite forms somewhat coarser, bladed fringes.  
These are precipitated as drusy cements, although during precipitation in the upper 
(supratidal) parts of tidal flats, where exposure in the shallow vadose zone may 
occur, cements may have more of a microstalactitic fabric.  (You know already 
what stalactites are; the adjective drusy applies, in a pore space, to a mineral 
surface that is covered with small projecting crystals.) In this case, fine fringes 
may hang downwards from the undersides of grains and form by precipitation 
from marine fluids, introduced during storms, that percolate down through the 
shallow vadose zone. 

 

8.4  Replacement 
8.4.1  Carbonate petrologists have long recognized that some carbonate 
particles. like ooids or shells, or unstable marine cements that were originally 
sediments, are now different in both crystal size and mineralogy.  This realization 
follows from recognition of ghosts of the primary mineral, represented by 
inclusions, pseudomorphs, or reproduction of an original outline.  (A 
pseudomorph is a mineral whose outward crystal form is that of another mineral, 
owing to some process that changed the mineral composition without changing the 
crystal geometry.)  It is obvious in many cases that the original material could not 
simply have been dissolved away and the new phase precipitated as cement.  In 
order to preserve the evidence of the original material, the growth of the new 
mineral must have taken place simultaneously with the step-by-step dissolution of 
the earlier material.  This situation implies that the fluid exists as a thin film, so as 

 163

to not generate void space, and to be delicately balanced in terms of composition 
so as not to dissolve faster than precipitation can proceed. 
8.4.2  This process of replacement is commonly called neomorphism.  
Neomorphism includes the diagenetic processes in which older crystals, whether 
abiotic or biogenic in origin, are consumed and in their place simultaneously 
occupied by new crystals of the same mineral or a polymorph.  Thus, sparry 
cements can thus have two entirely different origins.  (The adjective sparry is 
derived from the noun spar, a term that’s applied, loosely, to any transparent light-
colored crystal.)  In the first case dissolution and precipitation are sufficiently 
staggered in time so as to have the cement precipitate in a relatively large void.  
The sparry cement reflects this in the size and shape of crystals, with small crystals 
nucleating along the margins of the void space, and becoming increasingly large 
and blocky up to a maximum in the center of the void.  In the case of neomorphic 
sparry cements, precipitation is intimately associated with dissolution, and 
subsequent morphology reflects the sediment particle that was replaced and not 
the void space.  There is little variation in grain size except where it reflects 
primary variations in grain size. 
 

9.  DOLOSTONES 
9.1  Introduction 
9.1.1  By definition, dolostone is a carbonate rock in which more than 50% 
of the carbonate minerals is dolomite.  Rocks with mixtures of calcite and 
dolomite are common (you can use the terms calcitic dolostone or dolomitic 
limestone), but my own experience is that there’s a bimodal distribution, with 
fairly pure dolostones and fairly pure limestones more common than mixtures.   
9.1.2  Warning on usage:  the term dolomite is commonly used not only for 
the mineral but also for the rock, even though technically the rock should be called 
a dolostone. 
9.1.3  Dolostones are widespread and abundant in the sedimentary record, 
although not as abundant as limestones.  It’s interesting that the relative 
abundance of dolostone increases with age:  there is almost none in the Cenozoic, 
and only a few percent in the Mesozoic, but the proportions are about 3:1 
limestone to dolostone in the Paleozoic, and just the reverse, 1:3, in the 
Precambrian.  Why?  It's not known for sure.  Possibilities:  deposition; 
replacement; preservation.  Probably a combination of the first two. 
 
 

 
 

 

 164

9.2  Kinds of Dolostone 
9.2.1  There are two broad groups of dolostone: 
•  very fine-grained dolostones, characteristically thinly laminated, often with 
various primary depositional structures like desiccation cracks, but few 
fossils; 
•  coarse crystalline dolostones with abundant evidence of replacement, and 
commonly showing relicts or ghosts of primary features like stratification, 
ooids, or fossils. 
 
The usual assumption is that the first kind is nearly primary, forming soon after 
deposition of the calcium carbonate sediment.  The second kind is secondary, 
formed by replacement of calcite by dolomite in limestones well after 
sedimentation occurs, after the carbonate sediment has been lithified.   
9.2.2  In many carbonate rocks you can see good evidence of incomplete 
dolomitization:  scattered rhombs of dolomite growing in a mass of calcite that 
commonly shows primary sedimentary textures and structures.  The dolomite is 
neomorphic after the calcite.   
9.2.3  Thorough dolomitization leads to a totally crystalline dolostone in 
which the dolomite forms an interlocking crystal mosaic.  Such dolostones are 
often described as saccharoidal dolostone ox sucrosic dolostone. 
 
 

10.3  Relationships Between Limestone and Dolostone 
9.3.1  Here are some generalizations about the spatial relationships between 
limestone and dolostone in stratigraphic sections, ranging from the small scale to 
the large scale. 
 

•  On the scale of individual beds, incomplete dolomitization is common.  
You see “mottled” rock with a patchy distribution of dolomite.  The dolomite 
areas are irregular in shape, and they may or may not be interconnected. 
•  On the scale of successions of beds, you often see interbedding of 
limestone and dolostone on a scale of millimeters to decimeters to meters (or at 
least some beds show more thorough dolomitization than others).   
•  On the scale of meters to whole formations, irregular dolomitization can 
cut primary features indiscriminately.  This is often clearly related to joints and 
faults, but sometimes its origin is obscure. 
•  On the scale of entire stratigraphic sections (to produce what could be 
called stratigraphic associations of dolostone), it’s found that dolostone tends to be 
nearshore and shallow-water, whereas limestone tends to be offshore and deeper-
water.  There are many exceptions to this generalization, however.

9.4  The Origin of Dolostone 

9.4.1  The origin of dolostones was deeply mysterious until quite recently; 
it’s been only in the last twenty years that sedimentologists have developed even a 
partial understanding of the nature of dolostones.  This is largely because there are 
few places in the world today where dolomite is being precipitated in anything 
like a primary depositional environment.  In fact, up until the 1960s NO places 
were known! 
9.4.2  It’s clear that dolomite crystals don’t nucleate spontaneously from sea 
water.  Such nucleation is observed for aragonite in certain marine situations, but 
it’s never been observed for dolomite.  But sea water is oversaturated with respect 
to dolomite as well to calcite and aragonite (see the earlier chapter on limestones), 
and dolomite crystals are happy in sea water once they have formed.  As noted in 
the chapter on limestones, the lack of nucleation and growth of dolomite in sea 
water is probably a matter of kinetics:  it takes so long to build highly ordered 
structure of dolomite that dolomite loses out to calcite or aragonite in the 
competition for Ca2+ ions.   
9.4.3  The general thinking is that the primary-looking dolostone we see is 
the result of dolomitization of fine calcium carbonate mud (presumably aragonite) 
very soon after precipitation, while the sediment is still at or close to the 
depositional surface.  Conversion to dolomite before the sediment is finally 
deposited is suggested by the sometimes beautiful preservation of primary 
depositional features in fine-grained dolostones.  This has been observed in the 
few modern settings where deposition of dolomitic sediment can be studied.  
9.4.4  The other matter that needs to be addressed is the process(es) for 
partial or total replacement of calcite or aragonite by dolomite in the deposit long 
after deposition.  In the case of late replacement along fractures, one has to appeal 
to dolomitizing solutions unrelated to the original deposition.  But most secondary 
dolomite seems to have been formed while the deposit was still within the 
depositional setting, although probably deeply buried.  Two major theories have 
been proposed:  seepage-reflux dolomitization and brackish-water dolomitization 
(also called Dorag dolomitization). 
Seepage Reflux (Figure 7-11):  In a setting with restricted high-salinity 
water associated with the depositional area, one can picture dense water with 
lowered Ca2+ content and heightened Mg2+ content (owing to extraction of the 
Ca2+ by precipitation of calcite and/or aragonite) percolating downward and 
outward through the calcium carbonate sediment back to the open ocean.  Water 
seeping through the body of a reef from the lagoon is the best example.

Brackish-Water Dolomitization (Figure 7-12):  It’s known that mixtures of 
sea water and fresh water containing about 5% to 30% sea water are 
supersaturated with respect to dolomite but unsaturated with respect to calcium 
carbonate minerals.  Brackish water percolating through an already-deposited 
sediment should therefore tend to dolomitize the sediment.  This process has been 
invoked to account for dolomitization of various dolomitic units, both recent and 
ancient.

9.5  Practical Things About Dolostone 
9.5.1  Dolostone doesn’t fizz in the dilute HCl used for limestone 
identification, but if it’s powdered with a knife, then it will fizz.  This is a fairly 
reliable field test, although you have to be careful, because small amounts of 
calcium carbonate cement in a rock could produce about the same effect.   
9.5.2  Dolostones tend to weather in tan to buff colors, presumably because 
there usually are small percentages of ferrous iron in the dolomite.  Fairly pure 
limestones, on the other hand, tend to weather gray. 
9.5.3  In arid to semiarid regions, the weathered-surface texture of limestones 
and dolostones are different.  Limestone weathers by solution even in arid regions, 
and sloping bedrock surfaces show development of a network of fine solution rills.  
Dolostone, on the other hand, weathers by granular disintegration, and presents a 
granular-rough surface without solution rills.   
9.5.4  Dolostones are seldom very fossiliferous:  nearly primary dolostones 
were deposited in environments often hostile to macroorganisms, and replacement 
dolostone usually has its fossils partly or entirely obliterated.  It’s important to 
recognize, however, that there are well documented examples of dolomitized but 
nonetheless richly fossiliferous carbonates.
