Stop 1 – Sunrise Mountain W., Tapeats Siliciclastics-Bright Angel Shale: 

Setting: East of North Las Vegas and the easternmost thrust faults. We are in the 

autochthon. Across the valley, red and white sandstone is visible on the other side of the 

Keystone Thrust, which dips gently away from us. A marine transgression occurred from 

west to east, so sediments are younger going eastward.  

Observations: Before us is an unconformity between Precambrian metamorphics 

and basal Cambrian marine deposits. The layers dip to the east at approximately 45°. The 

older metamorphic layer is a red and white colored granite with grains 1-5mm. The 

contact between layers is somewhat wavy. The granite appears altered close to the 

contact, implying a possible paleosol. Above the contact is quartz arenite with differential 

weathering and cross stratification. 

About one meter above the contact is a layer of whitish arenite. The rock is poorly 

sorted with rounded clasts of mm order diameter.  

A half meter above is more arenite without clasts. It is cross stratified and calcite 

cemented. One meter further above, the rock exhibits parting indicating a dip at an angle 

to the overall dip. A little further up the parting indicates a dip in the opposite direction. 

This could be caused by sand dunes filling in bowl shaped depressions—we’re seeing 

opposite sides of the bowl with oppositely oriented dips. Clearly visible cross 

stratification supports the dune hypothesis and the truncation surfaces also indicated that 

we are moving up section into younger rock. 

R.Safipour  
 
After a covered section we find very fine grained green sandstone/shale. In the 

2

midst of this layer is a thin bed 1-2 cm thick of red colored coarser grained sandstone. 

The rock has parting and many extracted samples have sole marks and trace fossil 

burrows on the bottom. This is probably an event bed. There are a large number of these 

event beds interbedded with the very fine grained rock. My interpretation is that the very 

fine grained rock is from quiet water deposition. The event beds could be either 

tempestites or turbidites. There is one bed that is particularly interesting. It grades upward 

from planar to cross stratified with hummocky cross stratification on the top surface. This 

suggest to me that it was likely a tempestite. As the storm settled the current velocity 

decreased, leading to the change from planar deposition to ripples. 

Above: Tool marks 

 

Upsection the sandstone event beds become thicker and more common, 

culminating in several meters of cross stratified sandstone. This could be caused by a 

marine regression. As the water got shallower, the sediment was more easily affected by 

storm waves. The cross stratified section could be evidence of a tidal environment with a 

tidal current. 

R.Safipour  
 
Upsection we move abruptly into shale. I interpret this as a slow increase in water 

3

depth which abruptly cut off the supply of coarse grained siliciclastics, as the change in 

base level caused rivers to store sediment upstream to maintain their profile. 

 

Above: As seal level rises, streams maintain their profile by storing sediment upstream. 

 

Continuing upsection, we find a large sandstone event bed with the negative relief 

of flute marks on the bottom. This indicates that the current was first erosional and then 

depositional.  

 

Upsection we move into carbonates. This would indicate a marine transgression—

farther from shore the carbonate factory dominates over siliciclastic deposition from the 

land. Further up is ribbon rock. This rock has alternating tan and gray microfacies. An 

acid test indicates that the tan is dolostone, while rill marks on the gray microfacies 

clearly identify it as limestone. A possible explanation for the formation of ribbon rock is 

that certain lamellae are somehow preferentially dolomatized. The lamellae are also 

irregular indicated the rock underwent diagenesis. 

R.Safipour

Above: ribbon rock 

 

We also find ooids! The ooids are preferentially dolomatized. At this point the 

section is mainly carbonates all the way up.  

 

Large scale interpretations: The section is marine in nature and indicates 

allocyclicity in the water depth. The alterations in the thickness and frequency of event 

beds in the siliciclastics indicates small changes in water depth. The abrupt change to 

carbonates indicates a marine transgression. The signal is probably transgressive overall 

with small scale fluctuations and periods of regression. 

 

Stop 2- Sunrise Mountain E, Permian Redbeds: 

 
 
This is a large formation of quartz arenite with carbonate cement. Rock is red to 

 

salmon pink, probably due to hematite. Very large scale cross stratification is visible, as 

well as strange holes weathered into the rock forming large bowls and caves. The cross 

R.Safipour  
 
stratification has a “swoopy” look in some places, which is characteristic of eolian dunes. 

5

Jointing occurs at 90° to the strata. The sets are dipping gently to the South. 

 

Above: Cross stratification 

The rock is thinly laminated in some parts while other thick bands have no 

lamination. The laminated parts are likely caused by grain fall while the unlaminated 

bands are grain flow. A top surface is exposed with rib and furrow formation, indicating a 

principle wind direction from the North. 

 

R.Safipour

Above: Rib and Furrow 

 

Stop 3- North Shore L. Mead unconformity 

 

. The bottom red layer is sandstone. This is an angular unconformity—as can be 

seen from the photo. The red layer has undergone significant deformation and has a 

complex structure. In some places it dips steeply toward while in others steeply away. It 

is very fine grained and poorly consolidated. 

The top layer is siliciclastic conglomerate sandstone. It is mostly grain supported, 

but an acid test fizzes slightly indicating some carbonate cement. The clasts are 1-5cm in 

diameter. It is somewhat stratified, with bands of varying grain size and clast size, and is 

gently dipping. 

Interpretation: The lower layer was deposited first. It then underwent significant 

deformation and erosion before the deposition of the upper layer. The size of the clasts in 

the upper layer suggests a fluvial environment. The variations in clast and grain size 

could be caused by changes in current velocity. 

 

Stop 4 – Moenkopi Formation 

Layers are cut by a wash allowing for fantastic viewing. The layers are dipping at 

about 45°. Layers moving downsection: 

1)  Cross stratified sandstone 

2)  Dark colored conglomerate 

3)  Cross stratified shale 

R.Safipour  
 
Interbedding of green sandstone and red shale. The sandstone are probably 

7

event beds. They have a sharp base indicating erosion and a rippled surface, 

suggesting they are tempestites. The shale grades upward to mudstone. 

4) 

Veins of gypsum are introduced. These veins are up to a few cm thick. 

They conform with the strata in some places and in other places they cut through it. 

This indicates that they are post depositional features, deposited as veins in later 

diagenesis. In a few places there are large nodular deposits of gypsum as well. The 

gypsum veins are folded in some places. Differential weathering is exhibited where 

the cross the wash—the mudstone erodes more easily than the gypsum.  

 

 

In some places the mudstone exhibits climbing ripples with oscillation 

ripples on top. This suggests a possible combined flow. In addition, the negative relief 

of ripples is visible on the underside of a slab! In some places there are ripples with a 

low climb angle so that the stoss sides are not preserved. They come in long sets that 

don’t die out, suggesting they are oscillation ripples. 

  Up one of the side slopes, we discover some “photographites”. Soft sediment 

deformation in one bed indicates liquifaction and flowage. The bed plane below it has 

ripples on its surface, some of which are classic tuning fork ripples.  

R.Safipour

Above: Soft sediment deformation 

 

  On the other side of the wash, the layers are cut on top by an angular 

unconformity with overlying sediment. 

5)  Cross stratified sandstone 

  

The ripples change their direction of climb in several places. A side view 

and front view of the cross stratification indicates a current direction. 

Interpretation: the depositional environment was probably marine. The gypsum 

suggests a hypersaline environment and the presence of tempestites suggests marine 

deposition. Since the deposits are siliciclastic they must have been near shore in shallow 

water. 

 

Stop 5 – Red Rock Park, Aztec Siliciclastics 

R.Safipour

Swooping cross stratification suggests eolian dunes. This is caused when dunes 

overlap while moving. The cross stratification climbs to the East and the sets are very 

large (some up to 10 meters thick). Since only a small fraction of dune height is 

preserved in sets, we can assume the dunes must have been hundreds of feet tall. In 

places the sets appear to change their direction of climb, but this could also be opposite 

sloped sides of  troughs between dunes that were filled in by migrating dunes. 

There are three layers to the formation. The bottom layer has alternating stripes of 

red and white. The middle section is all red but it is a darker red than that in the stripes. 

The top layer is entirely white. The colors are due to hematite in the rock, but why it 

makes these three distinct layers is unclear. The stripes in the lowest layer could be 

caused by differences in porosity that allow water to preferentially flow in certain strata, 

leaching out the hematite. 

Stop 6 – Eagle Mountain 

R.Safipour  
 
The section has three Cambrian formations (from oldest to youngest): Zabriskie 

10

Quartzite, the Carrara Formation, and the Bonanza King Formation.  

The Zabriskie is a well cemented upper medium to lower coarse arenite. The rock 

has a purple tint. The strata alternate between more and less purple tint. The strata are 

dipping at ~45° with parting and jointing perpendicular to the strata. The formation is 

planar stratified. The combination of coarse grain size and planar strata suggests it is 

upper regime planar deposited by a strong current. 

Moving up section several meters we find a coarse to very coarse red arenite. It is 

less well cemented and grain supported with rounded grains. This is followed by several 

meters of covered section. When the outcrop reemerges it is a fine siliciclastic with shale-

like parting. Some lamellae have very coarse clasts. This abrupt upward fining could be 

explained either by autocyclicity (such as a shifting river) or allocyclicity (such as rising 

sea level). Roy D. Adams did a thesis on this formation and concluded that a combination 

of both allocyclicity and autocyclicity were at work, the former as changing sea levels 

and the latter as shifting tidal currents. 

There is a slow coarsening upward. The parting gets thinner and the rock gets 

redder. Eventually we find low angle cross stratification. Then we find an abrupt upward 

fining to red shale. This facies alternates between red and greenshale interbedded with 

coarser grained event beds. Moving upsection, these event beds are thicker, coarser, and 

more frequent. This suggests that the section is shallowing upward. We find some lenses 

of coarse rock, most likely deposited by event beds that filled only local lows in the 

underlying bed. Some event beds have tracks, flute marks, and burrows. 

R.Safipour  
 

11

We now reach the Carrara. They are weathered tan and an HCl test identifies 

them as dolomitic. They are upper medium grained and contain flute marks and elliptical 

shaped objects that may be oncoids or microfossils. 

Moving up we find a dolostone conglomerate event bed. There’s a floatstone with 

a trilobite. Although it is a floatstone this supports the hypothesis of a marine 

depositional environment.  

At this point we move across a Bonanza King scree and into a wash to continue 

working upsection. The background sedimentation  is a bluish-black siltstone. There are 

some sandstone event beds with sharp bases and rippled tops which are clearly 

tempestites. There is a general coarsening upward of the section and we reach some 

hummocky cross stratification. 

Next is a large section of ribbon rock (described in stop 1). The rock has ooids 

and is stratified, in some places planar and in others low angle cross stratified. There is 

also some minor faulting. The transition to carbonates and the presence of ooids suggests 

a very shallow marine environment. 

Interpretations: This section represents marine transgressions and regressions, but 

the overall signal is transgressive. The transitions from sandstones to shales represent 

transgressive periods. The general shift from siliciclastics to carbonates could be caused 

by mountains weathering down and shutting off the supply of siliciclastics, or by climate 

change that turned on the carbonate factory. It could also be caused by a marine 

transgression, however the presence of ooids shows that the carbonate section was 

deposited in shallow water. It is possible for water to remain shallow during a 

transgression if there is a shelf off shore.  

R.Safipour

Stop 9 – Tecopa Lake Beds 

 

The lake bed deposits are primarily siliciclastics and evaporates. They are mostly 

planar stratified with some cross stratification and are interspersed with datable ash beds. 

There are some good examples of soft sediment deformation as well. The lake drained 

186,000 years ago and subsequent alluvial deposits were laid down on top of the lake 

bed. The deposits were then incised and exposed. 

Stop 8 – Eagle Mountain W 

There’s a large orthoconglomerate with well rounded carbonate clasts. It is poorly 

sorted and unstratified. It has a sharp contact with sandstone above, indicating that it is an 

event bed, probably a landslide or debris flow of previously rounded clasts. The 

conglomerate has a fine grained carbonate cement at the bottom, but at the top it has a 

matrix of sandstone that is exactly the same as the sandstone above. It’s possible that 

after the event, sand that was deposited on top of the rocks filtered down in between the 

rocks. The clasts include arenites from the Zubrisky Formation and ribbon rock from the 

Carrara Formation, both of which are situated up the mountain. 

The sandstone layer above has quartz grains in dolomite cement. It is grain 

supported and has conformable contact with the conglomerate. It is planar stratified. 

There’s a thin layer of conglomerate a few cm above the contact, indicated a second 

small event. 

The rock fines upward into thinly laminated red shale, and then coarsens again to 

a medium grained cross stratified sandstone. We next reach a layer of yellow limestone, 

clearly identified by solution rills. Following this is another layer of medium grained 

cross stratified sandstone. Then there’s an interbedding of three rock types: a tan colored 

R.Safipour  
 
quartz arenite, a yellow dolomitic sandstone, and a bright yellow dolomitic shale. This 

13

layer is cross stratified and has undergone soft sediment deformation, made particularly 

visible by the color contrast of yellow and tan. 

Interpretation: We can rule out marine deposition because we know from the 

literature that the rock is Cenozoic and postdates the most recent marine transgression. It 

could be fluvial deposition. There are no channels or overbanks, indicating a braided 

stream. Changes in water speed and course account for the cross stratification and planar 

stratification. The carbonate deposits must have been eroded and carried down stream 

from older formations. The conglomerate is a debris flow from a subaerial period.  

Stop 11 – Johnnie section 

R.Safipour  
 

14

Interpretation: The carbonates must be shallow water marine, due to the presence 

of stromatolites. The planar siliciclastics could be marine or coastal. For example, they 

 

could be from a coastal plain that is occasionally flooded. 

Stop 11b – farther up on the Johnnie 

We start with a unit of interbedded fine grained sandstones and siltstones. Some 

beds exhibit pinch and swell cross stratification. The unit contains some individual beds 

that are hummocky stratified on top and planar on the bottom, indicating they are storm 

R.Safipour  
 
event beds. The beds are thick, on the order of decimeters, and some make “gutter casts” 

15

– they only filled the local lows of the bed below. This unit is from deeper water than the 

lower Johnnie, but the presence of storm waves means it was still on a shelf. 

Moving up we find carbonates, indicating shallower water. Sea level must have 

changed by some tens of meters. 

Next we come to a large bed of unstratified paraconglomerate. It is poorly sorted 

with a matrix of upper medium to lower coarse dolomite. The conglomerate contains gray 

carbonate clasts that are rounded to subrounded. The matrix looks a lot like unit 1 and the 

clasts look like unit 2 of the lower Johnnie. There are also a few arenite clasts. Manu of 

the clasts are rod shaped and show a slight horizontal preferential orientation. There is 

one huge dolostone clast the size of a truck. It looks like lower Johnnie unit 3 and is 

irregularly shaped with some veins of quartz. Some of the carbonate clasts have large 

ooids and some of the arenites have cross stratification. The conglomerate is about 50m 

thick at its thickest and 600 – 700m in total length. It thins out to the SE but remains thick 

and ends rather abruptly to the NW. 

This conglomerate is an incised valley fill. A valley was incised in the Johnnie 

formation and then filled with a conglomerate debris flow. This incision could be caused 

by a drop in sea level, causing a river to incise upward to maintain its profile. Later, more 

Johnnie was laid down on top of the conglomerate. 

Stop 12 – Kingston Peak Formation 

The first thing to catch our eyes is a turbidite: a paraconglomerate bed with both 

angular and rounded clasts. The bed is graded upward from very coarse to very fine and 

is unstratified—this is the Bauma Sequence A. Flute marks on the bottom indicate 

R.Safipour  
 

16

erosion. The whole bed is about 1.5 m thick. It is bounded above and below by fine 

grained siliciclastics with planar lamination, probably from quiet water deposition. 

Moving upward in the section we find a number of event beds with planar and 

cross stratification—Bauma B and C beds. 

Above: event beds. Below: dropstone 

 

 

R.Safipour  
 
Another interesting feature is a large lonestone. The strata curve around under and 

17

arch up over the lonestone. It must be a dropstone that fell from pack ice or an ice berg, 

because it’s too large to be transported by other means. We also know from the literature 

that this unit is Neoproterozoic, and the extent of glaciation was great during that time. 

Stop 14 - Dumont Dunes 

The sand has larger ripples with smaller ripples superimposed at about 90° 

orientation. We can tell that the last sand moving wind came from the west, indicated by 

the smaller ripples. The larger ripples indicate a previous wind from the north. We are 

also treated to the sight of a beautiful saltation cloud off the tip of one of the dunes. 

Stop 15 - Afton Canyon 

The Mojave river flows through this valley. At one time, a natural dam created a 

lake, but the river cut through the lake and drained it. Side rivers also incised because of 

the change in base level caused by the draining lake. Before us is a landscape of alluvial 

fans and incised terraces. 

At the start of our hike up the wash, we are surrounded on both sides by semi 

consolidated planar stratified stream deposits. Some of these beds are cobble sized while 

others are fine gravel. Each bed represents a separate flood event with either differences 

in current strength or differences in the size of the source sediment available to the river. 

Most of the clasts are arenites but a few are granite. The clasts are imbricated, indicating 

current direction. Berms and undercuts at the river base of the walls indicates that the 

river is currently incising. 

The planar stratification indicates a fast flowing current. In a few places there are 

some traces of low angle cross stratification, but it is rare. The rarity of cross 

R.Safipour  
 

18

stratification can be explained wither by a current dying out quickly before cross 

stratification could form, or by a very high concentration of sediment. There is a theory 

that dune formation is suppressed in high concentration sediment flows.  

We also find one unusually large clast, about 30 cm in diameter, that seems out of 

place. It is rounded and may have been rolled by the river current before it was deposited. 

Up on the left bank there is a large bank of finer grained tan colored deposit with 

bits of the “normal” gray bank plastered against it as a buttress unconformity. This tan 

material is older than the standard gray sediment. It was incised to make the canyon, and 

then the canyon filled with the gray sediment. The canyon was later incised again, and in 

this place the gray material was completely removed to expose the older tan wall. The 

color difference between these two deposition events could be explained by differences in 

the source sediment or by reworking of the sediment to remove certain finer components. 

 

Moving on we find a butte. It is composed of younger gray sediment capped by 

greenish colored lake deposits. The lake deposit cap is stronger material and allows for 

the tall vertical walls of the butte without collapse or sloping at the top. 

R.Safipour  
 

19

Above: Butte 

 

Continuing up the wash, we find a paleosol. It is an angular unconformity that is 

dark brown on top and light tan underneath. The color grades downward to dark brown 

again and the clast size grades larger downward. Both the color change and clast size 

change indicate weathering, and therefore a paleosol. 

We soon find another interesting unconformity. It consists of three layers. The 

bottom layer is planar stratified, tan colored, and slightly dipped. It makes an angular  

unconformity with a gray layer on top. The gray layer has solution rills and differential 

weathering and is not dipping at all. On top of this is a section of the greenish colored 

lake deposits again. Moving just a little farther up the canyon, the green lake deposits are 

replaced by an interbedding of gray and tan siliciclastics—we have reached the edge of 

the ancient lake bed. 

The youngest gray conglomerate deposits reappear and the sides of the channel 

narrow. We’ve reached a kickpoint—the highest point of incision of the river. The 

R.Safipour  
 
kinckpoint has worked its way upstream as the river tries to respond to a change in base 

20

level. 

Just past the knickpoint are some interesting features. There’s a green colored 

material, interspersed with red and purple rock. It consists of small rounded quartz grains 

imbedded in a very fine grained siliciclastic. This is a felsic tuff, and the quartz grains 

indicate it has been reworked. The contact between the conglomerate and the tuff looks 

like a buttress unconformity, but it could also be a fault. There is a basalt flow on top of 

the tuff, complete with amygdules that are filled with a green colored mineral. There’s an 

eroded waterfall chute in the basalt too. 

Above: basalt flow 

 

On the way back to the van, we find some true photographites! There’s a sand 

bank with absolutely classic climbing ripple and oscilation ripple cross stratification. 

Stop 16 – Bird Spring Formation 

This last stop consists of a series of units on a ridge. We start at the bottom in a 

calcareous marine layer. The top part of the layer has lots of burrowing while the bottom 

has none. This bioturbation indicates that the layer was a hardground—the carbonate 

R.Safipour  
 
factory must have shut down for some time to allow burrowing deep into the layer. The 

21

layer has medium quartz grains in a limestone cement and is planar laminated. 

Moving up section we reach a layer of limestone mudstone. It is pinkish colored 

and unstratified. This mudstone would have formed from quiet water deposition. 

The next layer is an arenatious cherty limestone wackestone. It contains fossil 

fragments and medium sized quartz grains. 

Next is a dolomite sandstone. It is medium grained and matrix supported and has 

large scale cross stratification. This could be formed either from tidal current or coastal 

dunes. The differences between lamenae thickness suggests an eolian origin, although it 

lacks the classic “swoopy” look. 

Next is a sharp contact with more arenatious limestone wackestone. It is 

unstratified and has burrows filled with sandy sediment. This layer becomes planar 

stratified farther up and has microfossils. The sharp contact between this layer and the 

dolomite below suggests it was brought about by an autocyclic process, possible a 

shifting tidal current. 

Next is a brown weathering quartz sandstone that is thinly planar laminated and 

carbonate cemented. 

Next is a thinly planar laminated fine grained carbonate layer with burrows at the 

bottom and microfossils. 

Next is are two distinguishable units of limestone. The bottom unit is a fine 

grained unstratified fossiliferous limestone. The upper unit is limestone grainstone, also 

with fossils. 

R.Safipour  
 
Next is a cross stratified sandstone with carbonate cement. It is very similar to 

22

previous sandstone units in the section but is interbedded with arenatious limestone with 

varying proportions of quartz to carbonate sediment. 

Next is a medium grained unsstratified limestone with foram fossils and some 

unusually large quartz grains. 

Next is a cross stratified medium grained calcareous sandstone. 

Next is a fine grained limestone  with chert veins that grades upward from 

packstone to grainstone. It is planar stratified at the bottom and unstratified at the top. It 

has some fossil fragments at the top. 

The final layer is an unstratified poorly sorted carbonate grainstone that ranges 

from upper medium to very coarse. 

Interpretations: The sequence suggests changes in sea level and current velocity. 

The regular cyclicity from siliciclastics to carbonates suggests allocyclic processes are 

mostly at work, although an autoclyclic process such as a shifting tidal current could 

account for some of the sharp contacts.
