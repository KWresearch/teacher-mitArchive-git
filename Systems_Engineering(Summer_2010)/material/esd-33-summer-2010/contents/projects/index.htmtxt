***** Goal *****
Develop a systems engineering plan for a realistic project.
***** Project Deliverables *****
The project deliverables comprise 40% of the final grade for this course.
    * Individual Project proposal (presentation and 1-page description) â 10%
    * Mid-term team presentation â 10%
    * Final team presentation â 20%
***** Detailed Overview *****
During Ses #3, each student will have 2 minutes to present a project proposal.
After viewing all of the proposals, students need to form teams of 3-5. Each
team must have the project idea originator. A team formation report (a one page
report containing names of the team members and project idea) must be submitted
by Ses #5.
Your team will make an 8-minute mid-term progress presentation during Ses #9.
In this presentation, you will need to include (but are not limited to) the
following topics:
    * Project definition / problem statement
    * Project scope
    * Stakeholders and their needs
    * System requirements
    * Your planned approaches
    * Challenges and issues that you face
During the final two sessions, your team will make a 20-minute final
presentation on your project. In the final presentation, you should include
(but are not limited to) the following topics:
    * Problem definition
    * Project scope
    * Stakeholders and their needs
    * Approaches you took
          o System Engineering methods and tools used
          o Different concepts you generated
          o Concept selection process
    * Final recommendation
    * Reflection on what your team have learned about systems thinking
