Deriving Capability Indices from “Scratch”

Agenda

 Demonstrate the 4 simple steps for deriving a Cp 
Index from Sample Data

 How it impacts the 7 Checks for Criticality!
 Measurable?
 Stable?
 Adjustable?
 Interactive?
 Sensitive?
 Robust?
 Capable?

Step 1: Measurement of samples of 
functions

 Measure the function by taking data as random, 
independent, stable samples of a function within 
the design…

Required KP Mgt. Data for any form of 
Capability Assessment

 All FRs or Functional Spec.s must have a 
capable measurement process
documented & in use

 Gage R&R Study

 Each FR or Functional Spec. is placed 
under stable SPC so the Cp can be 
routinely quantified for Phase-by-Phase 
growth & Life Cycle stability

Y as a Function of Controlling Xs

For a given Y there can be numerous 
controlling Xs ….

There can be 3 ways for a controlling X to influence Y:
Xi dominates the Mean… 
for Adjusting
Xj dominates the Standard Deviation… 
for Robustness
Xk co-contributes to both the Mean & s... You pick!

The question CPD&M asks is “do you know 
how Xs affect Ys in light of the 7 Checks???
- Which ones are out of control!?!?

Summary

 You should be able to repeat this explanation
 It is important for you  to be able to do this for anyone you work with.

 An organization practicing CPD&M must understand 
Capability
 How it degrades....
 how it  grows & matures due to intentional  investment in KP 
development tasks....
 How it is calculated....
 What it means in the context of CPD&M....
