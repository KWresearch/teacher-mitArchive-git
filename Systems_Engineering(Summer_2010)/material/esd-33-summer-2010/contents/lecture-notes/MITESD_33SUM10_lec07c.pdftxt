Critical Parameter Development & 
Management 

The 12 Step Process to Develop Critical Parameters
 

Defining a process for CPD&M 

� Post-launch Production & Ongoing Life cycle 
Management out to Discontinuance… 

� The 12 Step process is designed to be used by 
Teams that are supporting products and services 
that are already in the field. 
�  Development of CPs that are currently unknown 
	  Reverse engineering of CPs 
	  Can start at any focus point you want & develop CP data up & 
down the product & process relationship structure you need

What makes a parameter Critical? 

� Is it measurable? 

� Is it stable? 

� Is it adjustable? 

� Is it interactive & statistically significant? 

� Is it sensitive? 

� Is it robust? 

� Is it capable? 

If any one or more of these is a 
significant problem or a shortfall – 
then the parameter is Critical & 
needs the extra effort to make it 
ECO!

Step 1: Create a CP Project Charter 

� Establish the primary goal 1st  then… 
�  Specific objectives (CP Project requirements) 
�  Essential team members 
�  Roles & responsibilities 
�  Project time line 
�  Scope 

� CP project results 
�  clear, specific & measurable deliverables 
 

Intro to CPD&M, Copyright 2010, PDSS Inc.

Step 2: Create a cross-functional team of 
experts to help ID a thorough set of CPs 

� Make sure they are well balanced 
�  right mix of people (experience & judgment) 

� Good at mistake-proofing the list of candidate 
Critical parameters 

Intro to CPD&M, Copyright 2010, PDSS Inc. 

9 

Step 3: Generate / Assess Requirement 
Clarity, Classification & Flow-down 

�  Define Critical System level functional Requirements & their 
tolerance limits (Target + USL & LSL) 
“ Big”  Ys 

� 

�  Define NUD (Critical) & ECO (non-critical) requirements as 
they flow down to subsystems, subassemblies, parts, 
materials and mfg. /assy./ packaging processes 

Intro to CPD&M, Copyright 2010, PDSS Inc. 

10 

Step 4: Generate I-O-C Diagrams, P – Diagrams, 
Noise Diagrams & the Boundary Diagram 

�  Identify high level mass, energy & information flows into and 
out of the system, subsystems & subassemblies 
�  Define candidate System  level CFRs = Ys to be measured 

�  Identify Critical functions, inputs, outputs, controllable 
parameters & noises
