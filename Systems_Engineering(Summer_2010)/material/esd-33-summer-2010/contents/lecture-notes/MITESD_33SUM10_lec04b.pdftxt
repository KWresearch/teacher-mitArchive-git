Key areas for impact 
•  Requirements come from 
many stakeholder classes 
•  Upstream processes feed 
in business requirements 
•  As important as needs 
are constraints 
•  Don’t forget ‘non-
functional’ requirements 
•  QFD is a proven method 
to translate needs to 
requirements

Customer-Focused Design 
Map customer needs to functional descriptions 
•  Focus on “what” needs  
Overall 
Function 
to be achieved not “how” 
•  Helps to organize teams,  
tasks and processes 
•  Enhances creativity by  
decomposing problems 
•  Function or function sets derived from 
customer needs defines subsystems that 
minimize the number of internal interfaces 
(system engineering)  
Interface specifications and protocols 
definition can begin prior to form design

What is the QFD for? 

QFD is for 
•  Coordinating skills within an 
organization  
–  Serves as a lingua franca 
–  Helps break down the functional 
silos 
–  Encourages real teamwork 
•  Designing goods that customers 
want to purchase 
–  Creates external focus 
–  Provides immersion in the 
specifications 
•  Target setting for mature 
products 

• 

QFD is NOT for 
•  Automatic decision making 
–  “the house absolves no one of 
the responsibility of making tough 
decisions”  
Implementing a quick fix 
–  “None of this is simple…” 
–  “An elegant idea ultimately 
decays into process…” 
–  “What is also not simple is 
creating an organization capable 
of absorbing elegant ideas” 
•  More difficult to use for highly 
novel / unprecedented functions

Functional Modeling for CPM uses 
Conservative Law Based Metrics… 
•  Energy: …measure the flow, transformation & state 
of energy (mechanical, magnetic, electrical, chemical, 
thermal, fluidic…) 

•  Mass: …measure the dynamic or static state of the 
flow & transformation of mass (material deflection, 
elongation, volumetric or mass flow rates, liquid-to-
gas, solid-to-liquid & solid-to-gas transformations…) 

• 

Information: …measure the flow & transformation of 
digital & analog electronic, mechanical, magnetic, 
photonic, etc.  signals intended to control a function 
related to mass &/or energy transformation & flow.
