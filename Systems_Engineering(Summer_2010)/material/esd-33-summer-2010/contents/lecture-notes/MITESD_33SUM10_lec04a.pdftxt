Purpose 

As stated in ISO/IEC 15288:2008: The  purpose  of  the  
Stakeholder  Requirements  Definition  Process  is  to define  
the  requirements  for  a  system  that  can  provide  the  
services needed by users and other stakeholders in a defined 
environment. It  identifies  stakeholders,  or  stakeholder  
classes,  involved  with  the system  throughout  its  life  cycle,  
and  their  needs,  expectations,  and desires.  It  analyzes  
and  transforms  these  into  a  common  set  of stakeholder  
requirements  that  express  the  intended  interaction  
the system  will  have  with  its  operational  environment  and 
that are the reference against which each resulting operational 
service is validated

Why ‘Engineer’ Requirements? 
•  Provide early assurance that all top-level requirements are 
fully satisfied in the product, with traceability to where they 
are satisfied. 
•  Prevent unintentional addition of cost (avoid ‘gold plating’). 
•  Establish clear responsibility for requirements 
implementation. 
•  Provide clear visibility across teams into requirements 
allocation and cross-functional interactions. 
•  Easily and quickly assess the impact of changes to 
requirements. 
•  Provide data for early and thorough validation and 
verification of requirements and design artifacts. 
•  Avoid unpleasant downstream surprises!

Requirements Management 

Requirements Management is the process by which: 
•  System/Product needs are captured from the market, business 
strategy, customers and other sources. 
•  Requirements are synthesized from captured needs and the 
meanings and interpretations are validated with the original sources. 
•  Commitment to requirements is obtained from management and 
project personnel. 
•  A history of changes and change rationale is maintained as 
requirements evolve. 
•  Bi-directional traceability is maintained among requirements, project 
plans and work products. 
Inconsistencies are identified and resolved among requirements, 
project plans and work products. 

•

What is a Requirement? 
•  Well-stated requirements exhibit the following 
attributes:  
–  The requirement is Necessary 
•  What would happen if you didn’t include this requirement? 
–  The requirement is Verifiable 
•  How will you know you have met the requirement? 
–  The requirement is Attainable 
•  Requirements are concise and unambiguous 
•  Good requirements are solution-neutral 
•  Requirements are consistent (non-contradictory) 

6 

Requirements Semantics 
•  Requirements use ‘shall’ 
–  The system shall provide… 
–  The system shall be capable of… 
–  The system shall weigh… 
•  Statements of fact use ‘will’ 
–  Often part of a lead-in scenario prefacing one or more 
requirements 
•  Goals use ‘should’ 
–  Used for design goals where quantifiable 
requirements cannot be applied to a desired attribute 
7 

Summary: Attributes of Good Requirements 
•  What…not how 
•  Unambiguous, clear and complete 
•  Verifiable by test or independent analysis 
•  Necessary and appropriate for system 
hierarchy level 
•  Feasible 
•  Consistent (traceable) with requirements 
above and below in the system hierarchy

Formatting PAS in Word  
for Export into Doors 

Keep heading styles in the following form:  
Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3, …,etc. 
Notes:  
–  Framemaker documents use Sec-#, Sec-#.#, 
Sec-#.#.#. Export Framemaker documents to 
Word and convert them to Heading 1, 
Heading 2, etc. before exporting into Doors. 
–  Keep all other styles consistent throughout 
(e.g.  figure heading, table heading, etc.)
