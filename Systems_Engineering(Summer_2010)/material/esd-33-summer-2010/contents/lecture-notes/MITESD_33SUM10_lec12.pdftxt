What is Compound Noise? 

•  Aggregate several noise factors into a 

single noise factor
single noise factor 
•  Example 
– Temperature, humidity, salinity 
– Comppress 3D sppace 

into a single axis 

•  RResollutition IIII outter array 
•  Extreme conditions?

An Academic Perspective on 

Compound Noise


Extreme settings exist iff

βj  ≥≥ ∑∑ γγ ijij
βj 
i =1 

The compound noise technique identifies the robust setting (that which 
minimizes variance) iff

An Academic Perspective on 

Compound Noise

•  Use of compound noise has been widespread

• Comppound noise techniqque can identifyy robust 
settings only in limited situations 
•  Their limited nature suggests they are not often

Their limited nature suggests they are not often 
satisfied in practical experiments
