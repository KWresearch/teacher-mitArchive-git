PDSS Critical Parameter Development & Mgt. Process Quick Guide


12 Steps for a Critical Parameter Development Project (incl. 6 Check Points)


Step 1: Create a CP Project Charter 
establish goal, objectives, team members, roles & responsibilities, time line & scope 
-
-
define clear, specific & measurable CP project results 

Scope of CP 
Act ivity 

Step 2: Create a cross-functional team of experts to help ID a thorough set of CPs 
make sure they are well balanced, right mix of people (experience & judgment) 
-
-
good at mistake-proofing the list of parameters (methods for mistake-proofing) 

Step 3: Generate / Assess Requirement Clarity, Classification & Flow-down 
define Critical System level functional Reqts & their tolerance limits (USL & LSL) 
-
-
define NUD (Critical) & ECO (non-Critical) requirements as they flow down to subsystems, 
subassemblies, parts, materials and mfg. /assy./ packaging processes 

Step 4: Generate I-O-C Diagrams, P – Diagram, Noise Diagrams & the Boundary Diagram 
- identify high level mass, energy & information flows into and out of the system, subsystems & 
subassemblies 
- identify candidate Critical functions,  inputs, outputs, controllable parameters & noises 
- Define leading and lagging indicators & their units of measure 
- identify unit-to-unit, external / environmental & deteriorative noise parameters 
- preliminary documentation of required measurement systems 

Step 5: Structure a Critical Parameter Flow-down Tree 
Define the relationships between Y, ys & their controlling xs 
-
o  Function Trees & Functional Flow Diagrams 
o  Math Models 
Define macro-relationships aligned with Critical noise parameters; which are NUD? 
Plan to separate which xs dominate &  control the mean & which control σ for each Y & sub-y 
Conduct Potential Problem Prevention & Impact Mitigation Analysis (P3IMA Table aka FMEA) 
o  Laws of Unintended Consequences (unwanted functions) 

CP candidate structure & 
priorit ize for focus areas 

-
-
-

Step 6: Identify unique sub-areas of focus; lean out, rank & prioritize the areas to work on 
-
Group prioritized CP flows with the biggest impact on the reqts; apply 6 Step Prevention Process 
Select the appropriate groups of flows that matter the most; again – which are NUD? 
-
-
Align critical noise parameters with the appropriate sub-groups 

Step 7: Prove measurement systems are capable 
- MSA & Gage R&R Studies for Critical Ys, sub-ys & controlling Xs (for both leading & lagging indicators) 

Step 8: Design & conduct experiments (problem ID & prevention!) 
screening experiments (separate signal from random noise)

-
-
modeling experiments (linear & non-linear effects plus interactivity)

noise parameter strength experiments (what shifts the mean or spreads the variance?)

-
robustness experiments

-
-
tolerance sensitivity experiments


Step 9: Analyze data using ANOVA & other statistical methods that identify sensitivities & 
level of capability 
define statistical significance (p values)

-
-
MSparameter  / MStotal

Cp & Cpk values

-
-
Capability Growth Indices (CGI maturation by development process phase)

Step 10: Establish & Verify tolerance ranges & % contribution to variation of critical Ys & 
sub-ys 

-
-
-

USL & LSL for both nominal conditions & stressful conditions (robust tolerances) 
establish variance role-up model (s2  total  = s21  + s22  + …. + s2 n) 
verify & validate final design & processing set points 

Documented CP set 
points 

Step 11: Mfg. & Production Implementation Plan for Critical Parameters 
Establish production & assembly data requirements & data utilization plan 
-
o  Agreement on what constitutes a production or assembly CP 
� 
In-process CPs on the process itself 
�  Within-process or post-process CPs (on parts, sub-assy, sub-system 
or system during mfg., assembly, packaging or upon receipt) 
o  Requirements/Specifications to measure production & assembly CPs against 
o  SPC & Cp/Cpk Study requirements & procedures 
�  Frequency of measurements & action based upon data 
�  Critical Cpk>>>Cp Adjustment parameters (mean shifters) 
o  Measurement system requirements & acceptable signal/noise resolution 
o  Contingency & Corrective Action plans 
�  Alternative action plan 
�  Process specific LSS-based corrective action process plan 
•  Kaizen event or 6σ Project? 

Conduct CP summary 
reviews & make 
Cpk>>>Cp adjustments 
as needed during steady 
state mfg. 

Step 12: Evaluate Quality and Implement Changes in a Control plan 
Develop and submit alternate acceptance plans that maintain or improve functional 
-
quality with reduced acceptance costs 
o  Select acceptance plan that meets overall program needs 
o  Verify performance of selected plan 
o  Implement changes as supported by data per the control plan 

Change Implementation 
and Document Ongoing 
Control Plan

Problem Prevention Steps: 
The 6 Steps for Problem Prevention: 
•  Design a Diagram of deta iled functions in the ir seria l & para lle l f lows

•  These are va lue-added functions that possess inherent robus tness

• Rank & prioritize the value of each func tion re lative to one another


Plan & 
Rank 
T asks 

•  Define potential problems that can occur within & between the func tions 
•  A s tatement of the mis takes or errors that charac terize the prob lem

•  Identif ication of Lead ing Ind icators that measure the on-set of a prob lem


•  Evaluate & document the root causes of the potential problems

•  Understand the mechanisms behind all  impending problems


•  Define preventive  actions for effectiveness & value 
•  Finalize, measure & track  leading indicators –  be proactively effic ient


•  Define contingency plans if the prob lem ac tua lly occurs 
•  F ina lize, Measure & track lead ing & lagg ing indicators – be reac tive ly ef fective af ter 
ind icators reach a trigger po int. 

•  Re-use the  lessons  learned for  future use & reactiv ity

•  Continuous ly improve  the problem prevention process
