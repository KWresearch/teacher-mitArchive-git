CRITICAL PARAMETER MANAGEMENT 
Don Clausing and Dan Frey 
Early in the systems engineering process many decisions are made. When these decisions are
made well, they strongly contribute to success, but only if they are carried through in detailed 
design and transition to production.  It is therefore necessary to work out the implications of the
critical early decisions on myriad detailed decisions.  
Critical Parameter Management (CPM) is an engineering practice specifically aimed at
maintaining the robustness of the system through detailed design and manufacturing. In the early 
development, ideally during technology development, the critical parameters have their values 
optimized to achieve robust performance of the system. Subsequently during detailed design of 
the product system, production development and operation, and field-service development and 
operation it is all too easy to lose the optimized values of the critical parameters. When that 
happens, the system no longer has robust performance, and the development is delayed, with 
great risk of excessive warranty costs once the system reaches the field. 
The first distinction to be made is between a critical parameter and a critical specification. 
Critical parameters are the functional variables that control the physics (and chemistry and 
biology) of the system. Many of them never appear on the production drawings. For example, a
force between a feed belt and a paper stack is critical to the physics of paper handling.  This 
force is therefore a critical parameter of the paper feeder system.  This force is determined by a
spring constant and some geometric parameters of the design. These parameters do appear on 
drawings (or are implied by part numbers on a bill of materials).  The details on the drawing and 
bill of materials are called critical specifications.  
Table 1 shows how critical parameters are transformed during multiple phases of systems 
engineering.  During detailed design, engineers mapping from critical parameters to critical 
specifications.  During this mapping it is important to maintain the needed nominal values of the 
parameters and manage the associated variations.  Similarly, subsequent transformations must
carry the implications all the way to the factory floor.

The objective of Critical Parameter Management is to assure that the optimized values of the
critical parameters are sustained, which requires that the critical parameters are flowed down 
properly to set manufacturing precision levels that assure the customer satisfaction that was 
enabled by the robust design. Ideally the production process that is used to produce each critical
specification is in control and capable.  A manufacturing process that is in control is undergoing 
only random variations. A manufacturing process that is capable exhibits a standard deviation 
small enough compared to tolerances. 
THE CRITICAL-PARAMETER DRAWING 
The core of Critical Parameter Management is the Critical-Parameter Drawing. It is also the 
oldest in practice, having been implemented at the Xerox Corporation in the late 1970s. It was 
implemented in response to the type of problems that have already been alluded to. An example
is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Critical-parameter drawing of paper feeder. 
Figure 1 shows the nominal values of an example of some of the critical parameters. In the actual 
critical-parameter drawing there were about 30 such critical parameters, and a range, or 
tolerance, was also given for each critical parameter. Here it has been simplified to concentrate
on the basic principles. We will return to the subject of the acceptable range around a critical 
parameter. 
The first characteristic to note is that some of these critical parameters are not critical
specifications; i.e., they do not appear on any production drawing. An example is belt tension, 
which is specified as 15 Newtons. At this stage of development all that we care is that in order 
for the feeder to work well, the tension in the belt must be close to 15 Newtons. 
It is left up to the subsequent detailed design to determine the mechanism that will produce the
15 Newtons. In Figure 1 the roller that is pressing up against the belt will produce the tension. 
The upward force on the roller has to be resisted by the two downward force vectors produced by 

2


the tension in the belt on both sides of the roller. The upward force on the roller can be produced 
by a spring, gravity, pneumatic actuator, solenoid, or other means. The detailed design has to be
simple and inexpensive, and consistently produce the necessary upward force that produces 15 
Newtons tension in the belt. 
However, experience has taught that it is just here that trouble starts to enter in. The detailed 
designer is usually working in a trade-off space in which the robustness of the system is not 
included. Rather the emphasis is on characteristics such as manufacturability, maintainability, 
ergonomics, and safety. In his or her concentration to do well on these characteristics it is easy to 
lose sight of the ultimate goal – to produce 15 Newtons of tension in the belt. 
This is the purpose of the critical-parameter drawing, to keep attention focused on the 
functionality of they system. It says to the detailed designers, production designers, and 
production operation people, that they can use their best practices to achieve the other types of 
characteristics, but they must produce the functional values that are on the critical-parameter 
drawing. 
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION 
The critical-parameter drawing is essential to customer satisfaction. In the beginning we 
deployed the customers’ needs into engineering characteristics in the House of Quality. In 
response to those characteristics we selected and integrated technologies that we judged would 
provide a strong market-attack plan (MAP). Robust design was done so that the integrated 
technologies would adhere to customer-satisfaction values in the realistic conditions, which have 
large variations that tend to throw performance off. 
Having done this early work well, now adherence to the critical-parameter drawing will provide 
functionality that will live up to our expectations when we selected and integrated the 
technologies. Thus the critical-parameter drawing enables the subsequent activities to achieve
values that will provide customer satisfaction. 
One approach is to simply include all of the critical parameters in the design matrices of QFD. In 
principle this seems as though it might work. However, experience has shown that it is beneficial
to have critical-parameter drawings to emphasize the necessary attention. 
The subsequent activities after the critical parameters have been optimized in robust design are: 
1.  Detailed design 
2.  Production design
2.1.  Process selection 
2.2.  Tooling design 
2.3.  Online quality control design 
3.  Production operations – Online quality control operation 
This can be further extended to include field operations.

FROM CRITICAL PARAMETERS TO THE FACTORY FLOOR 
The first step is the detailed design. Let’s assume, for example, that the detailed design has six 
critical specifications (x1 through x6), which control the force against the roller Fr that produces 
the belt tension of 15 Newtons. 
Fr = Fr (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) 
Doing the detailed design so that belt tension is nominally 15 Newtons is relatively simple. A
much greater challenge, not well understood by most engineers, is managing variation away 
from nominal. A little history will help explain the current situation. 
Until the late 18th century all manufactured artifacts were made by craftsmen. If parts had to fit
together, he hand tooled them until they fit. Naturally the parts from one craftsman did not match 
the parts from another craftsman. Even successive items from one craftsman, even though 
nominally the same, would have parts that could not be interchanged between the two items. The
hand tooling was always a little different for any two items. 
Circa 1765 Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval, a General in the French Army, concluded that they 
should have muskets with interchangeable parts. His primary objective was to be able to repair 
muskets in the field. After a battle there would be two broken muskets. If the parts were 
interchangeable, they could be combined so that there would be one good musket. 
The production technology of that time was not up to the task. However, the dream marched on. 
It was carried into America by French officers who aided the colonists in their battle for freedom
from Britain. It took much difficult work, but by 1850 the arsenals at Springfield, Massachusetts
and Harpers Ferry, Virginia could produce some interchangeable parts. However, it was 
expensive to do so, and this approach was slow to spread to other industries. However, by the
early 20th century Henry Ford had to have interchangeable parts to operate his famous assembly 
line. 
How were interchangeable parts achieved?  By rigorous application of go/no-go gaging. If a
shaft had to fit into a hole, both were made to tight upper and lower limits such that the shaft
would always fit into the hole with a functional clearance. Thus came about the engineers’ 
obsession with tolerances.  If the nominal (target) diameter of a shaft is 25.000 mm, then a 
tolerance is applied to that; e.g., ± 0.025 mm. This says that all shafts that used should be within 
that range. That is the no/no-go culture that was started by General de Gribeauval. 
In the 1920s Dr. Shewhart at the Bell Labs realized that production processes have some natural
variation, which can be characterized by the standard deviation, σ.  He also observed that the 
production processes can have variation due to special causes (also known as assignable 
variations). The effects of the special causes can be eliminated in the short term, while the 
natural standard deviation can only be improved by longer-term quality improvements. 
Any feature on a part can be produced by one of several production processes. Therefore, 
production-process selection is an important decision. Each process is characterized by its cost 

4


and its precision; i.e., standard deviation. For more than a century engineers have put tolerances
on drawings. When they did that, they implicitly chose a production process. As product
engineers became more and more separated from production, they often did not understand this
connection very well. This led to battles between the design engineers and manufacturing 
engineers. When the design engineers don’t understand production and the manufacturing 
engineers don’t understand the justification of the design, a standoff frequently ensues as 
depicted in Figure 2. 

Figure 2 removed due to copyright restrictions.

Now let’s seek a more effective process than we see in Figure 2.  One is suggested by a story 
from Don Clausing.  Circa 1984 Clausing took Dr. Taguchi to the countryside south of 
Rochester. They hiked and then went to a country restaurant for lunch.  Summarizing a common 
view of a good systems engineering process, Don said, "First we do robust design, and then we
put tolerances on the drawings." Taguchi replied, "No."  Don repeated that thought in various 
ways, always with the response, "No." Finally they got into a dialogue, from which Don emerged 
with a new understanding of what to do after robust design -- select the production process to 
attain optimum overall economy! 
Here is how we view the situation.  For each feature to be produced we have several production 
options. To simplify the primary point, let’s assume that there are two production options. For 
example, a 25 mm shaft could be turned on a lathe or it could be ground in a cylindrical grinder.  
Turning will typically achieve precision of 0.05mm on a 25mm diameter.  Cylindrical grinding 
can typically achieve precision of 0.01mm.  Such values are readily available for most 
manufacturing processes as depicted in Figure 3.  But the added precision comes at a cost, 
perhaps a factor of two or three times the cost of turning.  Cost implications of process precision 
can be estimated (roughly!) with charts such as Figure 4.  In fact, the dependence of cost on 
precision more complex – it is not so smooth as in Figure 4 because at some point you are forced 

5


to “jump” from one process to a fundamentally different process.  But for an initial estimate, cost 
models as depicted in Figure 4 are fine.  
Note, however, how deeply tolerance based thinking is rooted in the current culture of 
engineering.  Figures 3 and 4 label axes with “dimensional tolerance” when standard deviation or 
precision would be a more accurate label!

Now let’s return to the choice between turning and grinding.  Is the improvement in precision for 
grinding worth the incremental cost?  That is the core of the issue.  The economically-based 
decision method is to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of manufacturing process cost 
and quality loss due to variations.  To estimate total cost, we must flow down from the quality 
losses due to deviation from ideal function to variation in critical parameters then down to 
critical specifications.  In our example of the roller with a force applied, we have six critical 
specifications. If we assume that there are two production-process options for each of the six 
critical specifications, then we have 64 total options. Fortunately, it is generally not necessary to 
consider all 64 options and pick the overall winner.  The quality loss implications of each critical 
specification can generally be allocated and each one can separately be optimized to minimize 
the overall cost.  This is a consequence of the fact that within the small range of manufacturing 
variations, most engineering systems behave almost linearly.  If this assumption holds, the details 
of the total cost calculation work out as follows: 
•	 Recall that the critical parameter, force, is a function of six critical specifications, that is, 
F = F (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6) 

6


•	 The quality loss because of not meeting the target value is proportional to the variance 
with some constant measured in dollars per Newton squared.  A useful way to estimate 
this constant is to consider a “customer tolerance” ΔC which prompts a typical customer 
to seek rework and a cost (economic loss) to do the rework, LC 

•	 The variance of the critical parameter is a linear combination of the variances in the
critical specifications.1  The weightings on each term correspond to a squared sensitivity 
of force, F, to each critical specification, x1, x2… x6. 

• 

•  Therefore quality loss due to variance in each critical specification xi is simply 
. 
And the minimum overall cost requires minimization of each total cost which is the sum
of the quality loss and production cost for that each critical specification xi. 
In some cases, the “total cost minimization” approach to selecting the manufacturing processes is 
replaced by other processes.  For example, for some systems the performance demanded is set by 
a contract.  In other cases, management has set a firm target based on a forecast of the 
competitor’s capabilities which must be matched.  For example, for a space-based imaging 
system may have clear specifications on pointing accuracy.  In such cases, it may be preferable 
to view the performance needed as fixed and to minimize production cost.  This approach is 
traditionally called error budgeting because it seems to suggest that error is a fixed quantity to be 
 
allocated across the system.   However, for most systems engineering in competitive commercial 
industries a better solution can be attained by minimizing the sum of production cost and quality 
loss. 
The other method for the selection of production processes is knowledge-based engineering 
(KBE). For specifications that are not critical, this is almost always the method that is used. It
can also be used for some critical specifications, but caution is needed. All too often such 
decisions have been based solely on either initial cost or on quality, with very bad results. 

After the production processes are chosen, the production tooling is designed and put into use to 
make parts. The production online quality control is designed and implemented in production. 
Any and all of this is referred to as critical-parameter management, or similar names such as 

1  This equation entered into the engineering literature as early as 1953 (Kline and McClintock 1953).  The 
equation is valid only if the critical specifications are independent (see Frey, 2004). This will not be 
applicable for example to resistances on an integrated circuit.  When Equation 2 is inadequate, the 
variance can be determined by several different means including Monte Carlo simulation, Latin 
Hypercube Sampling, or using orthogonal arrays (for an example see Phadke, 1989; pp. 190–193).

used is not important. It all has to be done. 
CRITICAL-SPECIFICATION TOLERANCES 
Although the selection of the right process (or grade) is usually the most important step, it is also 
necessary to determine the best tolerance value that will go on the production drawing. This can 
be used to sort the good from the bad when it is required. 
There are three “tolerances” (Figure 5).  We start with the customer tolerance. 

Figure 5. Three-tiered Tolerances. 
Again, the customer tolerance (ΔC) is the value at which the average customer (sometimes
thought of as the 50th percentile customer) will be sufficiently dissatisfied so that they will call
for corrective action.  Associated with the customer tolerance is a quality loss in dollars (LC) that 
is the cost of the countermeasure in response to the customer.  This cost will be relatively large 
because of the field logistics that will be involved. 
The same countermeasure could have been done much more cheaply in the factory.  This much 
smaller quality loss in manufacturing (LM) has associated with it a manufacturing tolerance (ΔM).
The manufacturing tolerance will be much smaller than the customer tolerance because it costs
much less to implement the countermeasure in the factory.  This is the tolerance that goes on the 
drawing. 
We can save still more money by using the adjustment limit D to limit variation during 
production. The customer tolerance and the quality loss that would be incurred at the customer's 
site establish the quality loss function. In factory operations we limit the usual variation to the
range of ±D, the adjustment limit. As is indicated in Figure 5, we save a great deal of money in 
quality loss avoidance by limiting the range to ±D instead of ±ΔC. 

8


LCLMDQUALITYLOSS!C!MThis concept of three-tiered tolerances based on the quality loss function clearly leads to 
production operations with the units of production bunched tightly around the customer-
satisfaction target value. 
The manufacturing tolerance is calculated to minimize the total cost. The quality loss is given by 
the quadratic relationship: 

where L is the expected quality loss, LC, the loss at the customers' tolerance (in other words the 
cost of the countermeasure in the field), ΔC the customers' tolerance, and Δ the actual deviation 
from the customer-satisfaction target for a specific unit of production. 
The countermeasure can be performed in the factory at a much lower cost, LM, than in the field, 
and this defines the manufacturing tolerance.  Putting the cost of the countermeasure in the 
manufacturing site and the unknown value of manufacturing tolerance into the loss function 
gives 

which establishes the value of the manufacturing tolerance.  If a specific unit of production has a 
measured value of ∆ that is greater than ∆M, then it should not be shipped. It is cheaper to fix it 
in the factory at a cost of LM than incur the greater value of the quality loss in the field. 
Conversely, if the value of ∆ is less than ∆M, then the product should be shipped. The quality 
loss in the field will be less than the cost of the countermeasure in the factory, LM. Thus the 
value of ∆M  is the boundary between products that should be shipped, and the products that
should be reworked. 
Because the cost of the countermeasure in the manufacturing site will usually be much less than 
the cost of the countermeasure at the customer's site, the manufacturing tolerance is significantly 
less than the customer tolerance. If the repair work (countermeasure) in the factory is very cheap, 
it pays to "repair", or adjust, nearly all of the units. Then the manufacturing tolerance becomes
very small, so that only the units that are already very good do not have the inexpensive
adjustment that improves customer satisfaction. The manufacturing tolerance is the tolerance that 
is put on the drawing.  If the product has to be inspected, no product outside of the 
manufacturing tolerance should be shipped. 
In actual practice, the value of the performance parameter is usually held to the tighter range of 
the adjustment limit, ±D, during on-line QC.  Therefore, there should never be any products 
outside of the manufacturing tolerance, and inspection (after production is complete) should not
be needed.  The only operational use for the manufacturing tolerance is in the unusual case that 
the on-line adjustment process failed.  Then the products that have been made while the 

9


L = Lc!c2 !2!M = LMLc !cadjustment process is not operational will have to be inspected, and the manufacturing tolerance
is then used to determine whether they should be shipped or reworked.  
To summarize the selection of production processes and the establishment of tolerances we 
compare the traditional approach with the approach that has been featured here.

DOCUMENTATION 
The objective of the documentation is to focus attention on the critical parameters during the
detailed design, production-tooling design, and online QC design and implementation. All too 
often in the past this work has inadvertently changed the optimized values of the critical
parameters, with devastating results. 
The core of the documentation to focus attention on the critical parameters is the critical-
parameter drawing. This is the beacon during all subsequent work. It keeps the importance and 
the values of the critical parameters visibly in front of everyone whose work has some influence
on them. 
Beyond the critical-parameter drawing, there is much supplementary documentation that can be 
very useful. The critical specifications can display their effect on the failure modes. For example, 
let’s assume that the detailed design includes a spring and lever to create the force on the roller, 
Fr. Then a critical specification is the spring constant K. If the nominal value of K is 10 
newtons/mm, then a value somewhat less than 10 will cause the failure mode of multifeeds. (Too 
little tension in the belt will produce too little force against the retard roll, and thus let the second 
sheet through too frequently.) Let’s assume that happens at 9 newtons/mm. On the other hand a
value of 11 newtons/mm will produce excessive damage to the sheets of paper, and excessive
wear on the belt and/or the retard roll. This can be displayed as: 

This can be displayed on the production drawing or on an enhanced version of the production 
drawing that is kept in a critical-parameter-management database. This keeps the failure modes
visible and prominent in the thinking of the people who subsequently do the tooling design, 
component purchasing, and online QC. This states loud and clear: DO NOT allow the spring 
constant to exceed 11, or excessive wear and damage will cause customer dissatisfaction. DO 

10


! "1.0 (multifeeds)+1.0 (Damage & wear)10NOT allow the spring constant to be less than 9, or excessive multifeeds will cause customer 
dissatisfaction. 
Another form of CPM documentation is the failure-mode catalog. This is a data base that shows
all of the failure modes of the system. For each failure mode the relevant critical-parameter 
drawing is referenced. The relevant critical specifications can also be referenced. 
The exact details of the CPM documentation can be varied and still be successful. The guiding 
principle is to keep the organization focused on the critical parameters and their values that are
required for successful performance and reliability. 
SUMMARY 
The total practice is summarized in Figure 6.  The system architecture and selected technologies 
determine the ultimate potential system performance and reliability. No amount of subsequent 
good work can make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear. The objective of the subsequent work is to 
capture as much of the inherent ultimate performance and reliability as possible. 
Robust design attempts to optimize the values of the critical parameters. If they are completely 
optimized, then all of the ultimate potential system performance and reliability will be enabled. 
The objective of the subsequent work is to carry this out to the factory floor and then to the 
customers.  Critical Parameter management therefore begins after robust design and is intended 
to deliver the quality made possible by the earlier steps.  If CPM is done well, then the optimized 
values of the critical parameters will be achieved for the customers. That is the goal of CPM.

This course note provides the basic principles and motivation of CPM. One brand of CPM is 
presented in great detail in Creveling, et al (2003; pp. 249-336). 
Critical-parameter management is essential to successful system-engineering practice. It helps to 
greatly reduce development time, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce life-cycle costs.
