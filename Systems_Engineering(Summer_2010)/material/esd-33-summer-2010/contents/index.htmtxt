***** Course Description *****
Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable the
realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and
required functionality early in the development cycle, documenting
requirements, then proceeding with design synthesis and system validation while
considering the complete problem including operations, performance, test,
manufacturing, cost, and schedule. This subject emphasizes the links of systems
engineering to fundamentals of decision theory, statistics, and optimization.
It also introduces the most current, commercially successful techniques for
systems engineering.
