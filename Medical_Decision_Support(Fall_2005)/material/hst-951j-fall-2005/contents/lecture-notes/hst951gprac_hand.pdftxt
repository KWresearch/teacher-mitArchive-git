Data 

Data  format 

The data we plan on using: 
Molecular Classiﬁcation of Cancer :  Class Discovery and 
Class Prediction by Gene Expression, T.R. Golub et.  al, 
Science 286:531­537.  (1999). 

Google:  “golub all aml data” 

The data comes as: 
�  Two ﬁles:  training set and  test set 
�  Each gene on a row 
�  class  in separate ﬁle 
Need  to  transform.

5×2 CV 

The 5x2CV F ­test can be used  to quantitatively compare  the 
performance of  two classiﬁers.  As  its name  implies,  the  test  is based 
on performing ﬁve replications of 2­fold CV. 
Let Δij  denote  the difference between  the performance measures of 
the  two classiﬁers on  fold  j  ∈ {1, 2} of replication  i  ∈ {1, . . . , 5}.  The 
¯
average difference  in performance on replication  i  is Δi  and  the 
2 . 
estimated variance  is si 

(Δi 1  + Δi 2 )

5×2 CV 
Let H0  denote  the null hypothesis  that  the  two classiﬁers perform 
equally well.  Under H0 , Δij  can be  treated as being N (0, σ2 ) 
distributed, and we have:

We  then reject H0  if  the statistic  f  is sufﬁciently  large.  For 95% 
conﬁdence,  f  = 4.74.

Markers? 

The repor t 

Bioinformatics:  Can we suggest markers  that discerns between ALL 
and AML? 

What we want  to  tell: 
�  Fuzzy Classiﬁcation Trees are wor th while 
�  They are  interpretable 
�  We  found a good marker  for discerning ALL  from AML 
Suppor t 
�  Comparison  to other classiﬁers 
�  Repeat of paper classiﬁcation  task 
�  Show stability of marker
