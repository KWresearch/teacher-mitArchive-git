Survival function

Probability that an individual survives at least t, T is patient’s 
survival 
•  S(t) = P(T > t) = 1 – F(t) 
•  Survival is cumulative, non-increasing function

•  F(t) is cumulative distribution of death (failure)

•  By definition, S(0) = 1 and S(∞)=0

Unconditional failure rate

•  pdf of T 
•  f(t) = lim Δt-> 0  P(individual dies (t,t+Δt))/ Δt 
•  f(t) always non-negative 
•  Area below density is 1 
•  Estimated by 
# patients dying in the interval/total patients 

Conditional failure rate

•  Hazard function 
•  h(t) = lim Δt-> 0  P(survivor until t dies (t,t+Δt))/ Δt 
•  h(t) is conditional instantaneous failure rate

•  Estimated by 
# patients dying in the interval/survivors at t

S(t ) = Π (nj - dj )/ nj

dj  is the number of deaths in interval j 
nj  is the number of individuals at risk 
Product is from time interval 1 to j

• Example

•	 Deaths: 10, 37, 40, 80, 91,143, 164, 188, 188, 190, 
192, 206, … 

Life-Tables

•  AKA actuarial method

S(t ) = Π (nj  - dj  )/ nj
i
dj  is the number of deaths in interval j

nj  is the number of individuals at risk

Product is from time interval 1 to j

•  Pre-defined intervals j 
are independent of death times

Simple  models


Multiple strata


Multivariate models


•	 Several strata, each defined by a set of 
variable values 
•	 Could potentially go as far as “one 
stratum per case”? 
•	 Can it do prediction for individuals?


Cox Proportional Hazards


•	 Regression model

•	 Can give estimate of hazard for a 
particular individual relative to baseline 
hazard at a particular point in time 
•	 Baseline hazard can be estimated by, 
for example, by using survival from the 
Kaplan-Meier method or parametrically 

Proportional Hazards


λi = λ eβxi

where λ  is baseline hazard (ie, for the “baseline” –

usually the most common patient) and x is covariate

i 
vector for a specific patient i

Cox proportional hazards 
hi(t) = h0(t) e βxi 

• Survival 


S (t) = [S0(t)]eβx
i


i


Cox Proportional Hazards


hi(t) = h0(t) e βxi 
•	 From the set of m individuals at risk at time j (Rj), the probability of 
picking exactly the one who died is 

h0(t) e βxi 
m  h0(t) e βxm 
Σ
•	 Then likelihood function to maximize to all  j is 
•	 L(β) = Πj  (e βxi  / Σm e βxm ) 

•	 MLE uses LogLikelihood 

Important details


•	 Survival curves can’t cross  if hazards are 
proportional 
•	 There is a common baseline h0, but we don’t need to
know it to estimate the coefficients 
Ie, we don’t need to know the shape of hazard
•	
function 
•	 Cox model is commonly used to interpret importance 
of covariates (amenable to variable selection
methods) 
•	
It is the most popular multivariate model for survival 

•	 Testing the proportionality assumption is difficult and 
hardly ever done 

Estimating survival for a  

patient using the Cox model

•	 Need to estimate the baseline

•	 Can use parametric or non-parametric 
model to estimate the baseline 
•	 Can then create a continuous “survival 
curve estimate” for a patient 
•	 Baseline survival can be, for example:

– Kaplan-Meier estimate 

Example of survival estimates


What if the proportionality  

assumption is not OK?

•	 Survival curves may 
cross 
•	 Other multivariate 
models can be built 
•	 Survival at certain time 
points are modeled and

Summary


•	 Kaplan-Meier for simple descriptive 
analysis 
•	 Cox Proportional for multivariate prediction 
if survival curves don’t cross 
•	 Other methods for multivariate survival 
exist: logistic regression, neural nets, 
CART, etc.
