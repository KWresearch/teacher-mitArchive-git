Probability of TB given PPD- = 2/89


Bayes rule


•  Definition of conditional probability:  

•  P(A|B) = P(AB)/P(B) 

P(B|A) = P(BA)/P(A)  

P(AB) = P(BA)

P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)


P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)


Simple Bayes


Probability of PPD- given TB = P(PPD-|TB)  = 0.2

=  0.1

= P(TB) 
Probability of TB 
= 0.89

= P(PPD-)  
Probability of PPD-

P(TB|PPD-) = P(PPD-|TB) P(TB)

Example of a Decision Problem


•  College athlete considering knee surgery

•  Uncertainties: 
– success in recovering perfect mobility 
– infection in surgery (if so, needs another 

surgery and may loose more mobility)

– survive surgery

•	 Quality Adjusted Life Years

•	 How many years with problem are equivalent to 
years without problem 
• E.g.:

–  x years with poor mobility are equivalent to y years 
with full mobility 
–  x years wheelchair-bound are equivalent to y years of 
full mobility 
•	 These are judgement calls that can represent an 
individual preference or a collective (societal) 
preference

Value of Information


•	 Value of “Clairvoyance” (e.g. perfect prognostic system)

If someone knows exactly what will happen if you make a 
•	
certain decision, how much is that worth? 
•	 E.g., if someone knows for sure whether the patient will 
die or survive following surgery, how much is that worth? 
It is usually calculated as the difference between the 
expected value with clairvoyance and without 
clairvoyance

Summary


•	 Use conditional probabilities to assign 
probabilities to branches 
•	 Use some utility scale that is consistent

•	 Calculate expected values 
•	 Choose the max expected value 
•	 Find out value of information 
•	 Perform sensitivity analysis
