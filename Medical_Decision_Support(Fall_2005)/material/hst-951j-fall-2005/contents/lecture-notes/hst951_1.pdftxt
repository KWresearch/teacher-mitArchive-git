•  Game theory 
–  Statistics 
–  Operations research 

•  Maximize utility 
–  In many domains, this 

means maximize $$$ 


Example of a Decision Problem


•  College athlete considering knee surgery

•  Uncertainties: 
– success in recovering perfect mobility 
– infection in surgery (if so, needs another 

surgery and may loose more mobility)

– survive surgery

Informed consent


"Informed consent and good clinical practice require a discussion of 
these risks and benefits, but there is very little data on the degree to 
which patients comprehend the specifics of this information," 
The researchers found that, of the patients who received angioplasty 
42 percent could not identify any risks, and 41 percent could not 
identify any benefits. For the surgery patients, 45 percent could not 
identify any risks and 22 percent could not identify any benefits. 
Furthermore, when asked to quantify the risks of the procedure, 78 
percent of the angioplasty and 57 percent of the surgery patients 
could not.
