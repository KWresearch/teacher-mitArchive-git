***** General Guidelines for Final Project *****
You should apply one or more of the models covered in class for your final
project.
If you implement the algorithms yourself, then you do not need to compare more
than one model, but you have to document your implementation and append it with
the final report (e.g., you implemented a genetic algorithm that selects
variables to be used in a neural network model).
If you are using existing software packages (See5.0, Genie, Rosetta, etc.),
then I would like you to apply your data in at least two different types of
models, preferably more (e.g. classification tree and rough sets), justify why
you think the data are better suited for these methods (e.g., categorical data
are better suited for classification trees than neural networks).
Use medically related data. I will provide those with little medical
connections with published data sets (e.g., trauma patients, extracted from
Christensen's textbook on logistic regression). Use this set or another of your
interest to compare performance of several models or to investigate selection
of variables (e.g., comparison of different selection methods), selection of
cases (e.g., detection of outliers). You can use medical data from:
    * UCI_depository_and_UCI_KDD_archive
    * Statlib
    * Delve_-_Data_for_Evaluating_Learning_in_Valid_Experiments
    * R_Project
    * NCBI_-_National_Center_for_Biotechnology_Information
too.
Remember to use the evaluation methods covered in class (ROC curves,
calibration curves and indices, etc.) to report performance of your models.
***** Reports *****
The report should be between 4-6 single spaced pages, 10-point font. Report can
be longer if you really need, but please do not add fluff. Include the usual:
    * Abstract
    * Background: (why the problem being addressed is important.)
    * Material and Methods: (include here as much detail as possible here, such
      as the exact parameters you used -- learning rate 0.05, etc. -- software
      name and version, and anything that would make your work reproducible by
      another person.) Include pointers to the data sets you used, as well as
      any detail of pre- or post processing that was used (e.g., constructed
      randomly 10 pairs of training and test sets for cross-validation, etc.).
    * Results
    * Discussion
    * Conclusion
    * References
    * Appendices (e.g., code implemented, pointers to data sets)
***** Web page *****
Delivery: Please create a web-page for your report. This web-page should
contain:
    * Title of the report
    * An abstract/summary of the report
    * A link to the report proper
    * Links to source code/application files and data needed to repeat what you
      did for the report
***** Software *****
If you want to install stuff on your own machine, R is free. Feel free to
implement algorithms if you want. Other packages you might consider are:
    * Neural networks: NevProp4, by Prof. Phil Goodman
    * Logistic regression: SAS
    * Classification trees: See5.0
    * Rough sets: Rosetta
    * Belief networks: SamIam
Please note that some of these are freely available as demo versions only, so
there may be limits on number of cases, variables, days available for trial,
etc.
***** Examples of OK projects *****
    * Compare performances of 4 different machine learning models in a certain
      data set, and fully report results using evaluation methods described in
      class.
    * Compare performance of 1 machine learning model (explain why you chose
      this one) and one or more medical experts (the expert cannot be
      yourself).
    * Investigate variable selection methods in different types of models (use
      of artificial sets to make a point is OK, but please also try in some
      real data).
    * Investigate case selection methods in different types of models (use of
      artificial sets to make a point is OK, but please also try in some real
      data).
***** Examples of Not OK projects *****
    * Build a framework for application of some method without actually using
      or implementing the method and showing results in artificial or real
      data.
    * Build a decision tree on some medical topic using you or your colleague's
      probabilities and utilities without testing in the real world.
    * Apply one machine learning model in a data set and not compare results to
      an existing reported model or other models.
    * Report results of machine learning models using accuracy alone.
    * Recycle projects from other classes.
If you don't know whether your project would be OK or not, please discuss it
with the instructors.
