Abstract 
 
The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has been used for decades in the diagnosis and 
treatment  of  critically  ill  patients,  but  knowledge  of  PAC  waveform  interpretation 
remains  inadequate  among  physicians  and  nurses.    Inspired  by  the  relative  success 
of  EKG 
feasibility  of 
investigates  the 
interpretation  programs,  this  study 
computerized  PAC  waveform  interpretation.    Clinician-provided  contextual  data, 
accompanying EKG  data,  and manually  pre-processed waveform  data were  provided 
as  input,  and  the  ability  of  classifiers  to  recognize  dangerous  situations,  system 
problems,  waveform  locations,  and  underlying  patient  physiology  was  evaluated.  
The  dataset  consisted  of  66  waveforms  classified  by  experts,  and  the  classifiers 
tested were simple logistic regression, 1-nearest neighbor, decision tree, naïve Bayes, 
and neural network.  Under 4-fold cross-validation, 1-nearest neighbor had the most 
success  at  classifying  accurately,  but  the  neural  network  had  a  high  area  under  the 
receiver-operator  curve  more  consistently  across  the  four  classification  tasks.    All 
classifiers  were  good  at  identifying  location.    The  results  of  this  feasibility  study  are 
encouraging  and  suggest  that  computerized  PAC  waveform  interpretation  may  be 
useful to clinicians. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Introduced into the intensive care unit (ICU) over thirty years ago, the PAC is used in 
the  diagnosis  of  cardiopulmonary  disturbances  and  for  assessing  and  monitoring 
hemodynamic  variables  in  the  critically  ill.    Data  derived  from  pulmonary  artery 
catheterization alter therapeutic decisions in about half of all insertions.1 2  More than 
45  million  catheters  have  been  used  since  1970.3    Use  of  the  PAC  is  considered 
routine  in  most  critical  care  areas,  and  estimated  sales  of  these  catheters  are 
between 1 and 2 million annually in the United States.4 
 
Recently,  however,  the  presumed  beneficial  effect  of  care  directed  by  the  PAC  has 
been called  into question by both  retrospective  reviews and prospective,  randomized 
trials.    Connors  et  al.  found  that  PAC  use  was  associated  with  increased  mortality 
and  increased  utilization  of  resources,  and  subgroup  analyses  did  not  reveal  any 
patient  group  or  investigation  site  for  which  PAC  use  was  associated  with  improved 
outcomes.5  In the “Canadian” study, Sandham et al. compared PAC-directed therapy 
with  standard  care without  the  use  of  the  PAC  and  found  no  benefit  to  PAC-directed 
therapy.6    In  the  “French”  study,  Richard  et  al.  randomly  assigned  patients  with 
acute  respiratory  distress  syndrome  (ARDS)  or  sepsis  to  management  guided  by 
either the PAC or the central venous catheter (CVC) and found no benefit for the PAC 
group.7 
 
One  possible  reason  why  the  PAC  has  not  yet  been  shown  to  be  beneficial  is  that 
knowledge  of  how  to  interpret  PAC  data  is  inadequate  among  physicians  and  critical

care nurses.    Iberti et al. administered a 31-question multiple-choice examination  to 
496  physicians  practicing  in  13 medical  facilities  in  the  United  States  and  Canada  to 
assess their knowledge and understanding of the use of the PAC and interpretation of 
data  derived  from  it.8    The  mean  test  score  was  67%  correct.    Gnaegi  et  al., 
evaluating 535 French, Swiss, and Belgian physicians  in 86  ICUs using  the same 31-
question  examination,  discovered  similar  results.9    Of  note,  approximately  50%  of 
the respondents did not correctly identify pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) 
from a clear tracing.  Of the 1095 members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine in 
the  United  States  who  responded  to  a  survey  assessing  attitudes  towards  and 
knowledge  of  PAC  use,  one-third  of  the  respondents  did  not  correctly  identify  PAOP 
on a clear  tracing.10   The evaluation of 168 critical care nurses  in southern California 
by  Burns  et  al.  revealed  that  39%  of  the  respondents  were  unable  to  identify  PAOP 
from a tracing.4 
 
This  paper  investigates  the  feasibility  of  accurate  computerized  PAC  waveform 
interpretation. 
  Computer-assisted 
interpretation  of  the  superficially  similar 
electrocardiogram  (EKG)  has  a  long  history11  and  is  at  least  as  good  as  EKG 
interpretation  by  a  trained  research  physician.12    However,  the  use  of  computers  in 
interpreting PAC waveforms  is still a  research topic.   deBoisblanc et al.,  for  instance, 
recently  published  an  article  on  estimating  pulmonary  artery  occlusion  pressure 
(PAOP)  in  nineteen  closed-chest  dogs  by  an  artificial  neural  network,  using 
pulmonary  artery  pressure,  its  first  time  derivative,  and  beat  duration  as  neural 
inputs.13 
 
PAC waveforms are more difficult to interpret than EKGs because PAC waveforms are 
context-dependent. 
  Although  clinical 
information  can  be 
informative,  EKG 
waveforms  can  generally  be  interpreted  in  isolation.    On  the  other  hand,  PAC 
waveforms  are  difficult  to  interpret  meaningfully  without  at  least  some  basic 
information on the state of the catheter system and the state of the patient (Table 1).

Example of Influence on PAC Waveform Interpretation 

Accompanying 
EKG 

A normal waveform from the proximal port is central venous 
pressure (CVP).  A normal waveform from the distal port is 
pulmonary artery pressure (PA) or pulmonary artery occlusion 
pressure (PAOP). 
Balloon Status  When properly inflated, the balloon changes the distal port 
waveform from PA to PAOP. 
An accompanying EKG gives the rhythm status and location of P 
waves, QRS complexes, and T waves in relationship to the PAC 
waveform.  These pieces of information are essential in 
differentiating a and v waves on the PAC trace and in the 
diagnosis of cannon a waves. 
Spontaneous inspiration decreases intrathoracic pressure and the 
measured PAC pressure.  Positive pressure ventilation increases 
intrathoracic pressure and the measured PAC pressure. 
Different settings, such as pressure support and intermittent 
mandatory ventilations (IMV), modify the interpretation in vastly 
different ways.  If positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is high 
enough, PAC pressure measurements have to be adjusted 
accordingly.

Sedation 

Transducer 
Level 

An awake or lightly sedated patient can take spontaneous 
negative-pressure inspiratory breaths.  A deeply sedated patient 
can only take ventilator-driven positive-pressure inspiratory 
breaths. 
The transducer should be at the level of the vascular structure of 
interest.  If the transducer is too high or too low, the measured 
pressure in the vascular structure would be proportionally too low 
or too high, respectively. 

 
The  PAC  waveform  itself  contains  a  lot  of  information  that  can  be  processed  into 
various  elements.    Some  simple  elements  can  easily  be  obtained  manually  from 
printouts of PAC waveforms and their accompanying EKGs (Table 2).

Trough Variation 

For each interval between R waves on the accompanying 
EKG, the peak on the PAC waveform is the highest pressure 
in that interval.  The highest peak (HP) is the maximum peak 
across all analyzed intervals. 
The lowest trough (LT) is the minimum trough across all 
analyzed intervals. 
This is the difference between HP and LT. 
This is the midpoint between HP and LT. 
This is the location of the peak in relation to R and T waves 
on the accompanying EKG. 
This is the difference between the maximum peak and the 
minimum peak across all analyzed intervals. 
This is the difference between the maximum trough and the 
minimum trough across all analyzed intervals. 

 
Interpretation  of  PAC  waveforms  consists  of  identifying  the  waveform,  recognizing 
problems and artifacts, and measuring pressures of  interest.   Measuring pressures  is 
only  meaningful  after  identifying  the  waveform  and  confirming  that  no  artifacts  or 
other problems exist, so the first task is classification (Table 3).

A PAC waveform indicating a dangerous situation requires 
immediate attention. 
A PAC waveform that indicates a problem means that there is 
either a dangerous situation or a problem with the catheter 
system that is causing an artifact in the waveform. 
Identifying the location of the source of the waveform is essential 
for measuring pressure. 
Identifying unusual features give clues to the underlying 
physiology of the patient or the state of the catheter system.

Methods 
 
The data consists of 66 PAC waveforms with accompanying EKGs and other essential 
contextual  information  (as  described  in  Table  1).    They  were  classified  by  a 
consensus of a critical care attending physician and a critical care nursing supervisor 
along  the  four  axes  of  danger,  problem,  location,  and  dominant  feature(s)  (as 
described  in  Table  2).    The  waveform  elements  described  on  Table  2  were  obtained 
manually  for  each  waveform.    The  compiled  data,  in  Microsoft  Excel  format,  is 
available  upon  request.    An  overview  of  the  kinds  of  waveforms  in  the  dataset  is 
given in Table 4.

The  machine  learning  software  used  for  classification  is  the  Java  data  mining 
program  Weka,  version  3.4.6.14    Attribute  selection  was  done  using  Ranker,  which 
evaluates  the  worth  of  an  attribute  by  measuring  the  information  gain  with  respect 
to  the  class  and  then  ranks  the  attributes  accordingly.    The  entire  dataset was  used 
for ranking.  The attributes with that were uninformative were discarded (Table 5).

The Weka  classifiers  that  were  investigated  include  ZeroR  (classifying  everything  as 
the  most  common  class  regardless  of  attributes),  Simple  Logistic,  IB1  (1-nearest 
neighbor),  J48  (decision  tree),  logistic  regression,  naïve  Bayes,  and  Multilayer 
Perceptron (neural network). 
 
Because  of  the  small  dataset,  with  some  classes  having  very  few  numbers,  1- 
nearest  neighbor  was  used  instead  of  K-nearest  neighbors  (with  K  greater  than  1).  
The  decision  tree  was  built  with  minimum  leaf  node  of  1.    The  neural  network  was 
built with 5 hidden  layers, which  is half of the total number of  informative attributes.  
(All other parameters were the defaults for these classifiers in Weka 3.4.6.) 
 
Cross-validation  was  used  to  evaluate  the  success  of  each  classifier.    Because  the 
dataset  is  small,  increasing  the  number  of  folds  would  increase  the  size  of  the 
training sets.  However, using too many folds would leave the test sets too small.  To 
balance  increasing  the  size  of  the  training  sets  and  keeping  the  size  of  the  test  sets 
acceptable,  four  folds were used,  so  that  training  sets each  contained 49 waveforms 
and test sets each contained 17 waveforms. 
 
 
Experiments 
 
Tables  6-9  display  the  results  from  running  the  various  classifiers  for  each  type  of 
classification.    The  kappa  coefficient  measures  pair-wise  agreement  after  correcting 
for  expected  chance  agreement.15    When  there  is  no  agreement  other  than  that 
which  would  be  expected  by  chance,  kappa  is  zero. When  there  is  total  agreement, 
kappa is one.  AUC is the area under the receiver-operator curve (ROC).

Results 
 
1-nearest  neighbor  (IB1)  was  significantly  more  accurate  (at  the  5%  level)  than 
ZeroR  for  all  types  of  classifications,  while  multilayer  perceptron  provided 
consistently good ROC results.  All classifiers were good at identifying location. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
This was a study on  the  feasibility of computerized  interpretation of PAC waveforms, 
and  the  results  are  encouraging.    However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  this  study 
only  demonstrates  one  part  of  the  total  task  of  waveform  interpretation.    The  first 
part consists of data acquisition and is a challenge in itself. 
 
Three  types  of  data  need  to  be  acquired  in  order  to  perform  the waveform  analysis.  
The first type consists of contextual information that should be easily provided by the 
clinician:  the  source  port,  the  balloon  status,  the  patient’s  respiratory  status  and 
level of sedation, and ventilator settings (as applicable).  There  is no reason why the 
clinician would not have this information. 
 
When  the  context  is  fairly  stable,  it  need  not  be  re-entered  for  every  interpretation.  
For example, when not actively being used,  the pulmonary artery catheter  tip (distal 
port)  is  left  in  the  pulmonary  artery  with  the  balloon  down.    The  proximal  port  is  in 
the right atrium (or central vein).  If the patient’s respiratory status, level of sedation, 
and  ventilator  settings  are  also  stable,  then  the  PAC  waveform  interpreter  can  use 
these  stable  context  attributes  to  monitor  proximal  and  distal  port  waveforms  and 
set off an alarm if it detects any dangerous situations. 
 
The second type of necessary data is an interpretation of the accompanying EKG, but 
good EKG interpreters already exist. 
 
The third type of necessary data  is the result of pre-processing of the PAC waveform 
itself  into higher  level  elements.    In  this  study, we pre-processed  the waveform  into 
elements  that  could  be  easily  and  unambiguously  obtained  manually.    We  did  this 
because developing a more sophisticated waveform processor was beyond  the scope 
of this project. 
 
However,  more  complex  elements  of  the  PAC  waveform  could  serve  as  better 
attributes.    For  example,  we  could  calculate  such  things  as  the  mean  pressure,  the 
means  of  the  peaks  and  the  troughs  from  heartbeat  to  heartbeat,  the  standard 
deviations  of  the  mean/peak/trough,  the  first  time  derivative,  the  second  time 
derivative, and the Fourier transform.  We could also standardize the dimensions of a 
PAC waveform segment between heartbeats and try to match its shape to the shapes 
of  classified  segments.    This  latter  task  of  pattern  matching  would  be  analogous  to 
handwriting recognition. 
 
In any case, any automated waveform pre-processor would be useful, even if it were 
restricted  to  the  primitive  elements  defined  in  this  study.    Manual  waveform  pre-
processing was  the most  time-consuming  part  of  the  data  acquisition  for  this  study.  
Automated  waveform  pre-processing  of  a  large  number  of  different  types  of 
waveforms  and  patient  situations,  along  with  the  corresponding  context  and  expert

classification would  result  in a  larger  training set  that would  improve  the accuracy of 
computerized PAC waveform interpretation. 
 
As  studies  have  shown,  physicians  and  nurses  have  difficulty  recognizing  a  PAOP 
waveform  even  on  a  clear  tracing.4  8  9    Computer  assistance  need  not  be  perfect  to 
still be useful in improving PAC waveform interpretation. 
 
Finally,  waveform  recognition  is  only  the  beginning  of  PAC  waveform  interpretation.  
The  rest consists of pressure measurement, and  it  is non-trivial  to  teach a computer 
from  which  portion  of  a  waveform  to  measure  the  desired  pressure,  even  when  the 
computer recognizes what the waveform is.
