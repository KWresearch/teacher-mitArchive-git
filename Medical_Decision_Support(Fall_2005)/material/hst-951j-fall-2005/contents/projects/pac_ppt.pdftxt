The Pulmonary Artery Catheter (PAC)

(cid:132) The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has 
been used for decades in the diagnosis and 
treatment of critical care patients.
(cid:132) The PAC is an invasive device used to 
measure the following:
(cid:137) cardiovascular pressures
(cid:137) cardiac output
(cid:137) mixed venous oxygen saturation

Significance of the PAC

(cid:132) Use of the PAC is considered routine in most 
critical care areas.
(cid:137) Estimated sales in the U.S. is 1 to 2 million per 
year.
(cid:132) Data derived from the PAC alters the course 
of therapy in about half of all insertions.
(cid:137) Pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), for 
instance, is used to decide whether to give or 
remove fluid volume from the patient.

The Problem

(cid:132) Despite its long history of use, the PAC has never 
been shown to be beneficial in terms of outcomes.
(cid:132) One possible explanation for this is the lack of 
knowledge among physicians and nurses in its use. 
(cid:137) Iberti et al. (1990): 47% of 496 North American physicians 
did not correctly identify PAOP from a PAC trace.
(cid:137) Gnaegi et al. (1997): 50% of 535 European physicians did 
not correctly identify PAOP from a PAC trace.
(cid:137) Burns et al. (1996): 39% of 168 critical care nurses in 
California did not correctly identify PAOP from a PAC trace.

Computerized Waveform Interpretation

(cid:132) Whereas computerized electrocardiogram 
(EKG) waveform interpretation has been 
available for decades, there is no equivalent 
software for PAC waveforms.
(cid:132) Unlike in the case of the EKG, where almost 
all the necessary information is in the 
waveform itself, the interpretation of PAC 
waveforms is highly context-dependent.

PAC Waveform Context

(cid:132) To properly interpret a PAC waveform, the 
following context information is required:
(cid:137) Source of the waveform (distal vs. proximal port)
(cid:137) Balloon status (deflated vs. inflated)
(cid:137) Accompanying EKG
(cid:137) Respiratory status (spontaneous respiration, 
positive pressure ventilation, or both)
(cid:137) Ventilator settings (if applicable)

PAC Waveform Elements

(cid:132) Pre-processing analog PAC waveforms is a 
challenge, but suppose that such software already 
exists and can return to us the following basic PAC 
waveform elements:
(cid:137) Highest peak (HP) pressure
(cid:137) Lowest trough (LT) pressure
(cid:137) Difference between HP and LT
(cid:137) Midpoint between HP and LT
(cid:137) EKG rhythm (regular vs. irregular)
(cid:137) EKG location of peaks
(cid:137) Range of peaks
(cid:137) Range of troughs

Classes of Interest

(cid:132) Dangerous vs. safe
(cid:137) Catheter tip (distal port) irritation of the right ventricle can
cause a deadly arrhythmia.
(cid:137) Overwedge of an inflated balloon in a pulmonary artery 
may cause pulmonary infarction.
(cid:132) Problem vs. no problem
(cid:137) All dangerous situations are problems.
(cid:137) System errors (such as underdamping, overdamping, 
inappropriate transducer level) are not immediately 
dangerous, but can contribute to improper treatment 
decisions.
(cid:132) Source location (CVP, RV, PA, PAOP, Overwedge)
(cid:132) System artifacts vs. abnormal physiology vs. normal 

Data Set

(cid:132) The data set includes 66 waveforms, each described by context, 
pre-processed waveform elements, and classification by experts.
(cid:137) Danger: 5 dangerous, 61 safe
(cid:137) Problem: 14 problems, 52 non-problems
(cid:137) Location: 18 CVP, 3 RV, 21 PA, 22 PAOP, 2 Overwedge
(cid:137) Predominant Feature:
(cid:132) 15 normal
(cid:132) 9 arrhythmias
(cid:132) 13 large waves
(cid:132) 14 respiratory variation
(cid:132) 11 frequency response artifacts
(cid:132) 1 improperly leveled transducer
(cid:132) 1 unspecified system artifact
(cid:132) 2 overwedge

Attribute Selection in Weka

(cid:132) For each type of classification, use Ranker on 
the full data set to determine information 
value of each attribute.
(cid:132) Discard attributes of zero information value.
(cid:137) Danger: discard peak variation, trough variation
(cid:137) Problem: discard lowest trough, trough variation
(cid:137) Location: discard peak variation, trough variation
(cid:137) Feature: discard lowest trough, HP-LT difference

Top Ranked Attributes

(cid:132) Danger

(cid:137) Lowest trough (0.12)
(cid:137) HP-LT midpoint (0.12)
(cid:132) Problem
(cid:137) HP-LT difference (0.42)
(cid:137) Highest Peak (0.42)
(cid:137) HP-LT midpoint (0.35)
(cid:132) Location
(cid:137) HP-LT midpoint (0.90)
(cid:137) Balloon status (0.87)
(cid:137) Highest peak (0.85)
(cid:132) Feature
(cid:137) Trough variation (0.69)
(cid:137) Peak variation (0.65)
(cid:137) Peak location (0.65)

Classification Strategy

(cid:132) Use 3-fold cross-validation for such a small 
sample size, so that the training and test sets 
are both of acceptable size.
(cid:132) Compare classification with 1-nearest 
neighbor, decision tree, na√Øve Bayes, and 
neural network (multilayer perceptron).
