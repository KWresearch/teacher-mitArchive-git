***** Course Description *****
This course presents the main concepts of decision analysis, artificial
intelligence, and predictive model construction and evaluation in the specific
context of medical applications. The advantages and disadvantages of using
these methods in real-world systemsÂ are emphasized, while students gain hands-
on experience with application specific methods. The technical focus of the
course includes decision analysis, knowledge-based systems (qualitative and
quantitative), learning systems (including logistic regression, classification
trees, neural networks), and techniques to evaluate the performance of such
systems.
