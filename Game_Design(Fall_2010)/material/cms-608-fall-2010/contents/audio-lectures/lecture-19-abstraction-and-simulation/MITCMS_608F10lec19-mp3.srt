14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,594
TA: A bunch of puzzles.

15
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:37,954
AUDIENCE: The first one's easy,
and then everything

16
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,270
after that is such a scam.

17
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,820
TA: Is it like a series,
or is it just one book?

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,056
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

19
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,790
I found it.

20
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,870
[LAUGHTER]

21
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,736
Everyone's looking at him and
they're like, you can do a

23
00:00:56,736 --> 00:00:59,116
practice leg in a one-person
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

24
00:00:59,116 --> 00:01:02,620
We'll just give you any puzzle
that gets progressively more

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,870
impossible.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,230

27
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:09,110
TA: Actually, I want to throw
out one suggestion.

28
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,400
If anybody's having trouble
thinking about what to put up

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
for a program post, and you
haven't been able to keep up

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,780
with your program posts, one
thing that you might want to

31
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,375
attempt is just a quick
postmortem on

32
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,200
the previous project.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,012
What went right, what you would
rather have gone right,

34
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:30,770
what went wrong, and just a
couple of other points.

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,250
Just sort of a reflection, just
thinking about what you

36
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,280
might want to try to change or
what you want to make sure

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,280
that you keep doing for
the next project.

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,080
That's just a good idea.

39
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,580
So if you could do
that next week.

40
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,717
It will be done today, so after
this week's program

41
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,945
post, you might want to try
to do the exercise.

42
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,410

43
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,205
PROFESSOR: So today, well first
of all I want to say if

44
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,414
you can't see the screen, you
might want to position

45
00:02:04,414 --> 00:02:07,114
yourself so that you can,
because most of everything is

46
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,070
going to be up here for today.

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,780
So I don't know if, for those
of you who have taken or are

48
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,206
taking video game studies, how
much you're going into this.

49
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,940
But some of today's talk is
definitely going to be more on

50
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,850
the video games studies
theoretical side.

51
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,810
And we're not actually requiring
you to implement

52
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,530
this stuff, so a lot what we are
going to be talking about

53
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:33,830
today is rhetoric and meaning
and how that relates to

54
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:35,750
simulation.

55
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,985
If you're not conscious of this,
or you don't put this in

56
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,020
your game, that's fine.

57
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,310
This is just something that I
think is really interesting,

58
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,960
and I hope you guys
will as well.

59
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,970

60
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,570
So, first of all, I want to
talk about what simulation

61
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:54,880
means, and it would help if
I did this correctly.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,628

63
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,114
There we go.

64
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:06,560
OK.

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,360
So, Gonzalo Frasca says, to
simulate is to model a source

66
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,370
system or different system which
maintains for someone

67
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,280
some of the behaviors of
the original system.

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,970
And so to me, this definition
is really important for a

69
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,900
couple of reasons.

70
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,150
First of all, he puts source
in parentheses.

71
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,715
For him and in his writing, he
doesn't necessarily think you

72
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:31,549
need one, which is a whole other
argument all together.

73
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:33,691
I want to point out that all of
this will assume that there

74
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:37,430
is a star system and that the
design is consciousness.

75
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,648
That's part of the board game
assignment, to make a game

76
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,640
based on a real world system.

77
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,960
But this technician has
a lot of space in it.

78
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,381
It maintains for somebody
some of the behaviors.

79
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:54,160
It's intentionally very loose.

80
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,430
And this'll come into to play
shortly, because a big part we

81
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,560
are going to talk about today
is the relationship with

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,560
subjectivity and simulation,
which I hope you guys saw a

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,140
little bit of in the
reading for today.

84
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,920

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,805
So to give a more rigorous
definition, this is a model

86
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:18,410
taken from an extremely dry
textbook called Theory of

87
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,260
Modeling and Simulation.

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,915
Zeigler and all have
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] of what it

89
00:04:22,915 --> 00:04:24,350
offers, and basically
they present a

90
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,960
simulation that's like this.

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,820
So the idea is, you have a star
system that exists within

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,460
the experimental frame.

93
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,160
This frame refers to, these are
the conditions under which

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,250
we are interested in
the star system.

95
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:38,580
Right?

96
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,720
So if you want to make a game,
say about life at MIT, there's

97
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,335
some things you are going to
include, some things you're

98
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,250
going to exclude, right?

99
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,184
You probably don't care about
the effect of the moon's

100
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:51,420
gravity on the campus,
for example.

101
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,280
And so then there's the
modelling relation.

102
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,365
So we observed the star system
under certain conditions, and

103
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:59,955
then we focused on the elements
that are important to

104
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:02,630
us, and from that we construct
the model.

105
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,680
And you notice, here they
distinguish between a

106
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,850
simulator and a model, which is
not something that I think

107
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,540
we do necessarily.

108
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,500
Because we tend to think that
simulations are complex

109
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,560
technological software
entities.

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,430
So separating this indicates
that multiple

111
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,380
things can be a simulator.

112
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,330
For example, in terms
of games, you can

113
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,395
have a board game.

114
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:33,085
You can have a video game.

115
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:34,950
And these could be based on the
same model, or they could

116
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,510
be derived from the same system,
but the simulator

117
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,380
exactly can be a couple
of different things.

118
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,320
And so this is a sort
of technical way

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,840
of looking at it.

120
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,070
What I want to talk about
specifically is what I refer

121
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,870
to in my writing as
a simulation gap.

122
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,522
And this is another way of
looking at the elements in a

123
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,000
simulation.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,150
So, major components such as
star system, the simulation,

125
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,850
the user, and I have all of
these super intuitive arrows.

126
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,070
So we'll go through
them quickly.

127
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,210
So the arrow at A,
this is kind of

128
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,700
the abstraction process.

129
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,030
We are looking at a star system
we're considering,

130
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:15,620
presumably within some sort of
experimental frame that we

131
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,470
care about.

132
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,870
And then from that we derive
behaviors and rules for what

133
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,880
we want to implement into
the simulation.

134
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,320
So the arrow with B represents
the user.

135
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,240
So this might be me.

136
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,015
And this is me interacting
with the game.

137
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,190
This is me playing with it,
seeing how the simulation

138
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,050
works, watching it run.

139
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,860
But then, importantly, there's
also arrow C my recognition

140
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,120
that it's based on something.

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,776
If you can't tell that
simulation has a star system,

142
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,040
you're going to think of it very
differently than if you

143
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,520
know where that star
system is.

144
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,420
And so D, then, is the
proverbial simulation gap.

145
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,950
And this is the space in
between all of them.

146
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:04,120
And this is a model of how
users, in working with a

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,680
simulation, can create
a subjective

148
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,570
interpretation of it.

149
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,090
They assign values to it.

150
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,750
They look at are there value
judgments in the game.

151
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,355
They may consider various parts
of the game to have

152
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:18,080
certain meaning or express
certain ideas.

153
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,900
And this arises from
understanding the difference

154
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,020
between the star system
and the simulation.

155
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,820
I wasn't able to compress the
quote down into a slide, but

156
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,150
Ian Bogost said that the
simulation gap is kind of--

157
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,349
a user's interpretation of a
simulation converges-- all

158
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:39,120
right, let's see if I
can get this right.

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,805
It's horribly wordy
in the book.

160
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:44,120
But he's basically saying your
interpretation is based on

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,920
what the simulation includes as
much as what it excludes.

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,920
We look at these design
decisions as having meaning.

163
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,010

164
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,750
And so we saw this in
the star article.

165
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,220
I'm sorry, this picture
is lo-res,

166
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,180
but the game is lo-res.

167
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,220
I don't know if you
remember this.

168
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,600
There's this key point in the
article for today when

169
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,070
[? Star ?] is talking about
discussing SimCity 2000 with

170
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,400
his daughter.

171
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,800
And if you remember, he and his
daughter react differently

172
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,150
to the game's exclusion
of mixed-use field.

173
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,070
Actually, I probably
want to check.

174
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,480
Has anyone not played SimCity?

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,340
Any of the versions?

176
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,450
No experience?

177
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:30,980
OK.

178
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,070
So SimCity basically is a--

179
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,380
he's called it a software toy.

180
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,770
It's a simulation of a city.

181
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,630
That's the name.

182
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,230
And the idea is you start with
an empty space, and are trying

183
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,460
to build it up into
a burgeoning

184
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,230
metropolis, or whatever.

185
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,765
One of the defining features
of the games

186
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:47,630
is it's very open.

187
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,240
There's no real set goals.

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,190
And this is primarily
done through zoning.

189
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:55,940
And zoning is designating
land for specific uses.

190
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,520
So the main zones in the game,
and in actual urban planning

191
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,290
are residential, commercial,
and industrial.

192
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,130
So to mark a segment of land
as residential means, this

193
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,834
land is approved for building
housing, basically apartments,

194
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,670
houses, etc.

195
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,790
Commercial zones are things
like commerce, offices,

196
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,540
retailers, those kind of things,
whereas industry is

197
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,450
manufacturing, mostly.

198
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,940
And so in the game, you can
basically say this chunk of

199
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,340
land is for this use.

200
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,470
But in reality, it's usually
not that cut and dry.

201
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,110
And so mixed-use development is
a particular kind of zoning

202
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,345
where you're saying this land
can be used for multiple

203
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:35,470
things at the same time.

204
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,430
And you see this a lot,
actually, in Boston,

205
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:41,180
especially down Newbury Street,
Back Bay, where the

206
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,410
ground levels of these apartment
buildings are

207
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,030
restaurants or stores.

208
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,597
And then there's space
to let apartments

209
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:48,940
built right above them.

210
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,170
And that's not possible
in any SimCity.

211
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,130
And so to get back to the
article then, the author is

212
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,810
saying that he thinks the
simulation is prejudiced

213
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,800
against this kind.

214
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,623
It's against having this kind
of zoning because the game

215
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,920
just leaves it out.

216
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,740
Whereas his daughter
says, well this

217
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,530
is just how it works.

218
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,600
So for the two of them, they
both interpret this exclusion

219
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:12,950
differently.

220
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,120
The daughter thinks, well, OK,
this is just how the game is.

221
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,960
It's not important.

222
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,570
And again the author
says well this is

223
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,450
actually a political decision.

224
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,360
So if any of you are familiar
with the game, can you think

225
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,650
of other games that
are examples

226
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,680
of politics in SimCity?

227
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,405
It's written about a fair
amount, actually.

228
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:34,375
AUDIENCE: There's the energy
scope, where you can choose

229
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,345
between coal or nuclear
and whatnot.

230
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,325
I think when you do get to the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

231
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:44,503

232
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:44,996
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

233
00:10:44,996 --> 00:10:46,968
They had their own agendas,
certainly.

234
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:48,940
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
not only that.

235
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,884
I think it's cheaper to build a
hydroelectric plant than it

236
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:53,870
is to build a nuclear plant.

237
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,842
Because the material
cost of building it

238
00:10:55,842 --> 00:10:58,307
in SimCity is cheaper.

239
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,786
PROFESSOR: That's certainly
part of it.

240
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:02,744
Although it's interesting to
know that in the game, I think

241
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,702
part of that is that the hydro
plants don't generate as much,

242
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:07,181
so you need a lot of them.

243
00:11:07,181 --> 00:11:07,674
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

244
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,646
I haven't played
in a long time.

245
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:10,139
PROFESSOR: Yes.

246
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,140
I think they took the hydro
plants out in 2000.

247
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,360
AUDIENCE: Oftentimes it's
a lot of rules, anyways.

248
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,465
It was often to your interest to
build industrial zones near

249
00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:23,360
a border of your city, so
that your city wouldn't

250
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,340
be polluted as much.

251
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,649
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

252
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,102
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

253
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,890
And it's a result of the
pollution model.

254
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,150
The industrial zones pollute in
a circle, so if you pollute

255
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,862
on the edge of the map, half
that circle is non-existent.

256
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,190
But there's a question.

257
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,200
Is the simulation arguing that
you should send your pollution

258
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,640
to other cities, or is it just
a result of how it works?

259
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,996

260
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:49,480
Jason?

261
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,715
AUDIENCE: The decision on how
to follow things like how

262
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:54,590
taxes affect group
rates, and how

263
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,160
different sections interact.

264
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,230
All those types of things
definitely have models from

265
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,830
what they come from, which have
certain slightly bigger

266
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,080
political slants to them.

267
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,248

268
00:12:09,248 --> 00:12:10,706
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering.

269
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:13,136
I think the difference in how
the father and the daughter

270
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:16,052
viewed the system is that
the father already had a

271
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:18,160
preconception of what the
city should be like.

272
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,075
But the kid wouldn't necessarily
know because they

273
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,450
haven't been exposed
to all of this.

274
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,250
So to them, it's like oh, OK,
this is how it works.

275
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,894
But the father knows that there
are other things in the

276
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,680
model system as opposed
to the simulation.

277
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,090
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

278
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:35,078
And that's, again, emphasizing
the fact that the user has

279
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,569
their own subjectivity.

280
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,551
Different people are going to
assign different values to

281
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,545
these things.

282
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:44,024
AUDIENCE: Mass transit in
SimCity is universally

283
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:46,509
considered to be a part of the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

284
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:56,946

285
00:12:56,946 --> 00:12:58,934
AUDIENCE: In some games they'll
complain about the

286
00:12:58,934 --> 00:13:01,419
lack of roads, but they don't
do anything about it.

287
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,904
They keep moving in.

288
00:13:03,904 --> 00:13:05,892
AUDIENCE: How are
they moving in?

289
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:12,880

290
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,160
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

291
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,860
And actually, in the
first one, you

292
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,430
could just have trains.

293
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,390
You could just have rail lines,
and there weren't even

294
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,065
train stations.

295
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,110
Everything was built up
against the tracks.

296
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,692
Which in reality, I've
lived next to the

297
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:25,614
commuter rail lines.

298
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:27,915
It's not pleasant.

299
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:30,802
AUDIENCE: In come cities, a
significant portion of the

300
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:34,310
population does make do with
only public transport, and you

301
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,702
can get a taxi.

302
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:41,180

303
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,200
PROFESSOR: Just one
final point.

304
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,510
It's a very small detail, but
a lot of the games will let

305
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,090
you declare your city a
nuclear-free zone, which just

306
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,590
basically means you can't build
a nuclear power plant.

307
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,550
But that stimulates growth.

308
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,490
People want to move there more
because there's no nuclear

309
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,970
power plants.

310
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,260
So I want to go through a few
more really short examples.

311
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,830
Civilization Revolution is
more like a stripped down

312
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,210
Civilization.

313
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,550
Is anyone familiar with
this version?

314
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,210
Now, specifically are you
familiar with the DS version?

315
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,680
That's the only one I've played
that's actually based

316
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,122
in [INAUDIBLE].

317
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:20,700
AUDIENCE: It's on iPhone, too.

318
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,460
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, it's
probably the same

319
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,080
thing on the iPhone.

320
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,940
So I've noticed, having played
this game a lot, in the game,

321
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,290
they have all these different
civilizations, and all

322
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,685
represented by a
famous leader.

323
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:34,315
So the Indians are lead by
Gandhi for however many

324
00:14:34,315 --> 00:14:36,303
thousands of years
the game goes on.

325
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:40,110
And I've noticed that Gandhi
is incredibly aggressive.

326
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,371
Almost to the point where he
declares war on someone.

327
00:14:43,371 --> 00:14:45,319
He will stay at war
the whole time.

328
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,780
I usually end up back
again, honestly.

329
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,200

330
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,410
And you can try to make peace,
and they'll never do it.

331
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,780
They'll say, oh yeah,
we'll be friends.

332
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,730
And then three turns later,
they're declaring war.

333
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,410
But on the other hand, Alexander
the Great, who

334
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,750
conquered much of Greece and
Macedonia, and was very

335
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,880
expansionist, is a
total pacifist.

336
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,800
He'll never fight you.

337
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,850
He never wants to declare war.

338
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,200
And not only that, but
he never expands.

339
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,005
They almost always just have
their one city, and they never

340
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,038
try to grow and spread,
which is totally not

341
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:17,440
what the Greeks did.

342
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,612
So there's this question here.

343
00:15:18,612 --> 00:15:22,260
Is this the result, then, of
bias in the simulation?

344
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,214
Do the designers just think,
is it bad history?

345
00:15:27,214 --> 00:15:29,470
AUDIENCE: I think that's
backwards.

346
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,752
Wrong pointer.

347
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:33,110
AUDIENCE: That might be it,
because in, for example,

348
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,560
Civilization 4, and I think 5,

where if you're being India,
your player can be Gandhian.

350
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,810
He's pacifistic in that.

351
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,740
And I'm pretty sure Alexander
the Great is probably also

352
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,190
expansionist.

353
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,900

that in this version.

354
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,854
PROFESSOR: Maybe
they messed up.

355
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:57,060
AUDIENCE: Gandhi, in number 5,
is still really aggressive.

356

thought it was funny.

AUDIENCE: Maybe they
like irony.

358
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,170
PROFESSOR: I actually have
my own theory on this.

359
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,880
Part of the game is your
civilization has a certain

360
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,526
government, and governments
get different benefits.

361
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:12,910
Actually, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

362
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,730
benefit in this game.

363
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,220
Indians start with
fundamentalism, which gives

364
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,240
you a bonus to attack.

365
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,740
Whereas the Greeks start with
a democracy, and then a

366
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,120
democracy that people won't
declare war in.

367
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
So there's this kind of weird,
and my theory is that Indians

368
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,960
always attack you because they
always have an attack bonus.

369
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,180
And the Greeks never attack you

370
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,420
because they're a democracy.

371
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,090
As we know, democracies aren't
necessarily pacifistic.

372
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,880
And again this is my
thinking on it.

373
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,694
This understanding the rules of
the system, and then I kind

374
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,340
of infer this AI behavior
based on that.

375
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,380
But again, this is
my position.

376
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,305
It's easy to find people
complaining about historical

377
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,760
inaccuracies in Civilization.

378
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,190
There's always this question.

379
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,740
Is it part of the system?

380
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,880
Is the system just behaving in
a certain way because of

381
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,810
certain properties?

382
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,170
Is there another intent there?

383
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,940
We can infer all these different
meanings from what

384
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,260
the simulation includes
and what it excludes.

385
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,619

not played September 12?

00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,910

lot of criticism.

460
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,620
So this is actually Gonzalo
Frasca's game, if you still

461
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,800
remember the quote from
the beginning.

462
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,940
Notable designer Greg
Costikyan has really

463
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,670
criticized this, saying
this is really harsh.

464
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,090
How can you call this
a simulation.

465
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,010
This is so insensitive.

466
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,115
And you notice that this game
leaves out a lot of the

467
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:11,380
aspects of terrorism and how
peaceful interactions work.

468
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:16,030
You don't see 9/11
happening here.

469
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:19,030
It really simplifies the
act of what makes

470
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,565
someone become a terrorist.

471
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:24,962
You don't have all of the other
pressures in the region,

472
00:21:24,962 --> 00:21:26,826
all of the other countries'
influences.

473
00:21:26,826 --> 00:21:30,100
It's very stripped down.

474
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,570
And I think Frasca talked about
part of the point here

475
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,630
is that it's ignoring so much.

476
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,600
Because that seems to be
the way that the US

477
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,140
government has responded.

478
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,200
It's like this happened, and now
we're just going to start

479
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,710
bombing them.

480
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,760
And so this is a really great
example of how what has been

481
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,600
stripped out and what's been
left in really creates a

482
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,295
strong statement.

483
00:21:51,295 --> 00:21:55,110
And you can interpret it in
a lot of different ways.

484
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,760
I personally think that what
he's going for is this idea

485
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,922
that the rhetoric surrounding
the War on Terror and the

486
00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:05,550
political actions are ignoring
a lot of factors, including

487
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,080
our own role in the
region of attack.

488
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,020
But anyways, I don't mean to
turn this into a subplot.

observations or anything

across, and you

of that game a lot.

691
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,074
PROFESSOR: So there's a couple
things that I want to say

692
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:07,050
about this game.

693
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,690
First of all, if you remember
[? Prospect's ?]

694
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,425
definition of a simulation,
it's talking about

695
00:33:10,425 --> 00:33:12,990
the space in it.

696
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,000
And I would consider
this a simulation.

697
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,300
This is based on a
source system.

698
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,764
But it's not the kind of number
crunching CS thing that

699
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:24,732
we associate with the word.

700
00:33:24,732 --> 00:33:27,880
For me, personally, I worked
a pretty horrible dead-end

701
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,910
cubicle job for about 18 months,
before I came in here.

702
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,980
For me, this game really
resonates, because it really

703
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,280
closely matches the
experience.

704
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,840
You're just doing the same thing
every day, and any sort

705
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,900
of deviation from the
norm stands out.

706
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,990
But in terms of exclusion
inclusion, one of the

707
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,660
interesting things about this
game, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

708
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,090
makes its point.

709
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,660
There is nothing else.

710
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,320
It's all a workday.

711
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,860
There is no weekend.

712
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,950
There's no I got home and
there's something different.

713
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,790
And that's the limited
agency in the game.

714
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:11,200
By that I mean it can be easy to
forget about, especially in

715
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,639
a place like MIT, but a lot of
people I know end up in these

716
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,577
very dead-end jobs.

717
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:19,094
This is a huge part of
any major economy.

718
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,046
There are people who
just go to their

719
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:22,860
cubicle day after day.

720
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,710
When I was at that crap job, I
knew people who had been there

721
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,980
for 40 years.

722
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,260
AUDIENCE: What kind
of job was it?

723
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,024
PROFESSOR: It was for
a mutual fund

724
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:31,920
subsidiary at Bank of America.

725
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,764
Back in the financial
district.

726
00:34:34,764 --> 00:34:37,100
I'm not sure if it would have
been better for me to stay,

727
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,588
given the whole, you know, we
tanked the economy but we

728
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:42,580
awarded ourselves billions
of dollars.

729
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,570
Maybe I should have
stuck around.

730
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,379
PROFESSOR: So it was a well-paid
type of job.

731
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,801
I mean, in this climate, it
might have become well-paid.

732
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:56,370
But it wasn't at the time.

733
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,444
It was actually, a lot of what
I did was trade corrections.

734
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:01,834
This is kind of a tangent,
but it drives me bonkers.

735
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:04,343
Financial representatives and
advisers make an obscene

736
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,150
amount of money, yet most of
them don't know the difference

737
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:09,320
between dollars and
shares in stock.

738
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,240
And most of my job is correcting
that for them.

739
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,220
It's unbelievable.

740
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,690
And it's no surprise to
me that the thing

741
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,290
is all fucked up.

742
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,330
Anyway, so any other reactions
to this game or

743
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,978
thoughts about this game?

744
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:25,880
AUDIENCE: The color
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

745
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,220
PROFESSOR: What do
you mean color?

746
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,470
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

747
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:35,940

748
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,046
PROFESSOR: There's also nothing
meaningful on the

749
00:35:37,046 --> 00:35:38,296
screen, right?

750
00:35:38,296 --> 00:35:41,100

751
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,980
AUDIENCE: There was some kind
of static noise, right?

752
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,390
But you turned it off?

753
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,790
PROFESSOR: I think so.

754
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,260
I forgot to close the September
12 window, so there

755
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,510
was some noise from that.

756
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,140

757
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,080
AUDIENCE: The use of color, just
in general, was really

758
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,540
interesting.

759
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,040
In particular, the only thing at
your work that is colorful

760
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,800
is the plumbing stock sign, the
exit sign which tells you

761
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,050
where to go kill yourself.

762
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,710

763
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,960
The leap is colorful.

764
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,500

765
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,700
AUDIENCE: I think the cows.

766
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,950
And the hobos.

767
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,320

768
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,310
I think it's interesting.

769
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,280
It's kind of from the heritage
of the game Another World.

770
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,848
Because sort of an early
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] look at what

771
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,820
it would be like to be
a human transplant

772
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,299
onto another planet.

773
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:37,503
You know [UNINTELLIGIBLE] that,
in the beginning your

774
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:38,489
character is extremely
vulnerable

775
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:39,722
and slow and clumsy.

776
00:36:39,722 --> 00:36:42,680
And it uses the same control
schemes on the same

777
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,131
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] channel
endings.

778
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:50,075
And by the same token, you're
playing an ordinary person.

779
00:36:50,075 --> 00:36:51,554
It's not the boss.

780
00:36:51,554 --> 00:36:52,540
Not this person coming in.

781
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,512
And you don't go into a

782
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,991
postal-style power trip, either.

783
00:36:55,991 --> 00:37:01,470

784
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,682
PROFESSOR: And so, I just wanted
to say, I actually

785
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:08,350
haven't seen the talk, but
apparently, someone has argued

786
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,800
that this game is just
a critique of

787
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,568
the art game movement.

788
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:13,470
Right, that it's making
fun of the whole

789
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,750
pretentiousness of that.

790
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,220
I don't really see that, but
again, it's subjectivity.

791
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,180
Like where does this
actually go.

792
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,140
AUDIENCE: Well, what do the
creators say to that?

793
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,570

794
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,366
AUDIENCE: You'll find that
really creative people like

795
00:37:27,366 --> 00:37:29,490
that never want to
talk about it.

796
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,630
AUDIENCE: I thought there
was an artist

797
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,630
statement on the website.

798
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,626
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

799
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,123
PROFESSOR: I thought
there was an artist

800
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:36,620
statement for this somewhere.

801
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,119
PROFESSOR: There could be.

802
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,030
I honestly haven't
looked it up.

803
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,700
OK, so moving on.

804
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,070
So anyway, good theory.

805
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,865
If you have a theory about how
things work, the best way to

806
00:37:49,865 --> 00:37:53,150
test it is to figure out what's
a horrible example.

807
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,100
So we've been talking about
simulations and subjectivity,

808
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,018
and saying, OK, how does this
model explain the way meaning

809
00:37:59,018 --> 00:38:03,760
gets invented in a game and
Mario is a really good example

810
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,090
to throw with that.

811
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,754

812
00:38:07,754 --> 00:38:09,600
So what are some things that
are abstracted into the

813
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,010
simulation?

814
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,090
Like what's here?

815
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,350
What's not?

816
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,010
AUDIENCE: It's physics.

817
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,400
You can jump to the moon.

818
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,250
AUDIENCE: You can
move in mid-air.

819
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,629
You can slam against extremely
hard things and break them.

820
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,625
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
things and kill them.

821
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:27,120
Technically [INAUDIBLE].

822
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,730
AUDIENCE: You can punch hard
things and breaking them.

823
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,620
PROFESSOR: You can get bigger.

824
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,490
You can shoot fire
out of your hand.

825
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,646
AUDIENCE: Still, the plumbers
don't seem to

826
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:39,074
really do any work.

827
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:42,567
They do get out of fights and
clean up coins here and there,

828
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:47,560
so that technically
counts as points.

829
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,450
AUDIENCE: Why is it

830
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,935
significant that he's a plumber?

831
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:52,410
Is it so he can clean pipes?

832
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:55,880
AUDIENCE:He was the one
who [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

833
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,780
PROFESSOR: And this
is the point.

834
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,340
He's an Italian, and
he's the plumber.

835
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,710
So if you focus on him,
what can we say

836
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,350
this game is arguing?

837
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,770
That Italian plumbers
have hard heads?

838
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,810
He doesn't even eat.

839
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,200
Do they not need to eat?

840
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,630
How do you--?

841
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,230
AUDIENCE: He eats mushrooms.

842
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,680
PROFESSOR: So to me, Mario is
a really interesting example

843
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,740
because we think of
it as a simulation

844
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,110
because it has physics.

845
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,323
When it came out, it had the
most advanced jumping physics

846
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:23,573
ever designed.

847
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,400

848
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,650
It's interesting.

849
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,660

850
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,460
So there's a couple
of things here.

851
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,650
There's so many of the
fantastical elements.

852
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,560
Like walking mushrooms-

853
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,070
AUDIENCE: He can jump
like five times.

854
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,120
PROFESSOR: -and flying
turtles and stuff.

855
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,280
Yeah.

856
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,740
Just the way that he jumps.

857
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,880
You also notice that unlike the
other games, it's hard to

858
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,820
find anything political
in Mario.

859
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,610
You could say he's
hoarding money.

860
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:49,550
Maybe he's a capitalist.

861
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,780
AUDIENCE: There's this
whole long essay

862
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,730
about how he's a communist.

863
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,796
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

864
00:39:54,796 --> 00:39:56,700
Could you post that
on the forum?

865
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,960
AUDIENCE: I will.

866
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,420
PROFESSOR: One thing again,
just [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to

867
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,240
notice is it's gender
politics.

868
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,490
So the only female
is the princess.

869
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,426
And what does she do?

870
00:40:07,426 --> 00:40:08,362
She sits and waits.

871
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,180
She has no agency, and it's
all about the masculine.

872
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,875
So you can have a feminist
reading.

873
00:40:12,875 --> 00:40:16,930

874
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,180
AUDIENCE: Is Bowser masculine?

875
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,357

876
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:22,740
PROFESSOR: That's an interesting
question.

877
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,130
Because it's also how much do
you bring in other elements?

878
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,412
Do you think about the cartoon
when you think about this?

879
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:29,864
Do you think about
the other games?

880
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:33,252
Do you just look at Mario
as an isolated event?

881
00:40:33,252 --> 00:40:34,704
AUDIENCE: Peach kicks
ass, man.

882
00:40:34,704 --> 00:40:36,640
AUDIENCE: That's true.

883
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

884
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,010

885
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,952
AUDIENCE: Well there's
the Super

886
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,200
Princess Peach, actually.

887
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,450
But her [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

888
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:52,950

889
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,411
AUDIENCE: She gets very upset.

890
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,661
She cries.

891
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,820

892
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,070
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

893
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:02,700

894
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
competitive development.

895
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:08,248
I think there's something you
said about the idea that

896
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:10,810
snappers-- is that
a Braunembaun?

897
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,420
AUDIENCE: It's Powell.

898
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,326
AUDIENCE: Powell and

899
00:41:12,326 --> 00:41:13,960
Braunembaun are working together.

900
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,150
Then [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

901
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:22,190
but has Nintendo ever made
a proper Peach game?

902
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,515
I don't think so.

903
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,425
PROFESSOR: Especially in the
American Super Mario II, when

904
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:28,480
you can control Peach.

905
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,050
And she is popular because
she floats.

906
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:37,230
So I mean again, this is
to say that this theory

907
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,550
emphasizes subjectivity.

908
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,410
There's just no lacking here
that we would find meaningful

909
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,518
or that we would actually
pick apart.

910
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:48,530
With that said, I certainly
think it works, especially

911
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,880
with more political
games, games that

912
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,750
have more of a message.

913
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:54,610
And again, this is all
stuff to think about.

914
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,538
It's not something we're
necessarily looking for.

915
00:41:57,538 --> 00:42:00,470
So anything else with
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in there?

916
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,495
AUDIENCE: There's one probable
reason why Mario's club--

917
00:42:03,495 --> 00:42:07,083
actually the original pre-Super
Mario Brothers where

918
00:42:07,083 --> 00:42:10,425
basically there is one screen,
and all this bad stuff is

919
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:11,910
coming out of pipes.

920
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,880

921
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,345
And the idea is that you are
trying to clear all the pipes

922
00:42:18,345 --> 00:42:20,820
of all the bad stuff.

923
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,790
AUDIENCE: I never got
that from it.

924
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,290
AUDIENCE: The pipes are there.

925
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,876
AUDIENCE: I guess in that case
what you are asking what do I

926
00:42:29,876 --> 00:42:30,681
bring from outside.

927
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:34,062
And I recall the typing from
that being a big point of what

928
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:35,312
[INAUDIBLE].

929
00:42:35,312 --> 00:42:39,860

930
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,590
PROFESSOR: So it's like a
Donkey Kong, Mario was

931
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,823
actually originally
a carpenter.

932
00:42:42,823 --> 00:42:46,070
And they retroactively changed
him into a plumber because

933
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,990
Mario Brothers, the original,
was about plumbing.

934
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:53,067
But they wanted to keep the
character the same.

935
00:42:53,067 --> 00:42:55,869
AUDIENCE: Mario's
in Donkey Kong?

936
00:42:55,869 --> 00:42:57,119
AUDIENCE: Yes.

937
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,340

938
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,440
PROFESSOR: They retroactively
changed his name and his

939
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,690
profession.

940
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,864

941
00:43:07,864 --> 00:43:09,840
AUDIENCE: --Donkey Kong

943
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:14,286
PROFESSOR: So that's
the example.

944
00:43:14,286 --> 00:43:17,270

945
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,144
Anyone not played this one?

946
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:20,394
You want to give it a shot?

947
00:43:20,394 --> 00:43:26,554

948
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:27,048
AUDIENCE: Surprise.

949
00:43:27,048 --> 00:43:28,530
You have to play this
game again.

950

951
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:34,770
PROFESSOR: Do you want
to shoot, Jeremy?

952
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,630
AUDIENCE: I was actually just
thinking of their Cooking Mama

953
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,276
simulation that started this.

been captured by evil Ronald

her a part of his Unhappy

who are tortured for

bar to jump.

To beat enemies, jumping
on their heads.

00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:12,718
You can also hit the down arrow
to do the proverbial

00:44:12,718 --> 00:44:13,968
heads thing.

PROFESSOR: Did you know
McDonald's is one of the

987
00:45:10,545 --> 00:45:11,990
biggest sellers of
chicken flesh?

988
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:13,692
And they use an outdated method
of slaughter that leads

989
00:45:13,692 --> 00:45:16,510
to extreme suffering
for birds.

990
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,040

00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,290

00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,014
It's not obvious at all
that it's from PETA.

PROFESSOR: You think
it's from PETA?

995
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

that, spinach?

00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:13,995
AUDIENCE: I like growth
hormones as

1008
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:15,245
the reason for that.

1009
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:28,520

1012
00:46:33,556 --> 00:46:35,548
I don't know if this
goes against one of

1013
00:46:35,548 --> 00:46:37,540
PETA's earlier ads.

1014
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,235
It was a sticker that had a
chick that looked like that

1015
00:46:40,235 --> 00:46:42,592
and it said I'm not a nugget.

1016

This character's
name is Nugget.

PROFESSOR: There's also
a KFC version of this.

1018
00:46:47,635 --> 00:46:48,970
But I think this one has more.

1026
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,590

1034
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,610
So this game is really different
than the other games

1035
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:38,912
we've looked at.

1036
00:47:38,912 --> 00:47:41,690
Does anyone have a sense
of that as well?

1037
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,985
AUDIENCE: Slightly political.

1038
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:46,780
AUDIENCE: Not subtle.

1039
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,250
AUDIENCE: For the most part
it's just a re-skinning.

1040
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:54,270
And so we were discussing this
in our other class, about Ian

1041
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,880
Bogost's perspective games.

1042
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,770
We looked at, what was it
called, it was Space Invaders.

1043
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:03,920
PROFESSOR: Tax Invaders?

1044
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,960
AUDIENCE: No.

1045
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,420
It was a McCain ad.

1046
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,220
And it was about corporal
spending.

1047
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:08,625
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

1048
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:09,770
I know of that one.

1049
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,030
AUDIENCE: [? CorpWars, ?]

1050
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,690
I think it was called.

1051
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:15,780
It's just a re-skinning, and
so they are using the same

1052
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:21,280
metaphors to just get people
to play it, and it's not

1053
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,915
really improving their point or
it's not doing anything for

1054
00:48:25,915 --> 00:48:26,750
their cause.

1055
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:29,140
AUDIENCE: The simulation of this
game seems to not really

1056
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,060
apply to their point at all.

1057
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:33,672
You're really just playing
Mario, and it

1058
00:48:33,672 --> 00:48:34,470
happens to look different.

1059
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:38,200
As opposed to September 12,
evolve where the actual

1060
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,551
simulation itself had meaning
with what they

1061
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:43,988
were trying to say.

1062

AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1063
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:47,882
The mechanics are having to do
with the political point, or

1064
00:48:47,882 --> 00:48:49,370
the narrative.

1065
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:55,390
AUDIENCE: This is a secondary
critique of Mario.

1066
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1067
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,160
What was up with that?

1068
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,680
AUDIENCE: I don't even know,
what were they trying to say

1069
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,736
about Mario?

1070
00:49:02,736 --> 00:49:06,130
AUDIENCE: They're kind of
enunciating the fact that it's

1071
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,050
basically a Mario ripoff.

1072
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,490
Nintendo [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1073
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,586
Yes, we know it's a Mario
ripoff, so we're going to tell

1074
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:15,180
you that we're aware of it.

1075
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,560
PROFESSOR: PETA also has an
established problem with

1076
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,525
Nintendo, with their Cooking
Mama re-skin.

1077
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,197

1078
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:26,447
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1079
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:29,109

1080
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:32,050
technically --although Nintendo
has licenses.

1081
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,930
PROFESSOR: Well I guess Nintendo
received the brunt of

1082
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,150
PETA's wrath, in that
case anyways.

1083
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,400
AUDIENCE: What is
Cooking Mama?

1084
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:48,860

1085
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:53,870
AUDIENCE: It's a DS game
that's about cooking.

1086
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,940
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] because
they're working

1087
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,440
out vegetarian options.

1088
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:59,940

1089
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,500
AUDIENCE: Wow.

1090
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,750
AUDIENCE: So they made another
flash game similar to this one

1091
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,930
where Cooking Mama kills animals
and the features are

1092
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,701
really bloody and slitting
their throats and stuff.

1093
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,530
[LAUGHTER]

1094
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,617
AUDIENCE: Remember we played
the video game yesterday in

1095
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:14,769
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1096
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:15,988
Video Game Studies?

1097
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:17,816
PROFESSOR: Was that a McDonald's
video game?

1098
00:50:17,816 --> 00:50:18,730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1099
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:20,400
It was at videogame.com.

1100
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,550
And that one is a simulation
of running McDonald's.

1101
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,359
And it presents itself as
serious, and at first, most of

1102
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:29,285
us in the class, as I was,
thought it was produced at

1103
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:29,650
McDonald's.

1104
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,990
And as it goes on, you can
manage the beef farms and the

1105
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,011
soy farms, and then your
slaughterhouse, and then your

1106
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:39,185
stores, and then your
corporate area.

1107
00:50:39,185 --> 00:50:41,720
And at first it seems like, hey
we're going to show you

1108
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,740
how the business at
McDonald's works.

1109
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,960
And then you get this farm
portion, and there's the

1110
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,390
option to use [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
crops.

1111
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,220
And you think, oh
I can do that.

1112
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,600
It's a trade off.

1113
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,070
Then you have to bribe the mayor
so you can destroy his

1114
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:52,840
crops to put yours.

1115
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,500
And you're like, wait.

1116
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,120
Then you can choose to
feed your cows sludge

1117
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:57,190
to make them fatter.

1118
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,105
There's all these little things
that you can add on.

1119
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:02,080
You can bribe a climate expert
to say that you're

1120
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,330
environmentally friendly.

1121
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,280

1122
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,240
AUDIENCE: Are these bribes
based on any fact?

1123
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:10,970
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

1124
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,150
It was a good game, too.

1125
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,308
We played it, and it was
really challenging.

1126
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:17,723
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1127
00:51:17,723 --> 00:51:19,655
AUDIENCE: You know it's
the same company.

1128
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:20,905
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1129
00:51:20,905 --> 00:51:24,002

1130
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:26,410
AUDIENCE: CNS 590, and
apparently it's almost

1131
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,020
impossible.

1132
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,098
They do their own act as they
corrupt everything.

1133
00:51:31,098 --> 00:51:33,030
AUDIENCE: And that's advanced
rhetoric, right?

1134
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,275
To be successful,
you have to--

1135
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:34,950
AUDIENCE: The guy next to me
was playing all-natural

1136
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:36,170
organic without corrupting
anyone.

1137
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,610
And he was--

1138
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:39,302
he went to [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1139
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:39,776
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1140
00:51:39,776 --> 00:51:44,050
But at least learn the actions
you're taking in the game.

1141
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,710
You're supposed to hear when
you're walking past someone

1142
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,300
who just talked to you about
how McDonald's sucks.

1143
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,660
AUDIENCE: That wasn't
very effective.

1144
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,194
This was just like, oh,
I'm hungry now.

1145
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,525
AUDIENCE: If it's the
difference between a

1146
00:51:55,525 --> 00:51:58,890
simulation and a game, this is
really more of a game than a

1147
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,036
real simulation.

1148
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:03,733
In a real simulation, the
mechanics have to relate to

1149
00:52:03,733 --> 00:52:04,480
whatever it is.

1150
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,960
PROFESSOR: But again,
who's to say?

1151
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,290
This isn't any more or less a
simulation than Mario was.

1152
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,202
AUDIENCE: I don't think Mario
is a simulation either.

1153
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:15,040

1154
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,740
PROFESSOR: So that's
exactly what it is.

1155
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:21,035
This game has a point to make,
but it's doing so in a very

1156
00:52:21,035 --> 00:52:22,040
narrative fictional way.

1157
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,860
It's not leveraging
the simulation.

1158
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,340
And generally speaking,
these games

1159
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:27,660
are just not as effective.

1160
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,540
And that's one of the cool
things about simulations.

1161
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,796
You get to see how it
works and experience

1162
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,660
things first hand.

1163
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,480
Whereas, is this any more or
less effective than a pamphlet

1164
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,690
or a brochure?

1165
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:39,682
Maybe in terms of exposure.

1166
00:52:39,682 --> 00:52:42,446
A lot of people can play this
game, but it's not doing

1167
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:44,074
anything that any other type
of media could do.

1168
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:47,002

1169
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:48,466
And that's what I got.

1170
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:52,240

1171
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,400
So we're going to do some of the
brainstorm exercise again

1172
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,310
and talk about projects for
the next assignment.

1173
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,492
Does anyone else have anything
they want to add

1174
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:01,190
before we move on.

1175
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:03,130
AUDIENCE: There's a lot
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1176
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,585
the issue of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
simulation.

1177
00:53:04,585 --> 00:53:07,520
I mean we'll be playing games
that are ostensibly

1178
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,948
simulations, or at
least satires.

1179
00:53:10,948 --> 00:53:12,936
AUDIENCE: Which are a
different crunch.

1180

1182
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,892
And I want to point out --

1183
00:53:20,892 --> 00:53:22,860
back to one of the
earlier points--

1184
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,844

1185
00:53:23,844 --> 00:53:24,336
system.

1186
00:53:24,336 --> 00:53:27,780
It doesn't necessarily--

1187
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,748
it does make a game.

1188
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,044
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] system doesn't
have to be a real

1189
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:32,700
world focus.

1190
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,160
It could be any system.

1191
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,112
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1192
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:43,530
They're all very much based
on fictional systems.

1193
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:47,182
But Michael's game is
particularly good, but they're

1194
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,174
trying to figure out what the
system is in those storybooks.

1195
00:53:49,174 --> 00:53:52,162
And make them, relevent
for those players.

1198
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,448
AUDIENCE: So we can do
fictional systems?

1199
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:04,436
PROFESSOR: Not for this
particular one.

1200
00:54:04,436 --> 00:54:06,428
Not for the assignment.

1202
00:54:07,922 --> 00:54:09,914
AUDIENCE: Does anyone know
why they came out

1203
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,930
with Lego Star Wars?

1204
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:13,934
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] of
the Lego games?

1205
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,886
AUDIENCE: Because
they're awesome.

1208
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,880
PROFESSOR: But I think Lego was
not doing very well until

1209
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,895
they got the Star Wars license
to make actual Lego sets.

1210
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,145
And that was a big revenue
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:54:28,145 --> 00:54:30,960

1212
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,970
That was last year.

1213
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,670
If you have a toy store in
Europe, it will be half Lego.

1214
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:38,630
I've had that experience of,
wow, I remember when I wanted

1215
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,888
this when I was six.

1216
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:41,840

AUDIENCE: --Lego Star Wars.

1229
00:55:08,357 --> 00:55:11,351
It's probably more on topic
for stuff like video game

1230
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:15,010
studies, but it probably
works well with a

1231

number of classes offered.

00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:20,333

It will talk about different

We'll talk about different

1239
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:43,085

was another similar point that

1245
00:55:56,758 --> 00:55:59,178

1246
00:55:59,178 --> 00:56:01,620
You saw [INAUDIBLE].

1247
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,200
It's a really, really
good class.

1248
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,300
And he approaches it in
a very similar way.

1249
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,740
For instance, let's
look at a model.

1250
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:12,280
Let's look at those assumptions
and what you're

1251
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:17,162
choosing to simulate, what
you're choosing to leave out.

1252
00:56:17,162 --> 00:56:20,620
And he'll get to things like
game play, [INAUDIBLE].

1253
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,748
He's pretty well equipped after
taking this class to

1254
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:24,590
start thinking about
those issues.

1255
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,080
But he looks a lot
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1256
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,482
How does someone constructing
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1257
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:33,856
the basic first step of how
to release simulation.

1258

PROFESSOR: That's for CNS 590
Education Exploration for

1262
00:56:45,504 --> 00:56:47,860
AUDIENCE: It's multiple

1263
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,660
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1264
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,110
It's definitely crossed
with 11.

1265
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,547
I think it's crossed with at
least one other thing.

1266
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:55,797
AUDIENCE: CNS [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1267

TA: Actually we can
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1269
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:09,770

1270
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:13,130
So this time I'm going to
do it is a brainstorming

1271
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,020
similarly as last time.

1272
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:20,060
But instead of brainstorming the
whole game ideas, which is

1273
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,960
what we did last time, I want
people to pull out systems.

1274
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,370
Pull out the real world systems
that you might want to

1275
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:30,370
write a game about.

1276
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,185
Because what if [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
near the end

1277
00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:36,160
up reciting two models, and
one of the game play, it's

1278
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,780
probably going to be
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] determined by

1279
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,220
who your teammates are.

1280
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:45,244

1285
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,755

it and sharing it.

You don't have to.

1288

yourselves to

just the real world.

1689
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:27,910
I mean, coming up with things
like zombie outbreaks, sure

1690
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:30,250
there is a system
you can model.

1691
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:34,640
But if you're just trying to
push on the edges of the

1692
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,570
constraints, then you're just
trying to give yourself an

1693

easier time.

1694
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:43,133
And more often I see the results
actually turn out to

1695
01:19:43,133 --> 01:19:44,250
be less interesting because
people are just

1696
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:45,910
going for the ideas.

1697
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:47,260
They just [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1698

People aren't actually
trying to work it.

1700
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,820
But that being said, even with
a lot of the ideas up here, a

1701
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:59,180
lot of them have connections.

1702
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:01,896
Even there will be
the obvious ones.

1703
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:04,884
Like oil spill containing and
oil spill starting could

1704
01:20:04,884 --> 01:20:06,520

up on the board.

01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:25,940
You have until the end
of Friday, I guess.

1710

We don't really need
to know until the

beginning of next week.

1712
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:34,492
So actually by the end of
Friday, you should know who is

1713
01:20:34,492 --> 01:20:38,960
on your team and what project
you're working on.

1714
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,580
Over the weekend, you know
who's on your team.

1715
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:45,070
You know to email people
on your team.

1716
01:20:45,070 --> 01:20:47,580

1717
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,440
And what idea you're
starting with.

1718
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:52,510
Again, the idea can diverge a
little bit, but I like the

1719
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:53,820
previous project.

1720
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:56,960
We do want you to keep with
whatever you started with and

1721
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,100
use it as core system.

1722
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,400
You may choose presidential
election.

1723
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,670
It may be something about
winning votes.

1724
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,085
And then you decide no, you
want to make a game of

1725
01:21:05,085 --> 01:21:06,240
gerrymandering.

1726
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,580
That's fine.

1727
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,427
Because it's still keeping
in with the

1728
01:21:09,427 --> 01:21:11,200
same core of the system.

1729
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,016
But say oh, we want to do
something about winning votes

1730
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:16,630
and then instead it became
about religion or

1731
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:17,510
something like that.

1732
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:20,042
I could see how you got there,
but that's not really keeping

1733
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:23,380
with the spirit at this
particular time.

1734
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,558
So stick with the original
core system that you're

1735
01:21:26,558 --> 01:21:28,350
working with.

1736
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,990
And try to find the fun in it.

1737
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,520
Don't try to like, oh, this
is a really dull simulator

1738
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,413
mechanic, but if we add a bunch
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE] then

1739
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:35,260
it becomes funny.

1740
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:35,830
No.

1741
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,690
Try to find it fun in
the original system.

1742
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:40,860
And if you can't try to pick
apart the system and find the

1743
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,490
one component that is fun.

1744
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:46,605
So all of bomb making might
not be so much fun as as

1745
01:21:46,605 --> 01:21:47,170
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1746
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:47,740
the blood--

1747
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,060
Yeah, that might be
the fun part.

1748
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:53,350
The one part, I'll be, oops my
hand slipped, and therefore I

1749
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:54,550
am now dead.

1750
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:56,950
That part might be actually kind
of fun, as opposed to OK,

1751
01:21:56,950 --> 01:21:58,390
now I need to figure out how
to get [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1752
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:02,710

1753
01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,670
Cool.

1754
01:22:03,670 --> 01:22:04,290
All these ideas are going
to stay up on

1755
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:05,540
