10
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:22,850
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, so I'm
actually to keep the

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,170
discussion today pretty short
because the games that we've

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,580
got lined up are pretty long.

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,572

14
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,070
Two of them I know
are really good.

15
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,100
One of them was good last year
so we'll see again this year.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,600
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,790
So we'll see.

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,978
Are there 4 games at least.

19
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:44,936
AUDIENCE: I'm [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

20
00:00:44,936 --> 00:00:47,331
Mexico and Puerto Rico
which will be five.

21
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:48,290
I just haven't pulled
it out yet.

22
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,535
AUDIENCE: I call Thebes.

23
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:50,720
GUEST SPEAKER: Cool.

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,140
For people--

25
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,260
have you played Thebes before.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,600
AUDIENCE: No.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:52,930
GUEST SPEAKER: Good.

28
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:53,300
OK.

29
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:00,650
So for people who played San
Juan last time, I think Puerto

30
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,070
Rico's an interesting
comparison.

31
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,150
Because, San Juan actually, it's
a sequel to Puerto Rico.

32
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,050
So you kind of--

33
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,340
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

34
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,150
AUDIENCE: Which one
was San Juan?

35
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,520
GUEST SPEAKER: That was
the one where, how

36
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,190
would describe it?

37
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,735
AUDIENCE: Is it related to Race
for the Galaxy as well?

38
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:15,120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

39
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,470
AUDIENCE: You choose
the action.

40
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,830
GUEST SPEAKER: Ah, Race?

41
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,820
So that takes us right
into today's game.

42
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,400
So Puerto Rico is kind of
what was [INAUDIBLE].

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:34,860

44
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,190
Puerto Rico is the, I guess
it was actually the first

45
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,474
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

46
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,260
we needed previous
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

47
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,870
inspirations.

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,610
And San Juan's kind of the card
game of this, which is

49
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,820
why we introduced it earlier.

50
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,510
Because you guys were working
on card games.

51
00:01:52,510 --> 00:02:00,140
Race to the Galaxy is more of
a spiritual succession as

52
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,850
described in the reading.

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,410
But you could also
think of it as a

54
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,500
clone with a few upgrades.

55
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,890
Because it wasn't
the same people.

56
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,298
It wasn't the same
people who made--

57
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:10,210
AUDIENCE: It was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

58
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,032
AUDIENCE: To clarify, the guy
who did San Juan and the guy

59
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,880
who did Race to the Galaxy were
kind of collaborating.

60
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,410
So the games are really
similar because they

61
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,470
influenced each other.

62
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,620
But they were not strictly
the same project.

63
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,350
GUEST SPEAKER: So you can think
of it as multiple people

64
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,685
from the same artist community
turning out similar games at

65
00:02:27,685 --> 00:02:28,300
the same time.

66
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,620
AUDIENCE: Nice.

67
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,790
GUEST SPEAKER: But, yeah,
informed by each other, and

68
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,910
when Race came out it was very
much seen as this is Puerto

69
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:42,454
Rico with problems fixed, or the
game has expanded my bad--

70
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,430
AUDIENCE: And problems
added, too.

71
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,040
GUEST SPEAKER: --and problems
added, too, and, of course,

72
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,020
completely different scenes.

73
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,630
But at least in terms of game
mechanics, that's a nice

74
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,080
connection that you can actually
see among the games

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,661
that you played before
and you're going

76
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:57,670
to be playing today.

77
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,059
Not every single game that we've
got here has got that

78
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:03,970
kind of heritage factor.

79
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,390
These games aren't specifically
picked, to me, to

80
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,400
match up with previous
games or sequels.

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,640
The only reason why I'm talking
about sequels because

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,480
we had to talk about them
sooner or later.

83
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
Of course, Battlestar Galactica
is really a

84
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,440
[? rotation ?]

85
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,280
of the TV series.

86
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,720
And I wouldn't quite call this
a sequel, in a sense, because

87
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,704
simply, this is not based
on a previous

88
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:27,532
Battlestar Galactica game.

89
00:03:27,532 --> 00:03:30,561
I'm sure there were previous
Battlestar Galactica games

90
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,440
that were based on the old
'70s TV series that have

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
nothing to do with this one.

92
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,120
This is more of the
adaptation.

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
And the reason why I'm using
that upgrade is so that we can

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,500
be very clear in
our vocabulary.

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,810
This is taking elements of
something that's in a

96
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,430
different medium, like the film
or the TV series, and

97
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,780
trying to figure out what in
that TV series, in that world,

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,940
that has been created, that
fictional world, might yield

99
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,120
interesting game playing.

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,070
And this game is pretty much
about figuring out who is the

101
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,630
Cylon in and among
all the players.

102
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,104
Among all the players, there's
going to be traitors.

103
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:12,700
And you try to hide your
activities, and you try to

104
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,720
help people, help the human race
survive, if you happen

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,839
not to be a traitor.

106
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,930
But some of the things that you
end up doing in order to

107
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,940
help the human race, not just
surviving and not looking

108
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,630
suspicious.

109
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,940
If you played Mafia it kind of
has a little bit of that feel.

110
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,200
Only this is way more
heavy [? weighing ?]

111
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,680
of a game mechanics because they
really, really wanted to

112
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,840
make you think like the
characters, that you have the

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,904
same dilemmas that
the characters

114
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:38,780
in the TV show have.

115
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,350
AUDIENCE: Does the Cylon know
that he or she is a Cylon?

116
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,660
GUEST SPEAKER: I believe
that, I believe you

117
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,080
can find out halfway.

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,960
AUDIENCE: OK.

119
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,260
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, if I recall
the rules correctly.

120
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,760
And then there are players
who will know

121
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,700
right from the beginning.

122
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,930
So there may be more than one.

123
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,994
In fact, there is really
more than one.

124
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:01,860
AUDIENCE: I'm psyched.

125
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,540
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, so there
were a bunch of different

126
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,895
things that were listed in--

127
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:11,770
they were given as reasons why
people want to do sequels.

128
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,920
But for the most part the big
one is just you're building

129
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,900
off an established base.

130
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,630
You're not having to rebuild
everything from scratch.

131
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,640
In many cases, a sequel doesn't
actually cost less or

132
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,540
take less time than making
your original game.

133
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,535
You just end up spending,
hopefully, spending that

134
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:33,780
development time a little
bit more wisely.

135
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,220
You avoid a lot of pitfalls
because you're pretty much

136
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,370
making a very similar game.

137
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,630
The game industry's been one of
those fields where, oddly

138
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,790
enough, part two, the follow
up, tends to be better then

139
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,360
the original.

140
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,730
As opposed to how many movie
sequels are generally better

141
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,370
than the original?

142
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,900

AUDIENCE: Just the sequel.

178
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,510
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, well, some
of them are spaced apart so

179
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,620
far that you actually only
ended up playing--

180
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,370
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean
like Half-Life.

181
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,620
GUEST SPEAKER: Half-Life,
Half-Life 2, for instance.

182
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,738
AUDIENCE: Star Trek.

183
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,172
GUEST SPEAKER: Star
Trek, Star Trek 2.

184
00:06:58,172 --> 00:06:59,415
AUDIENCE: Age of Empires.

185
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:02,132
GUEST SPEAKER: Age of Empires
I, II, and then III.

186
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:03,070
AUDIENCE: Shogun - Total War.

187
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,720
GUEST SPEAKER: Shogun.

188
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,150
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

189
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,080
AUDIENCE: The Total
War series.

190
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,230
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, Total War
is kind of an interesting

191
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,920
thing because they don't
pitch them as sequels.

192
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,240
But they very much pitch
them as a series.

193
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,040
And the whole idea is that if
you liked one game, you

194
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,310
actually know a lot about what
any of the other games

195
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,280
in that series do.

196
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,880
Sure, graphically they're
upgrading.

197
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,490
Game mechanics wise
they're trying to

198
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,870
portal a lot of things.

199
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,900
Some of them are medieval.

200
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,600
Some of them are Japanese.

201
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,480
AUDIENCE: In the readings,
they mentioned that Final

202
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,120
Fantastic VII was the
sequel to VI.

203
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,670
Is that correct?

204
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:36,752
Is that correct nomenclature?

205
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,940
GUEST SPEAKER: And I will
disagree with that, actually.

206
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,795
Final Fantasy VII actually has
a sequel, for instance.

207
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:43,500
AUDIENCE: Right.

208
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,650
GUEST SPEAKER: What was
it, Crisis Core?

209
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

210
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,980
AUDIENCE: There's a
couple, actually.

211
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,400
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

212
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,970
AUDIENCE: More than one--

213
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

214
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,940
GUEST SPEAKER: First of all,
there's the movie.

215
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,266
That sequel was the movie.

216
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,260
And then they did a
bunch of things.

217
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,030
AUDIENCE: Oh God, there were--

218
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,970
GUEST SPEAKER: Final Fantasy
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]--

219
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,280
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

220
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,940
Final Fantasy--

221
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,950
GUEST SPEAKER: --an entry
in a series but--

222
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

223
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,366
GUEST SPEAKER: But I think when
it comes to, this is what

224
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:04,980
we're going to be pitching
to a publisher--

225
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,318
I'm not sure that Square Enix
needs to pitch Final Fantasy

226
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:10,778
themselves--

227
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:13,840
Think of another game that has
an [? all ?] series, if anyone

228
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,660
can come up with one.

229
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,030
AUDIENCE: Baldur's Gate.

230
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,360
GUEST SPEAKER: Baldur's Gate
might be actually a good one

231
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,630
because different companies end
up working on different

232
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,990
types of revisions.

233
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,080
Actually, most of these--

234
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,820
well, actually, Fallout and
Baldur's Gate both come from

235
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,010
Interplay, I believe,
originally.

236
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,900
AUDIENCE: They went out of
business after Bloodlands.

237
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,429
We were talking about
this yesterday.

238
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,289
GUEST SPEAKER: I suspect
that was before that--

239
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:37,940
AUDIENCE: That was Vampires
Bloodlines.

240
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,764
AUDIENCE: Yes, this
came up yesterday.

241
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:39,590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

242
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,440
GUEST SPEAKER: But basically--

243
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,890
leaving aside what makes a
company go out of business--

244
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,010
the issue of when you have a
series and then you have

245
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,550
different companies making
different versions, Guitar

246
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,490
Hero III, for instance--

247
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,565
AUDIENCE: Knights of Republic.

248
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:56,580
GUEST SPEAKER: Knights
of the Old--

249
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,160
AUDIENCE: The second one was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

250
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,340
GUEST SPEAKER: So BioWare was
the first one and Obsidian did

251
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,200
the second one.

252
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,310
Fallout was Bethesda,
Obsidian, I believe.

253
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,840
Obsidian's really built a whole
business model around

254
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,100
making part two of something.

255
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,510
AUDIENCE: Or expansion
packs and stuff.

256
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,435
GUEST SPEAKER: Expansion
packs, no.

257
00:09:15,435 --> 00:09:19,590
You have closely related
to that.

258
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,300
And in those cases, sometimes,
like in the case of BioWare,

259
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,020
Obsidian connections, they
have a good relationship,

260
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,400
they've all written a lot of
technology, and they are

261
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,250
getting an advantage of we've
kind of ironed out the kinks,

262
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,330
we're just sort of continuing
the story, especially the

263
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,150
story based game.

264
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,960
Knights of the Old Republic,
clearly you've got to fit it

265
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,140
within the Star Wars story.

266
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,690
And they had the interest to
basically keep the tale of

267
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,470
these characters going,
even more so for--

268
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,210
well, Mass Effect was
by Bioware, but

269
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,150
that sort of thing.

270
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:00,630
But then you have the other
angle where you just want to

271
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,070
get the same success but you
want to tell a different

272
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:06,465
story, or in the case of
Guitar Hero III have a

273
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:09,650
completely different
set of music.

274
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,535
And in Final Fantasy VII, you
had certain game mechanics and

275
00:10:13,535 --> 00:10:15,720
certain things that carry
on from game to game.

276
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,520
And definitely you want
to carry the fans

277
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,490
from game to game.

278
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,330
But part of the appeal of the
Final Fantasy series is that

279
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,260
every single one is going to
be a different story, not

280
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,118
dramatically different but it's
going to be a different

281
00:10:26,118 --> 00:10:27,980
story with different characters

282
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,620
and a different world.

283
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,800
So but this is pitched very
similarly when you go to a

284
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,120
game company and your whole idea
is how do we get the fans

285
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,355
to buy even more, or even more
fans, to buy version two.

286
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:42,753

287
00:10:42,753 --> 00:10:45,840
There are two edges to that
sword, though, because what

288
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,555
typically happens in a lot of
sequel development is, they

289
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,970
are trying so hard to please
the original fans often by

290
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,880
adding complexity, by adding
things that build on things

291
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,980
that players of the first game
already know, that you

292
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,290
actually start alienating
new players.

293
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,510
The game becomes just so complex
or just complex enough

294
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,684
that people start getting
turned off.

295
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:11,780
A couple of weeks ago over here
we played Guitar Freaks

296
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,650
on Friday Games for Gambit.

297
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,680
And the first version is
actually extremely accessible.

298
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,730
Once again, from the second
version all the way up to, I

299
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,600
think, the version 4 that we
were playing, it is almost

300
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,150
impossible for a new player to
jump in because they've got

301
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,505
one beginning friendly song and
everything else is based

302
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:28,920
for fans of the game.

303
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,490
So you imagine a Guitar Hero
game that's built entirely for

304
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,430
people who've already mastered
expert on the previous game.

305
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,830
That's kind of what happened
with Guitar Freaks.

306
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,100
And in many cases, that might
be enough if the game was

307
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,520
particularly successful the
first time around, and you

308
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,320
only get 80% of the fan base
to buy the second version,

309
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,760
that's still a lot of money.

310
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,880
And it's a way lower risk
compared to coming up with new

311
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,130
IP from scratch.

312
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,880

313
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,950
And a lot of companies, when
they're creating IP, they're

314
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,740
very much specifically thinking,
right off the bat,

315
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,430
what are the sequel
opportunities.

316
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,510
Even now, because you've got
downloadable content, so it's

317
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,110
even narrower than that, is what
are downloadable content

318
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:10,630
opportunities?

319
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,790
How do we release extension
packs really, really quickly?

320
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,940
And how do we create stories,
worlds, technology that's just

321
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,040
going to be able to anticipate
all that.

322
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,830
There's a game up there now on
Xbox Live Arcade called Monday

323
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,950
Night Combat.

324
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,810
And they did some of the old
clever hacks to basically

325
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,980
allow them to update the game
on a week to week basis.

326
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:37,300
Whereas typically that kind
of a certification that's

327
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,630
required from Microsoft
is really expensive.

328
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,880
Every time you want to release a
new version, you have to put

329
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,780
it through an entire rigorous
QA testing schedule, again.

330
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,360
But they came up with some
technology that let them make

331
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,190
at least game tuning changes on
the fly without having to

332
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,410
go through the Microsoft
testing series.

333
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,170
So it's not technically
releasing the sequel but they

334
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,730
were very much thinking
about how do we keep

335
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,290
updating this game.

336
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,550
I wouldn't be surprised if Steam
started off as that.

337
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,970
There's a battle net kind of
started off as just an easy

338
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,725
way for them to get up patches
and to keep tuning this game,

339
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:14,505
and eventually someone involved
decides, hey, we can

340
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:15,780
sell games this way.

341
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,314
And launch was kind of bumpy.

342
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:20,090
But it's fine now.

343
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,710

344
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,960
There is one thing which the
book didn't mention which is

345
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,150
the reboot, the sort of
franchise reboot.

346
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,400
This can sometimes happen when
you have a publisher who's got

347
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,060
control of an RP that kind
of floundered halfway.

348
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,070
Maybe there was a bad execution
on creation and

349
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,510
possible circumstance.

350
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,750
Or they just play out the
formula to death.

351
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,000
And then they want to try to get
a new batch of fans, a few

352
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,630
people who liked the
original one.

353
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,840
And I was talking with the Tomb
Raider game where they're

354
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,180
just trying to--

355
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,970
they've rebooted the Tomb
Raider franchise several

356
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,120
times, at this point, each time
trying to say, OK, you've

357
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,290
probably heard from Tomb Raider
from the huge amount of

358
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,140
advertising that we've done when
you may not have actually

359
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,830
liked the previous versions
of the games.

360
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,410
And we're doing to reboot this
franchise by making a

361
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,800
different game in
that same world.

362
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,010
In Tomb Raider we'll use
characters and we'll use the

363
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,690
fiction, but we'll change the
game play significantly.

364
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,180
Because we're not going after
the old fans anymore.

365
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,320
We're going after a new batch.

366
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,080
It's probably about the same
technical challenge as

367
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,020
updating, as trying to
make a sequel for a

368
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,800
completely new platform.

369
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,310
Because they're basically having
to write everything

370
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,900
from scratch.

371
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,360
But the good news, of course,
is that all that previous

372
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,254
advertising that you did a
decade ago still works.

373
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,760
Let me think of--

374
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Can anyone think of a good
example of a good reboot?

375
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,420
AUDIENCE: Is Mario
64 a reboot?

376
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:00,895
AUDIENCE: No.

377
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:04,300
GUEST SPEAKER: I think it was
seen to a lot of people that

378
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,440
it was because it wasn't clearly
a sequel to any of the

379
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,890
previous Mario games.

380
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,820
And it was kind of
Nintendo kind of

381
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,370
saying, hey, it's not--

382
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,540
AUDIENCE: It's not really
a clone of anything.

383
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,555
GUEST SPEAKER: It's
not really--

384
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:19,460
It invented a lot of things for
the first time, in fact.

385
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,740
I would say that Mario 64 and,
of course, the way how they

386
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,710
branded it, they didn't brand
it Super Mario World, what 5

387
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,220
or Super Mario 4 or anything,
they called it Mario 64 to

388
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,915
sort of distinguish it
from some of the--

389
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,382
AUDIENCE: I would almost call
IT an upgrade more than a

390
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,120
reboot, though.

391
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,600
Because it was mostly just
a move from 2D to 3D.

392
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,070
AUDIENCE: It was more
than that, I think.

393
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,465
GUEST SPEAKER: It's a good
challenge because to the

394
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:47,260
player it may seem like it's not
that but for a technical

395
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,220
point of view they had to
continue to reinvent how Mario

396
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,110
moves, the way how Mario jumps
frankly, the way how the

397
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,520
camera moves, it never used to
be a huge problem in the 2D

398
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,860
games, but was the primary thing
that they've managed to

399
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:09,070
figure out how to get working
in 3D was the camera.

400
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,780
I wouldn't be surprised if their
marketing pitched it a

401
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,480
little bit like a sequel.

402
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,700
But it was also very, very clear
of this is going to be a

403
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,660
whole new generation, you've
never played Mario on anything

404
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,110
like this, so don't expect your
previous Mario experience

405
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,935
to carry over necessarily.

406
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:26,290
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say Metroid, as well.

407
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:26,885
GUEST SPEAKER: Metroid Prime?

408
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:27,510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

409
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:30,250
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, that's
a really good example.

410
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:33,360
In fact, Metroid Prime was an
instance where they gave the

411
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,630
franchise to a completely
different developer.

412
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,550
Previously, it's all
internal Nintendo.

413
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:42,530
And then Nintendo went to a
western developer, Retro

414
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,540
Studios over in Texas and
basically had them make the

415
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,150
first western version
of Metroid.

416
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,090
But they had a very heavy hand
in controlling that.

417
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,780
Whereas--

418
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,610
I'm not sure we're going to
be playing this later--

419
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,520
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow
which just came out, kind of

420
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,550
went the other way around.

421
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,650
Western developers, a Spanish
developer, decided to make a

422
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,780
Castlevania clone.

423
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,839
They loved Castlevania.

424
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,710
And they were going to make
a game that was just like

425
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,050
Castlevania but they don't call
it Castlevania because

426
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,510
they didn't have the
rights for it.

427
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,599
And they showed it off at E3
or something, and Konami

428
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,710
basically said, why don't
we just turn this into a

429
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:23,999
Castlevania game, Hideo
Kojima to [INAUDIBLE]

430
00:17:23,999 --> 00:17:26,260
making it work.

431
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,253
AUDIENCE: It must have been
their dream come true.

432
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:28,255
GUEST SPEAKER: That
was probably

433
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,530
their dream come true.

434
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,700
That was probably what
they wanted.

435
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,040
And you had the advantage of the
all the Castlevania fans

436
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,210
now saying OK, this is going
to be in canon, if we liked

437
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,810
Castlevania, we'll probably
like this one, which is

438
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,590
exactly what they were
trying to get across.

439
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,020
It's like imagine the people
who made Torchlight being

440
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,555
approached from Blizzard saying
why don't we just turn

441
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,350
this into Diablo 3.

442
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,120
AUDIENCE:A bunch of people who
made Torchlight were from

443
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,560
Blizzard, right?

444
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,340
GUEST SPEAKER: I wouldn't
be surprised.

445
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,160
AUDIENCE: Were they from
the Diablo team?

446
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,980
GUEST SPEAKER: I wouldn't
be surprised.

447
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,110
In the same sense that a lot of
people who built GuildWars

448
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,300
were from the World
of Warcraft team.

449
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:03,640
So that's less an issue of
sequels and more an issue of

450
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,910
that's just how the game
industry works.

451
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,925
People move from project
to project and carry

452
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:07,590
knowledge with them.

453
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,850
AUDIENCE: Like Call of Duty was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

454
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,906
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes, Call
of Duty, yes and--

455
00:18:11,906 --> 00:18:12,800
AUDIENCE: They got tired
of it and were

456
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,660
like we can do better.

457
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,050
GUEST SPEAKER: That's an
interesting discussion of

458
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,700
instead of sequels you have
companies making effectively

459
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,480
clones competing against
the original franchise.

460
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,920
And in this product case
they're trying--

461
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,235
there's people who left EA on
2015, I believe, and then they

462
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,400
started Infinity Ward.

463
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,010
And they made a game
that basically

464
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,080
competed with the original.

465
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,190
AUDIENCE: The first Call of Duty
was so ridiculously good,

466
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,670
at least, it marked me when I
played it the first time.

467
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,040
GUEST SPEAKER: But it's very
clearly trying to be Medal of

468
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,150
Honor the next version.

469
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, clearly, yeah,
no, of course, of course.

470
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,380
GUEST SPEAKER: So that's an
interesting situation where

471
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,960
it's hard to be a spiritual
successor when you're

472
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,420
competing against the
original product.

473
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,960
But you can think of them--

474
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,040
AUDIENCE: BioWare did
that with Dragon--

475
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,322
I mean not competing against
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

476
00:19:02,322 --> 00:19:03,768
Dragon Age because they don't
have the rights to

477
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] game anymore.

478
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,780
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, Dragon Age
is more of a DND clone, I

479
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,150
would say, which--

480
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

481
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,382
AUDIENCE: Empire Earth
reinvented itself with--

482
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:16,860
GUEST SPEAKER: Which one?

483
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,370
AUDIENCE: --with
Empire Earth--

484
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:17,897
GUEST SPEAKER: Empire Earth.

485
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:19,120
AUDIENCE: --with zero success.

486
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,220
It didn't do [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

487
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,090
GUEST SPEAKER: I kind of lost
track of that series.

488
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,100
AUDIENCE: In the whole game, the
first game was like, you

489
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,120
can go through 15 ages.

490
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,430
You can literally play a game
against someone and go from

491
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,940
prehistoric units to nukes in
the same game with everything

492
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:33,620
in between.

493
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,916
And then they released the
sequel which, I think,

494
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:37,690
overseas and then it's like
they [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

495
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,510
themselves and go, we're going
to simplify everything,

496
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,819
there's just going to be four
ages, kind of like in Ancient

497
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,720
Empires, and we're not going
to have this massive

498
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,210
progression.

499
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,525
And they tried to simplify
everything.

500
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:47,295
And it totally bombed.

501
00:19:47,295 --> 00:19:48,545
GUEST SPEAKER: I think
that's a rebooting.

502
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:51,340

503
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,020
But I think that's a
reboot gone wrong.

504
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,730
That's a, our original game is
not selling well enough among

505
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,620
new players, maybe, and it's
not entirely satisfying our

506
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,720
old fans, so we're going to take
this franchise that we

507
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,930
advertised really, really well,
and we're going to make

508
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,700
it completely, effectively a new
game, maybe with the same

509
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,540
theme but a new game
that targeted at

510
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,740
a new set of players.

511
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,430
Sometimes it works.

512
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,240
Sometimes it bombs.

513
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
Might and Magic released a game
called Clash of Heroes,

514
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,590
Might and Magic Clash of Heroes
for the Nintendo DS.

515
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,960
Who's played any
of the original

516
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,745
Might and Magic games?

517
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,622
AUDIENCE: Different from Heroes
of Might and Magic?

518
00:20:31,622 --> 00:20:33,500
GUEST SPEAKER: Either
of them, actually.

519
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,370
So who's played Heroes
of Might and Magic?

520
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,944
Can you describe the game?

521
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,186
What's it like?

522
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,430
AUDIENCE: Want to
go, [? Fred? ?]

523
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,080
AUDIENCE: Well, it's like
essentially just a turn based

524
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,710
strategy game where you have
cities and you have heroes.

525
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,350
And these heroes lead armies.

526
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,310
And you encounter other smaller
armies and try to

527
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,340
defeat them and stuff.

528
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,430
And you have--

529
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,040
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
city, you start with--

530
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,020
you have an economy.

531
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have an
economy and you build things

532
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,020
in your city that can then
produce better units for your

533
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,075
armies and stuff.

534
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,350
You can take over other
cities and--

535
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,150
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

536
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,770
GUEST SPEAKER: Like
Civilization, I would say.

537
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:18,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's like
Civilization but if you took

538
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,000
Civilization and removed

539
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,990
everything that wasn't military.

540
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,882
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

541
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:23,980
AUDIENCE: And that was what
played out and gave it its

542
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,970
distinctive arena--

543
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:27,530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

544
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:27,960
AUDIENCE: --turn based--

545
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,470
AUDIENCE: You're trying to do
stuff like battlefields where

546
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,680
the turn based, you have your
units on one side and the

547
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,520
opponent's units on
the other side.

548
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,800
And you move units together.

549
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,712
So if you have pikemen and
bowmen, you have the clump of

550
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:45,380
all bowmen who then move
together as a unit.

551
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,044
GUEST SPEAKER: So Clash of
Heroes, a Nintendo DS game in

552
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:52,410
the Might and Magic series, and
what they did was, they

553
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,690
made a match three game.

554
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,580
They made a game where you--

555
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,650
it's like Bejeweled.

556
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:00,550
You take three bowmen, put them
in a row, and then they

557
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,490
become a bunch of bowmen who
are going to attack.

558
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,605
So they get the same idea
of let's take--

559
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:08,990
and because the Nintendo DS
has two screens, so the

560
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,160
enemy's armies are on one and
yours are on the other.

561
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,405
It's kind of like sending
troops up and down.

562
00:22:14,405 --> 00:22:16,700
But the game play's dramatically
different.

563
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,080
It's effectively a
franchise reboot.

564
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,740
They want to get the same idea
of leading massive armies

565
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,560
against each other.

566
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,122
I think they take some of the
characters, at least some of

567
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:30,277
the technologies that came with
the original Heroes of

568
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:32,120
Might and Magic.

569
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,260
But that's as far as it got.

570
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,090
Everything else they changed.

571
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,730
Because they were going for a
completely different audience,

572
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:41,580
the assumption being Nintendo
DS players liked match three

573
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,474
games like Bejeweled, actually
really good.

574
00:22:46,474 --> 00:22:48,784
I'd encourage it if you like
match three games.

575
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,805

576
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:57,520
I was going to put Sarah on the
spot for having worked on

577
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,380
Thief II, and Thief Gold,
and Thief 2 Gold,

578
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,596
and a number of releases.

579
00:23:04,596 --> 00:23:07,548
But maybe we can start telling
us a little bit about your

580
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:09,024
original involvement on Thief.

581
00:23:09,024 --> 00:23:09,516
SARAH: Sure.

582
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:11,976
Do you want me to stand up
to actually hear me?

583
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,928
GUEST SPEAKER: I can bring
the mike closer.

584
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:19,848
SARAH: So Thief: The Dark
Project, I came on as actually

585
00:23:19,848 --> 00:23:21,324
as team tester.

586
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:24,276
Part way through it I became
community manager,

587
00:23:24,276 --> 00:23:25,260
essentially.

588
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,485
And then I actually stepped into
a design role for about

589
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:33,722
the second half of
the project.

590
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:37,374
And I continued to work as a
designer and project manager

591
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,053
on Thief II and Thief Gold.

592
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:42,020
GUEST SPEAKER: What were
you designing in Thief?

593
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,332
SARAH: In Thief I, I was pretty
specifically designing

594
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:46,492
game play for a level
that someone

595
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:47,573
else had already built.

596
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:50,360
Building levels took a lot
longer than putting in game

597
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,812
play, at least from
my point of view.

598
00:23:52,812 --> 00:23:54,176
I believe the person who built
it thought that building

599
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,780
levels was a lot faster
than laying game play.

600
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,080
So it was a good combination.

601
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,630
But it was built by an artist
who didn't have the scripting

602
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,226
experience or the testing
visions to go through and make

603
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:05,736
sure that all the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] for the game

604
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,840
play experience is working.

605
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,880
So I was basically handed
a level and

606
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,105
said, OK, make it fun.

607
00:24:11,105 --> 00:24:13,620
GUEST SPEAKER: Now Thief is a
first person stealth game.

608
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,312
Basically you're looking through
the eyes of a thief

609
00:24:16,312 --> 00:24:18,850
who is not physically
all that robust.

610
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,806
But he can sneak.

611
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:23,061
And he can shoot arrows,
usually at

612
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,790
your back, and hide.

613
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,905
SARAH: And the AI is, unlike in
most games where the AI is

614
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:34,750
tuned sort of aha, we noticed
you, we charge you, the AI is

615
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,090
carefully tuned to both tell the
player if the AI sort of

616
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:42,530
notices you, if the AI thinks
he's looking for you and is

617
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:45,900
looking for, and if he's
actually coming after you.

618
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,574
So that a player who makes a
noise while sneaking up on

619
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,860
them will realize that, oh, he
noticed that, I should go be

620
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,820
more quiet.

621
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,254
So the AI feedback and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] was actually

622
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,170
really pretty important
to playing experience.

623
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,935
If you didn't give the player an
avenue to approach a guard

624
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:05,460
from behind or to sneak up on
them in some way, you'll

625
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,150
pretty much guarantee the
player will get killed.

626
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,300
Because the player could not, in
fact, take one guard on one

627
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,950
to one many times.

628
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,170
You could probably kill one
guard face to face, but then

629
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,368
he'd be sufficiently wounded
that the second fight would

630
00:25:19,368 --> 00:25:20,470
finish him off.

631
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,033
So you had to be giving the
player channels and ways to

632
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,911
sneak up and places to hide and
things like that if you

633
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:27,964
wanted to have an interesting
game and a challenging game.

634
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,587
GUEST SPEAKER: And that's the
game play we say you're

635
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:29,770
talking about.

636
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,276
SARAH: Those are the game
plays we've been talking

637
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:34,850
about, yeah, placing AIs
determining their path,

638
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,920
putting-- this actually
particularly had a lot of

639
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,180
traps in it--

640
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,470
so creating the traps and giving
clues to the player in

641
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,350
games so that they could, A,
either notice the trap was

642
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,600
there before getting hit by it
and finding some other way to

643
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,092
trigger it, or notice that it
was there or notice it was

644
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:57,690
there and then discover
how to get out of it.

645
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,423
GUEST SPEAKER: Thief
is a 199--

646
00:26:00,423 --> 00:26:03,900
SARAH: Oh God, 19-- ancient
at this point.

647
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,820
GUEST SPEAKER: 199--

648
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,690
SARAH: 199--, 1996, it was
released around the

649
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,186
same time Doom was.

650
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:13,010
GUEST SPEAKER: And it's pretty
impressive because in Doom you

651
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,444
can't look up, I believe.

652
00:26:14,444 --> 00:26:15,410
You can shoot up
but you can't--

653
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,630
SARAH: Yeah.

654
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,440
I think you can crouch.

655
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,160
You can lean around corners.

656
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,467
You can, in fact, shoot
your bow while

657
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,702
leaning around corners.

658
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:28,670
And, yeah, you can look up
and down and all around.

659
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,768
GUEST SPEAKER: So that's Thief
I. What happens when Thief II

660
00:26:32,768 --> 00:26:35,160
gets approved?

661
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,820
SARAH: Well, the first thing I
had to do was convince people

662
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,500
they wanted to do Thief II.

663
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,750
Because while Thief was a great
game and it's actually

664
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:44,705
sold fairly well over time,
its initial sales were not

665
00:26:44,705 --> 00:26:45,550
what publishers want to see.

666
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,600
Because the initial sales a
publisher wants to see is, oh

667
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,570
my God, it sold 10 million
copies, awesome.

668
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:52,870
Instead what we did was we
sold a fairly good first

669
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:56,110
initial sell through and then
it just kind of kept going.

670
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,830
So the first thing we had to
do was convince them that,

671
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,580
yes, Thief II would be a good
idea, enough people are

672
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,040
continuing to buy Thief I. Those
same people will all run

673
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,310
out and buy Thief II on
the very first day.

674
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,884
And the way we did that was,
first of all, taking a look at

675
00:27:08,884 --> 00:27:10,970
forums and saying, hey look,
people are pretty excited

676
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,590
about this.

677
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,460
They're enjoying it.

678
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,380
It's got good lasting power.

679
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,770
Our fans are going to stick
around to play with it a

680
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,890
second time.

681
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,080
And that was sort of a marketing
end analysis that

682
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,560
led into a publisher.

683
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,930
And the other part was saying,
OK, what are the improvements

684
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,970
we're going to make
to this game?

685
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,550
How are we going to change this
game to make it better

686
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,127
than Thief I while still
taking advantage of

687
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:29,690
everything we did?

688
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,890
So we created basically a big
design doc with, here are the

689
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,020
areas that we thought we could
have done better in Thief I.

690
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:34,720
Here's what we're going
to improve.

691
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,810
And here are the changes
we're going to make.

692
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,770
So we're not going to
make Thief I, again.

693
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,850
We're going to take what Thief
I was, add some improvements

694
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,840
to it, make a deeper story,
and hopefully get a more

695
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,340
variety of game play was what
we actually ended up aiming

696
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,270
for in our initial docs.

697
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:55,720
We wanted to give Garrett
additional abilities,

698
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,060
vary the game play.

699
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,400
The game play in Thief
I was all speed.

700
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,200
We tried to have some additional
types of missions

701
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,210
in Thief II.

702
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,070
But there was a little more
face to face fighting.

703
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,790
There was a little
more subterfuge.

704
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,187
Instead of just sneaking around,
we also had, OK, so

705
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:15,410
now you need to disguise
yourself as someone and sneak

706
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,720
in, sneak out again.

707
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,520
You need to pass for them while
getting a goal done and

708
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,150
things like that.

709
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,800
So we tried to find, what are
additional stealth and

710
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,580
subterfuge issues and game
play we can have?

711
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,446
GUEST SPEAKER: How many of those
features in Thief II

712
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:32,804
were inherited from dropped
features from Thief I?

713
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:35,870

714
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,920
SARAH: A lot of them inherited
from dropped ideas from Thief

715
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,450
I. But when they first started
designing Thief-- and I was

716
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,007
not on the initial Thief design
team so now I'm making

717
00:28:44,007 --> 00:28:47,230
up what they were
talking about.

718
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,430
It wasn't clear that it
was going to be--

719
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,930
It was sort of like, it's going
to be a stealthy game,

720
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,810
but we hadn't actually
defined what stealthy

721
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,630
game play was yet.

722
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:58,570
So it was Thief I that kind of
told us what, this is what

723
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,900
stealth game play that works.

724
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,087
And once we found the one or
two things that worked, we

725
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:03,710
kind of went with that
and put in that.

726
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,750
It was in Thief II, we got to
play around what are some

727
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,260
other ideas of stealthy
game play?

728
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,290
What are some other ways to
trick people into [INAUDIBLE]?

729
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,120
GUEST SPEAKER: And people that
played Metal Gear Solid or any

730
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,950
of the games in Metal Gear Solid
series, it owes a lot to

731
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,200
Thief, especially the really,
really noisy end you see.

732
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,853
It wasn't, I heard something,
I wonder what's over there.

733
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:23,970
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

734
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,200
SARAH: DS-X also.

735
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,920
GUEST SPEAKER: But DS-X is also
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

736
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,450
SARAH: But that's what I'm
saying is that DS-X also

737
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,250
actually took a lot of Thief's
lessons and went on with them

738
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,708
from there.

739
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,824
GUEST SPEAKER: Again, a lot
of people working on

740
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:36,020
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

741
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,100
SARAH: DS-X2, more
DS-X2, but yeah.

742
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,110
Looking Glass folded and
went out of business.

743
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:46,060
And a lot of people moved to
Austin to then work on Thief

744
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:50,200
III and DS-X2 and those
projects there.

745
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,174
GUEST SPEAKER: I
have a question

746
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:55,070
about the Gold version.

747
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,287
SARAH: The Gold version?

748
00:29:56,287 --> 00:30:00,340
The Gold versions of the games
are really a way to try to

749
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,910
convince, from the marketing
point of view, is a way to

750
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,540
convince players to buy the
same material again.

751
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,300

752
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,180
I'm being a little cynical
here, and I admit that.

753
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,570
But we added new, we did, in
fact, add, what we did was, we

754
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,800
added several new missions.

755
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,090
So it was expanded play.

756
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,216
And then we went back and
problems that we knew were in

757
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:22,730
the missions, we fixed them.

758
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,783
And we actually added some
richer game play to several of

759
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,790
the missions that, oh God, we
have to get this out the door,

760
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,430
we have to get this out the
door, this would be so cool if

761
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,810
we could set this up but
we don't have time

762
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,290
to, and out it goes.

763
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,100
And so we went back
and we touched up

764
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,310
over half of the missions.

765
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,670
We added some additional
game play.

766
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,715
We added extra goals.

767
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,060
We took areas where we thought
the game play was particularly

768
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,660
weak because we'd gotten rushed
on finishing it and we

769
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,870
made the levels a bit longer and
a little more interesting

770
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,080
in our opinion.

771
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,910
And then we also added
three new levels.

772
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,900
And it was kind of a chance,
it was a do over.

773
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,050
We had very limited programming
resources so we

774
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,120
didn't really get to add much
in the way of new features.

775
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,250
But we were able to go back
and tune it and make

776
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,680
significant changes to the
levels, to the way that the

777
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,690
guards worked, to the scripting
behind the levels.

778
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,030
Vin was working on a 3D mod.

779
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,210
There's usually a fair bit the
designer can do behind the

780
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:18,530
walls of telling the AIs what to
do and how to think and how

781
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,460
the game play flows.

782
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,430
And Thief, especially, had an
extremely rich editor that--

783
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,755
more powerful, I think, than any
other editor I ever worked

784
00:31:25,755 --> 00:31:29,159
with, even though it is
now 15 years old, 15

785
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,370
years old, I think.

786
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,426
It's still the most powerful
editor for a

787
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:36,420
designer I have ever seen.

788
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,930
GUEST SPEAKER: So
did you feel--

789
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,920

790
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,736
You mentioned you looked
at forums and

791
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:44,510
you look at fan input.

792
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:49,172
And how much of that, of what
went into making the sequel,

793
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:51,160
actually came from fan input?

794
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,880
Or was it just like verifying
what you already wanted to do.

795
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,870
SARAH: Part of it was to verify
what we wanted to do.

796
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,667
Part of it was to verify there
was enough interest that

797
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,540
people would want to do it.

798
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,930
Part of it was to see, what
did people like most?

799
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,560
Which of the missions did
people like most?

800
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,970
Are there any good ideas out
there for how to play a game

801
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,910
that we think, yes,
they're right, we

802
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:09,580
never thought of that.

803
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,780
I think that one of the things
people talked about a lot was

804
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,285
actually disguise missions.

805
00:32:13,285 --> 00:32:15,540
And I think we had two disguise
missions in Thief II

806
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,393
where you're kind of disguising
yourself as, no,

807
00:32:18,393 --> 00:32:21,240
no, no, no one looked at me, I'm
just another guard walking

808
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,890
around, don't worry about me.

809
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,040
And that was something that we
said, oh, yeah, that would be

810
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,760
really cool.

811
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,990
And that's something we had no
time to implement for Thief

812
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:35,090
but, if we're choosing new
features to implement in Thief

813
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,850
II, that was actually not an
amazingly difficult one.

814
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:40,000
Because you just, if you've got
a way to put a tag on the

815
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,155
play that says, oh, guards
don't get upset

816
00:32:42,155 --> 00:32:43,176
when they see you.

817
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:46,770
GUEST SPEAKER: Did you have a
situations where players came

818
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,490
out with exploits that
you tried to

819
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,375
address in the Gold version?

820
00:32:50,375 --> 00:32:52,390
SARAH: There were not,
no, actually.

821
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,710
There were a couple of places
where people found bugs that

822
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,420
were level enders that
got people stuck that

823
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,610
we went in and fixed.

824
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,204
There were not a whole lot of
exploits that I recall us

825
00:33:03,204 --> 00:33:04,660
trying to go in and fix.

826
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,755
AUDIENCE: So if somebody
deliberately found something

827
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:08,892
that put them on the roof of the
castle or something like

828
00:33:08,892 --> 00:33:11,740
that, then you didn't want them
trying to [INAUDIBLE]?

829
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,940
SARAH: If it allowed the player
to get to a place when

830
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,760
he broke the game, we
did try to fix it.

831
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,400
Because we tried to fix anything
that was game breaker

832
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,390
where you could get up on
the wall and then leap

833
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,340
off into the void.

834
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,700
But sometimes what we'd do is,
rather than stop you from

835
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,490
getting up on the castle and
proving how cool you were,

836
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,990
we'd let you get up on the
castle but we'd put in

837
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,456
invisible barriers so you
couldn't hurl yourself into

838
00:33:31,456 --> 00:33:36,280
the darkness and then
crash the game.

839
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,190
If players enjoyed finding those
things so taking them

840
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,830
out doesn't enhance
the game play.

841
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,750
And the point of the Gold
project was to try to make

842
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:47,630
something the game play was
sufficiently enhanced that it

843
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,668
was worthwhile to go
out and buy again.

844
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:53,300
GUEST SPEAKER: So now we're in
an environment where patches

845
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,815
pretty much is downloaded,
right?

846
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:55,310
SARAH: Yeah.

847
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,795
GUEST SPEAKER: We don't
necessarily have that

848
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,920
situation in the year 1996.

849
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,115
Is there still a role of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASES]

850
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:03,920
new releases?

851
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,000
SARAH: I think now again that
would be an expansion pack.

852
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,830
I don't think that you would
do a Gold version.

853
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,219
You'd do an expansion pack.

854
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:13,290
And with an expansion pack
patch you could fix old

855
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,970
problems and you might introduce
new games and of

856
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,046
levels, but I don't think
you do it with the

857
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:17,876
hassle of doing a Gold.

858
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:21,355
I think you just do
an expansion pack.

859
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:24,337
[APPLAUSE]

860
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:27,567
GUEST SPEAKER: Questions
for Sarah and her

861
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:31,295
experience on it?

862
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:33,655
AUDIENCE: Pretty much all of
your data points just came

863
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:34,790
from forums where you--

864
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,690
SARAH: Oh yeah, oh yeah, that
was just one of the places

865
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,124
where we looked.

866
00:34:37,124 --> 00:34:39,949
We also looked at sales
and continuing sales

867
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,719
and things like that.

868
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,770
Like I said, that was actually
more of a marketing sales to

869
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,730
sort of do, here's why we think
players will like it.

870
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,420
Here's some experiences
we got.

871
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,877
Here's the hard data on our
sales, how our sales are

872
00:34:50,877 --> 00:34:55,830
continuing, and the fact that
while it did not come out and

873
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:00,000
sell 100,000 copies the first
month, it's continuing to sell

874
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,527
20,000 or 30,000 copies a month,
which means that word

875
00:35:02,527 --> 00:35:05,733
of mouth is pretty strong, and
people are continuing to go

876
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,195
out and buy it and go
out and play it.

877
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:10,140
And here's the forum where a
whole bunch of people are

878
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,760
using the editor released.

879
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,570
And the activity in that forum
is going up over time not down

880
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,260
over time which indicates you've
got more people coming

881
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,950
into it, people are coming in,
they're staying at and using

882
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,826
it, and you've got more people
continuing to come in, the

883
00:35:23,826 --> 00:35:25,300
community's growing, which means
that there's interest

884
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:27,270
there and there's people who
are paying attention to

885
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,393
project and are going to
continue to pay attention to

886
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:29,720
your product.

887
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,843
AUDIENCE: But also it
gave for finding

888
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:33,150
dead ends, for finding--

889
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:36,580
You said you fixed some of the
dead games [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

890
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,445
SARAH: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

891
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:40,580
Well, the difference
between a--

892
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,990
let me think--

893
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,060
At our height, we had a 12
person QA department.

894
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,454
And 50,000 users
is pretty big.

895
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:53,510
And we did our best
on testing it.

896
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,340
And we had another 10 or 15
helpers through our publisher.

897
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,330
But we had comparatively
speaking a ridiculously small

898
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,270
QA department for the game.

899
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,425
GUEST SPEAKER: But then you
have the situation where

900
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,756
someone notes something on the
forum and then you can verify

901
00:36:08,756 --> 00:36:09,752
it with your QA team.

902
00:36:09,752 --> 00:36:10,750
SARAH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

903
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,070
GUEST SPEAKER: And you can
actually figure out whether

904
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,017
what they were seeing was
exactly the problem they were

905
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:15,180
describing.

906
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,060
SARAH: And it being a solely
single player game--

907
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:22,040
I know a lot of games do large
beta tests where they ask 500,

908
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,800
or 200, or 1,000 people
to play the game.

909
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,418
We did not do any external
testing like that at all.

910
00:36:28,418 --> 00:36:28,870
Yeah.

911
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,080
GUEST SPEAKER: And this was
also back in the '90s that

912
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,450
wasn't being done.

913
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,776
SARAH: Oh, yeah, it was not
the sort of thing that was

914
00:36:31,776 --> 00:36:35,110
really done in the
'90s as well.

915
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,780
It's very much a developmental
shift.

916
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,180
AUDIENCE: Did you ever
explicitly ask on the forums

917
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,378
if there were another sequel,
would you buy it?

918
00:36:45,378 --> 00:36:46,860
SARAH: I don't know.

919
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,840
I did not do that.

920
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,890
I was not on the forums.

921
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,924
I helped with some of the forum
data in [? reforms ?]

922
00:36:51,924 --> 00:36:54,960
but I didn't really post
on the forums a lot.

923
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,323
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
would be viable tactic, or

924
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:58,480
would you just say, people would
probably just say yes.

925
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,590
SARAH: I think that your data
wouldn't be very good.

926
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:00,900
AUDIENCE: OK.

927
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,370
SARAH: The most you're probably
going to get is the

928
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:05,620
1,000 people who read
the forum say, yes.

929
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,830
And that's 1,000 people.

930
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,750
And that's not enough sales
to justify doing anything.

931
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,530
AUDIENCE: Gotcha.

932
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,490
SARAH: It's more interesting,
I think it's more useful to

933
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,370
look at trends, if you've
got a survey out

934
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:18,630
maybe, I don't know.

935
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,890
GUEST SPEAKER: I've seen
companies bring in focus

936
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,910
groups, people who played the
first game to come in and

937
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,480
bouncing off either prototypes
or features that they're

938
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,700
planning for the second version
to see how they will

939
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,575
respond to them.

940
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:35,250
I would say that the information
you back from that

941
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,900
is also not very good.

942
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,810
But it might be something that
is done to gain traction in

943
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:45,750
internal studio politics, and it
was like, well, we did this

944
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,840
exercise where we brought these
people in and they said

945
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,263
these features are OK, so
we can take the risk of

946
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:50,756
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

947
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:55,530
As opposed to driving the entire
process [INAUDIBLE].

948
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:58,130

949
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,740
SARAH: Games don't respond
really well to focus test

950
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,820
based development.

951
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,937
GUEST SPEAKER: Or
focus group--

952
00:38:03,937 --> 00:38:06,820
SARAH: Or focus group
based development.

953
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,640
Getting feedback on your
games is great.

954
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,820
Finding out how many people are
likely to like your game

955
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,098
is a lot harder.

956
00:38:13,098 --> 00:38:15,090
GUEST SPEAKER: Especially if
they can't actually see it

957
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,576
when you're asking them the
question then they have no

958
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,960
idea what they're
commenting on.

959
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,610
They'll make something up that
they think you want to hear,

960
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,641
is, yes, of course, we'll
buy a copy of the game.

961
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:27,410
We loved the first one.

962
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,344
Sure.

963
00:38:28,344 --> 00:38:30,117
But if they haven't actually
seen the second version of the

964
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:31,923
game [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE], so
you don't actually know if

965
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,490
that is the case.

966
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,520
For those of you who do missed
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

967
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,180
talk last week, he was talking
about how Inamplitude which

968
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,080
was a sequel--

969
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:42,870
Was Amplitude--

970
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

971
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,920

972
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,350
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

973
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,130
GUEST SPEAKER: I think it was
in the very first one.

974
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,710
So that was Frequency.

975
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,360
He was talking about how the
folks from Sony were helping

976
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,230
them run their focus groups.

977
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,963
And they did two tests and one
of the tests was, after they

978
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,476
played the game, they did a
survey of how many people were

979
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,695
planning on buying this
when it came out.

980
00:39:06,695 --> 00:39:08,913
And they had a particularly
high score, like 80% or

981
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,630
something like that, like the
highest survey I've ever seen.

982
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,295
But they also did a survey of
how many people were planning

983
00:39:14,295 --> 00:39:17,410
on buying the game just by
looking at the box before they

984
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,072
had played the game.

985
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:20,280
And that was a particularly
low number.

986
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,584
And the Sony people called
it, said this is

987
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:23,240
not going to sell.

988
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,230
Because, sure, the people who
played their game are going to

989
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,800
enjoy the game.

990
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,624
But no one's going to play the
game in the first place

991
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:31,306
because people can't figure out
what your game's about.

992
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:32,270
And they tried to address those

993
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,560
problems with the sequel.

994
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,830
That's one thing which
[? Brenda ?] talks about, your

995
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,480
chance to do a do over, a chance
for you to go back and

996
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,470
fix the problems that you
found in the first one,

997
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,110
especially when you find
those problems really

998
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,060
close to ship date.

999
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,070
There's nothing you can do about
the first time around.

1000
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,990
But if you're lucky, you get
a second chance to do it.

1001
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,420
SARAH: I also noticed that
Frequency was not called in,

1002
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,850
or rather, it wasn't
Frequency II.

1003
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,250
GUEST SPEAKER: There
was a Frequency II.

1004
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:01,930
They called it Amplitude.

1005
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,650
So it was actually kind of a
reboot as well because they

1006
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:07,194
kind of just wanted people, OK,
let's pretend Frequency

1007
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:08,628
didn't happen and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1008
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,858
And we'll make sure that our
Frequency people who loved the

1009
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:11,496
game know what it is.

1010
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:12,460
SARAH: Ahead of time.

1011
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,750
It's much easier to tell the
small base who liked you, oh

1012
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:20,127
yeah, and buy this game, than it
is to tell a large group of

1013
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:22,265
people who weren't interested
the first time, no, no, you

1014
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:24,170
didn't like it the first time,
but trust us, you'll

1015
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,810
like it this time.

1016
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:31,460
GUEST SPEAKER: I've seen a
couple of companies do

1017
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,166
effectively Gold versions every
time they move to a new

1018
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:38,500
platform, like the latest
platform which they release it

1019
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,440
on tends to become the
definitive version that, if

1020
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,820
you're a big fan of the
franchise and you're willing

1021
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,930
to buy this game multiple times,
you want to get that

1022
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,810
because of the few extra
features that they've put in.

1023
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,840
Maybe it's different endings.

1024
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,114
Maybe it's upgraded cutscenes.

1025
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:54,560
If it's a role playing game
I see that a lot.

1026
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,250
Maybe they redid the cutscenes
from scratch or redid the

1027
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,340
audio from scratch.

1028
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,810
So it's the same assets but
they're higher resolution.

1029
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:06,370
And, of course, you have games
that started out there like

1030
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,740
this online flash games and
stuff like that and then

1031
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,850
you've got to move
them to other

1032
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,106
platforms like DS or PSP.

1033
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:15,800
And those games tend to have not
only completely reworked

1034
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,470
controls because the controls
are different but also a lot

1035
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,280
more features because you have
to now justify to people who

1036
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,480
may have loved the game but
didn't pay any money for the

1037
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,420
first version to actually put
down money for it now.

1038
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,480
So [? N ?] is a good
example of that.

1039
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,870
There's a game that came
out by [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1040
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:36,863
and the DS and PSP what
started life as

1041
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:37,880
a free flash game.

1042
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,570
And lots of people loved it.

1043
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,530
But lots of people didn't have
to pay any money for their

1044
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:41,910
first version.

1045
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,822
So how much do you love it is
kind of a weird factor.

1046
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:52,370

1047
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,020
I guess we should start
with the games.

1048
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,140
