9
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,220
PROFESSOR: Today is pretty
much just set aside for

10
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,080
brainstorming.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,202
So we're probably going to
do about an hour of that.

12
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:28,396
Just to throw the ideas that
people already have in their

13
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:32,246
heads about what could be with
the problem space that we're

14
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,442
working on.

15
00:00:34,442 --> 00:00:41,381
This whole preparing people to
deal with violence and folks

16
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,840
suffering from an illness.

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,922
And there's a whole bunch of
different things that people

18
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:47,070
may be working on.

19
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,150
And the idea is that hopefully
we can get this all out and

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,020
then we can spend the next
half-hour, and frankly the

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,920
rest of this week, trying
to figure out

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,000
who's in which team.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,002
Who's collaborating on a
similar topic and who's

24
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:03,580
interested in what.

25
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,040
And then, anyone actually get
through any of the readings?

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,760
OK, great.

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,160
So there's a few things
up there.

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,926
I realize that we don't have
a lot of time to read.

29
00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:14,550
And there's probably more stuff
up there to read that

30
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,550
needs to be read necessarily.

31
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,770
But it's all there
as resources.

32
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,555
Any ideas that people
thought might be

33
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:22,805
interesting to work on?

34
00:01:22,805 --> 00:01:24,480

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,220
Andrew?

36
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,560
AUDIENCE: So one of the basic
issues I heard from the

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,220
presentation, and the papers,
was communication.

38
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,330
So this may work as a
simulation, but the real world

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:43,055
system would be communication
between the psychiatrist and

40
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:44,050
the patient.

41
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,990
Along with the psychiatrist with
the person above them.

42
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,830
PROFESSOR: Psychiatrist,
patient, communication?

43
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,080
AUDIENCE: Yes.

44
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,435

45
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:55,890
What do they call them?

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,250
Not the patient.

47
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,130
Patient, psychiatrist?

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,840
AUDIENCE: Orderly?

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,285
AUDIENCE: Nurse?

50
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,070
AUDIENCE: What function
do they have?

51
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,320
AUDIENCE: Give us more
information.

52
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,360

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,820
AUDIENCE: Psychiatrist-Patient
for now that's fine.

54
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,650
PROFESSOR: You know how talking
about psychiatrists

55
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,055
there is patient.

56
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,180
Psychiatrist, resident?

57
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,920
AUDIENCE: Maybe like nurse,
patient, and then nurse

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,420
reporting incidents
to supervisors?

59
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,920
PROFESSOR:Three levels?

60
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,002
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's the one.

61
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:27,210
PROFESSOR: So it would go
supervisor, nurse--

62
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,850
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, guys.

63
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,806
PROFESSOR: --and you
have the patient.

64
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,196
Those kinds of reporting
up and reporting down.

65
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,015
All right, yeah?

66
00:02:35,015 --> 00:02:36,420
AUDIENCE: So I had
a couple ideas.

67
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,040
One of them was, every idea you
have a patient and there's

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,900
two doctors or psychiatrists.

69
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,350
And so one psychiatrist is
trying to calm the patient

70
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,530
while the other is doing the
opposite and trying to make

71
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,620
this patient as angry
as possible.

72
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,280
So the way I was thinking was,
the psychiatrist that's trying

73
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,290
to enrage the patient?

74
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,010
That's training in
what not to say.

75
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,720
While the doctor who is trying
to calm them down is--

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,820
PROFESSOR: So by showing what's
the worst possible way?

77
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,476
OK, I'm going to call that
good cop, bad cop.

78
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,030
AUDIENCE: --Yeah, and then
another idea I had which I

79
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,990
thought of with [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
yesterday was

80
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:26,390
have a team of psychiatrists
working with one patient.

81
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:31,860
But interlaced in one of the
psychiatrists is a saboteur

82
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,820
trying to enrage the
patient as well.

83
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,594
PROFESSOR: And what are the
target audiences going to be

84
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,844
like actual residents.

85
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:43,290

86
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm just going to say a
saboteur in a group of

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,330
psychiatrists.

88
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,600

89
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,277
Because maybe there's an
idea under that dynamic

90
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,470
that we can play with.

91
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,620
OK?

92
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,340
AUDIENCE: OK, so a
few quick things.

93
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,290
One would be, I'm not
exactly sure how

94
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,980
this fits into a game.

95
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,690
But simulating people who are
delusional schizophrenic by

96
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,700
either having every player have
a separate audio track

97
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,250
playing in their ear
as they play?

98
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,339
So there's voices speaking to
them and they have different

99
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,140
audio experiences.

100
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,350
Or having just one speaker that
everyone can hear that's

101
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,175
playing audio.

102
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,250
So incorporating audio into the
experience to simulate in

103
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,640
some way the internal thought
processes and perhaps these

104
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,560
delusional thoughts.

105
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,308
The voice that tells you to go
kill your mother and what not.

106
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:32,220
Which is a documented issue.

107
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,663
PROFESSOR: This particular
game doesn't have to be a

108
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,330
board game, doesn't have to be
a card game, you have a lot

109
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,830
more flexibility in what
you want to do.

110
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,137
I would suggest steering away
from doing anything that

111
00:04:40,137 --> 00:04:41,270
requires digital logic.

112
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,966
But MP3 players would
be perfect.

113
00:04:44,966 --> 00:04:46,820
AUDIENCE: Exactly, something
like that.

114
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,205
So the second thing would be a
board game where you're in

115
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,170
charge of managing a ward.

116
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,280
It's just a logistical game.

117
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,690
Making sure that you don't
leave anyone neglected or

118
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,445
forget anyone.

119
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:01,860
So your patients have their
favorite nurse, and they have

120
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,500
issues that you have to
uncover and deal with.

121
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,670
And if you leave somebody
unattended and someone goes

122
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,510
over they may become violent.

123
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,700
So you've got to try
and make sure.

124
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,483
And then the third idea would be
to have one player play as

125
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:16,620
the patient and to simulate
their inability to communicate

126
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,420
properly for whatever reason.

127
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,803
The information of their
condition is

128
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:21,970
hidden from the player.

129
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,510
And so try to create a game
experience that is genuinely

130
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,940
frustrating because the player
doesn't quite know what's

131
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,530
wrong with them and can't
articulate it properly.

132
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,880
And the other players are in
charge of finding it out.

133
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,990
And putting some kind of
time-constraint things where

134
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,020
it gets heated.

135
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,653
PROFESSOR: There are a bunch
of improv games that are

136
00:05:38,653 --> 00:05:39,380
exactly that.

137
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,230
I have something about me but
can't tell you what it is.

138
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,150
AUDIENCE: But the players know
that it can get really, yeah.

139
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,872
AUDIENCE: That's like the game
where you have, I can't

140
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,530
remember what it's called, but
the one where you have to try

141
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,350
to make the other person
say a word.

142
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,866
But you can't use a certain
series of key words.

143
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:59,290

144
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,700
AUDIENCE: I'm simulating
schizophrenia with audio tape.

145
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,920

146
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,850
Being part of RPG's which
have done that well.

147
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,270
So like live-action role
playing stuff.

148
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,530
Which did it really well.

149
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,510
It actually works.

150
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,350
So I recommend that.

151
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,561
It's been tried in a setting
which I've seen before and

152
00:06:20,561 --> 00:06:21,050
worked really well.

153
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,770
So I think it could work out.

154
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,000
PROFESSOR: You could do a
refinement on that idea.

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,770
AUDIENCE: So I know one of the
main things that he was

156
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,080
talking about was knowing what
to do and just going through

157
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,530
the process of what happens when
somebody does something.

158
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,990
And so that brought to mind
D & D, and how you have to

159
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,840
prepare for the encounter and
then in the encounter you have

160
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,960
certain actions that
you can do.

161
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,290
Calm through speech, calm
through presenting some

162
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,780
object, or some idea
or whatever.

163
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,210
Which I think would map pretty
easily into the D & D space.

164
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,550
And then you could also have
certain abilities which are

165
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,240
natural to your character like
you're very charismatic which

166
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,790
makes some things
easier and such.

167
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:11,542
So simplify D & D to handle
interactions with patients.

168
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:14,080
PROFESSOR: So table-top
RPG style.

169
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,120
And the kind of things you want
to emphasize are things

170
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,950
like preparation and playing
up your actual skills?

171
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,742
AUDIENCE: Right.

172
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,218
PROFESSOR: Things that
you're good at.

173
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:27,646

174
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,896
So natural skills
and preparation.

175
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:34,050

176
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,610
AUDIENCE: So I had an idea for
a game that could potentially

177
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,550
be a card game.

178
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,520
Where the player who's playing
as the patient and the player

179
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,310
who's playing as the doctor
are operating

180
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,750
under different rules.

181
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,240
And one of the main points of
the game is they're not

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,150
actually aware of the other
player's rules.

183
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,450
So, for instance the patient
could have certain goals which

184
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,000
he is trying to achieve.

185
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,020
But he is unaware which of
these goals is completely

186
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,780
unreasonable to the doctor.

187
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,220
And the doctor has certain
actions he can take and is

188
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,530
unaware which of these
are going to be

189
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,150
threatening to the patient.

190
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,970
And so, then there could be an
instance where the patient

191
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,330
actually believes the only way
he is capable of winning the

192
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,000
game is by using violence.

193
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,184
And so that could be one
of the end conditions.

194
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,627
PROFESSOR: So, sure.

195
00:08:15,627 --> 00:08:19,480
And you have to deduce
that out?

196
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,020
Moving on to Michelle?

197
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,890
AUDIENCE: I like the idea that
a psychiatrist has to really

198
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,170
keep their composure when
dealing with a violent person.

199
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,050
They can't raise their voice.

200
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,200
They have to keep at
a certain distance.

201
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,740
And they can't seem upset
for whatever reason.

202
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,230
Sort of a party game idea, you
could have two people.

203
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,570
Basically, one person would
just have to be throwing

204
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,576
insults at the other person.

205
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,659
And the person who's receiving
the insults would just have to

206
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,800
stay calm the whole time and
continue to talking.

207
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,370
Which is really hard to do even
if you know it's coming.

208
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,320
PROFESSOR: So keep your cool.

209
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,050
I mean, that could be a game
where you're literally

210
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,210
insulting someone or it could
be a thing where you're

211
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,630
playing a character with a
certain amount of composure

212
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,045
points or something and you're
planning actions and

213
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,812
maintaining notes.

214
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:06,800
And different tactics to be
able to increase those or

215
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,650
decrease those.

216
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,610
AUDIENCE: A co-op type of game
where you are a bunch of

217
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,830
nurses trying to take
care of the ward.

218
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,950
This is a lot like Jeremy's
Diner Dash style game.

219
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,370
Except, you have a limitation
to how you can

220
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,190
actually do it once.

221
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,865
So you will be forced to
neglect one often.

222
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:24,150
PROFESSOR: A patient, one?

223
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,400
Neglect one patient?

224
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,430

225
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,900
AUDIENCE: So nurses
will get sick and

226
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,150
they'll have to leave.

227
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,470

228
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,455
PROFESSOR: So, rather you
have limited resources.

229
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,365
Not quite nearly enough to deal
with every single crisis

230
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,800
that's going to happen.

231
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,570
AUDIENCE: So the one thing I
found interesting in reading

232
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,580
this stuff is statistically the
amount of violence that

233
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,996
happens with mental patients is
not actually that different

234
00:09:54,996 --> 00:09:56,324
from the amount of violence that
happens in the general

235
00:09:56,324 --> 00:09:57,190
population.

236
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,220
And it talks about how people
going through this, and

237
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,210
deciding to go into the
profession, might actually

238
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,640
second guess themselves
because they have this

239
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,095
perception of there's
more violence.

240
00:10:05,095 --> 00:10:08,365
So I think incorporating
something where you have life

241
00:10:08,365 --> 00:10:13,050
in the ward and life
outside of it.

242
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,670
So you incorporate both the
things where you're trying to

243
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,700
deal with patients but you're
also reinforcing this idea

244
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:23,200
that it's not significantly
more dangerous

245
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,680
than real life is.

246
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
AUDIENCE: None of your patients
stab you but you get

247
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,610
mugged on the way home.

248
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, something
like that.

249
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,140
It's just life.

250
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,100

251
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,950
PROFESSOR: One thing that could
be really attractive is

252
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,060
that now broadens your audience
to people who aren't

253
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,670
just psychiatric residents.

254
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,230

255
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,230
AUDIENCE: So, I like the idea
of the patient and doctor

256
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,590
having different roles, rules,
goals, views, et cetera.

257
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,740
But I also like the idea of
incorporating an escalation

258
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,330
and de-escalation into
the conflict

259
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,850
between the two of them.

260
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,160
So I feel like part of the
thing which was really

261
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,280
compelling about the
role-playing scenario which

262
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,250
they showed was there was then
sense in which the doctor can

263
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,054
say things which can escalate or
de-escalate the situation.

264
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:20,750
Make it more or less likely that
things will go a bad way.

265
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,577
And one way which that could
be done partially through

266
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:29,620
roles would be to have hidden
keywords which the patient

267
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,468
responds to or what have you
and that moves them into a

268
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:32,800
different state.

269
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,726
And then transitioning between
these two states changes the

270
00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:41,780
goals which the patient has so
maybe the intent on trying to

271
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,480
get Nurse-- what was
the nurse's name?

272
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,810
Dave?

273
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:44,210
AUDIENCE: John.

274
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,000
AUDIENCE: Nurse John.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
But as they get de-escalated
then they just want to change

276
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,210
their meds.

277
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:54,410
But then as they get
de-escalated from that then

278
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,010
they just want to
go run back out.

279
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:00,139
PROFESSOR: Just coming up with
the rules that model what an

280
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:05,290
unreasonable patient would
do or what are you

281
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,500
willing to give up.

282
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,144
And actually putting somebody
in the shoes of that, is

283
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:11,675
essentially something
to think about what

284
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:14,710
I can do as a doctor.

285
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,542
AUDIENCE: So, there was this
guy we used to play in my

286
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,700
family where you're given a
scenario and certain number of

287
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,830
words you can't use.

288
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,140
Essentially, you choose random
words and you have a scenario.

289
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,350
Basically what you were saying
where certain keywords do

290
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:30,950
certain things.

291
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,840
But you have to somehow create
the best story or the best

292
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,520
calm-down passage to read
to the patient.

293
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,220
And then there's some
arbitrator, the GM of the

294
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,640
game, that decides which of
the three people that were

295
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,400
playing which one had the
best story out of those.

296
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,280
To get you to have to come up
with something to deal with,

297
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,532
You need Nurse John
right away.

298
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,640

299
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,480
PROFESSOR: You could do a thing
where you had to create

300
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,995
a story about a random
explanation

301
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,960
of elements or cards.

302
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,984
But then some number of those
cards, specifically the other

303
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,418
player or maybe the game of
other players specifically

304
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:17,852
just saying.

305
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:20,720
Those internally are supposed
to be our keywords.

306
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,452
And there's some 20 questions
type of way to try and figure

307
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:27,350
out what those cards are.

308
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,710
So that would be like a doctor
trying to figure out what

309
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,454
they're dealing with while
they're [INAUDIBLE].

310
00:13:34,454 --> 00:13:37,298

311
00:13:37,298 --> 00:13:39,668
AUDIENCE: You can make that
game like Guess Who.

312
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:43,420
Where each person draws a card
and you have to give a

313
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,108
statement to the other person
or ask them something.

314
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:49,814
And then you see whether they
escalate or de-escalate and

315
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,520
each individual card
has a trade story.

316
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,012
If you talk about
this that's bad.

317
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:53,504
If you talk about this
that's good.

318
00:13:53,504 --> 00:13:56,456
PROFESSOR: I'm not familiar
with Guess Who.

319
00:13:56,456 --> 00:13:58,178
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's
not really that

320
00:13:58,178 --> 00:14:01,870
much like Guess Who.

321
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,470
AUDIENCE: 20 questions?

322
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,650
AUDIENCE: What I can think of
is everyone just has a whole

323
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:09,670
bunch of character cards and
each of them have traits.

324
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,695
Like, watch this.

325
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:14,074
If you you say this
they'll get upset.

326
00:14:14,074 --> 00:14:16,504
If you say this, it's not
very fully fleshed out.

327
00:14:16,504 --> 00:14:17,962
But everyone just randomly
draws traits.

328
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,392
And you just take turns speaking
to each other.

329
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,910
And then the patients
either will

330
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,980
respond or get more angry.

331
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:29,130
PROFESSOR: So it's almost like
your role is a collection of

332
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:36,265
randomized traits or randomized
behavioral rules.

333
00:14:36,265 --> 00:14:39,488

334
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:45,832
So, rules determined by
randomized rules.

335
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:48,760

336
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,548
For those people in the
Assassin's Guild, or are

337
00:14:50,548 --> 00:14:55,592
familiar with the Assassin's
Guild, there's the concept of

338
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:56,630
assignments.

339
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:05,055
Things that you as an individual
player are given at

340
00:15:05,055 --> 00:15:06,892
the beginning of the game as
things that you can do and

341
00:15:06,892 --> 00:15:07,750
have to do.

342
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,220
Or if you do something you
have to do it in these

343
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,210
specific conditions.

344
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,150
Psychological limitations
is what they're called.

345
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,488
It could be something as simple
as you have to speak in

346
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,771
an accent all the time
or you have to limp.

347
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,390
It could be something more like
every time you see blood

348
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:24,655
you have to run away because
there's a [INAUDIBLE].

349
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,317
It might be interesting to think
of a collection of those

350
00:15:26,317 --> 00:15:30,370
things and that crafts
how we play.

351
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,340
So this makes me think I
should probably do the

352
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,264
live-action class at some point
and talk about party

353
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:39,722
games and role-playing games.

354
00:15:39,722 --> 00:15:40,710
I think you had your hands up?

355
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,668
AUDIENCE: No, my hands
are in my pocket.

356
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,850
PROFESSOR: Your hands are
just up, correct?

357
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,697
AUDIENCE: Another thing that
psychiatrists do when they're

358
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,370
talking to a patient is to try
and get the story out of them

359
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,650
as to why they're upset.

360
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,840
So you could have a game where
the patient has some set of

361
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,965
cards that has some set of story
with some keywords and

362
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:07,145
the doctor has to try and get
these words out of him.

363
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:11,520
But the patient, himself,
doesn't fully know his story

364
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,720
so it keeps on changing.

365
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,910
You can keep modifying your
story as you go by drawing

366
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,620
cards and putting them away.

367
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,720
And you can only really get the
full picture once you get

368
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,950
all the cards from the
patient that you can.

369
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,500
PROFESSOR: So, does the patient
have all the cards?

370
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,930
AUDIENCE: The patient
has his full story

371
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:28,180
but it keeps changing.

372
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,820

373
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:38,110
PROFESSOR: So, ever-changing
story and you want to stay on

374
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,516
top of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

375
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:41,981
AUDIENCE: Yes.

376
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:43,953
AUDIENCE: This isn't really
a fleshed out idea.

377
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:46,270
But as a mechanic?

378
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:49,270
Say there's a doctor and
a patient and the only

379
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,810
communication is
through cards.

380
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,245
So the doctor will give the
patient two cards, and then

381
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:57,906
the third card is randomly
inserted off of a deck and

382
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:58,490
shuffled in.

383
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,090
The patient receives
all three.

384
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,790
So the patient might
be schizophrenic

385
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,340
and imagining things.

386
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,255
And they get what the doctor
is saying but they also get

387
00:17:06,255 --> 00:17:08,700
other random things as points.

388
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,071
PROFESSOR: So as a mechanic
that would be--

389
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:15,321
man, that's hard to describe.

390
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,589

391
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,890
The idea that you will be adding
the randomized element.

392
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,290
AUDIENCE: So you get information
that is both what

393
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,460
the other person played, and
something random, and you

394
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,710
can't distinguish
which is which.

395
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:28,050

396
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,296
AUDIENCE: You have a
communication channel and

397
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,490
you're adding random noise.

398
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

399
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,410
Is that a question
[INAUDIBLE]?

400
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:43,000

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,396
I am running out of space,
so that's a good thing.

402
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,229

403
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,708
Any other ideas?

404
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,958
That's creepy.

405
00:17:52,958 --> 00:18:01,648

406
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:02,898
Anyone else?

407
00:18:02,898 --> 00:18:06,618

408
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,612
AUDIENCE: One concept I thought
was interesting,

409
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:09,290
though I'm not really sure how
to turn it into a game

410
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:15,490
immediately, is the idea of the
patient and specifically

411
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,870
the doctor or the rest of the
world having at the moment

412
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,970
irreconcilable narratives.

413
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,670
And the goal of bringing those
into some type of medium in

414
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,326
which the patient can
comfortably exist with this

415
00:18:31,326 --> 00:18:35,720
narrative that's in line with
the rest of the world.

416
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,950
PROFESSOR: So the idea, again,
of narrative disruption is why

417
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,430
people get violent in
the first place.

418
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:48,560
So maybe even taking out the
question entirely of is this

419
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,010
person going to act violently,
but can you even work together

420
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,886
with somebody to change how they
see the world until it

421
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:59,750
makes sense on both sides.

422
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,548
AUDIENCE: So with that,
something I can't actually

423
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:07,716
think of a game for it right
now, be something like you

424
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:13,766
have the patient and doctor.

425
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:16,742
One person trying to figure
out the other person, the

426
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:17,900
other person trying to
trigger the other.

427
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,730
But there's something in the
middle that's changing

428
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,050
everything.

429
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,292
So it's just trying to reconcile
the difference.

430
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:26,964
Figuring out the connection and

431
00:19:26,964 --> 00:19:28,540
communication between the two.

432
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,010
PROFESSOR: So you have a
situation where you actually

433
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,490
have three people playing.

434
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,671
And there's one person who's
changing information on some

435
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:40,270
predictable or unpredictable
way.

436
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,850
AUDIENCE: Maybe they have their
own objective in mind.

437
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,590

438
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,620
The two people on the ends are
trying to figure out what the

439
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,712
other one's saying and then one
person in the middle has

440
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:56,710
their own agenda, representing
schizophrenia.

441
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,260
PROFESSOR: So there's a noisy
communication channel with an

442
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,510
agenda --I like that.

443
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,590

444
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,206
That could be an algorithm or
that could be a person.

445
00:20:11,206 --> 00:20:13,520
It could be a person running
an algorithm in their head.

446
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,856
AUDIENCE: I mean the noisy
communication channel, or the

447
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:19,606
actual state of mind of
the patient, that

448
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:22,036
is the point right?

449
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:25,540
And then depending on their
level of arousal, that could

450
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,750
change how everything
gets screened

451
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,660
into being very combative.

452
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,682
And so everything the doctor
says is taken as being.

453
00:20:37,682 --> 00:20:41,070

454
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,593
PROFESSOR: Some sort of parable
that's actually going

455
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:47,200
to affect how they were
able to [INAUDIBLE].

456
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,116

457
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:52,730
OK.

458
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,352
AUDIENCE: This would probably
only work once, the first time

459
00:20:54,352 --> 00:20:57,800
you play through, but again
you've concealed from the

460
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,510
players, or certain players,
themselves

461
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,660
what their goals are.

462
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,760
Or what they believe think
about the game.

463
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,080
Say, it is in fact a delusion
or not true.

464
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,050
So you might tell them that it's
about a game set in 2100

465
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,180
when you've been wrongly
imprisoned in a psychiatric

466
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,210
ward and you must fight
your way out or

467
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,270
something like that.

468
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,440
And there's a voice that will
guide you, or whatever.

469
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,880
And then you don't tell that
player that they're in fact

470
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,660
playing a schizophrenic player
who will [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

471
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,080
these things.

472
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,629
And then you use some sort of
live-action role playing or

473
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:36,310
not, I'm not exactly sure, but
this other guy is convinced

474
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,995
that this is what the
game is about.

475
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,610
PROFESSOR: I could write
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

476
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,410
rivals scenario.

477
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:46,364
The player's don't know that
going in, but folks have seen

478
00:21:46,364 --> 00:21:49,352
the film The Cabinet
of Dr. Caligari.

479
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:51,620
It's an old German expressionist
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

480
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,290
film.

481
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,476
I could spoil it?

482
00:21:54,476 --> 00:21:56,221
Does anyone care?

483
00:21:56,221 --> 00:21:59,960
It's an old 1920s.

484
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,020
AUDIENCE: I think you're fine.

485
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,160
PROFESSOR: But the basic idea
comes down to the hero of the

486
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,450
horror story is actually
just a patient in

487
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,700
a psychiatric ward.

488
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,930

489
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:18,310
And everybody who he believes
is part of the story he's

490
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,720
conquering is somebody else
in the psychiatric ward.

491
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,800
The big villain is actually the
person running the ward.

492
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,730
AUDIENCE: That's like
Shutter Island.

493
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
like Shutter Island

494
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,050
PROFESSOR: Not entirely unlike
a lot of different stories.

495
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:37,080
But similar idea of the
information being given is not

496
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,740
to be trusted.

497
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,490
AUDIENCE: Something to go
along like that, a game

498
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,420
mechanic for that would be
everyone's assigned a

499
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,230
different role.

500
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,820
And one of those roles
is patient.

501
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,820
So you don't know if you're
the patient or not.

502
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,845
And so in time as you do your
objectives, and as you play

503
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:56,200
along you may start to
realize things aren't

504
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,515
actually as they seem.

505
00:22:58,515 --> 00:22:59,556
So eventually you may
figure out I'm

506
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:00,830
actually the patient here.

507
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,120
PROFESSOR: Right, almost
like primeval

508
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,500
authority in that sense.

509
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,620
AUDIENCE: Going along with that,
I think an interesting

510
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:13,260
mechanic would be like the
Battlestar Gallactica.

511
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,710
The person knows that they're
a Cylon but they can

512
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:18,330
infiltrate by doing that voting
system at the end.

513
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,282
What is that?

514
00:23:20,282 --> 00:23:21,750
The [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

515
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,141
So you know that someone's
trying to sabotage you but you

516
00:23:25,141 --> 00:23:26,391
don't know who.

517
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:30,470

518
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,580
PROFESSOR: So that's who's
the patient from a

519
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,310
different way, right?

520
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:39,040
One is, player knows who--

521
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,272
at least one person knows and
the other one is trying to

522
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:44,445
figure out whether
they are it.

523
00:23:44,445 --> 00:23:47,270

524
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,520
[INAUDIBLE].

525
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,222

526
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:55,035
AUDIENCE: This is just an
interesting mechanic.

527
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:58,390
There was this RPG called,
Great [INAUDIBLE]

528
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,760
Game that had this really
interesting mechanic for

529
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,830
handling the dark side
that each player had.

530
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,150
Which might be relevant
in this situation.

531
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,560
Essentially you had a different
person who's also

532
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,440
playing another protagonist
also play your antagonist.

533
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,740
And so, they would either talk
to you and tell you things or

534
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,485
they would just directly control
your character like if

535
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:23,070
you fail at the composure
role.

536
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,850
And taking the adversarial side
of your character away

537
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:33,060
from your control, it means that
your character is more

538
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,220
likely to behave in a really
disruptive way.

539
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,080
Rather than just a controllably
disruptive way

540
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,870
would be if you had a vested
interest in your character.

541
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:46,430
PROFESSOR: So, open end case
control of your character.

542
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,606
And that might work really well
with some of the ideas of

543
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:51,534
the good cop bad cop idea that
someone thought of already.

544
00:24:51,534 --> 00:25:02,270

545
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:07,120
AUDIENCE: So, actually going
off of the audio idea of

546
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,115
someone is actually
hearing voices?

547
00:25:11,115 --> 00:25:12,930
If it was the patient thing.

548
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,290
You could actually have things
where you have one player is

549
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,240
actually playing a patient who
is schizophrenic and another

550
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,750
player is playing the
voices in his head.

551
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:24,140
But they don't really
know that.

552
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,560
They are playing the scenario
where they have some delusion

553
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,310
that they're trapped
in whatever.

554
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:33,680

555
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,460
So having a person actually
being the--

556
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,830
as you're saying-- having an
actual person be the dark side

557
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,340
of the patient.

558
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,422

559
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:49,700
PROFESSOR: But neither of them
know who's the dark side?

560
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,300
AUDIENCE: The patient, yeah,
you could have it.

561
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,310
AUDIENCE: One way you could
arbitrate it is you could say,

562
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:57,560
the patient player is
just basically able

563
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,510
to do as they please.

564
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,920
But there are rules which govern
whether the dark side

565
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,170
character can take over.

566
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,740

567
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,540
And that means that the patient
is genuinely driven by

568
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,150
trying to reach a compromise but
they can just be overruled

569
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:15,770
by the dark side.

570
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,750
AUDIENCE: There could also be
things where it could be more

571
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,080
like a strong role-playing
thing?

572
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,400
Where the voice is actually just
trying to convince them

573
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
that yes, this delusion
is real.

574
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
PROFESSOR: So, do you
still think you

575
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,495
have a recorded thing?

576
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:29,320
Or two different?

577
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,480
AUDIENCE: You could actually
have two people just actually

578
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,850
standing there talking.

579
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,640
PROFESSOR: So two people playing
one character at once.

580
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,140
AUDIENCE: It would potentially
require a lot of suspension of

581
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,500
disbelief on the part of
the person playing the

582
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:41,870
psychiatrist.

583
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,940
PROFESSOR: It might be one of
those things that's easier to

584
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:50,336
mediate by having people
talk on screen or

585
00:26:50,336 --> 00:26:53,312
something like that?

586
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,296
Or a microphone in a
speaker type thing?

587
00:26:55,296 --> 00:26:56,546
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

588
00:26:56,546 --> 00:26:59,760

589
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,496
I've not seen many games that
are designed specifically to

590
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:03,460
be played on the [INAUDIBLE]

591
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,960
function.

592
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,466
AUDIENCE: I definitely like
that idea, and I think it

593
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,760
could work well in a
card game as well.

594
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,340
If you have two players sharing
the same hand, and the

595
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,950
player who actually gets to play
the cards from the hand

596
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,610
is whoever's in control
of the patient.

597
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,580
And so the state basically
changes depending on what the

598
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,690
doctor does.

599
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,110
Different players come in
control of the patient's hand.

600
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,300
PROFESSOR: So it seems like
we actually have a lot of

601
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,740
different options on how we
could mechanic someone who's

602
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,990
going to be unstable.

603
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,680

604
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,237
And also, a bunch of ideas on
how that state switch could

605
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:42,950
happen or what makes
it take over.

606
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,270
So that's pretty cool.

607
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,170
And that's not mutually
exclusive from any other ideas

608
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:49,930
that are specifically
about the patient

609
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,430
and the doctor, right?

610
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:55,570
So we're talking about what
happens to the patient.

611
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,610
These are the rules a patient
could be operating under.

612
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,176
The doctor could have a
different set of rules.

613
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,860

614
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,286
AUDIENCE: I was reading about
this, and I think that it

615
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:09,970
turns out most violence in
psychiatric wards happens to

616
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,130
the patients themselves or to
other patients by patients.

617
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:18,270
Much more than it actually
happens towards practitioners.

618
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,780
And I'm just noticing that I
don't think any of our ideas

619
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,560
address any of those issues.

620
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,570
PROFESSOR: Ward management maybe
gets a little closer.

621
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:31,410
AUDIENCE: People start turning
on themselves.

622
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,160
And I was just thinking another
possible way you could

623
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,230
apply a lot of these
role-playing multiple role

624
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,310
auditory mechanics is
to a situation.

625
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,490
We should probably do research
in what situations lead to

626
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,025
patients coming in contact
with each other and the

627
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:49,980
encounter turning violent.

628
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,940
And all players be patients that
have various different

629
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,140
mental disorders, and just to
help you understand as a

630
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,840
patient what kinds of behaviors
and situations would

631
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,450
lead you to going violent
on someone else.

632
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,870
Just like one of those, be in
someone else's shoes helps you

633
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,300
understand the situation
better.

634
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,520
PROFESSOR: So we're just putting
them in an environment

635
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,857
where everything that is
necessary for a different

636
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:21,828
character to become upset and
violent and just see how it

637
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:22,784
naturally occurs.

638
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:24,034
[INAUDIBLE].

639
00:29:24,034 --> 00:29:26,620

640
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,990
OK.

641
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,500
AUDIENCE: They gave a persuasion
that's a cross

642
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
between BS and Uno.

643
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,280
So you have two doctors who are
trying to get rid of cards

644
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,560
in their hand, and the patient
wants a certain set of cards.

645
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,985
And he's saying, I'm
looking for John.

646
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:45,182
And the two doctors pull out a
hard and say, oh this is John.

647
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:46,829
Or they can be like, oh this
isn't John but I can

648
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,079
help you out later.

649
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,520

650
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,496
PROFESSOR: That almost seems
like it's intended to teach

651
00:29:54,496 --> 00:29:55,490
people about lying.

652
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,981
AUDIENCE: Yes.

653
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:02,448
PROFESSOR: So, I'm going
to say it's almost

654
00:30:02,448 --> 00:30:04,436
like BS and Go Fish.

655
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:17,358

656
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:20,360
So we have a pretty
good pile here.

657
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,860
A lot of these can obviously
be combined.

658
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,890
And there's no reason why
multiple groups couldn't

659
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,940
attempt to do similar topics.

660
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,295
In fact, you could take exactly
the same set and I'm

661
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:36,760
pretty sure you're going
to [INAUDIBLE].

662
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,346
So that's fine.

663
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:42,420
Again, a lot of things that
could probably be easier done

664
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,200
live-action.

665
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,280
Or easier to do a prototype
live-action.

666
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:53,020
The folks who were here on
Monday, they are actually

667
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,912
focused mostly on trying to see
what could be moved out to

668
00:30:58,912 --> 00:31:03,180
more resonant things
in the future.

669
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,785
Your games don't necessarily
need to do that.

670
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:08,910
But you might want to
keep that in mind.

671
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,834
Because this assignment is a
game for a client after all.

672
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:15,750
And if you manage to
address that need--

673
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,880
here's something that doesn't
require one person from the

674
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,477
original GM team.

675
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:24,149

676
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:28,620
You can imagine the acting
exercise that we ran through,

677
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,930
beyond talented improvising
on their feet.

678
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,280

679
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:40,456
Requires people and requires
responses that may not

680
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:44,963
necessarily every gaming
environment's going to have.

681
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:48,330
Something that can be turned
into a very understandable set

682
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,974
of rules or using technologies
that are very accessible.

683
00:31:52,974 --> 00:31:56,132
They're going to play your voice
and its going to be a

684
00:31:56,132 --> 00:32:00,102
lot easier than something like
formulas or something like a

685
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:04,638
phone as opposed
to [INAUDIBLE].

686
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,730
AUDIENCE: It was a phone
conversation actually going?

687
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,244
So if it's live, and people are
in different rooms, and

688
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,584
actually talking to each other
over the phone or Skype or

689
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:13,172
something like that.

690
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:14,980
But you're talking to someone?

691
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,159
You have the phone-ups and then
that other person can

692
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,270
hear what you're saying
and be the evil voice?

693
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,870

694
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,229
PROFESSOR: That's the thing,
you don't even

695
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:23,850
need to do it on Skype.

696
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:26,830
You just get two cell phones
with [INTERPOSING VOICES]

697
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,520

698
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,140
Now, the technology just becomes
that much easier for

699
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,390
games [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

700
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:39,960

701
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,320
AUDIENCE: Or you could make it
like if there's some game that

702
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,100
two people are playing.

703
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,120
The two groups that are playing
the same game but they

704
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,530
both hear the other group.

705
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,230
Like this group would
hear the other

706
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,970
group's playing the game.

707
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,725
So it's not even just a
random conversation.

708
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,048
They're playing the same game
you're playing but you're

709
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:56,950
hearing them play games.

710
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,390
PROFESSOR: Wow.

711
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,845
Wow.

712
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:01,611
AUDIENCE: That's deep.

713
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:06,030
PROFESSOR: I could
say two groups

714
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,280
eavesdropping same game.

715
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,940

716
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,562
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to say
that I think the thing which

717
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:19,496
is really hard if you're working
with people who like

718
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:23,384
don't really want to do a
role-playing thing is building

719
00:33:23,384 --> 00:33:28,990
a level of emotional intensity
and the fear of violence.

720
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,194
Which is the point
of the training.

721
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:34,330
They want them to be able to
deal with that kind of

722
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,520
emotional stress on your feet.

723
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,620
So I was just wondering.

724
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,460
Because I don't have
any good ideas.

725
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,554
Can anyone think of something
which works out?

726
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,891
AUDIENCE: Which could genuinely
create a situation

727
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:48,186
where one could be afraid
of violence?

728
00:33:48,186 --> 00:33:51,138
AUDIENCE: Without actually
having to

729
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:53,620
threaten another person.

730
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:56,260
AUDIENCE: I don't think you're
going to be able to do that.

731
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,750
AUDIENCE: Well, if one player's
role is actually not

732
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,160
to understand but to provide the
experience for the other?

733
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,090
And they are hearing the
recording that's giving them

734
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,250
cues as to what to do?

735
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,679
And the other player's not
agreed to this, and one of

736
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,952
their cues is like and now, grab
the other player by the

737
00:34:17,952 --> 00:34:20,949
shoulders and shake them
violently and say something.

738
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:23,575
You could possibly create
a situation where

739
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:26,284
you're like, whoa.

740
00:34:26,284 --> 00:34:27,449
AUDIENCE: The problem is you
have to be able to get

741
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,097
somebody who can do that without
cracking up in the

742
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:30,639
middle of it.

743
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,790
Because people do that when
they're nervous and

744
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,710
uncomfortable.

745
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,170
So you'd pretty much be
reduced to finding

00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,060

you have a patient to

patient interaction.

753
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,521
So you have two people in
different rooms on the phone

with each other trying to
negotiate something.

755
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,264
I don't know what it would be.

756
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:04,228
AUDIENCE: And some other people
in each of their rooms

757
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,192
that are talking in their ear
and trying to distract them

758
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,180
from the conversation.

759
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:13,120
PROFESSOR: OK, so patient
talks to patient.

760
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,096
AUDIENCE: Maybe it could be
something like they're trying

765
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,258
There is a specific article on
schizophrenia that I uploaded

Patrick first, then Michelle?

770
00:35:43,972 --> 00:35:46,200
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
something along the lines of

771
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,540
Battleship?

772
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,445
If you have a doctor player
and a patient player and

773
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:53,860
they're both looking at their
own version of the same board.

774
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:58,640
And if the patient wants to get
from one end to the other

775
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,245
and the doctor has to allow
whether or not they can make

776
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:01,920
their move.

777
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,970
But on the doctor's board they
have different obstacles.

778
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:07,306
And so the patient will
say, I want to move

779
00:36:07,306 --> 00:36:07,540
from here to here.

780
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,300
And the doctor says, I can't
let you do that.

781
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,490
I can let you go from
here to here.

782
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,590
It'd be a game about
compromise.

783
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:19,306
PROFESSOR: OK, so sort
of a doctor mediated

00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:27,810

786
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,003
And the Battleship analogy is
good to help us remember where

787
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,220
the idea came from.

788
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,170
Michelle?

789
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so just
something that Owen said about

790
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,890
trying to simulate fear.

791
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,060
I mean, if you can add time
pressure to any game then I

792
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,615
think that strong of a stress
situation can almost be fear.

793
00:36:48,615 --> 00:36:49,895
It can get [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

794
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:54,363

really going for is stress in

AUDIENCE: So, an idea of how
to take the doctor mediated

800
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,250
board movement into
the real world?

801
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:13,900
We're talking about these phone
to phone conversations.

802
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:19,340
You could have the patient in
a room but he's blindfolded.

803
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,210
And he's trying to move through
the room towards an

804
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,320
exit in the room or something.

805
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,920
And the doctor has some limited
information about the

806
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,700
room and has to help him
navigate through the room.

807
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,740
And he'll say, I want
to move forward.

808
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,460
And he'll say, well I can't
really let you do that because

809
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,910
there's a pit fill of spikes
in front of you.

810
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,740
And you wouldn't necessarily
actually have a real pit full

811
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,160
of spikes in front of them.

812
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,020
But that kind of thing where
you're trying to gather

00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,690
information and help
them through this.

814
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,540
And you could put time pressure
on it and say, well I

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,205
have to make a decision now
because he wants to move now.

816
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,165
But I might accidentally move
him into an obstacle and have

817
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:59,750
to deal with that.

818
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,030
PROFESSOR: You could have a
thing where there are some

819
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:09,060
things that the patient needs
to do that the patient can't

820
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,407
talk about.

821
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:15,074
And it might be something like
the patient has to move every

822
00:38:15,074 --> 00:38:15,808
10 minutes.

823
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,297
And only the patient
knows this.

824
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:17,770
The doctor doesn't.

825
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,710
AUDIENCE: The patient has a fear
of moving to the left.

826
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,315

like that.

PROFESSOR: Patient has
to move left, right.

829
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,820
AUDIENCE: I think it also
emphasizes the thing they were

830
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,850
talking about on Monday
in that you are

831
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,370
both trying to not--

832
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,840
if it escalates to the point
where violence happens--

833
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,270
you're both trying to not let
yourself get hurt but you're

834
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,790
also trying to not hurt them.

835
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:43,810
And I think incorporating that
in some way might be cool.

836
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,290
PROFESSOR: Definitely a lot
of these ideas are sort of

837
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:51,010
mechanicing the patient's
limitations are really,

838
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,250
really, cool.

839
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,700
But again, remember the audience
is the residents.

840
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,910
So understanding what
a patient is

841
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,168
going through is useful.

842
00:39:00,168 --> 00:39:04,309
But also thinking of rules
that help a resident

843
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:07,385
understand what they can do
is also really important.

844
00:39:07,385 --> 00:39:09,114
So don't just think about
throwing a ton of limitations

845
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,986
on them without also given
them a release.

846
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:14,922
Things that they can
actively do.

847
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:16,858
Words that they can carry out.

848
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:20,488
AUDIENCE: So, working off the
time pressure thing, I think

849
00:39:20,488 --> 00:39:23,700
that it might make sense for
these kinds of escalation,

850
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:28,470
negotiation type, situations
for the person who's

851
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,600
controlling the patient to know
what their triggers are.

852
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,390
And every time a bad thing is
said, they just reduce the

853
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,555
amount of time that the doctor
has to deal with them.

854
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:45,400
And they say that, they just
say minus 10 seconds.

855
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,015
And they have a timer and it
ticks down to reach the

856
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,600
conclusion of the doctor getting
them to where they

857
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,166
want to be.

858
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:56,060
And rather than like raising
their voice, or being

859
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,229
physically in some way, they
just adjust a timer.

860
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:03,652
And when it gets down
to zero it's over.

861
00:40:03,652 --> 00:40:05,608

864
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,720
AUDIENCE: I'd just like to say,
one way you could make

865
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,860
your players feel pressure is
to give them a really flat

866
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,870
goal hierarchy.

867
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:21,160
Right?

868
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,250
So a good example is
Missile Command.

869
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,930
Does everyone know that game?

870
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,440
Missile Command is
just six cities.

871
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,020
And there's missiles coming
in and you have to

872
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,930
shoot them all down.

873
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,460
And each city is equally
valuable.

874
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,920
So if you lose one you're in a
drastically reduced position.

875
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,870
Whereas games that tend to have
a more structured goal

876
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,570
hierarchy basically means
you can afford a loss.

877
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:44,900
Right?

878
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,440
So like chess is
a good example.

879
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,450
Where you can say, OK I can
afford to lose this.

880
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:51,720
Whereas in Missile Command you
can't afford to lose anything.

881
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,832
So by really capping what the
player has, what they can

882
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:00,340
afford to lose, and then making
sure that all of their

883
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,260
goals have equal value, that
means that every loss and

884
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,400
every failure is felt
much more strongly.

885
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,250
And I felt like, Dion when you
were doing your role play,

886
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,932
there was this sense, especially
coming from Caesar,

887
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:19,010
that any one thing that goes
wrong is really bad.

888
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,260
There's a really thin
line there.

889
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,150
PROFESSOR: That's especially
applicable when talking about

890
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,020
the doctor's goals,
not necessarily

891
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,430
the patient's goals.

892
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:28,820
AUDIENCE: I mean, from the
doctors' position right?

893
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,711
You can't really afford a
lot of mistakes in these

894
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:32,961
situations.

895
00:41:32,961 --> 00:41:37,612

896
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:40,738
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of aghast,
but I was listening to what

897
00:41:40,738 --> 00:41:45,700
you were saying and I have a
thought on how to combine lots

898
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,895
of these different ideas.

899
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm envisioning a game where
there'd be two types of

900
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,320
players, like you were

901
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,680
mentioning, doctors and patients.

902
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,180
And there'd be one doctor
and multiple patients.

903
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,950
It would be a turn based game
where you go around and give

904
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:01,950
each person a turn.

905
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:04,500
The doctor would always be
in relationship to each

906
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,210
individual one.

907
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,100
And limited vocabulary I thought
was important, taking

908
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,660
that from a couple
of the ideas.

909
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,950
The patient and the doctor each
have their own set of

910
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,970
vocabularies and the
clash of that would

911
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,380
introduce mechanic there.

912
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,375
Where the patient has their own
vocabulary describing to

913
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:28,030
the doctor what they like,
what they don't like.

914
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,240
They know what they like.

915
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:37,510
You could extract it to describe
anything the doctor

916
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,090
would have in their
vocabulary.

917
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:43,072
So, as one example the doctor
could give the patient a card

918
00:42:43,072 --> 00:42:45,530
with a shape or some
item on it.

919
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,920
And the item has attributes like
color, shape, something

920
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,190
that somebody could
like or dislike.

921
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:56,820
In their list they could look
at this and see one of these

922
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,450
things clashes with something
in my list of dislikes.

923
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:01,460
I don't like that card.

924
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,760
I'm going to escalate my anger,
my displeasure, with

925
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,170
the situation.

926
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,480
And so, the doctor has a limited
amount of time to deal

927
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,270
with each patient.

928
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:16,800
As the patient's escalation
increases, they have less and

929
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,250
less time to be dealt with.

930
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:21,460
After a certain point the doctor
loses that patient, so

931
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:24,300
you have that loss brought in.

932
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,860
And then after all the patients
have been lost the

933
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,050
game is over.

934
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,050
The way that it would be won
is that the doctor is

935
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,180
discovering the profile
of each patient.

936
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,043
Because they are trying to, like
in a normal setting or a

937
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:42,150
real world setting, you're
trying to discover the profile

938
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,620
that allows the doctor to deal
with the patient in the best

939
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,140
possible way so that they
aren't violent.

940
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:53,600

941
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:57,623
PROFESSOR: So that seems to
play off the patient and

942
00:43:57,623 --> 00:44:01,487
doctor have different
rules and triggers.

943
00:44:01,487 --> 00:44:04,481
You've got a situation where, in
what you're suggesting, you

944
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:07,770
have one doctor and
multiple patients.

945
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,970
Which is accurate.

946
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:11,620
I'm not quite sure that they'd
be dealing with them

947
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,310
simultaneously but it might
not matter for the

948
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,560
purposes of the game.

949
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,280

950
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,690
It might be like those improv
games where you manage to

951
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:30,720
figure out before time
runs out what a

952
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,870
person's profile is.

953
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,510
That could be the
win condition.

954
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,450
So it's equal win
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

955
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:40,649
and equal loss if you don't
actually get it incorporated

956
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:44,416
with something like you give a
trigger and reduce the amount

957
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:46,146
of time you have available, the
number of turns available.

958
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:47,628
It doesn't have to
be real time.

959
00:44:47,628 --> 00:44:54,544

960
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:55,794
So you can use it with
multiple patients.

961
00:44:55,794 --> 00:45:00,472

962
00:45:00,472 --> 00:45:05,310
So that doesn't even necessarily
have to deal with

963
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,050
talking about actual psychiatric
ward situations.

964
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,048
That could be something like
objects and colors.

965
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:14,860
It's more of a guessing game.

966
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:18,480
That might be too abstract,
possibly, because in the end

967
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,490
you want people to be able to
tie it back to the experience.

968
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,350
To be able to make an easy
connection to what it's like

969
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:27,770
to be a resident or what
it's going to be

970
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:29,860
like to be a resident.

971
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:36,310
So this is where the theme
needs to be pretty clear.

972
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,350
But in [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

973
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:39,556
talked, fear is not meaning.

974
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:43,900
Meaning is also tied pretty
well with your mechanics.

975
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,310
So that's just something
to keep in mind.

976
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:53,240

977
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,470
OK?

978
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,692
PROFESSOR: We probably have
another half-an-hour class.

979
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:04,570
I think the plan was just to let
everyone figure out teams

980
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,500
you wanted to be in.

981
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:12,660
This is going to be class time
to talk to each other and see

982
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,770
if there's stuff in here
that people are

983
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,280
really psyched about.

984
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,190
Is there anyone in this class
that's already like, this is

985
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,440
something I really want to do?

986
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,845

987
00:46:23,845 --> 00:46:25,855
AUDIENCE: Well, my preference is
towards the ward advantage.

988
00:46:25,855 --> 00:46:28,710

989
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,960
To ward advantage?

990
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:38,766

991
00:46:38,766 --> 00:46:41,256
PROFESSOR: I don't really
have a plan [INAUDIBLE].

992
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:45,120
AUDIENCE: I'd be interested in
voices and hidden information.

993
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,860
So fooling players and that
result in them behaving in

994
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,220
erratic ways.

995
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,700
And as from the point of view of
other players, and then the

996
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,080
point of view of player's
behaving erratically, other

997
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,336
players are behaving erratically
because it's not

998
00:46:56,336 --> 00:46:59,140
in line with what they think
is actually going on.

999
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,398
Or voices, or both, or
something like that.

1000
00:47:02,398 --> 00:47:04,039
PROFESSOR: So that's the general
territory you're

1001
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:06,150
interested in going into?

1002
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,026
Who wants to?

1003
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,490
AUDIENCE: I'm very interested
in the escalation and

1004
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:11,200
de-escalation by hidden
keywords.

1005
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,450
[INAUDIBLE].

1006
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,800

1007
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,252
AUDIENCE: I like basically
hidden rules, goals, and

1008
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:20,925
keywords, and two different
players

1009
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:23,322
playing the same character.

1010
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:24,801
Those are two mechanics
I really like.

1011
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:31,220

1012
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,930
PROFESSOR: We have a couple
of seats out there.

1013
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,180
Caffeine helps, there's
a bunch.

1014
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,370

1015
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,820
What do we have on Friday?

1016
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,270
GUEST SPEAKER: On Friday we
mostly just have brainstorming

1017
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:46,250
and team-building scheduled?

1018
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,220
That time is pretty flexible.

1019
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:51,735
PROFESSOR: S0 what I can do
maybe, if folks can plan to

1020
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:56,200
come into Wednesday with a team,
what I'm going to do is

1021
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,590
I might move my--

1022
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,910
AUDIENCE: You mean Friday?

1023
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,320
PROFESSOR: --Sorry,
Friday, yeah.

1024
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,695
Then I will move my
live-action talk

1025
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:06,410
up to Friday instead.

1026
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,640
So Wednesday we can just-- since
it seems like a lot of

1027
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,890
people are going in
that direction.

1028
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,180

1029
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,360
You don't have to do a
live-action game, but it's one

1030
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:18,610
of my favorite games.

1031
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,931
