00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,160
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

14
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,210
and we will spend the next
couple of weeks grading them.

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,440
But that was pretty fun on
Friday so [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,370

17
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,560
We've been talking these
past couple of weeks--

18
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:50,290

19
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,380
we've been talking the past
couple of weeks about serious

20
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,624
games, games for education,
games as an art form, as a

21
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,440
means of expression.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,280
And we're going to be continuing
some of those

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,220
discussions later on.

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,660
But the whole idea is to sort
of give you, to sort of prep

25
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,620
you, for a situation where
you're going to make a game

26
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,360
for a client.

27
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,400
And for this last assignment,
you're actually going to be

28
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,596
making a game based on a problem
that Lisa is going to

29
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:17,846
be talking about.

30
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:21,090

31
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,490
GUEST SPEAKER 1: My name is
Jim [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

32
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,240
I'm a clinical psychologist.

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,720
I work at--

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
I was at Beth Israel, I'm just
starting at Brigham and

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,250
Women's Hospital, one of the
Harvard mafia hospitals.

36
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:39,240
And my area is using interactive
media for clinical

37
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,780
training but especially for

38
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,196
treatment of clinical problems.

39
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:45,300
So we make computer programs
to help treat clinical

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,392
disorders in psychology.

41
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:50,368
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It's
my turn to stand up.

42
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,860
I'm [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,590
I'm a psychiatrist at UMass.

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,529
I trained in the same
place like Jim used

45
00:01:56,529 --> 00:01:58,994
to work, Beth Israel.

46
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,952
And my focus is primarily
clinical.

47
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:06,389
I'm an attending psychiatrist
in a variety of settings,

48
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,375
inpatient, outpatient.

49
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:11,430
And what I brought up to Jim
and then Phillip was a

50
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,540
practical question that I will
try to present, which is

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,374
helping psychiatry residents
deal with angry, agitated, and

52
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,350
potentially [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
patients.

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,804
Later this is a significant
and largely unknown issue.

54
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:35,784
Certainly the research is
picking up, and we don't quite

55
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:37,278
understand the extent
of the problem.

56
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:39,270
And but I'll say more.

57
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,770
I'll save it for our
presentation.

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,060
Thank you for coming here.

59
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,780
PROFESSOR: So when they
contacted me, there was the

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,565
usual interest in trying to
make some sort of digital

61
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:55,629
piece of software to help the
training residents in learning

62
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,260
how to deal with violence
in mental institutions.

63
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,120
And immediately the first thing
that I thought, well

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,940
before we jump right into
digital, let's try doing

65
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,900
something in analog first.

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,740
Let's try prototyping
something first.

67
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,316
But it also occurred to me that,
in the real world of

68
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:20,950
game design, there's actually a
lot more jobs in game design

69
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,680
outside of the game industry
than inside the game industry.

70
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,100
There are a lot of companies out
there that are basically

71
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,800
looking for solutions.

72
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,700
Some of which may be games.

73
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,290
And you might end up working in
some of those capacities.

74
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,200
A lot of folks in advertising
for instance

75
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,715
are involved in games.

76
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:41,880
A lot of folks who are
interested in improving

77
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,980
teaching methods, or improving
simulations, working on--

78
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,860
trying to think of
an example--

79
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,730
public awareness.

80
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,910
And people who are also now
working in website design and

81
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,200
in various online services, who
are trying to think about

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,010
how to make their experiences
a little bit more game like.

83
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,580
There are really really good
ways of doing that, and there

84
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,460
are really really bad
ways of doing that.

85
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,780
And for the most part what we're
hoping is that, if you

86
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,538
end up getting one of those
jobs, you're going to be able

87
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:19,440
to bring some of your personal
insight as having actually

88
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,015
done game design, as opposed
to just copying what games

89
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:27,217
have done, and just assuming,
well, it kind of looks like a

90
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:28,250
game, therefore it is a game.

91
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,460
You guys know that now.

92
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,910
So this is kind of get your
feet wet, in terms of

93
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:41,170
designing something, designing
for somebody else's needs.

94
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,080
The important thing to keep in
mind is, who is going to be

95
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,740
playing your game, or who's
this game intended for.

96
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,640
And in what context are they
going to be playing your game.

97
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,710
One of the particular problems
that you're trying to address,

98
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,030
what's the part of
the system that

99
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,690
you're trying to simulate.

100
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:05,040
And what kinds of insights do
you hope people are going to

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,010
get out of that.

102
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,060
The problem they're going
to talk about it huge.

103
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,650
If you noticed I uploaded
actually four readings to the

104
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,630
class website.

105
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,220
Only one of them is required,
but all of them are useful.

106
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,670
I will be uploading more.

107
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,780
These are all reference material
for the team to use

108
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,370
however you wish.

109
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,080
Because the problem is so huge
and vast, you don't have to

110
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,910
solve the whole problem.

111
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,870
You pick one thing that you're
excited about, that you're

112
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,690
interested about, and that you
think that you might have a

113
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,950
good strategy.

114
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,940
Do the usual brainstorm.

115
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,277
We're going to be going through
brainstorming and team

116
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,980
selection pretty much
just this week.

117
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,540

118
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,445
And try to identify some small
part that might be addressable

119
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:48,205
with a card game or a board
game, or I'll talk a little

120
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:51,442
bit about role-playing games
in a couple of weeks.

121
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:54,680
So with that being said
I'm going to turn

122
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,000
it over to you guys.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,298
GUEST SPEAKER 2: OK so we'll
try to take turns to talk

124
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:08,250
about violence in psychiatry,
in particular.

125
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,370
So as Jim has pointed out,
violence is a large issue.

126
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,260
What I'm going to try to focus
on, as I mentioned earlier,

127
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,676
rather than engaging with
psychiatric patients,

128
00:06:19,676 --> 00:06:22,634
especially psychiatric patients
on an inpatient

129
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:30,980
program, which is where the
question for me came from.

130
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,330
And obviously violence
can be looked at in

131
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,280
a variety of ways.

132
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,596
And I think in one of the
handouts that I sent to

133
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:49,045
Philip, Violence in Mental
Illness, they talk about the

134
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:52,496
biological, psychological
theories that the social

135
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:57,919
dimension of violence and how
it can be understood.

136
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,370
If you look at the human
development, and no matter

137
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,934
what theory you consider,
either a traditional

138
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:10,000
drive-based theory like Freud
or Erikson's stages, each

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,370
seems to define a certain
developmental goal, and often,

140
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,330
achieving or achieving in a
faulty way that goal can

141
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,128
create potential for aggression

142
00:07:24,128 --> 00:07:26,900
and sometimes violence.

143
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,340
A little child or an adult who's
dependent or needs are

144
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:39,312
frustrated may try to takeover
and get those met, in one way

145
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:40,980
or another.

146
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:46,752
So what I use as a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] metaphor for

147
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:51,750
the origins of violence is a
communication breakdown.

148
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,286
At some level, something doesn't
happen right between

149
00:07:56,286 --> 00:08:02,130
the person who gets angry and
those around him or her.

150
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,080
So in a most generic way,
basically communication is

151
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,045
less about who says what to
whom, than in what channel,

152
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:12,440
and with what affect.

153
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,606
The breakdown can occur
at many levels.

154
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:18,078
Again, this is the
generic form.

155
00:08:18,078 --> 00:08:19,250
I hope I'll [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

156
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,170
what I mean.

157
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,320
And especially what can be done
at a practical level,

158
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,644
let's say when you are the
resident on call at night.

159
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:31,787
And the staff calls you up and
says so and so is getting out

160
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:32,549
of control.

161
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,747
She's raising her voice,
threatening, pounding walls,

162
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,580
wanting to get out, refusing
medications.

163
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,860
How do you approach
such a person?

164
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,780
And again, the intervention
can happen

165
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,500
at different levels.

166
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,190
And actually one goal of the
training, or potentially the

167
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,090
game that you might consider,
is what to do.

168
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:58,390
How do you establish when do you
engage fully, by yourself,

169
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,670
with outside help, when
intervention is minimal and

170
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,560
you just bring pens with you,
restrain the patient, use

171
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,350
pharmacology.

172
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,640
So it's a continuum
of interventions.

173
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,038
I'm going to just focus on
what to do when you can

174
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:15,950
actually engage the patient.

175
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,060
Again, continuing the metaphor
is what Walter Fisher has

176
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,970
described as this type of
narrative, rationality, as

177
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,930
opposed to the traditional
rational paradigm that defines

178
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:41,190
people as thinking beings that
actually do make decisions and

179
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,855
base their actions on evidential
reasoning.

180
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:45,810
Or rational people.

181
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,016
We analyze the situation.

182
00:09:47,016 --> 00:09:50,130
We come up with the best
possible outcome.

183
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,170
Walter Fisher talks about that
fact that we are all

184
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,040
storytellers, that we try to
interact and understand others

185
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,990
based on the narrative
that we have about

186
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,445
ourselves and about others.

187
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,870
My assumption, and again, this
is just the introductory

188
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,800
metaphor if you want, that at
some point violence can be

189
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,830
caused by a disruption
in this narrative.

190
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,330
Things don't make
sense anymore.

191
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,840
We feel misunderstood.

192
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,650
We feel the victim
of an injustice.

193
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,488
And that those principles
apply to somebody who is

194
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:26,721
struggling with a
mental illness.

195
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:31,158
Where things have a much
narrower window of opportunity

196
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:34,273
than for people who are able
to flexibly adapt to the

197
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:35,523
demands of reality.

198
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,590

199
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:44,250
So we all know who this is, and
the reason I put it up--

200
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,606
and I have to admit I haven't
looked into the copyright, I

201
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,610
know there are longer and longer
copyright rules for

202
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,440
using cartoons, so you'll
have to forgive me.

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,820
My point is that this
is an angry person.

204
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,840
And as someone who
is communicating.

205
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,540
I think we get quickly and
clearly the fact that his

206
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,744
emotional range may be intense,

207
00:11:09,744 --> 00:11:10,648
but it's fairly narrow.

208
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:15,200
It doesn't cover like
a spectrum.

209
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,560
And the communication
is fairly simple.

210
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,670
He's in distress.

211
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:23,080
He is imposing his point
of view, his space.

212
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,843
He could become very aggressive
and assaultive.

213
00:11:28,843 --> 00:11:31,880
I think that the language
is very simplistic.

214
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,010
How would we approach the Hulk
in trying to calm him down and

215
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,756
change his color?

216
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:40,172
That's the end of my
introductory metaphor.

217
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:43,588

218
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:47,492
And please, feel free to
interrupt, jump in, and make

219
00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:53,860
this presentation as long or
as short as you want me to.

220
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,430
There are many slides, but I'm
not going to go through every

221
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,259
single line.

222
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,241
I'm just using this as a
stimulus for the conversation

223
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,229
especially from your
perspective

224
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:05,217
and from your needs.

225
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:08,199
As I said, I'm a clinical
provider, I'm a psychiatrist.

226
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:12,843
I deal with patients all the
time, many of whom are angry

227
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:15,810
or potentially angry or
potentially assaultive.

228
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,715
And I may do things after so
many years instinctively.

229
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:23,042
But sometimes I have to think
through, OK, this is the

230
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,935
situation, how do I do to
maximize the benefit for the

231
00:12:26,935 --> 00:12:29,273
patient I'm treating and
to keep myself safe.

232
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:32,908
I've been assaulted just
once, in 15 years.

233
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:36,150
It was like in the movies.

234
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,021
A VA patient, former Green
Beret, who got upset with the

235
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:46,865
system, and picked up a very
heavy armchair and lifted it

236
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,813
above his head.

237
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:52,130
And we established
eye contact then.

238
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:54,770
I think he wondered, what should
I do with this puny

239
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,422
little doctor?

240
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:58,120
Should I squash him or not?

241
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,530
And at the end, I guess it was a
last, you know, split second

242
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,298
moment, he decided to
throw it to my side.

243
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:09,561
A large section of the wall came
down, so I was looking at

244
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,780
it wondering, well
I could have been

245
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,766
that wall coming down.

246
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:13,259
He ran out.

247
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,724
It took him a while--

248
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:18,190
for people to catch
up with him.

249
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,910
And two cruisers full of police
officers to subdue him.

250
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,540
So I guess, no communication
there.

251
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,440
He was just subdued.

252
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
What's the magnitude
of the problem?

253
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,160
I think it's substantial.

254
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,435
And actually more than 10 years
ago, there were some

255
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:41,079
isolated reports of how
significant the problem was in

256
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:42,850
terms of the trainees, and
especially psychiatry

257
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:50,724
trainees, being the target of
verbal and physical violence.

258
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:54,265
On this first page I
talk about medical

259
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:56,680
students in one study.

260
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,612
Numbers are relatively small.

261
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:05,820
But again, the study
is 14 years old.

262
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,790
A survey of psychiatry residents
showed that assaults

263
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,550
or threats of violence are
clearly one of the most

264
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,010
difficult events in
their training.

265
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,226
And some were wondering
introspectively if this is the

266
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:19,680
right field for them.

267
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,585
Actually some students may
wonder reading this literature

268
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:24,740
whether psychiatry is
the right field

269
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,620
for them to go into.

270
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:35,456
And as you see in the fourth
article, almost two-thirds of

271
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,414
psychiatry residents were
assaulted at least once during

272
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:40,400
their training.

273
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,520
And obviously like with any
dangerous situation, the risk

274
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,925
of post-traumatic symptoms
can be substantial.

275
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:52,660
Either acute stress response
or longer lasting issues.

276
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,804
The idea of improving their
training and their ability to

277
00:14:57,804 --> 00:15:01,850
deal with the situation
has multiple benefits.

278
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,523
Those who know what
to do are never or

279
00:15:04,523 --> 00:15:05,490
almost never assaulted.

280
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,758
Not only that, if they happened
to be exposed, the

281
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:12,026
likelihood of developing
post-traumatic goes down

282
00:15:12,026 --> 00:15:12,512
significantly.

283
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,400
So I don't think I need
to demonstrate

284
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,858
that point any further.

285
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:21,510
The assault rate in a more
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] relatively

286
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,846
recent study, 10 years old,
pretty old, you see that

287
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:31,520
overall the number of assault
rate was 30% to 40%.

288
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,256
Men tended to be slightly
more physically

289
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:35,714
assaulted than women.

290
00:15:35,714 --> 00:15:39,602
AUDIENCE: Can you define what
assault means, exactly?

291
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:41,060
What qualifies as assault?

292
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,766
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Assault
basically means kind of laying

293
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:46,590
hands on the person.

294
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,680
And the assault resulting in
an injury, of any kind.

295
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,890
Skin being kind of broken
through or--

296
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,245
AUDIENCE: Just holding
the clinician

297
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:00,335
wouldn't be an assault?

298
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,938
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well it would
be an assault because that

299
00:16:02,938 --> 00:16:08,090
kind of grabbing action could
actually result in injury.

300
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,614
And I think it would be probably
very limiting to talk

301
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,240
only about physical injuries,
especially since the

302
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,386
psychological consequences are
often the longer lasting and

303
00:16:19,386 --> 00:16:22,230
much more significant.

304
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,230
I think what the surveys have
shown also is that how

305
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,990
unprepared trainees in the
mental health and outside the

306
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,150
mental health field
are actually.

307
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,860
Often this is reduced to a few
lectures, especially during

308
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,150
orientation.

309
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,970
And then they are thrown into
the lion cage and they learn

310
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,790
on the job.

311
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,050
And many of these findings
are introspective.

312
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,220
Many trainees felt that well, I
didn't say anything, because

313
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,310
I thought I was supposed to
toughen up and bite the bullet

314
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,190
and move on.

315
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,240
Or this is part of the job, I
chose this, it's my fault.

316
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,050
Or maybe I did something
wrong.

317
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,580
Maybe I was the one who made
it so the assault happened.

318
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,450
So a lot of reasons that were
just, again, not looked into.

319
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,314
Fear of being scrutinized.

320
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:12,500
How come that I'm
the one that was

321
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,119
assaulted, and not 10 trainees.

322
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,869
How I'm going to explain this.

323
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,324
I was so frightened that I
cannot even remember clearly

324
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:20,730
what happened to me.

325
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,670
So there are a variety
of reasons why

326
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,170
people who are in training--

327
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,310
and again, I'm focusing on a
again a very small segment, a

328
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,232
specific group of trainees
in medical

329
00:17:31,232 --> 00:17:32,206
and psychiatric training.

330
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:35,615
But I could easily think of
other situations of people who

331
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,605
are exposed to the potential
for violence and where such

332
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,880
training would be helpful.

333
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,026
Up until now, and for the most
part the data that I was able

334
00:17:46,026 --> 00:17:48,882
to collect, and most people in
looking at this have been able

335
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:51,270
to collect is fairly limited.

336
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,890
There are certain limited
number of programs.

337
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,760
Methodologically the research
is quite faulty.

338
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,160
You can just talk about how
limited the generalizability

339
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,965
of the findings are.

340
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:06,585
And often people have
talked about what

341
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,680
happened in the past.

342
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,772
So clearly the recall bias is
a major limiting factor in

343
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:15,120
understanding what happened.

344
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,980
Also, as Jim asked me, so how
do you define assault.

345
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,860
One of the biggest problems
with most research in this

346
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,774
field is that defining assault,
aggression, is done

347
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,330
in very idiosyncratic ways.

348
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,955
It's hard to compare
different studies.

349
00:18:31,955 --> 00:18:34,902

350
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:39,790
So this is a compilation of what
people in different areas

351
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,460
have thought about in
terms of improving

352
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,860
the psychiatric training.

353
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,886
And as you see most often, in
the last few years, the idea

354
00:18:49,886 --> 00:18:56,590
of using simulation to expose
the trainees to a protected

355
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,320
environment that has clearly
defined boundaries and

356
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,297
consequences, and basically that
can be repeated almost in

357
00:19:05,297 --> 00:19:09,225
identical fashion in order to
gain proficiency, this coming

358
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:12,171
up more and more.

359
00:19:12,171 --> 00:19:16,410
What many training programs
are doing is to use

360
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:20,076
standardized patients
that use actors.

361
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:23,338
And that of course
would behave in

362
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:26,720
a programmed fashion.

363
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,810
They make get up to you and
make fists, but hopefully

364
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,980
they'll not get so much into
the role and then they're

365
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,755
punching you.

366
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,420
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I think this is
the real challenge, is that

367
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,271
there's different levels
of learning.

368
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,320
You can learn kind of a list of
facts, things to do if your

369
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,270
patient starts to get agitated
and threatening.

370
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,970
And you can learn how to take a
test on it and forget it the

371
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,020
next day, especially if
it doesn't come up

372
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,110
for you right away.

373
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,400
And then there's the question
of internalizing it so you

374
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,380
actually have not just kind of a
working knowledge but really

375
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,140
understand what you should
do in different kinds of

376
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,540
circumstances.

377
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,270
And that's where the idea of
role playing with live role

378
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,440
plays for the trainees--

379
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,960
it could be residents, and
mental health providers--

380
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,390
can really be helpful so they
have some sense, some

381
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,120
semblance of this kind
of training.

382
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,180
But the tricky things with these
role plays is it's not

383
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,490
easy to ensure that everybody
receives high quality access

384
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,270
to well trained actors.

385
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,310
Here at Harvard Medical School,
they probably do.

386
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,610
At UMass, they probably do.

387
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,850
But there's a lot of places.

388
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,122
And if you expand beyond
psychiatry to every mental

389
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:35,560
health center in the country,
every caseworker who is going

390
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,720
out to visit a patient at their
home, or social worker,

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,310
they're definitely not getting
this kind of training.

392
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,510
And so the ones who really I
think you said before are

393
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,940
really well trained are
the nurses, actually.

394
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,090
Because they get a different
kind of training that's really

395
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,980
pretty effective,
it sounds like.

396
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,870
But the mental health
care providers

397
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,900
often have no training.

398
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,980
And then they're the ones who
are kind of in a closed room

399
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,040
with the person who can
become really violent.

400
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,665
Especially if it's at their
home, or an inpatient unit.

401
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:03,750
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Jim was making
reference to that

402
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,000
psychiatrist at MGH who last
year was stabbed by a patient

403
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,650
in the outpatient clinic.

404
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,475
GUEST SPEAKER 1: You all hear
about this last year?

405
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:12,295
Can you just describe
the situation?

406
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,826
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well, it was
late in the evening, when most

407
00:21:14,826 --> 00:21:17,230
things like this have the
potential of happening.

408
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,620
This was a neuro evaluation
or [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

409
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,490
in the Bipolar Clinic at MGH.

410
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:31,333
Basically he was angry from the
beginning and was able to

411
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,800
stab repeatedly.

412
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,280
An off guard person who just
happened to walk by.

413
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,720
GUEST SPEAKER 1: It was a
police officer, right?

414
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,290
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

415
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,360
He was one of the security
people for

416
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
that particular clinic.

417
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,340
He came and he had a gun.

418
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,830
I don't know how often off-duty
security people carry

419
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,240
their guns.

420
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,130
But he opened and killed
the patient.

421
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:55,724
So he was charged.

422
00:21:55,724 --> 00:21:58,210
Eventually was cleared.

423
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,690
For using excessive force.

424
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,020
GUEST SPEAKER 1: What happened
to the psychiatrist?

425
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,686
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well, the
psychiatrist was admitted into

426
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:07,074
the hospital and required
extensive surgeries.

427
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,946
She was stabbed in the chest
and in the neck.

428
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:14,095
It was a fairly gruesome-- she
survived and I think she's

429
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:14,940
back at work.

430
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,980
But this is an extreme case.

431
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,450
And I'm afraid that many of the
things that we talk about,

432
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,800
the principles that we may
come up with, may not

433
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,620
necessarily be so helpful, other
than thinking back at a

434
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,445
level of intervention.

435
00:22:29,445 --> 00:22:33,230
It is quite conceivable that
for somebody who charges at

436
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,066
you, you won't be able to talk
him down, you won't be able to

437
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:40,682
use any of the nice
de-escalation principles that

438
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm going to talk about
in a few minutes.

439
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,290
But, figuring out what
do, I think it means

440
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:45,982
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

441
00:22:45,982 --> 00:22:50,690
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
nurses have a different

442
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,720
training system for this, and
it seems to be effective.

443
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,630

444
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,150
What is that training, like what
is different about what

445
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,386
nurses get taught?

446
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:05,420
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well, there
are some, in most states,

447
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,484
there are some regulations that
try to implement some

448
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:14,412
level of training or are
designed specifically for

449
00:23:14,412 --> 00:23:17,600
patients who get
out of control.

450
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,430
And that's not only
psychiatry.

451
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:25,595
Emergency room teams have
probably the most highest rate

452
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:29,640
of assaultive patients, across
diagnostic departments.

453
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,278
Often psychiatric patients,
especially patients using

454
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,530
substance abuse, will
get out of control.

455
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,690
So if you want to become an
emergency physician, or if you

456
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:42,649
work in the field as an EMT or
another capacity, you'll have

457
00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:44,400
to deal with these situations.

458
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,460
What makes the nurses somewhat
better trained is that they

459
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,032
often are the frontline
staff dealing with

460
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,180
out of control patients.

461
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,478
And I think that's probably
pretty sad, because physicians

462
00:23:57,478 --> 00:24:01,350
should be equally, and trainees,
physicians and

463
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,254
trainees should be equally
well trained.

464
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:08,580
But on the nursing front, there
has been some progress.

465
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,170
In Massachusetts, the Department
of Mental Health

466
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,250
has some mandatory training.

467
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,590
But there's a lot of red tape
there, but there a lot of

468
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,455
helpful aspects, including
aspects

469
00:24:20,455 --> 00:24:23,412
related to stop attacks.

470
00:24:23,412 --> 00:24:28,410
And I wish I could have
presented a recording of a

471
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,270
training session for staff.

472
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:35,230
When I went to it, I thought it
would be something like a

473
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,593
very spectacular kind of
kung-fu, how you do it.

474
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:41,510
When in fact, the emphasis is
how to keep yourself safe, and

475
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,410
believe it or not how to keep
the person safe, the person

476
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,620
that you're blocking the
punches, the person that may

477
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,040
be trying to strangle you, or
keep you in a stronghold, or

478
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,750
scratch you, or rip your hair.

479
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,170
Again, even when you're trying
to be intervene or you're

480
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,109
trying to protect yourself,
and keep the

481
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:04,558
other person safe.

482
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:10,360
No punching, kicking, no kind
of spectacular steps.

483
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,816
But again, that's also I feel
could be an interesting topic

484
00:25:15,816 --> 00:25:17,812
for a simulation.

485
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,806
How do you interact with--

486
00:25:20,806 --> 00:25:24,299
especially since again
I'm a totally kind of

487
00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:26,810
outsider in the field.

488
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:31,020
Having kids, they were asking
me the other day about

489
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,270
Microsoft's Kinect.

490
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,190

491
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,985
And I thought that was really
interesting because the level

492
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:43,890
of interaction with computer
generated interfaces is very

493
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,335
interesting, and certainly
would be a safe bet to be

494
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:50,245
attacked by somebody
from the TV.

495
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:54,530
AUDIENCE: It sounds like the
nurses get better training

496
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,840
because the states require them
to have better training.

497
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
GUEST SPEAKER 2:
That's correct.

498
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,680
That's a part of it.

499
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,950
I've been trying at UMass to
suggest that not only the

500
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,930
staff physicians get exposed to
the training but even the

501
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,110
psychiatry trainees and other
trainees, especially in

502
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,270
emergency medicine.

503
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,204
They should all really
know about it.

504
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,921
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I suspect some
of this have to do with

505
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:20,156
the benefits of being
in a union.

506
00:26:20,156 --> 00:26:23,614
So a union can demand that
nurses receive this better

507
00:26:23,614 --> 00:26:26,084
training, where the physicians
don't have a union.

508
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,090
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It's
also about numbers.

509
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,720
On any unit, you
have six, seven

510
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,420
nurses for one physician.

511
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,400
And the nurses are there in
shifts around the clock.

512
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,686
So their likelihood of being
exposed to an out-of-control

513
00:26:39,686 --> 00:26:42,320
patient are much higher.

514
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,380
Usually on these units people
intervene as a team.

515
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,796
And as a team leader that tries
to apply so many of the

516
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:52,800
principles I'm going
to talk about.

517
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,216
And then if there is need for
seclusion or restraints, then

518
00:26:57,216 --> 00:27:00,330
that has to be done in a
coordinated fashion.

519
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,894
And things are much clearer,
as I said,

520
00:27:02,894 --> 00:27:04,630
on the nursing front.

521
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,340
Maybe because they are doing
it all the time and because

522
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,498
there are some tight
regulations,

523
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:11,942
because they're unionized.

524
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:16,472
And at least half of the
literature really comes from

525
00:27:16,472 --> 00:27:17,650
the nursing direction.

526
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:23,050
So that's a tangent.

527
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,215
PROFESSOR: Just want to ride
off the Kinect comment that

528
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:28,065
you were making.

529
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:30,125
We will be talking about a
little bit more about live

530
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,790
action games so that's kind of
how you prototype something

531
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,156
that's going to be a motion
gesture computer game.

532
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,320
You don't obfuscate.

533
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,434
Actually having to write code to
do that, that sort of body

534
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:45,843
recognition, is kind of annoying
and expensive.

535
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:50,226
But you can test off a lot of
ideas just by having two

536
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:51,690
people play with coding.

537
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:54,500
Safety becomes the biggest
concern for

538
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,530
the players as well.

539
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,659
It's kind of interesting in this
particular case that you

540
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:00,887
are trying to teach someone
how to prevent

541
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:04,440
damage to both parties.

542
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,030
That actually kind of
helps you with the

543
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,050
design a lot actually.

544
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,145
That's only one problem.

545
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:16,065
You'll go into more details
about the kinds of things to

546
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:19,516
prevent it escalating into
actual conflict.

547
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:24,446
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And the idea
is basically to do your best

548
00:28:24,446 --> 00:28:27,897
to not end up at that particular
extreme of direct

549
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:31,850
combat, which is not--

550
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,520
So ideally you don't
have to go there.

551
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,580
And as I said in 15 years I've
been assaulted once.

552
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,340
I'm sure I was lucky.

553
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,750
People think that my eyebrows
are intimidating.

554
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:50,198
So don't tend to get very
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

555
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:53,500
Again I'm going to tell a few,
you know, tell you about a few

556
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,470
pearls and a few tricks
that I personally use.

557
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,010
It may not be helpful
for everybody.

558
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,070
Over time, you develop
you own style.

559
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:08,168
The idea is to be able to make
an assessment and try to take

560
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:09,136
preventative steps.

561
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:10,588
And I think that's the secret.

562
00:29:10,588 --> 00:29:14,460
And this is what I hope better
training may be the user

563
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,396
simulation and gaming
would be helpful.

564
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:19,300

565
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:25,010
Now I'm going to just, I'm going
to jump into talking

566
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,195
about prevention and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

567
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:32,930
but identifying how you assess
and how you think about the

568
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,380
potential for violence.

569
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,282
And these are some known risk
factors for aggression.

570
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:45,154
Obviously the history of
violence is the top.

571
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:51,132
How recent, how frequently,
those people become

572
00:29:51,132 --> 00:29:52,750
assaultive.

573
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,210
What's the pattern
of escalation.

574
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,260
What are the associated
symptoms.

575
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,480
What happens before somebody
becomes assaultive.

576
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,030
Why is this important?

577
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,999
Because you can do, and probably
should do before, you

578
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:09,410
engage with the patient an
assessment at that level.

579
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,170
And it will help you figure out
how deep to get involved,

580
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:15,050
how likely you are to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] the patient.

581
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,206
Versus saying, oh, I don't need
this, I need help, let's

582
00:30:19,206 --> 00:30:20,454
go in as a team.

583
00:30:20,454 --> 00:30:23,850
So that-- that makes
it important.

584
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,830
People often talk about
violence and a rise in

585
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:26,630
tendencies.

586
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,920
Young people tend to
be more assaultive,

587
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,710
and there's no surprise.

588
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,590
Also older people who have
dementia and get more

589
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,991
disinhibited and more likely
to become reactive.

590
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:43,191
I always like to tell
the story about a

591
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:43,925
patient with dementia.

592
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,125
I was moonlighting, and he swung
at me as I was passing.

593
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,065
And then I went to
talk to him.

594
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,680
Well, I don't know, you just
passed by, and I was upset,

595
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,800
and you were the closest.

596
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,790
So I thought I would try to--

597
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,320
So there was no way for
me to predict that.

598
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,336
It wasn't a serious thing, it
wasn't a predatory type of

599
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:07,292
assaultiveness where
somebody plans.

600
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:10,715
Doesn't like you,
goes after you.

601
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:15,116
A colleague of mine was
attacked by a patient.

602
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:19,517
The patient watched when people
were not around, went

603
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:22,290
into the doctors room,
locked the

604
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,160
door, and started punching.

605
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,684
So that's a totally
different animal.

606
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:29,521
So the distinction between
impulsive, affective if you

607
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:36,710
want or the type of aggression
and the predatory is essential

608
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,640
to keep in mind.

609
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:48,080
In some subcultures, violence is
not allowed certainly much

610
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,020
more frequent.

611
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,322
People of a lower socioeconomic
status may be

612
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:56,160
more likely to become
assaultive.

613
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,035
Patients of a limited cognitive
ability, especially

614
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:02,899
when institutionalized, are
way more likely to become

615
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:03,382
assaultive.

616
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:07,725
And then it's many, many
diagnoses increase the

617
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,705
likelihood of assaultiveness.

618
00:32:09,705 --> 00:32:13,170
The top are psychotic disorders,
like schizophrenia.

619
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,120
Mood disorders like bipolar.

620
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,390
I told you about what we call
cognitive disorders,

621
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:26,460
especially dementia and
confusional states.

622
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,080
Patients that have had traumatic
brain injuries or

623
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,966
that have had epilepsy.

624
00:32:32,966 --> 00:32:35,852
GUEST SPEAKER 1: There's a
real problem with Iraq or

625
00:32:35,852 --> 00:32:39,410
Afghanistan veterans, when they
have had an IE explode

626
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,540
under their vehicle.

627
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,660
And they had a brain injury.

628
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,750
Now they have a lot of
disinhibition about violence.

629
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,745
And they can just go off
sometimes very unexpectedly.

630
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:51,730
GUEST SPEAKER 2: The frontal
lobe exerts a sort of

631
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,370
inhibitory influence on our
ability to function.

632
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:00,350
And that allows us
to plan, to think

633
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,200
ahead, to sequence events.

634
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,000
This is the executive function
of our frontal lobe.

635
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,864
When it's impaired either in a
trauma, or after surgery, or

636
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:16,256
being in an accident, or
becoming demented, that

637
00:33:16,256 --> 00:33:22,112
ability to operate in that
fashion may be impaired.

638
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:25,040
Violence is a possible
side effect.

639
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,330
Substance abuse are at the top
of the list, because of the

640
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:33,412
disinhibition, both during the
intoxication phase and during

641
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:36,085
the withdrawal people tend to
become very agitated and

642
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:37,800
assaultive.

643
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,668
There are certain personality
disorders.

644
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:46,840
So when we think about the
percentage order, we have this

645
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,315
enduring maladaptive patterns
of relating to you and to

646
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:53,428
others and to the world.

647
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:56,886
The obsessive compulsive
personality disorder likes to

648
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,862
have things organized,
planned.

649
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:01,002
Nothing-- even going
on vacation is

650
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:01,826
an exhausting task.

651
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:05,165
Nothing has to happen
randomly.

652
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:09,690
The grandiose personalities
really need this kind of

653
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,550
feeling coming from
all directions.

654
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,210
They need to be in
the limelight.

655
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,370
They use people, not as real
people but as people that

656
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,320
provide sustenance to their
own self esteem.

657
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,844
Two type of personality
disorders are particularly

658
00:34:27,844 --> 00:34:31,630
likely to promote violence.

659
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:37,340
The antisocial and you may have
heard the term borderline

660
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,723
personality disorder, which
is basically at core has

661
00:34:40,723 --> 00:34:43,675
significant instability and
emotions and interpersonal

662
00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:49,579
relationships and identity
and basically

663
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,750
their lives are a mess.

664
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:55,260
Often they feel abandoned,
they feel put down.

665
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,504
They may get briefly paranoid
and often they become

666
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:00,390
assaultive.

667
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,360
So again, I'm throwing
a lot of terms and

668
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,320
definitions at you.

669
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,803
I don't want to make this a
lecture about psychiatry.

670
00:35:10,803 --> 00:35:14,033
But these are conditions
that I think are

671
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:15,276
helpful to think about.

672
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:19,252
AUDIENCE: When people with
delusional disorders like

673
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:22,731
schizophrenia get violent, is
it usually because they are

674
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:24,719
frustrated about something or
is it because they suddenly

675
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,701
have some sort of delusion about
their clinician that

676
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:30,925
involves requiring them to take
some sort of action that

677
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:31,875
is violent?

678
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,150
GUEST SPEAKER 2: I think both.

679
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,086
I think even people that have a
psychotic disorder have the

680
00:35:37,086 --> 00:35:40,040
right to feel the victim
of an injustice or

681
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,650
feel frustrated or--

682
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,437
many of the reasons that I
talked about could happen.

683
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:49,427
But in particular,
I think the other

684
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,425
point is equally important.

685
00:35:50,425 --> 00:35:52,920
That they may act on a
delusional conviction.

686
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,820
Or their psychosis may also
have hallucinations.

687
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,733
And command auditory
hallucinations are known to

688
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:07,840
often be the forerunners
of a violent attack.

689
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,720
You talk about me
and say things.

690
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,810
Or the voice tells me, I'm
going to go after you.

691
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:21,310
And the person feels hopeless
to resist that.

692
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,210
I discharged a patient,
was doing great.

693
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,870
Next day he comes back.

694
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,060
Went home, the voice told him
that he needs to hurt his

695
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,490
mother, otherwise he'll
get disemboweled.

696
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,360
So he started punching her and
then chased her with a knife.

697
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:42,137
She had to hide in a neighbor's
house until the

698
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,530
police arrived.

699
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,836
There is an interesting threat
control override here that

700
00:36:47,836 --> 00:36:52,130
people who have looked at
violence have prescribed as

701
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,340
being sometimes the proximal
cause for violence.

702
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,423
People feel directly
threatened.

703
00:36:59,423 --> 00:37:05,345
And they also have this
overpowering urge that they

704
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:08,110
need to act on that they
cannot resist.

705
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,450
It's a controversial concept.

706
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,190
I'm not so sure why we should
give this particular

707
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,492
association a higher status
than other delusional

708
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:20,420
convictions about the neighbors
watching me or

709
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,240
planning to kill me, or putting
together a variety of

710
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,330
clues that my friends are really
trying to get rid of me

711
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,530
and then I need to
protect myself.

712
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,230
But you are absolutely right.

713
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,890
What's interesting even though
patients with 20 psychiatric

714
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,680
disorders may have their reasons
to become assaultive,

715
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,780
in the overall bigger scheme
of things, when you look at

716
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:46,240
actual violent assaults
committed in society, they're

717
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,270
responsible for a tiny one.

718
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,343
So it's an interesting way
of looking at numbers.

719
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:57,170
Yes they could become violent,
but the reality is that their

720
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,130
numbers, the actual violent
acts, are very small.

721
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:04,906
But anyway this may just be a
kind of statistical trick.

722
00:38:04,906 --> 00:38:07,997
AUDIENCE: You're talking about
the number of cases of violent

723
00:38:07,997 --> 00:38:11,495
episodes compared to the
general population.

724
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:12,120
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Exactly.

725
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,600
That's exactly the problem
right there.

726
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,505
And then there are various
acute findings when you

727
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,960
examine the patient.

728
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,870
On what we call the mental
status examination.

729
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,295
Obviously, hostilities,
suspiciousness, agitation are

730
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:28,235
all associated with violence.

731
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:35,220

732
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,630
I want us to focus one minute
on the so-called aggressive

733
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:48,527
attributional style, how do we
respond to stress when we have

734
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:51,960
a perception of threat.

735
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:57,927
This is the threat override
delusion that I mentioned.

736
00:38:57,927 --> 00:38:59,899
I think that's quite relevant.

737
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:02,860

738
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,690
What happens in conditions of
uncertainty, and many of these

739
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,930
patients may have to think
in a distorted fashion.

740
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:16,690
I was talking at the
beginning about the

741
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,380
communication breakdown.

742
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,132
You have the layer of the mental
illness that shrinks

743
00:39:22,132 --> 00:39:22,910
your options.

744
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,640
You have a particular situation
to deal with that

745
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,850
makes you even more likely
to become assaulted.

746
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,215
And this constellation of
cognitive distortions may make

747
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:37,400
it more likely for you
to become assaulted.

748
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,400
Neglecting the base information,
which assigns a

749
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,960
high weight to certain events
that otherwise are low

750
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,360
frequency, attending only to
facts that would confirm your

751
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,510
assumptions, I think--

752
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:59,040
AUDIENCE: So if the
psychiatrist's office calls to

753
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,350
reschedule an appointment, the
person assumes that this is

754
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,820
because the psychiatrist
doesn't like him.

755
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,850
This person doesn't want to
treat me, they don't like me,

756
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,350
they don't want me to be their
patient because they

757
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,785
rescheduled me.

758
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:13,720
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Ignoring facts
that could disconfirm

759
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,440
your hypothesis.

760
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,649
I just talked to the
psychiatrist who was nice to

761
00:40:19,649 --> 00:40:23,450
me, but still the fact that he
called and canceled is the

762
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,530
overriding explanation that
he doesn't like me.

763
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,875
Or focusing on common events
just because you remember

764
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,920
them, which is an interesting
way of explaining.

765
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,050
The fact that you remember
them and it brings

766
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:38,135
them up in the rack.

767
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,510
And other disconfirming
evidence is

768
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,885
totally kind of ignored.

769
00:40:42,885 --> 00:40:45,270
AUDIENCE: In spite the
assumption that the train on

770
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,420
the other platform always
seems to arrive first.

771
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,354
Because those are the
ones you remember.

772
00:40:50,354 --> 00:40:52,310
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Or the
garden variety, the

773
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,740
grass is always greener.

774
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,450
And I talked about medications
and street drugs.

775
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,220
Some are more likely
to be associated.

776
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,300
Alcohol just by the
sheer volume.

777
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,800
And especially because
withdrawal is so violent.

778
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,335
It's a significant issue.

779
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:12,530
The intoxication phase, your
level of coordination, your

780
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,110
perception of facts, it's just
they're so off that you are

781
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,156
more likely to lose control.

782
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:24,336
Antidepressants have an
interesting impact, because in

783
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:27,136
people that have an underlying
tendency to swing in their

784
00:41:27,136 --> 00:41:29,100
moods may actually all
[? blend those ?] things.

785
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,460
You may have heard of the news
of antidepressants promoting

786
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,700
violence and suicide
in adolescents.

787
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,320
And while statisticians are
still scratching their heads

788
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,260
to figure out the exact numbers,
the truth is that

789
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,183
mood is very unstable
in adolescents.

790
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:51,350
And often initial depression
may turn out to

791
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:52,670
be something else.

792
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,310
You give somebody an
antidepressant, call him or

793
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,240
her for followup in six
or eight months.

794
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,480
In the meanwhile, lots of
things could happen.

795
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,484
And I think in those cases,
when actually those young

796
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:07,600
adolescents committed suicide,
it was not so much about

797
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,010
antidepressants causing it.

798
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:11,595
Probably the antidepressants
made the symptoms worse.

799
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:14,270
It was very poor followup
and poor diagnostic.

800
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:18,950
But anyway, this is getting
too technical.

801
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,400
I included this last minute.

802
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,530
This is an interesting summary
of a nationwide study focusing

803
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:30,900
on violence risk assessment.

804
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,454
Let me just take two minutes
about useful measures in

805
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,440
assessing dynamic
to the violence.

806
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,130
People have looked at violence
in two ways.

807
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,990
They have put together
all those factors

808
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,530
that I presented initially.

809
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:53,053
And they have looked at the
perspective of those who have

810
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:53,210
become violent.

811
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,040
And they compiled the
history, clinical

812
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,130
risk assessment scale.

813
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,430
The problem is that when you're
dealing with somebody,

814
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,530
those scales, even though they
may give you a good image of

815
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:06,950
what happens in the long run,
they may not help you deal

816
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,490
with the immediate situation.

817
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:12,910
So clinical scales have been
used in [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

818
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,210
One developed in Norway, the
other one, the dynamic

819
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,860
appraisal, developed
in Australia.

820
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,325
These are the items
for the HCR-20.

821
00:43:21,325 --> 00:43:25,550
And it's almost like a
repetition of what I said

822
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,570
earlier in terms of
risk factors.

823
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,750
This is the historical
risk factors.

824
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:30,780
And these are validated, because
they have been used

825
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,410
for more than 15 years.

826
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:38,540
The clinical scale is the
dynamic part of the HCR.

827
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,480
And then the risk management
scale is trying to project in

828
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,710
the future what you have to do
in order to ensure safety,

829
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,400
what could go wrong.

830
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,850
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So the value
of these scales is kind of

831
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,490
sizing up the likelihood of this
person coming violent, in

832
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:55,790
the absence of other
information.

833
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:58,280
The best predictor is probably
what they're actually doing

834
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,200
behaviorally in front of you.

835
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,220
They're reaching for something
heavy, I take that in and

836
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,510
weigh that heavily.

837
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,580
But in the absence of anything
else, you know that the people

838
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:15,365
who meet a certain profile are
more likely to be violent as a

839
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:16,960
psychiatric patient
than others.

840
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,477
GUEST SPEAKER 2: This is a
dynamic scale that looks at

841
00:44:19,477 --> 00:44:22,960
what happens in front of you,
as you pointed out.

842
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,950
You're considering confusion
or debility, how boisterous

843
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,960
and how verbally threatening
the person is.

844
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,360
The most recent one is the
dynamic appraisal of the

845
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,030
situation aggression that has
seven factors that seems to be

846
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,330
the best one [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

847
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,120
assessment or prediction
of violence

848
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,950
over the next 24 hours.

849
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:50,028
And this is an interesting
psychopathy and an index.

850
00:44:50,028 --> 00:44:53,300
Psychopathy has an interesting
history.

851
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:58,700
I think the current version
that we all talk about is

852
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,090
antisocial personality.

853
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,860
But basically refers to people
with minimal capacity for

854
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,840
empathy, whose moral dimensions
is fairly

855
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,985
primitive, who engage in
stealing, cheating, violence,

856
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:19,320
and don't have a lot of moral
drawbacks to do it.

857
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,686
It seems to be associated with
violence, not surprisingly.

858
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:27,700
And this is actually a factor
analysis that identifies those

859
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,860
two dimensions.

860
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:36,560
Now just at the end I want to
talk about the de-escalation

861
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,370
principles that I am actually
now trying to incorporate in

862
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:48,500
the standardized patients,
because these should be fairly

863
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,060
easy to at least present, and
then maybe hopefully to teach

864
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,892
the residents how to use
in terms of dealing

865
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:57,850
with agitated patients.

866
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:04,654
So actually many of them
are used by staff.

867
00:46:04,654 --> 00:46:09,630
How to start interaction
with a violent patient.

868
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:11,690
How to position yourself.

869
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,560
Within arm's length.

870
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,930
Probably at 45 degrees.

871
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,170
For two reasons.

872
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,250
One, in case you're attacked,
to offer a much smaller

873
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,990
surface of the impact and also
to allow you a way to escape,

874
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,910
you have to.

875
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:34,170
Not obviously to block
the exit door.

876
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:37,490
Stand over if the person is
leaning down or in the bed.

877
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,870
Never turn your back.

878
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,750
What to do with you
your hands.

879
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:44,840
Never make fists, or kind of
keep your arms crossed, or

880
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,840
behind you, or in your pockets,
to kind of appear as

881
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,770
nonthreatening as possible.

882
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:55,535
How to regulate the
eye contact.

883
00:46:55,535 --> 00:46:58,325
If it's too intense, it
can become bothersome.

884
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:02,915
If it lacks completely, then
people could conclude that you

885
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:05,682
are not really interested
or involved.

886
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:08,490
GUEST SPEAKER 1: The thing
that's important to keep in

887
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:11,910
mind with a psychiatric
patient is,

888
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:12,670
well, a couple things.

889
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,930
One is that mental health
patients are much more likely

890
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,670
to be the victims
of violence than

891
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,370
actually to commit violence.

892
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,490
And this is really the outlier,
the unusual case

893
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,340
where the psychiatric patient
becomes violent.

894
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,240
But obviously it's an
important situation.

895
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,090
It does happen frequently enough
to be a real concern

896
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,364
for the providers, for
their well being.

897
00:47:32,364 --> 00:47:39,810

898
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:41,980
Basically there's different
levels of what you have to

899
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,150
understand how to do.

900
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,135
One, how to protect yourself,
and then two, how to protect

901
00:47:46,135 --> 00:47:46,410
the patient.

902
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:50,752
It's almost like if your child
who's 11 years old comes at

903
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:53,440
you swinging, it's really
different than if you're

904
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,710
getting bumped on the subway
in terms of what

905
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,060
you're going to do.

906
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,370
Now the person who's sitting in
your office might be a lot

907
00:47:58,370 --> 00:47:59,160
bigger than your 11 year old.

908
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,240
But you kind of get the idea.

909
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,982
You're not trying to punish
them, you're not trying to

910
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,790
inflict any more harm on them
than is absolutely needed in

911
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,306
order to stop the situation
and for you to get

912
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,176
out, or let them out.

913
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:13,940
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Yes.

914
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:15,480
And that's important,
and that's somewhat

915
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,730
counter-intuitive.

916
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:20,450

917
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,906
I'm just thinking, I'm trying to
think in terms of potential

918
00:48:22,906 --> 00:48:28,870
simulation, and targets for
our training paradigm.

919
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:33,874
I think an important aspect is
for the person who is going to

920
00:48:33,874 --> 00:48:36,075
the training to understand
himself or herself.

921
00:48:36,075 --> 00:48:38,779
How what's the reaction when
you are threatened.

922
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:41,500
And how to continue to
think on your feet.

923
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,920
And take decisions that are not
based on a flight or fight

924
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,880
or tend and befriend attitude.

925
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,840
This is not about dealing
with a common situation.

926
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,810
This is when you have to
maintain your ability to

927
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,955
remain therapeutic and helpful
and to minimize harm to

928
00:48:58,955 --> 00:49:02,470
yourself and certainly harm
to the other person.

929
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:04,900
And the truth of the matter is
that many people in these

930
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:11,340
situations react the way that
they've always done.

931
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,540
I gave Jim the example of a
social worker I work with, who

932
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:19,660
every time when she is
confronted by a patient, she

933
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:24,633
gets angry and she gets
defensive and tells things to

934
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:26,820
her that I find are hurtful.

935
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:29,710
And they are just adding
gas to the fire.

936
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,640
I need to intervene because
you feel that it's almost

937
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,850
like, you know, I'm
there to umpire.

938
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:35,010
OK, time out.

939
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:35,440
Stop.

940
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,296
We need to do something else.

941
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:40,686
And I try to explain to her.

942
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,450
She just doesn't get it.

943
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:47,968
Or can theoretically figure
it out but doesn't do a

944
00:49:47,968 --> 00:49:49,270
very good job at it.

945
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,515
When we are angry or frightened,
our behavior, the

946
00:49:53,515 --> 00:49:57,100
way we talk, the way
we track, changes.

947
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,544
And those things can be major
triggers for the other person.

948
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:03,780
GUEST SPEAKER 1: If you're
staying really calm, and the

949
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:06,975
other person's escalating,
that's a real dampening force

950
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,780
on that other person from
escalating even more.

951
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,396
And it's really, really hard to
do, to stay professional.

952
00:50:13,396 --> 00:50:16,475
And recognizing that
this aggression is

953
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:17,910
really a medical symptom.

954
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:20,986
It's like if they are bleeding
on the floor.

955
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:23,070
The difference obviously is that
it could actually hurt

956
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,220
you, the provider.

957
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,435
But you need to recognize it
as a medical symptom that

958
00:50:26,435 --> 00:50:28,820
needs to be dealt with as
opposed to taking it really

959
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,287
personally, or you being
violent back.

960
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:35,810
GUEST SPEAKER 2: How
do you appear.

961
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:38,210
How do you--

962
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,038
obviously, being calm, centered,
self assured is

963
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:41,986
always helpful.

964
00:50:41,986 --> 00:50:45,320
It's the message that
you're conveying.

965
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,460
Often if you respond to anger
by being fearful or angry

966
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,505
yourself, obviously these
will just escalate.

967
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:58,970
Or if you're fidgety and
pacing, and gesturing

968
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:03,302
yourself, and wondering, so what
do I do now, I think the

969
00:51:03,302 --> 00:51:07,510
other person would clearly
pick up that feeling.

970
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:12,924
Touching most often than
not is not a good idea.

971
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:15,369
Even though instinctively we
would like to calm the other

972
00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:17,325
person down or wonder
what it is.

973
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:21,230
This is how we learn to show
empathy and that we care, we

974
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:21,730
want to help.

975
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:27,510
Well, it may not
be a good idea.

976
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:33,273
And then this could be
a topic in itself.

977
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:36,710
Active listening would
be the most--

978
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,147
if you want the buzzword,
in terms of the verbal

979
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:42,130
de-escalation principle.

980
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:46,650
Often when I'm called, and
many of my colleagues are

981
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:48,210
called in such situations.

982
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,670
I introduce myself.

983
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:53,246
I'm telling the person no
matter how agitated

984
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:55,745
he is why I'm here.

985
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:58,400
And I'm trying to understand.

986
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,260
I may not respond or react
to the person's curses or

987
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,200
threatening behavior.

988
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,490
Of course I try to maintain
a safe distance.

989
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,815
And I continue my assessment.

990
00:52:07,815 --> 00:52:11,305
Can I deal with this, or I need
help, or I need to stop

991
00:52:11,305 --> 00:52:13,916
and find another way.

992
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:19,800
And I give that person feedback
about what I see, how

993
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,628
he or she makes me feel.

994
00:52:21,628 --> 00:52:24,400
I feel you are threatening, I
feel uncomfortable, I think we

995
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:24,910
need to stop.

996
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,400
Do you want to talk?

997
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,580
What are the issues that
you're dealing with?

998
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:37,214
And I also explain and set
limits on what is acceptable

999
00:52:37,214 --> 00:52:39,120
and what is not acceptable.

1000
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,706
Often, that combination works.

1001
00:52:41,706 --> 00:52:44,910

1002
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:48,340
I listed pharmacotherapy and
seclusion restraint because

1003
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,280
they are part of the process,
and I think I would like

1004
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,670
people who are trained for this
to understand that those

1005
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:57,920
things are available.

1006
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,290

1007
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,757
Any questions so far?

1008
00:53:05,757 --> 00:53:11,625

1009
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:15,048
AUDIENCE: I've just got a
couple of comments on

1010
00:53:15,048 --> 00:53:16,026
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1011
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,612
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

1012
00:53:16,612 --> 00:53:17,004
We can do that.

1013
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:18,960
And also I wanted to suggest and
see what you think about

1014
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,924
this, if someone would like to
play the role of a patient, I

1015
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,575
can meet with you briefly and
just kind of prepare you to do

1016
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:28,170
that if anybody is interested
in taking the role of the

1017
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:28,685
aggressive patient.

1018
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:30,445
You'd like to do that?

1019
00:53:30,445 --> 00:53:33,910
Why don't you and I step out for
just a couple of minutes.

1020
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,385
And then [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

1021
00:53:36,385 --> 00:53:37,635
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1022
00:53:37,635 --> 00:53:42,820

1023
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:47,710
PROFESSOR: So there's a couple
of things that have been

1024
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:50,780
brought up already, immediately
seem to be

1025
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,830
possible places where you guys
can think of what you're doing

1026
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:57,070
to do your project on.

1027
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,690
There's identifying factors.

1028
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:04,850
There's a whole bunch of
different schemes and

1029
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:08,700
different metrics that people
have been using.

1030
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,410
All the way from known
personality types to

1031
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:16,790
socioeconomic factors and
personal history.

1032
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,400
You could make some kind
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1033
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,500
I can imagine, some sort of like
can you figure out enough

1034
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,290
information before
it's too late.

1035
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,266
The dynamic assessment of
violence seems to be more of a

1036
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,050
time pressure kind of thing.

1037
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,870
Because you almost have to
figure out on the spot.

1038
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,690
But factors are very
different.

1039
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,730
But similarly I can find
de-escalation.

1040
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:44,750

1041
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,270
It seems kind of interesting,
because it almost seems like

1042
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,840
you could make a word game.

1043
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,052
Or a face to face kind
of thing out of that.

1044
00:54:54,052 --> 00:54:59,645
Can you remember what you're
supposed to do in conversation

1045
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:03,110
with each other without
missing any of the

1046
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,100
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1047
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,080
And that might be something.

1048
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,980
That would be like a live
action game but not

1049
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,808
necessarily a physical game.

1050
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:12,550
It would be more like
a party game.

1051
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,160
GUEST SPEAKER 2: One way--

1052
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,295
this is, by the way, I didn't
want to go there to

1053
00:55:18,295 --> 00:55:19,080
make this too long.

1054
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,650
But these are some parts of a
standardized patient that I'm

1055
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:27,340
putting together, then I'm going
to try actually to talk

1056
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,538
to the simulation department
at UMass, to be

1057
00:55:30,538 --> 00:55:32,014
played by an actor.

1058
00:55:32,014 --> 00:55:37,060
And this would be the
training goals.

1059
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:40,465
And I'm really particularly
interested in how people

1060
00:55:40,465 --> 00:55:43,316
respond when they are exposed to
an angry situation or even

1061
00:55:43,316 --> 00:55:44,910
to an angry face.

1062
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,442
What do you have to
do in order to

1063
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:47,750
de-escalate the patient.

1064
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:55,620
And what I think I'm going to
suggest to the actor is that,

1065
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:58,130
you are in the room and you're
pacing up and down.

1066
00:55:58,130 --> 00:55:59,100
And appearing angry.

1067
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:03,170
And you're allowed to use some
generic swear words.

1068
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:06,170
And to have a number
of complaints.

1069
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:07,936
Could be a number of them.

1070
00:56:07,936 --> 00:56:10,150
Nurse was too late to give
me the medications.

1071
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,140
The girlfriend didn't
come in time.

1072
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,530
You owe money.

1073
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,509
You just had a job interview
today and you missed it

1074
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:18,540
because you're in
the hospital.

1075
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,930
Could be a number of things.

1076
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,050
And then the person
approaches you.

1077
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,660

1078
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:30,400
The trainee should follow some
rules in terms of the verbal

1079
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,040
and nonverbal de-escalation.

1080
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:37,270
If that person is able to engage
you, you can become

1081
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:41,890
less angry, less agitated,
more interested.

1082
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:45,910
Pacing less, lower your voice.

1083
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,970
If the trainee is just doing the
right or wrong things, you

1084
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:53,460
either stay at the same level
or get more and more angry.

1085
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,440
Of course, it's fairly demanding
for a standardized

1086
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,990
for an actor, because the
nonverbal elements are easy.

1087
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,250
How you regulate the distance.

1088
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:05,595
How you look, how
you approach.

1089
00:57:05,595 --> 00:57:10,055
You inhibit your natural
tendencies to pat the person

1090
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,370
on the shoulder, whatever.

1091
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,180
But the verbal aspects
are more difficult.

1092
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,410
AUDIENCE: Improvising dialog
on the spot is hard.

1093
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,615
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Exactly.

1094
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:21,290
But at the same time, the goals
of the dialog are not.

1095
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:25,410
Because you should probably find
out what's going on, even

1096
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,820
though, let's say, the actor
will try to tell you about his

1097
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,550
life, and how miserable
things are.

1098
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:34,200
You know, I lost my job,
and I was kicked out.

1099
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,850
But you need to try to
bring the person

1100
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:37,400
to what really happened.

1101
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,820
I think that's very, very
helpful because you're pinning

1102
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,630
down a particular conflict
that triggered it.

1103
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,680
And if you are able to
do that, then you

1104
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,340
can take some steps.

1105
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,980
OK.

1106
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,980
I have a patient right
now who has

1107
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:55,970
difficulty expressing herself.

1108
00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:01,045
And systematically there's one
particular shift where the

1109
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:04,010
staff is not patient, doesn't
wait for her.

1110
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,670
You just need to give her
a little bit more time.

1111
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,300
And she gets upset and angry
and starts pacing.

1112
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,105
And I have to every time say,
please, listen to her.

1113
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:15,225
Or she comes up to me, she tells
me the story and then I

1114
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,070
have to go back to the staff.

1115
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,900
People just don't have the
patience or don't care.

1116
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,600
So that's just a simple
intervention.

1117
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,660
This is why you need to find
out what's going on.

1118
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,480
And then, if you can get more
information about what brought

1119
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,724
the person to this place.

1120
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:33,690
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

1121
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:36,600
I think we're prepared.

1122
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:39,790
She did role play before
I showed this, because

1123
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,350

you want to do it?

00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:43,060
You've been trained.

00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:45,940
You're the expert actually.

1128
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,937
GUEST SPEAKER 2: OK.

1129
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:48,931
Alright.

1130
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:51,416

I respond to him
and I want him.

Why isn't he here?

Why?

this person?

to you right now.

can I help you?

But what else can I do?

1156
00:59:37,822 --> 00:59:38,786
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT: Um.

1157
00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:41,678

1158
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:42,642
Stop it.

I can talk about that.

1166
00:59:54,865 --> 00:59:57,526
So tell me what kind of problems
do you have with the

don't think the

medication is helpful?

And I know we haven't
met before.

But I'm here and trying
to be helpful to you.

01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:25,325
And when you get angry and
upset, you get to be

1208
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:25,820
intimidating.

1209
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,810
And there are other--

1210
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:29,285
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT: Is that
why you're going to poison me?

1211
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:29,780
Scared of me?

1212
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:30,770
GUEST SPEAKER 2: No.

1213
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,159
Well, I'm not trying
to hurt you.

1214
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:36,652
But we need to come up
with a solution.

1215
01:01:36,652 --> 01:01:38,648
Because you could get hurt and
other people could get hurt.

1216
01:01:38,648 --> 01:01:41,642
So we need to do something
about that.

1217
01:01:41,642 --> 01:01:43,638
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT: I would
be better off dead.

1218
01:01:43,638 --> 01:01:45,135
Everyone wants me dead.

1219
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:46,133
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well.

1220
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:50,624
I understand you're quite
distraught today.

1221
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:53,119
And I want to help you.

1222
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,614
I may not be able
to, right away.

1223
01:01:55,614 --> 01:02:03,099

1224
01:02:03,099 --> 01:02:09,586
I'm going to try to get the
nurse that you want.

1225
01:02:09,586 --> 01:02:12,580
But what if I do not get him?

1226
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,073
What's the next best thing?

1227
01:02:16,073 --> 01:02:17,323
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT:

1228
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:20,065

1229
01:02:20,065 --> 01:02:21,562
I don't know.

1230
01:02:21,562 --> 01:02:26,053
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Would it help
to contact your family?

1231
01:02:26,053 --> 01:02:27,550
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT:
Maybe mom.

1232
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:28,049
I want my mom.

1233
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:29,047
GUEST SPEAKER 2: OK.

1234
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:32,041
I can try to reach out to her.

1235
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,855
And do you think that if you
change the medications maybe

1236
01:02:35,855 --> 01:02:39,110
you can try a combination
that could help?

1237
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:41,013
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT: As long
as it's not poison.

1238
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:41,780
GUEST SPEAKER 2: OK.

1239
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,466
I hear you.

1240
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:46,424
You don't like the medication.

1241
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:48,396
You think that it's
hurting you.

1242
01:02:48,396 --> 01:02:50,368
But it's helped in the past.

1243
01:02:50,368 --> 01:02:54,805
And maybe a different
combination would be better.

1244
01:02:54,805 --> 01:02:55,298
Hmm?

1245
01:02:55,298 --> 01:02:56,284
ROLE PLAYING PATIENT: Maybe.

1246
01:02:56,284 --> 01:02:57,534
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Maybe?

1247
01:02:57,534 --> 01:03:02,228

1248
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:03,674
Well, thank you.

1249
01:03:03,674 --> 01:03:05,210
We can go on like this.

1250
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:13,130
[LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE]

1251
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,380
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1252
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:27,968

1253
01:03:27,968 --> 01:03:32,570
AUDIENCE: I have a question
concerning about the

1254
01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:37,288
disruption of narrative model
of why violence occurs.

1255
01:03:37,288 --> 01:03:41,320
Is that pretty much accepted
as the way--

1256
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,320
GUEST SPEAKER 2: I just
made it up for this.

1257
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,820
[LAUGHTER]

1258
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:47,300
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if there were competing,

1259
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,811
different theories, it might
be useful for people to

1260
01:03:50,811 --> 01:03:52,759
understand more than one model,
or is that [INAUDIBLE].

1261
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:58,190
GUEST SPEAKER 2: The narrative
perspective is, if you want, a

1262
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:00,000
cry from the past.

1263
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,731
I think the last 20 years,
in science and certainly

1264
01:04:03,731 --> 01:04:07,550
medicine, have been dominated
by hard evidence.

1265
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:12,316
Actually, the evidence-based
medicine has been taking over

1266
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:16,060
the entire world, as the
ultimate standard.

1267
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:22,430
So there are lists of the
strength of the evidence, and

1268
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:28,286
randomized controlled designs
are the best, and clinical

1269
01:04:28,286 --> 01:04:31,060
impression anecdotes
are the worst.

1270
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:38,090
So on this map, the narrative
or a person-like story about

1271
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:44,780
the patient may not be if you
want the accepted model today.

1272
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,538
But I think in dealing with
individual cases, I feel that

1273
01:04:49,538 --> 01:04:51,017
makes a lot of sense.

1274
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,870
When you have to deal with
somebody who is very

1275
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:57,560
distraught, if I tell him that
the best available evidence

1276
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,954
was published two years ago and
showed that, you know, 20

1277
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:05,930
milligrams of Abilify would work
best for psychosis, I'm

1278
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:08,663
not so sure that you
would fuel the

1279
01:05:08,663 --> 01:05:10,403
warmth and the empathy.

1280
01:05:10,403 --> 01:05:12,910

1281
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:15,180
But the reality, it
could be that that

1282
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,040
evidence is is right.

1283
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,260
He's psychotic.

1284
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:20,130
And he tried to a variety
of medications.

1285
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:23,080
Some of them made him fat and
pushed his triglycerides up

1286
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:25,365
and raised his blood pressure.

1287
01:05:25,365 --> 01:05:30,310
If I switch him to Abilify in
two months, he'll get better.

1288
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:37,600
But dealing with the immediate
issue, I think it's just, it's

1289
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,572
something else.

1290
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:41,609
And that knowledge about
medication, while helpful in

1291
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:42,470
the long run, will not
make it very good.

1292
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:46,500
So this is why I came up with
if you want, for the purpose

1293
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:53,210
of this meeting, with a way of
creating a metaphor that could

1294
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:58,130
sustain my verbal and nonverbal
de-escalation.

1295
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:03,720
I'm trying to create some sense,
some coherence, some

1296
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:07,046
meaning, some meaning
to that interaction.

1297
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:10,822
And in doing that, I'm empathic
and I'm trying to

1298
01:06:10,822 --> 01:06:14,430
channel the energies
in a way that it's

1299
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:15,860
almost like a beginning.

1300
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:16,370
He's distraught.

1301
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:17,450
He's ready to give up.

1302
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,715
He's ready to shut himself
away from the world.

1303
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:23,800
I'm trying to reach out to
him, without becoming his

1304
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:27,300
friend, without becoming
his brother or father.

1305
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,556
And I think in a sense
I'm restoring the

1306
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:32,230
meaning of his narrative.

1307
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,462
Somebody cares, somebody
reaches out.

1308
01:06:35,462 --> 01:06:38,060
PROFESSOR: Because it seems like
a very interesting system

1309
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:42,490
for people, for designers
to play with.

1310
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:45,100
The idea of trying, even though
there is this historic

1311
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:49,470
narrative, and you may not
know enough about the

1312
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:51,596
narrative to be able
to act on it.

1313
01:06:51,596 --> 01:06:53,303
But you'd find out things
about it by

1314
01:06:53,303 --> 01:06:54,920
talking to the patient.

1315
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:59,015
And what you're really trying
to do is make things fit

1316
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,955
within that person's
narrative.

1317
01:07:00,955 --> 01:07:03,290
GUEST SPEAKER 2: You're filling
the blanks that were

1318
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,450
kind of somewhat destroyed
by events.

1319
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:09,300
And it could be a variety
of events.

1320
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,190
And at times you have to
use your imagination.

1321
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:12,410
It's almost like intuition.

1322
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,450
I mean, I know the principles
from every case, but how I'm

1323
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:20,414
going to do it, it's
not pre-programmed.

1324
01:07:20,414 --> 01:07:24,150
PROFESSOR: Seems like that's
also something that you could

1325
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:26,700
then play with from a design
point of view.

1326
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,550
This idea of disruptive
narrative, and then how do you

1327
01:07:30,550 --> 01:07:31,570
put it back.

1328
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:36,210
Just like putting the pieces
back together [INAUDIBLE].

1329
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:38,352
GUEST SPEAKER 2: That may be
the reason-- and that's

1330
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:40,320
another speculation, I'm
just making this up--

1331
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:44,200
why adventure games
are so powerful.

1332
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,100
Because, in a sense, you're
finding a substitute narrative

1333
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:50,622
that is much more controllable
than your own.

1334
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:55,230
And for the time of the
game you're there.

1335
01:07:55,230 --> 01:07:59,500
It's almost like you're buying
a few minutes, 10 minutes, 20

1336
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,500
minutes of a different
story line.

1337
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,690
PROFESSOR: Actually, one of
our researchers here looks

1338
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,212
specifically at adventure
games.

1339
01:08:05,212 --> 01:08:07,570
And her point of view is that
playing adventure games is

1340
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:12,440
like being a performer who
hasn't been given the script.

1341
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,080
You're still an actor in the
story, and you have to figure

1342
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,454
out what that story is in
order to move it along.

1343
01:08:17,454 --> 01:08:23,190

1344
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,819
There's one other thing that
I do want to bring up.

1345
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:28,550
Obviously, I don't want any of
these games that you guys are

1346
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:33,819
working on to be quizzes, to be
really fun quizzes, even.

1347
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:36,219
[INAUDIBLE]

1348
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:37,819
all this stuff is about.

1349
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:40,097
I do want you guys to
be learning games.

1350
01:08:40,097 --> 01:08:43,061
And not just Trivial Pursuit,
Psychiatric Version.

1351
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:47,020

1352
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:48,809
That's kind of pointless.

1353
01:08:48,809 --> 01:08:51,600
We have had games in the past
in this class where people

1354
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,526
basically pulled questions out
of a hat and had to answer

1355
01:08:55,526 --> 01:08:57,490
them, with various penalties.

1356
01:08:57,490 --> 01:08:59,904
Kind of fun, but that's
not what I've been

1357
01:08:59,904 --> 01:09:01,729
teaching you guys.

1358
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:03,550
So try to think about systems.

1359
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:07,532
Try to think about all these
things that they want their

1360
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:09,390
trainees to learn.

1361
01:09:09,390 --> 01:09:12,892
Think about how they can engage
with the system, in

1362
01:09:12,892 --> 01:09:14,868
some small way, for
your project.

1363
01:09:14,868 --> 01:09:19,314

1364
01:09:19,314 --> 01:09:20,796
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
a question?

1365
01:09:20,796 --> 01:09:23,760
What are your thoughts, or what
are the field's thoughts

1366
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,670
on lying to people, so
mitigate a situation.

1367
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,485

1368
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:36,120
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Well, I would
call lying a distortion, in a

1369
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,745
very general way.

1370
01:09:39,745 --> 01:09:45,222
And when people lie, they
have to make a decision.

1371
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:49,614
Often, people lie for a
variety of reasons.

1372
01:09:49,614 --> 01:09:54,006
What I always am surprised by is
the reason to make friends,

1373
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:57,422
to get friendly, to resolve
a situation.

1374
01:09:57,422 --> 01:10:05,175
And I don't believe in lying
as a communication tool.

1375
01:10:05,175 --> 01:10:09,925
Given, it may make things
easier in the short run.

1376
01:10:09,925 --> 01:10:13,818
Certainly clinically
it's not helpful.

1377
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:17,269
I was telling you about patients
with borderline

1378
01:10:17,269 --> 01:10:20,720
pathology that has this
affective and relational

1379
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:24,690
instability that is basically
taking over their lives.

1380
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:28,427
They are some of the most
accurate lie detectors that

1381
01:10:28,427 --> 01:10:29,160
you can imagine.

1382
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,320
You cannot design something
more perfect than that.

1383
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,750
Especially having been in the
system for a long time.

1384
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,152
They can feel the lie even
before it comes up.

1385
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:40,582
And if you're going that
path with them.

1386
01:10:40,582 --> 01:10:44,230
AUDIENCE: So this role play,
for example, if you told

1387
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,070
Bobby, well, let
me go get John.

1388
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:47,420
You wait here for a minute.

1389
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,210
And then you know that John
is not working right now.

1390
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:51,550
He's nowhere in the hospital.

1391
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:54,430
But you just told him that to
safely get out, then you get

1392
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:56,890
security to come back in
with you, and you can

1393
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:57,445
subdue him or something.

1394
01:10:57,445 --> 01:10:59,666
GUEST SPEAKER 2: That's
a great example.

1395
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:01,986
And that happens all the time.

1396
01:11:01,986 --> 01:11:05,420
Because often when you're in
this place, many of your

1397
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,920
requests are unreasonable.

1398
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,150
So you need to set
some limits.

1399
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,752
And eventually you'll end
up setting some limits.

1400
01:11:13,752 --> 01:11:15,730
He could have continued to
escalate until attacking me,

1401
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:18,352
breaking everything
in the room.

1402
01:11:18,352 --> 01:11:22,708
I usually tell them about how
they make others feel.

1403
01:11:22,708 --> 01:11:27,548
How unacceptable some of their
behaviors are, and what are

1404
01:11:27,548 --> 01:11:28,516
the consequences.

1405
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:33,074
So I'm going to probably tell
you if this continues, I don't

1406
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:36,278
have any other choice but to
call security and you may end

1407
01:11:36,278 --> 01:11:36,490
up in restraints.

1408
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,442
And with a chemical medication,
it could be

1409
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:40,900
injectable, you can
take it by mouth.

1410
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:45,168
So I'm coming up front with how
the next few minutes, the

1411
01:11:45,168 --> 01:11:47,144
proximal future, looks like.

1412
01:11:47,144 --> 01:11:50,780
As opposed to kind of fudge it
and get on his friendly side,

1413
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,918
and, oh I don't mean anything,
but the security will put you

1414
01:11:54,918 --> 01:11:56,072
in restraints.

1415
01:11:56,072 --> 01:12:01,050
So I don't want to buy him out
by just becoming his friend.

1416
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,050
If that involves lying--

1417
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:05,190
that's-- some people do it.

1418
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:06,130
When you're in the
corner, you're--

1419
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:08,325
OK, so what do I do now.

1420
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:09,890
A little lie won't hurt.

1421
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,095
And you do it.

1422
01:12:11,095 --> 01:12:12,292
Maybe it's just my--

1423
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:14,020
GUEST SPEAKER 1: What you just
mentioned too, that sort of

1424
01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:15,974
like good cop, bad cop.

1425
01:12:15,974 --> 01:12:19,140
Well, I wish we could have more
of a conversation here,

1426
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,110
but security needs to put
you in restraints.

1427
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,290
Security's the bad guy.

1428
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,610
When that's exactly
where you want the

1429
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,801
patient to be anyways.

but you know Jim.

1439
01:12:38,244 --> 01:12:40,745
AUDIENCE: I guess my followup is
would you ever sneakily put

1440
01:12:40,745 --> 01:12:42,940
medicine in someone's food or do
something [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1441
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:48,716
GUEST SPEAKER 2: It's not only
a lawsuit waiting to happen,

1442
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:54,080
of a major magnitude, but I
don't think it's right.

1443
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,566
Even though probably reality
is that family members and

1444
01:12:58,566 --> 01:13:01,458
sometimes even providers in
nursing homes may do that.

1445
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:04,006
But I think it's--

1446
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:07,010
GUEST SPEAKER 1: You may need
to treat the person against

1447
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:09,450
their will, which is often
meaning putting them into

1448
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,640
physical restraints, which is
usually like leather kind of

1449
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,800
things, kind of a straitjacket
thing, or maybe to a bed.

1450
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,480
And maybe physically inject them
with something to really

1451
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:18,420
sedate them.

1452
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,174
But you should always be telling
them what you're going

1453
01:13:20,174 --> 01:13:20,990
to do, right.

1454
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,230
And the reason why
you're doing it.

1455
01:13:23,230 --> 01:13:24,895
Even if they don't have any
choice in the matter.

1456
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:27,780
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And if you feel
that the person is unable

1457
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:35,490
to comprehend, then you may
need to work towards

1458
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,700
appointing a guardian
who will take

1459
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:39,240
decisions for that person.

1460
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,810
And it's not necessarily that
the legal field has pushed

1461
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,940
itself very hard in field.

1462
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:46,390
But I think it's fair.

1463
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,250
You meet the person where
that person is at,

1464
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:49,550
and try to be helpful.

1465
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,010
And I think, in my view, there
is no substitute for being

1466
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:55,390
upfront and saying this is
what's going to happen.

1467
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,490
He may not be my best friend,
but he knows exactly.

1468
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:02,873
I'm telling the patients often
ahead what's going to happen.

1469
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:05,010
In that sense, I'm giving
them choices.

1470
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:07,279
So if I end up taking
them to court for

1471
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:08,700
commitment, they know that.

1472
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:13,220
And you would be surprised
how angry they are at the

1473
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:15,386
beginning and how OK
they are later.

1474
01:14:15,386 --> 01:14:18,580
And how often they come up to
me and say, thank you, I was

1475
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:23,480
in a very bad space and I didn't
want to, and I fought

1476
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,950
you all the way but I think that
was the best solution.

1477
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:28,380
I don't necessarily do that
to get that thanks.

1478
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,340
I just do it as a principle.

1479
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,820
Often it doesn't come.

1480
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,200
It's not like people
are grateful.

1481
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,880
Often they leave the hospital.

little of this training, just

1483
01:14:39,505 --> 01:14:39,880
a few minutes.

1484
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,580
This is a project I've been
working on a lot for NASA,

1485
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:47,920
which is basically to develop a
mental health support system

1486
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,410
for the long duration
space cruise.

1487
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,730
And this is kind of a
whole other topic.

1488
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:54,880
But just one piece of this was
teaching the astronauts how to

1489

manage conflict, interpersonal
conflict more

You can roll your mouse over
them to hear how they're said.

Even though some options are
more likely than others to

1531
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,360
reduce the conflict, I recommend
that you try out

options you might not
choose in real life.

01:17:47,193 --> 01:17:50,990
It's four months into your
mission, with five and a half

1546
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:51,820
left to go.

1547
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:54,790
So far, the mission's been
going pretty well.

1548
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:58,750
But you're both tired, having
had to sleep shift last night.

1549
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:03,205

1551
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,530
Is your display getting
squirrelly?

1552
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:08,580
Shoot, mine too.

1553
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:11,108
Damn, I think the whole
system's down.

1554
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:12,972
It was the wrong cable.

1555
01:18:12,972 --> 01:18:16,360
When I was installing
the recorder I

1556
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,350
disconnected the A10 cable.

1557
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:21,433
I fixed it right away but
I think it screwed

1558
01:18:21,433 --> 01:18:22,390
up the whole system.

1559
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:25,260
Look, if ground calls, don't
tell them about the cable.

1560

Ah, this is a tricky
situation.

1563
01:18:31,782 --> 01:18:35,149
You believe it's important to
tell the ground what happened.

1564
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:38,690
At the same time, you don't want
Chuck to get in trouble.

1565
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,630
What's your response?

1567
01:18:42,030 --> 01:18:44,110
They'll spend hours trying
to figure this out.

1568
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:45,185
We got to tell them.

1569
01:18:45,185 --> 01:18:47,520
What's wrong with telling
the ground.

me in a bad position.

01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:07,904
I have no idea.

1586
01:19:07,904 --> 01:19:08,790
Yeah I know.

1587
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:12,351
I already got the
reboot started.

1588
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:17,420
No, I guess it's too early to
say what the impact is.

Roger that.

1590
01:19:17,905 --> 01:19:20,060
I'll let you know if
it happens again.

the ground.

1596
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:33,152
You're worried that this might
backfire on you, if the ground

1597
01:19:33,152 --> 01:19:34,960
finds out that you knew
what happened.

1598
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:37,090
This makes you very
angry at Chuck.

1599
01:19:37,090 --> 01:19:39,450

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

1601
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:42,440
GUEST SPEAKER 1: The reason I'm
showing you this is that

1602
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,820
this is one approach that I've
taken to teaching how to

1603
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:47,410
handle an interaction with
somebody through sort of a

1604
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:47,880
simulation.

1605
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,750
Now this is obviously
not a game.

1606
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:50,170
There's no score.

1607
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,220
There's no time limit.

1608
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:54,060
It's more of an interactive
movie.

1609
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:57,570
But with the teaching points
here, just like what Cesar's

1610
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:00,870
given you is, we can give this
to an astronaut and they'll

1611
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:04,050
read it in 5-10 minutes and say,
yup, got it, what's the

1612
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:04,760
next thing.

1613
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,820
That doesn't mean they actually
can use it, remember

1614
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,420
it, absorbed it.

1615
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,745
and I'm not saying that
this is the way they

1616
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:11,600
should do your games.

1617
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:17,395
But that this is one approach
that we've taken to try to get

1618
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:20,730
them more involved with the
material in more of a

1619
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:21,910
simulated way.

1620
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:24,500
We can just do maybe one
or two more of this.

little detail, alright?

Plus if we do tell them, next
thing you know we're going to

Even though Chuck seems
exasperated, you know what's

1634
01:20:44,135 --> 01:20:45,290
going on in his mind.

1635
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:47,970

1637
01:20:49,383 --> 01:20:52,855

to know what happened.

01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,910
real delays.

1724
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:17,170
Anyway.

1725
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:21,090
So I think what I'm going to
do is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1726
01:24:21,090 --> 01:24:22,340
this class.

1727
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:25,590

1728
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:28,525
If there are teams who are
really wanting to do a live

1729
01:24:28,525 --> 01:24:31,550
action game, and they want to
get a head start on that, talk

1730
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:32,560
to me directly.

1731
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:37,150
And maybe what we can do is,
meet up with you as a team.

1732
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:40,220
And try to get some
of ideas across.

1733
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:43,450
Do a brainstorming with me.

1734
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,610
I will also get into talking
about live action games the

1735
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:47,907
following week.

1736
01:24:47,907 --> 01:24:50,769
I'll schedule one of the
classes for that.

1737
01:24:50,769 --> 01:24:54,130
So we're not going to
miss that topic.

1738
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,880
I just worried that if we get
to it too late, and you are

1739
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,470
making live action games, then
you don't have enough material

1740
01:24:58,470 --> 01:24:59,720
to work with.

1741
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:06,590

1742
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:10,520
Finally, about this assignment,
if the subject

1743
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:16,436
matter is at all uncomfortable
for you to work with, and you

1744
01:25:16,436 --> 01:25:22,620
can't really find something in
this fairly large topic that

1745
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,531
you will be comfortable working
with and you can't

1746
01:25:25,531 --> 01:25:28,720
find a team, talk
to me directly.

1747
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,950
And we can work out some
other assignment.

1748
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,270
I can't say that I have an
assignment in my back pocket

1749
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:37,930
all ready to go, and more
likely than not, I'm

1750
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,799
half-assing it too.

1751
01:25:40,799 --> 01:25:45,629
I would much prefer folks to
work on this problem that I

1752
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:46,595
think is fascinating.

1753
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:50,459
And a pretty big problem that
you can find some small

1754
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:51,425
project that you're
comfortable with.

1755
01:25:51,425 --> 01:25:56,080
But if you are, I don't want to
make anyone uncomfortable

1756
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,580
due to [INAUDIBLE].

1757
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:58,830
So just talk to me.

1758
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:04,956
