14
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,620
PROFESSOR: OK, so today, we have
a guest lecturer, Clara.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,102
Some of you have probably
already taken her class.

16
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:42,050
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,472
My current victims.

18
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:44,894
PROFESSOR: And past victims.

19
00:00:44,894 --> 00:00:46,316
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

20
00:00:46,316 --> 00:00:47,840
PROFESSOR: We'll probably
need to do

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,786
something about the lights.

22
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:53,732
[INAUDIBLE].

23
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,180
I'm still operating on
Tylenol and caffeine.

25
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,950
So today we're going to talk
about stories in games.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,690
And Clara teaches not just the
Intro to Video Game Studies

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,955
class, but also the Writing
for Video Games

28
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:11,320
class in the spring.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,284
I wanted her to come in and
bring her expertise because

30
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,588
she's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
probably a

31
00:01:17,588 --> 00:01:19,218
lot more than I have.

32
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:22,641

33
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,597
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Hello, perfect.

34
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:25,847
[INAUDIBLE].

35
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:28,020

36
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,622
So yeah, Philip asked me to
come here and talk about

37
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:35,632
stories in games, and as far
as I remember, he said you

38
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:38,250
guys had to read two
articles for today.

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,476
Chapter four in [INAUDIBLE]

40
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:45,859
and Soren Johnson's Theme
is Not Meaning.

41
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,853
Didn't I [INAUDIBLE], too?

42
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:49,851
PROFESSOR: Yes.

43
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,348
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
And he's late, OK.

44
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:51,847
PROFESSOR: Shh!

45
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:53,843
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: [LAUGHS]

46
00:01:53,843 --> 00:01:57,085
Anyway, so preparing
this has been kind

47
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:59,590
of interesting because--

48
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,295
I thought about this quite a bit
because there's this focus

49
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:08,820
in my research studying how
games and stories can be

50
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,590
brought together.

51
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,870
What does it mean to have
a story in a game?

52
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,260
Where do we put the story?

53
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,700
But the interesting challenge
was thinking, well, the guys

54
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,970
are working mostly on
non-visual games.

55
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,320
And what do stories have to do
with non-fictional games.

56
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,690
So here what I'm going to need
is your input, because you

57
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,820
guys have been playing all these
board games, card games,

58
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,700
and I want a bit of your input
of what you think.

59
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,260
How you think these concepts
apply to non-digital games,

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,110
because the part of digital
games I can do pretty

61
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:44,365
confidently.

62
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,710
But I don't know as much about
board games or card games.

63
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,995
So I need your expertise.

64
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:50,865
This is why you guys are here.

65
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:54,160
So the first thing that I wanted
to ask you about is

66
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,350
that we have two different
meetings, and one is sort of

67
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,320
about fiction and the other
is sort of about theme.

68
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,666
But what is the fiction
of a game?

69
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:04,916
I turn it to you.

70
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:07,860

71
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,816
AUDIENCE: The fiction of a game
is, well, whatever you

72
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,700
want it to be.

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,564
It could be the characters
in a digital game.

74
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,500
It could be a real environment,
but you just have

75
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:18,920
fictional characters.

76
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,670
It could be an environment
that may not exist.

77
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,310
It's pretty much up to the
designer to figure out what

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,930
they want to--

79
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,850
like with [INAUDIBLE] be in the
game that are real, or if

80
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,841
they want it to be fiction.

81
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:39,400
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Well,
there's something there, but

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,990
it might be a bit more
intuitive than that.

83
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,236
I think that you're on
the right track, yes.

84
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,600
AUDIENCE: I'd say it's the
setting or the universe in

85
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,680
which the user perceives the
events of the game to take

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,880
place in, or the one that the
designer intends the user to

87
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,750
see the game take place in.

88
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,760
AUDIENCE: OK, so
you can mention

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,340
environment as the big--

90
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,650
what was the word you used--

91
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:08,470
the universe, the setting,
something like that.

92
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:08,940
Back there.

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,825
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, I was going
to say that the word that is

94
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,024
used over and over is world.

95
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:14,838
It's just a world,
pretty much.

96
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,529
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: And
that's the keyword.

97
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,350
When [UNINTELLIGIBLE] is talking
about fiction, he's

98
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,340
really talking all throughout
about fictional worlds.

99
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,540
In a way, designing games and
designing video games

100
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,242
specifically, is always thinking
about what is the

101
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:32,890
world of this game.

102
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,120
And at times there might be
games that don't have worlds.

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
You can make Tetris.

104
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,110
You could make--

105
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,000
There's very few video
games without worlds.

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,250
But there are some.

107
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,000
Tetris--

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,840
AUDIENCE: Peggle.

109
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,110
So does Peggle.

110
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,840
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Peggle?

111
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,560
Well, Peggle has characters,
you know.

112
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
You were talking about this.

113
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,335
Characters are already
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in fiction.

114
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,420
AUDIENCE: You said it has
nothing to do with unicorns.

115
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,670
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes.

116
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,190

117
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,141
Who wants to say something?

118
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,494
We have two hands here.

119
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:01,300
AUDIENCE: I'm stealing it.

120
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,960
OK, in print or with board
games, I think of fiction much

121
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,400
more as the specific explicit
things they give you, like the

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,380
pictures, the rules, and all of
that stuff versus what it

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,380
feels like you're doing.

124
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,070
So if they don't specifically
tell you you're in blah place,

125
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,420
then that's not part
of the fiction.

126
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,940
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
OK, yeah.

127
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,350
So you put your finger on it,
but when we're talking about

128
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,780
non-digital games, there are
some non-digital games where

129
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,940
thinking about worlds
is a bit shaky.

130
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,360
Do you want to say something?

131
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just going to
add that in an environment,

132
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,770
you have a set of things
you can do.

133
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,570
So you're basically
given rules.

134
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,250
Like in a board game, you could
be given a character

135
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,890
that has to jump for
some reason.

136
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,947
The board game could
say that they could

137
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:47,820
jump some insane distance.

138
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,110
Well, in real life, they
can't do that.

139
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,330
That's just part
of the fiction.

140
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,316
So it's whatever laws apply
within that world, as well.

141
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:56,060
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: This is
a very interesting point

142
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,660
because when you were
talking about--

143
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,400
what's that word
that he uses--

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,645
incongruous worlds?

145
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:03,030
Incoherent, incoherent.

146
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,410
He talks about incoherent
worlds, and it's like, well,

147
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,390
incoherent according to what?

148
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,940
It's obviously not the rules
that are also creating part of

149
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,845
the fiction.

150
00:06:08,845 --> 00:06:15,060
The rules are also creating what
are the laws of gravity

151
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,020
in a specific world that we are
playing in, for example.

152
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,370
So when we're talking about
fiction, we're mainly talking

153
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,010
about fictional world.

154
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,960
Now, how does that
relate to theme?

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,105
And you were already kind
of hinting at that.

156
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,190
That in fiction and board games,
it's kind of like,

157
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,750
well, it almost can
be about anything.

158
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,380
But what is the theme of a g--
when you-- if you remember

159
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,390
Soren Johnson's discussion--

160
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,950
what does he refer
to as a theme?

161
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,800
He is not an academic, so he
has a more wobbly, loose

162
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,250
definition.

163
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,500
What is the theme of a game?

164
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,431

165
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,683
AUDIENCE: The theme of the game
is what the designer says

166
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,970
to the player, this is what
the game is about.

167
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,870

168
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,310
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
But when--

169
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,995
Soren Johnson is saying
theme is not meaning.

170
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:10,560

171
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,360
So he's making a point that
theme might not be what the

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,192
game is about.

173
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:15,650
Right?

174
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,400
AUDIENCE: This is what the
game designer tells you.

175
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah.

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,533
The example that he gives is
Ticket to Ride, right?

177
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:26,350
And Ticket to Ride is not
about riding trains.

178
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,240
It's about--

179
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,750
it's about--

180
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,170
well, the description is
about going from one

181
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,610
end to another, right?

182
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

183
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,050
And travelling across--

184
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,490
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Is building--

185
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,970
AUDIENCE: It's about travelling

186
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,110
across the United States.

187
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,080
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But is it
really travelling, or is it

188
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,850
building the--

189
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,442
AUDIENCE: It's not even
a story about--

190
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:46,834
the story's about travelling.

191
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,410
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, the
story's about travelling,

192
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,460
that's the theme.

193
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,535
But what you actually do is--

194
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:57,280
AUDIENCE: The official story
is that I think it's some

195
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,655
number of years after the events
that were Around the

196
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:03,930
World in Eighty Days, and to
commemorate that, the original

197
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,140
people who were involved in
that race decided they're

198
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,134
going to race across
America in trains.

199
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:10,882
And that is the theme of the
game, according to--

200
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:12,485
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
that's the theme of the game.

201
00:08:12,485 --> 00:08:15,190
AUDIENCE: Well, that sort of
what drives to the point of

202
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,770
what Sorenson's talking about,
that when theme and meaning

203
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,580
are incongruous--

204
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,190
as they are in Ticket to Ride to
an extreme extent-- it can

205
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,381
actually turn people off from
the game sometimes.

206
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,236
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Well, and it's not

207
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:25,840
that it's a bad game--

208
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,610
AUDIENCE: Or Halo Wars.

209
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,980
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Well,
not necessarily.

210
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,175
AUDIENCE: The thing about Halo
Wars was that it sounded like

211
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,210
you bought it thinking it was
going to be an action game,

212
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,301
then got disappointed
and were like, blah!

213
00:08:33,301 --> 00:08:35,330
AUDIENCE: In the case with
Ticket to Ride, it is pretty

214
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,570
much just what they were
saying there, right?

215
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,210
That the theme seems to just
be whoever it is that wrote

216
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,927
the instruction booklet say that
you're doing, which may

217
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,672
not necessarily have anything
to do with the actual

218
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:49,270
mechanics of the game.

219
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,070
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
I have the game.

220
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,855
I didn't know if you guys
have played it.

221
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:52,720
I made you want to play it.

222
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,620
[INAUDIBLE]

223
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,910
As of right now,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

224
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,400
is a game called Too Many Cooks,
and it seems to be

225
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,026
about cooking.

226
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:05,720
Yeah, you have ingredients,
and you're

227
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,160
making a soup of sorts.

228
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,050
But really what you're doing
is resource management and

229
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,920
exchanging.

230
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,690
Just imagine being a cook and
having to, like, well, I have

231
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,805
to wait until I get the right
ingredient or maybe exchange

232
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:18,970
it for another.

233
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,370
That's not how you
cook really.

234
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,700
So there's always the clash of
how the fiction of the game

235
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,720
relates to the rules.

236
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,050
And the interesting distinction
between fiction

237
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,612
and theme is that theme seems
to be like a layer, seems to

238
00:09:33,612 --> 00:09:36,320
be like a decoration.

239
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,970
At times, it can be
part of the title.

240
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,170
It can be how the tokens
look like, or what

241
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,150
the board looks like.

242
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,620
That is setting up the
fiction of the game.

243
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,810
Not the fiction, the theme.

244
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,930
But it doesn't really have
a fictional world.

245
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,260
When when you're playing Ticket
to Ride or when you're

246
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,055
playing Settlers, you
have a feeling

247
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,305
like you're in a world.

248
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:00,498

249
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:04,980
AUDIENCE: At least, more
so than Ticket to Ride.

250
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,320
So, I will argue that maybe the
world that you feel is not

251
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,130
that they're telling you
that you're in, right?

252
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,800
One of the problems of Ticket
to Ride is that you never

253
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,100
really feel these characters
exist.

254
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,426
But the world of the United
States is very, very present.

255
00:10:23,426 --> 00:10:27,175
Like the positioning of the
cities, the fact that these

256
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:31,250
cities exist and can be
connected by land is very--

257
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,360
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: You guys
have read the levels of

258
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,610
abstraction?

259
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,610
Talked about levels of
abstraction here at all?

260
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,413
PROFESSOR: Not in great
detail, but--

261
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,670
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK, it's
the idea that it's a world,

262
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,385
but the way that it works is so
abstracted that it doesn't

263
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,230
really-- you're not in
a world anymore.

264
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,860
It's just these little
bits and pieces.

265
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,560
OK, we have fiction and
we have theme, but

266
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,510
we also have stories.

267
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,790
And what do stories have
to do with this?

268
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,460
How do we have the story
in non-digital games?

269
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,525
What principle--

270
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:03,860
a story--

271
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm going to find it for
you to save time.

272
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,540
A story is a series of connected
events that involve

273
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,300
characters.

274
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,260
So those characters perform
actions, or there are

275
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,940
happenings, things that happen
to them, and those actions

276
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,580
happen in time and in a
specific setting, in a

277
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,950
specific place.

278
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,700
And in the case of games, they
also involve objects.

279
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,730
That's like my telegraphic
version of what a story is.

280
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,720
So what we do in games, in
games we have changes of

281
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,730
state, right?

282
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,680
Every step of a non-digital
game, particularly.

283
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,660
We can think about non-digital
games as changes of state, and

284
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,790
having a change of state can
constitute an event.

285
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,120
So that is one way.

286
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,990
So how do we generate rules that
generate changes of state

287
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,080
that can be thought of as
an event in the story?

288
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,580
But I want to know a bit more.

289
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,650
Of the games that you've
played so far, how can

290
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,510
non-digital games--

291
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,805
and maybe you've played more
board than card games than

292
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:11,770
anything, but--

293
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,190
how can we have a story?

294
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,290
How can we have those
events happen?

295
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,495
AUDIENCE: So one game that I've
played that has a really

296
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,000
nice story to it is Battlestar
Galactica.

297
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,470
In a way, that places--

298
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,784
it works off of what the
player already knows.

299
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:27,270
So it sort of assumes that the
player has a knowledge of the

300
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,760
Battlestar Galactica world,
and so it keeps

301
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,756
referring to that.

302
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:33,246
Whenever you play a card that
has special abilities,

303
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:37,014
[INAUDIBLE], so it relies
on previous knowledge.

304
00:12:37,014 --> 00:12:38,802
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: That's
a very good point.

305
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:40,680
The point of--

306
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,690
in digital games and non-digital
games, but is also

307
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,790
in digital games--

308
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,370
a lot of storytelling in games
happens in the player's head.

309
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,240
Is it evoking [INAUDIBLE]

310
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,190
, is tapping on the player's
knowledge.

311
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,270
Is not, as we've got to say,
is not so much about

312
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,030
storytelling, but like,
OK, what do you know?

313
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,090
We are making the player
fill in the gaps.

314
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,640
So that designing a game that
involves storytelling is

315
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,180
usually giving cues to the
player to create the story, if

316
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,570
that makes sense.

317
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,415
Patrick?

318
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:17,290
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
that a lot of board and card

319
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,415
games, a lot of the fiction just
comes from the metaphors

320
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,930
of the mechanics.

321
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,650
So, for example, in Settlers,
when you want to build a road,

322
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,010
if you strip away all the
fiction, it's just I have

323
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,780
these cards, I put them down,
I can put this piece here.

324
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,500
But adding the fiction to it,
you say now, I'm not just

325
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,170
putting cards down, I'm using
the resources to build a road.

326
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,360
And so that metaphorical
action is another

327
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,630
event in the story.

328
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,790
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Well, it
becomes a meaningful action.

329
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,540
That's another--

330
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,310
I'm sure that you guys have
been talking about that.

331
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,600
What is a meaningful action?

332
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,300
And at times, meaningful action
is it constitutes a

333
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,880
story event.

334
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,995
Yeah.

335
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:00,290
AUDIENCE: I think the whole
point of Munchkin and and

336
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,750
Shiggy and those games are
to construct stories.

337
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,620
When we played it, there was a
moment when someon trashed

338
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,080
someone else's shrooms, and then
the other person played a

339
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,020
Go Dumpster Diving card to go
pick up the shrooms and a bong

340
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,810
from the dumpster.

341
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:21,330
And this whole sequence of
events, the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

342
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,870
text on the cards, what they
were, and the actions you were

343
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,620
taking, and you string them all
together, I did this, and

344
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,040
this happened, and this happened
with this object, and

345
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,540
you've got a perfect story,
because you know you're

346
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,620
playing the geek, and that--

347
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,464
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Well, there's that.

348
00:14:32,464 --> 00:14:35,000
But the other thing that is good
about Munchkin is that

349
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,890
reading the cards is fun.

350
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,990
There are bits of the story
you'll get in Munchkin that

351
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,810
are like, [INAUDIBLE].

352
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,430
That is kind of like
engaging already.

353
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,630
Oh, and you wanted
to say something?

354
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,550
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
say that there are some games

355
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,470
which are entirely about
telling stories.

356
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,950
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Thank you.

357
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,418
AUDIENCE: Role-playing games are
the number one, and then

358
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:53,452
another example is something
like Once Upon a Time, which I

359
00:14:53,452 --> 00:14:57,060
think is [INAUDIBLE].

360
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,625
And then they have, also,
The Adventures of Baron

361
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,900
Munchausen, if you've
ever seen--

362
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,650
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes.

363
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,530
Oh, I should bring it, yes.

364
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,380
I have it in my office.

365
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,480
Thought that's kind of
difficult to set

366
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,160
up in half an hour.

367
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,400
But yes.

368
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,940
AUDIENCE: And actually, a friend
of mine invented a game

369
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,590
which is vaguely based on
The Adventures of Baron

370
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,387
Munchausen, where each person
is telling a story and they

371
00:15:16,387 --> 00:15:19,598
have cards in front of them
which needs to be flipped over

372
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:21,080
by incorporating the elements
of the story into

373
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,550
their hand of cards--

374
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,305
Anyway, don't worry about it.

375
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:28,550
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you're going a
bit faster, but that's fine

376
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,940
because yeah, there are games
that are about storytelling,

377
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,640
communal storytelling,
and role-playing

378
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,500
games are about that.

379
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,080
And again, as game designers,
what we are given when we have

380
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,060
the rule book from D&D
is a fictional

381
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,870
world that has rules.

382
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:48,150
But then we have, as a designer,
as a DM, we are

383
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,930
coming up with what
is the situation?

384
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,180
What is the world?

385
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,710
What is the the specific
challenges that we're

386
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,950
situating in this world?

387
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,920
How are we going to do that?

388
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,810
But it's about communal
storytelling.

389
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,040
As we're going to see in a
minute, there are also games

390
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,000
that are about coming
up with stories.

391
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,970
We're being thrown in
a similar way--

392
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,650
well, in Munchkin, you're
kind of constructing the

393
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,730
story as you go.

394
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,310
But in the games that we're
going to play today, or some

395
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,230
of you are, like Gloom or Once
Upon a Time, the game is being

396
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,180
able to produce a narrative.

397
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,110
Being able to make sense given
the specific cues.

398
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,660
You've had your hand up?

399
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,376
AUDIENCE: I was going to do the
opposite extreme of a game

400
00:16:24,376 --> 00:16:29,420
with a very basic story, and you
kind of make a story up as

401
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,700
you go along, but it's not
really that crazy.

402
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,450
This card game, Falling, where
pretty much the pretense is

403
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,460
you are [UNINTELLIGIBLE], and
you're falling to your demise.

404
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:46,250
And so while you guys are
falling, you guys decide we'll

405
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,820
make a contest of who hits
the ground last.

406
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,630
And so it's a real-time game,
and you're dealt cards in

407
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,775
order, and it keeps
going until you

408
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:53,690
reach the ground card.

409
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,350
And so you can attack
other people.

410
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,427
OK, this is going to
happen to you and

411
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:00,381
different effects happen.

412
00:17:00,381 --> 00:17:02,350
And so when you're actually
playing it, it's kind of like

413
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,900
the intensity when
you're falling.

414
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,630
Like, oh, I'm going to die, I
have to do this fast because,

415
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,300
before you know it, the ground
is already at you.

416
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,990
AUDIENCE: It's interesting
because it creates a longer

417
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,405
event of something that's
supposed is

418
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:14,170
supposed to be, pop!

419
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:14,380
Gone.

420
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,280
Scratch, right?

421
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,089
But it's kind of zooming in on
how long that would feel if

422
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,030
you were actually falling,
making a mini-story of that.

423
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,180
It's interesting because I don't
know how strongly-- this

424
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,380
is one of the questions we'll be
talking about in stories in

425
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,360
games is what kind of an
event constitutes an

426
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,980
event in the story?

427
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,680
Is opening a door an
event in the story?

428
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,300
Well, in some games, it can be
because it might give you

429
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,120
access to new areas, there might
be someone showing up

430
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,610
that changes things.

431
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:53,470
But in other cases, like
Monopoly, going around and

432
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,510
getting the--

433
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,530
how many, $100?--

434
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:00,140
$200, is that an event?

435
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,250
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's not.

436
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,250
It doesn't seem like a story
event because it's such a

437
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,333
mundane thing that happens all
the time, although clearly, it

438
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,501
has [INAUDIBLE].

439
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,870
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, it
does have an effect, but as a

440
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:14,320
storytelling art, is kind
of questionable.

441
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
The other thing I wanted to ask
you, seeing as you guys

442
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,670
have been playing particular
board games, there are board

443
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,100
games that have similar
mechanics.

444
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,900
So, I played Race to the Galaxy,
which I really like.

445
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,650
And I've been told that
[? Potomac Coast ?]

446
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,900
is very similar, yes?

447
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,370
So does changing the theme--

448
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,010
those two games have
different themes--

449
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:39,460
but does changing the theme
affect the rules in any ways?

450
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,372
For those of you who might
have played both?

451
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:45,000
AUDIENCE: Not really.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,020
Not for--

453
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,830
San Juan, I think is closer.

454
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,650
San Juan is with the cards.

455
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,820
But it doesn't really change
the game, because the

456
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,880
mechanics are almost
identical.

457
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,660
It's just covered in a different
shell, or whatever

458
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,940
it is, whatever the mechanic
they're trying to mimic.

459
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,030
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So it's
like maybe you don't like

460
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,650
colonial or whatever--

461
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,540
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if you
don't like the--

462
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,884
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: The
science fiction part--

463
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:12,370
AUDIENCE: The science fiction
theme, you could go for this

464
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,510
more Earth town building
theme.

465
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,150
But if you don't like playing
the game itself, switching to

466
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,428
the other game is probably
not going

467
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:21,508
to be all that different.

468
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,430
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes, yeah,
which I think is kind of

469
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,526
interesting, and it's like,
so [INAUDIBLE].

470
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:25,952
Yes?

471
00:19:25,952 --> 00:19:27,790
AUDIENCE: The interesting thing
is that in neither of

472
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,245
those cases, unlike, say,
Ticket to Ride, do these

473
00:19:31,245 --> 00:19:33,010
things feel like they're
tacked onto the theme?

474
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,580
And in each case, the actual
mechanics of the card

475
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,170
faithfully represent what
they're supposed to be in the

476
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:41,980
game fiction, right?

477
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:50,810
So I feel that the fact that
the themes are essentially

478
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,130
interchangeable, or that the
same mechanics underlie both

479
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:57,120
games, despite the fact that
they have different themes,

480
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,300
doesn't necessarily mean
that there's something

481
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,700
wrong with the theme.

482
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,861
It's just that--

483
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:03,070
AUDIENCE: But the meaning
is similar--

484
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,386
AUDIENCE: It's just that the
mechanics are flexible, or

485
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:04,650
something like that.

486
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,490
AUDIENCE: But what I mean, the
meaning of what you actually

487
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,040
do in the games is similar.

488
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,020
Resource management, planning
ahead, knowing when you can

489
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,170
deploy a certain--

490
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,280
they are about the same
thing, even if they

491
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,180
have different settings.

492
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,050
So that's probably
the connection.

493
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,980
It's not about oh, if you like
science fiction games, you can

494
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,160
play the Battlestar Galactica
game, Race to the Galaxy,

495
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,470
whereas I'm guessing that for
most people, it's, well, if I

496
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,540
like Puerto Rico, or I'm
thinking of San Juan, sorry,

497
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] wrong place.

498
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,000
AUDIENCE: Their themes
are close enough.

499
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,450
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
But you would play

500
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,624
something that is similar.

501
00:20:40,624 --> 00:20:41,532
Does that make sense?

502
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:47,050
AUDIENCE: If the meaning of both
games is really empire

503
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,160
building in some sense, right?

504
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,213
In San Juan, it's got historic
themes, and Race to the Galaxy

505
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:52,119
it's futuristic.

506
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:55,800
But they're both empire
building.

507
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,090
The theme is very well defined
in both of these games.

508
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,304
That will make sense because
both themes are about empire

509
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:06,104
building, only one's in the
future and one's in the past.

510
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:08,790
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
OK, so we have--

511
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,590
this has taken a bit of the
time, but these are the

512
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,330
foundations of the concepts that
I wanted to get across

513
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,560
today and discuss today.

514
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,280
When we talk about video games,
there's an extra layer,

515
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,212
which is video games that are
story driven versus just games

516
00:21:25,212 --> 00:21:26,760
with a story.

517
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,460
An example I have here.

518
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,333
So this is Soul Calibur 2,
as far as I remember--

519
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,319
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

520
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,798
Soul Calibur II--

521
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:35,291
[INAUDIBLE]

522
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,277
I think so.

523
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:37,756
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
I don't know.

524
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:38,742
[INAUDIBLE]

525
00:21:38,742 --> 00:21:42,010
Soul Calibur hoping that it was
familiar to [INAUDIBLE]

526
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:42,800
designing.

527
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,757
Anyway, so in Soul Calibur,
what's the game about?

528
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:48,751
AUDIENCE: Fighting.

529
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:51,280
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: It's about
fighting hand-to-hand.

530
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,470
AUDIENCE: It has some
weird story.

531
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,470
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: And it
does have a weird story that's

532
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,010
like, well, does anybody
know the story?

533
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,155
I know that there's something,
and there's some reason why

534
00:22:00,155 --> 00:22:04,050
Sandra or Sophitia--

535
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,634
Sophitia, right?

536
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:07,586
I don't know.

537
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,538
I think her sister is Sandra.

538
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:11,230
AUDIENCE: They're related
somehow, they're mother and

539
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,870
daughter or brothers or
sisters or something.

540
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,790
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Oh, OK.

541
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,380
Maybe that's what she's
asking for.

542
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,744
I didn't know.

543
00:22:18,744 --> 00:22:20,470
I still like these games.

544
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,010
But do I know their stories?

545
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:22,440
No.

546
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,310
But does it?

547
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,020
Eh, not really.

548
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,900
Enough of these.

549
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,030
For some people, I'm sure that
they do care about the stories

550
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,835
of these, or the stories of
the characters in Street

551
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:32,770
Fighter, for example.

552
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,040
Yes?

553
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,160
AUDIENCE: Well I was going to
say for games like this, I

554
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,220
actually kind of like the
story because it adds--

555
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,670
the game is not the story.

556
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,040
There are two separate
entities.

557
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,170
But one kind of adds
to the other.

558
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,530
Like Diablo, for example.

559
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,090
There's lots of people that have
played Diablo II without

560
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,520
really caring about
the actual story--

561
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,280
AUDIENCE: Those cinematics were
so cool back in the day.

562
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,020
AUDIENCE: But even though you
can pretty much separate the

563
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,435
story from Diablo II and people
would probably still

564
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:09,040
play it, the story definitely
adds a layer of, I am attached

565
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,740
to this game.

566
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,870
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But
Diablo, in Diablo, the

567
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,690
difference is that Diablo's
closer to being a

568
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,450
story-driven game.

569
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,000
It's closer to being an
art-boutique game, where the

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,840
quests, you have to know who
you're going to talk to, what

571
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,130
are you going to do.

572
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:28,430
I had a friend, we were working
in this game service,

573
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,500
and we had to test all these
role-playing games.

574
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,710
And one of my coworkers was
like, oh, I have to play--

575
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,140
it was Baldur's Gate II.

576
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,840
One of the cool ones.

577
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,620
And he was like, OK, I have to
test this, and I just have to

578
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,650
see that it works.

579
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,120
And he was not paying attention
to any other text.

580
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,890
He was just doing the
technical testing.

581
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,600
But then he got stuck, and we
were supposed to finish the

582
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,820
games, and he was stuck, and he
was going slower because he

583
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,290
didn't know what to do.

584
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,600
I said, well, if you had read
what you actually had to do.

585
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,760
Well, for him, it was like,
it was just a story!

586
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,330
Well, you're playing an RPG.

587
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,920
You can't leave the story out.

588
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,306
Somebody's telling you that
you have to squash I don't

589
00:24:09,306 --> 00:24:13,660
know how many arts, be happy
to know that you have to

590
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,930
support the arts.

591
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,790
You have to know where to go.

592
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,120
So in story-driven games, what
happens is that the story's

593
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,810
really so tied to the rules and
the goals of the game that

594
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,570
you have, as you advance in
the game, you're also

595
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,110
advancing in the story.

596
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,210
That something that, here, when
you beat up somebody in

597
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,360
Soul Calibur or Street Fighter,
whatever fighting

598
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,970
game you can think of, there
might be a little cut scene

599
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,150
that tells us who they are.

600
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,010
One thing that I like about--

601
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:46,660
is it Soul Calibur?

602
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,530
Yeah.

603
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:50,000
There's a bit of taunting,
like, oh, he beat me, or

604
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
something like that.

605
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,730
But that is building character a
bit, and that means writing.

606
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,760
But really, it's not really
story-driven.

607
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,340
The fact that we're getting
bits of the story as we

608
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,610
complete challenges, doesn't
mean that if we ignore the

609
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,212
game, we can still
complete the game

610
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:07,715
without knowing the story.

611
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:08,930
Does it make sense?

612
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:13,390
So this is something that video
games are doing that, to

613
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,480
a certain extent, some of the
board games that you might

614
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,100
have been playing
don't quite do.

615
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,200
Does it make sense?

616
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,920
We can still think of-- and
there might be some people who

617
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,080
play these board games still
at the mathematical level

618
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,140
without paying any attention
to what the event that's

619
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,810
representing of.

620
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,160
But that's one potential of
video games, that idea of

621
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,480
having a story-driven game where
you're playing a game,

622
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,940
you are interacting with the
world with a strong--

623
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,523
in the cases of story-driven
games, you also have the

624
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:47,300
struggle of a fictional world
that you are interacting with,

625
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,810
that you are exploring, that
you're poking around.

626
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,960
So one thing I wanted to make
clear here is that when we

627
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,210
talk about storytelling--

628
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,820
and let's try to use the term.

629
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,640
We're talking about the stories,
but is it really

630
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,480
storytelling?

631
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,170
And the thing is that
technically

632
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,350
games don't tell stories.

633
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,730
Who's telling the story?

634
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,350
Who's the narrator?

635
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,910
There might be games that have
a kind of gimmick of having

636
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:14,630
the narrator, like Prince of
Persia: Sands of Time.

637
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,770
When you make a mistake, and
he's supposed to be telling

638
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:21,120
what's happened to him, and he's
like, no, no, no, wait,

639
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,150
when are you guys going
to learn, no,

640
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,860
that's not how it happened.

641
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,450
But really, most games, again
like Baldur's Gate or Diablo,

642
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:35,760
or more recently like Mass
Effect, who is the

643
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,370
storyteller?

644
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,100
And the thing is that
there are also

645
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,910
different types of stories.

646
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,590
When we are interacting with a
game, what we are doing is

647
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,310
performing, and as we perform,
we are creating a story.

648
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:52,460
There's a story that has been
maybe prepared for us.

649
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,580
Going back to the Munchkin
thing, in every card, we have

650
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,970
a bit of the story, and we are
kind of putting it together,

651
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:04,130
laying it out.

652
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,190
So the game designers have
designed each game, each chunk

653
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,710
of the story, what
are the cues that

654
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,650
we're giving the player?

655
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,230
But then there's also what else
this player is bringing

656
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,030
to the game.

657
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:19,260
As I was saying before, there's
part that is the game

658
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,330
itself telling its story, and
the other is what we are

659
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,200
evoking, what we are having the
player bring to the game.

660
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,300
Is the story happening in
that player's head?

661
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,190
So what I'd like to say is
that it's not really

662
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:34,270
storytelling, it's about story
building, and as game

663
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,800
designers, we are designing
those little chunks.

664
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:43,210
We are creating stories that are
meant to be reconstructed,

665
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,230
that are meant to be together.

666
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,890
So the difference between
storytelling and story

667
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,700
building basically, when we
have storytelling, we have

668
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,720
somebody who's narrating, or
maybe there's someone who's

669
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,900
re-enacting what's happened,
so a thing like

670
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,870
theater, for example.

671
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,560
But this continuous, it's
something that just happens

672
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,700
and is not fragmented, which is
what story building means.

673
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,040
We have something that has
not already happened.

674
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,540
It's communicated one way, and
what those events are and what

675
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,840
order they're told, that's
determined by the author.

676
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,000
If we think about stories and
how stories apply to games in

677
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,380
terms of story building,
we're talking

678
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,180
about fragmented stories.

679
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,970
Stories in pieces.

680
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,540
Stories that we have to put
together like a puzzle.

681
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,290
And we're game designers.

682
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,570
We make puzzles.

683
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,290
That's one of the many things
that we can do.

684
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,900
What those fragments are, how
are we giving cues to the

685
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,270
player to put together those
fragments, or to come up with

686
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,750
their own ways of coming
up with the story.

687
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,640
In a way, it's a kind of
collaboration between the

688
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,210
designer and the player, because
we rely on the player

689
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,480
to put this story together, to
come up with their own ways of

690
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,600
filling the gaps, to really
have a proactive role in

691
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,470
figuring out what the story
is, and what the

692
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,420
order of events is.

693
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,160
But there are--

694
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,510
you guys have seen the games of
progression and the games

695
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,780
of emergence?

696
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,472
Yes?

697
00:29:10,472 --> 00:29:11,274
You discussed that?

698
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:13,998
AUDIENCE: Could you
[INAUDIBLE]

699
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:15,850
I'm trying to remember
where this--

700
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,220
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: It's like
the [INAUDIBLE] in the

701
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,152
first chapter, second chapter?

702
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:19,976
AUDIENCE: Well it's
a seperate--

703
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:23,070
I think we had actually looked
at the individual paper.

704
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we have the
individual, not the book.

705
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,812
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Not the chapter?

706
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:29,270
AUDIENCE: But it's basically
the same thing.

707
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,855
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK, yeah,
because he talked about

708
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:35,090
the same thing in a couple
of different places.

709
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,590
So what happens is that at
times, there are games that

710
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,940
have a specific order of events,
and there are some

711
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:47,020
adventure games, like Syberia
for example, where you have to

712
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,840
go through a very specific
sequence of events, and when

713
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,450
you get to a scene it's like,
you have to do this.

714
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:01,370
Things like Dragon's Lair,
the laser disc DVD.

715
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,030
When you go to a place and you
have to figure out what is the

716
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,070
action that you have to do, and
if you don't do it, you

717
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:09,290
die in horrible ways.

718
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:15,520
So those are games that set
the order of events very

719
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,340
specifically.

720
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:19,550
But most of the games tend to
have some more flexibility,

721
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,490
and let the players
explore the world.

722
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,240
Things that happen in the world
are generated by how the

723
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,200
player is interacting
with the world.

724
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,010
So in RPGs, for example,
depending on the RPG, there

725
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,412
might be the main quest and
the side quests, and there

726
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:36,880
might be flexibility in what
order that happens.

727
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,320
Even how a player might solve
a specific quest.

728
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:48,050
In terms of table top, who here
has been dungeon master?

729
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,034
OK, a bunch of you.

730
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:51,902
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

731
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,925
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
OK, so we have a

732
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,400
corner of dungeon masters.

733
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,110
So you probably know that when
you design a quest, and then

734
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,600
you set it up, and you have your
players, and then your

735
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,760
players come up with a couple of
different ways of tackling

736
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,940
your quest, whatever they
can come up with.

737
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,610
And you have to improvise
and try to--

738
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,710
you're building the rails
of their living.

739
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,290
It's like they're trying
to anticipate what

740
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,010
they're going to do.

741
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,825
So we're trying to get that into
video games, too, but we

742
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:22,605
don't have the improvisational
capacity built

743
00:31:22,605 --> 00:31:24,640
into computers yet.

744
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,195
But as you see, it's like the
dungeon masters, as dungeon

745
00:31:29,195 --> 00:31:32,695
masters, we're responding to
the actions of the player.

746
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:33,945
Does it make sense?

747
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,560

748
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,170
When we're talking about story
building, there are games, as

749
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:41,170
I was saying, that are about
story building, where the

750
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,280
challenge is constructing a
story, improvising as you go.

751
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,770
You're given chunks, and you
have to be able to be a

752
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,300
storyteller.

753
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,940
But you'll play these later.

754
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,609

755
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:57,100
We've actually talked
about this before.

756
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:02,430
So when we're talking about
building the fictional world

757
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,140
of the game--

758
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm going to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
through this a bit fast.

759
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,910
We have until 4:30, right?

760
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:10,870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

761
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,310
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK.

762
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:17,160
So there are also very minimal
ways in which we can construct

763
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,690
our fiction, and these are
lessons that I've taken from

764
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,620
digital games.

765
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,990
But if you think about it, many
of these also apply to

766
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,800
non-digital games.

767
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:34,330
So for example, we have the
title of a game can tell us

768
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,990
something about the fictional
world, right?

769
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,790
What about board games
or card games?

770
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,261
How do the titles build
the fictional world?

771
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:45,525
AUDIENCE: The board game Mafia
Wars is pretty clear about

772
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:46,700
what you're doing.

773
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,050
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
So that's a way.

774
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,840
It's evoking some things,
like the type or

775
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,720
kind of world on itself.

776
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,950
And also setting
the situation.

777
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:58,210
So here, Mafia Wars is about

778
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,000
AUDIENCE: Mafia having--

779
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,712
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: There's
different factions.

780
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:00,940
AUDIENCE: Getting in trouble--

781
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,060
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
There's going--

782
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,970
yeah.

783
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,740
There's going to be betrayal
probably, shooting down people

784
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,155
in horrible ways.

785
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,308
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

786
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:10,980
AUDIENCE: Any licensed game?

787
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,345
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Any licensed game?

788
00:33:12,345 --> 00:33:13,320
Yes.

789
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,560
Thought at times, things like
versions of Monopoly or

790
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,970
Trivial Pursuit where
it's kind of like--

791
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,075
AUDIENCE: Star Wars--

792
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:23,610
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Star
Wars everything.

793
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,360
AUDIENCE: Risk gets
kind of broad.

794
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,370
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: And there
are also skimmings of

795
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,830
Risk, right?

796
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, lots.

797
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,460
AUDIENCE: Lord of the Rings.

798
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,800
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Lord of
the Rings everything, too.

799
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,662

800
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:37,912
Kind of like Barbie.

801
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:40,001

802
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,909
AUDIENCE: I just feel like
there are so many Risks.

803
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:44,217
AUDIENCE: I know there's
[? God's ?] which takes place

804
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:46,882
back in like mythological,
[INAUDIBLE]?

805
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:50,396
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
apart from franchises, what

806
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:50,945
other titles are--

807
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,485
AUDIENCE: The Settlers
of Catan.

808
00:33:52,485 --> 00:33:55,272
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Settlers
of Catan, which is evoking--?

809
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:56,255
AUDIENCE: Settling.

810
00:33:56,255 --> 00:33:57,700
[LAUGHTER]

811
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,020
AUDIENCE: Building cities.

812
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,330
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Building, sure.

813
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,976
AUDIENCE: San Juan.

814
00:34:01,976 --> 00:34:04,170
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
San Juan's going to--

815
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,330
that's what you told me, too.

816
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,735
AUDIENCE: Chinatown.

817
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:07,620
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Chinatown?

818
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,521
AUDIENCE: It's set
in Chinatown.

819
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,739
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
And what do you do?

820
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:13,239
AUDIENCE: You build businesses
that are stereotypically

821
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,579
associated with being
in Chinatown.

822
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,451
[LAUGHTER]

823
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:19,442
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So with
one title, it's not only we're

824
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:21,940
evoking the world, but we
can also evoke rules.

825
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,294
What do you have
to do to here?

826
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,635
So like Mafia Wars,
you kill people.

827
00:34:25,635 --> 00:34:27,070
But then, Settlers of Catan.

828
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,320
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

829
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,595

830
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,520
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But you
are maybe playing what some of

831
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,454
the rules are, what the game
is about, which is what is

832
00:34:35,454 --> 00:34:36,260
important here.

833
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:41,030
And again, Soren Johnson calls
attention to the fact that if

834
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,219
you're announcing that your game
is about something in the

835
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,479
description booklet, the people
might not always read,

836
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:49,949
or at least a part of
people don't read.

837
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,260
You should follow up with that,
because it's helping,

838
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,000
it's giving cues to the player
about how is the story of the

839
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,660
game going to build up.

840
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,410
What is the key?

841
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,560
I like talking about giving
keys to the player a lot

842
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,800
because I come from theater.

843
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,880
It's a very intuitive way
of understanding.

844
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,650
It's not about us selling the
story, it's about helping the

845
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,590
player construct the story.

846
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,076
So I have two examples from
video games I really like

847
00:35:15,076 --> 00:35:19,630
about how to build a fictional
world with a title.

848
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,730
One obvious one in video games
is Space Invaders, right?

849
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:28,311
Space Invaders means we're
on Earth and--

850
00:35:28,311 --> 00:35:28,780
AUDIENCE: Invaders, aliens.

851
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,360
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Invaders
from space, and we'll probably

852
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,140
have a fight.

853
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,580
AUDIENCE: Invading from space.

854
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,220
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Another good one,

855
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,470
Zombies Ate My Neighbors.

856
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,032
There's a whole story
right there.

857
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:41,212
So what's the story
of this game?

858
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:42,156
AUDIENCE: Zombies ate
the neighbors?

859
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:43,970
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: The
zombies ate the neighbors?

860
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,590
So what do I do in this game?

861
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,255
AUDIENCE: Probably
kill zombies.

862
00:35:47,255 --> 00:35:48,185
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So
probably killing zombies.

863
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:49,755
AUDIENCE: Are zombies
eating my neighbors?

864
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:52,250
Or the zombies ate my neighbors
and then just left.

865
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,545
AUDIENCE: Maybe the zombies
are your neighbors.

866
00:35:53,545 --> 00:35:55,310
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
maybe you have to kill your

867
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,340
neighbors, too, now.

868
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,170
If there's anything left,
because they ate them.

869
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,540
But this is a whole situation.

870
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,000
What do I have to do?

871
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,220
OK, zombies.

872
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,010
Whacking zombies, I'm sure,
or running away from them.

873
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,320
AUDIENCE: The fact that you
have neighbors in the

874
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,550
neighborhood, right?

875
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,100
It's not like a military
zombie shooter.

876
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,715
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes,
it's not Resident Evil.

877
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:19,486
AUDIENCE: They looked
vaguely like '50s.

878
00:36:19,486 --> 00:36:21,290
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
I'm not sure about that.

879
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,820
This is like a Genesis game.

880
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,680
AUDIENCE: I just played a
game with an old, like--

881
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,145
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

882
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,790
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yeah, yeah, right.

883
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,050
AUDIENCE: Harkening back to the
zombie movies of the day.

884
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,690
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah.

885
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:37,770
Another great title that I found
not too long ago, Earth

886
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,890
Dies Screaming.

887
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,206
[LAUGHTER]

888
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,152
AUDIENCE: Wow.

889
00:36:41,152 --> 00:36:42,870
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Which is
actually about the '70s--

890
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,026
AUDIENCE: Whoa.

891
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:48,770
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: The title
is from a '70s British

892
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:53,040
movie that I think has nothing
to do with the game.

893
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,970
This is like Space Invaders
in a way.

894
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,440
You are defending the earth,
it kind of looks like that.

895
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,860
You have your space ship, and
you have invaders, and you

896
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:09,080
have to destroy it before
it lands on earth.

897
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,550
But again, it's very
evocative.

898
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:15,530
It's more memorable than Space
Invaders in a way,

899
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,770
because it's got--

900
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,600
there's people attacking
earth, whoever it is.

901
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,090
And this is going
to end badly.

902
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,370
That's another thing, but Space
Invaders and things like

903
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:24,850
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

904
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:30,627
and all those arcade games that
do have an ending, you

905
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:31,908
know the ending.

906
00:37:31,908 --> 00:37:33,402
You cannot really save earth.

907
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:37,510
It's really ominous in a way.

908
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,480
But again, we have a whole.

909
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,970
We have a whole situation
is about--

910
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,200
in the title.

911
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,830
It's also very memorable.

912
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,290
I really like this title.

913
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,770
Another way in which
we can give cues to

914
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,790
players to build worlds--

915
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:58,055
and I had more of this, but
this applies more to video

916
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:02,100
games than to board games,
card games, and even

917
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:05,380
role-playing games, is
character design.

918
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,690
Because when we are making--

919
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,960
and tell me from your
own experience--

920
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,450
but when you're making
non-digital games, and even

921
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:17,890
when you're preparing your
Dungeons & Dragons campaign,

922
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,150
you don't really come up
with the characters.

923
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,220
The characters is something
that the player brings.

924
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,670
For card games, if you have any
examples that are counter

925
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,470
examples for this, please
let me know.

926
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,660
But character design is not
something that you do so much

927
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,480
in non-digital games.

928
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,370
Do you have any examples
of that?

929
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,707
AUDIENCE: Well, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

930
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:36,501
can be.

931
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,680
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yeah, in a way, yes.

932
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,020
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
[? Acompora ?]

933
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,645
and other games where you have
a character which is assigned

934
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:48,130
to you and often they
have back story.

935
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,576
In [? Acompora ?] there's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], Byron, or

936
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:51,858
what have you.

937
00:38:51,858 --> 00:38:55,490
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say the game where

938
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,160
you're trying to--

939
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,096
Clue, Clue.

940
00:38:57,096 --> 00:38:59,620
Where you choose a character
and they all have their

941
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,300
[INAUDIBLE] and whatnot.

942
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,310
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
The things that I--

943
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,410
As a player, are you really
involved with those

944
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,475
characters?

945
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:08,530
AUDIENCE: I think I can think
of one game which is an

946
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,395
example where you are, and
it's called Android.

947
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:18,640
This game was released, I think,
two years ago now, and

948
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,820
part of the--

949
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,270
actually, you should
probably play it--

950
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,870
part of the point is that
it was trying to include

951
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,120
developments of--

952
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,370

953
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,830
resolving characters' personal
stories through

954
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,760
mechanics in the game.

955
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,590
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Oh, yeah.

956
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,935
AUDIENCE: So you're actually
playing through this choose

957
00:39:37,935 --> 00:39:42,070
your own adventure-ish
type scenario.

958
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,540
And the choices that you make
throughout the game influence

959
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,818
what directions your
character's

960
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,630
personal story arc.

961
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,793
It's a very good game.

962
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:53,090
But it's interesting, right?

963
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,820
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, what
I'm trying to get at here

964
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,150
is that at times, the
characters are--

965
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,650
and again, evoking actions,
evoking certain emotions, too.

966
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,560
I think that that detachment
with non-digital games--

967
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,990
with role-playing games,
it's different.

968
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:10,120
But again, when you're building
your own characters

969
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,630
in role-playing, you have an
investment when you're making

970
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,630
it yourself.

971
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:17,050
I'm talking more of the point
of view of the designer.

972
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,675
Here?

973
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:22,870
AUDIENCE: So another
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] game again,

974
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,830
Battlestar Galactica.

975
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,100
You are assigned a character,
and if you know Battlestar

976
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,370
Galactica, you're probably
going to go for certain

977
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,310
characters, because like, oh,
that character's hilarious, I

978
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,570
want to be him, or,
I'm going to be

979
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,030
Starbuck, Starbuck's awesome.

980
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:41,130
And then each player actually
also has certain traits, which

981
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,720
are characteristic of their--

982
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,652
for the player in the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], like

983
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:51,000
[? tie ?], except he's now
taller, so there's a certain

984
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,451
negative attribute to him if
you're in a certain situation.

985
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:55,244
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK.

986
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,900
All right, we have--

987
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,100
near the back.

988
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,620
AUDIENCE: I was going to say
in live-action role-playing

989
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,210
games, like expansion,
Assassin's Guild, and stuff,

990
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,880
the characters are entirely

991
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,070
designed by the game designers.

992
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,775
But you still get the players
who take up this character and

993
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:14,600
become involved with it, because
all of their actions

994
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,462
are based on what the designer
chose to make that character.

995
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:22,426
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yep, yep,
that's true, that's true.

996
00:41:22,426 --> 00:41:24,896
And one?

997
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,040
AUDIENCE: Two other games.

998
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,963
Cosmic Encounter is where
probably a lot closer to the

999
00:41:31,963 --> 00:41:34,590
thousand island kind of
situation you've got.

1000
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,396
You pick a race at the beginning
of the game.

1001
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,815
So it's not a single
character.

1002
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:43,247
But that's effectively the same
thing in that, if you

1003
00:41:43,247 --> 00:41:45,510
pick something like the Cubans,
you have different

1004
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,750
goals, and you have different
powers that you

1005
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,060
can use in the game.

1006
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,687
Whereas if you play a game like
Illuminati, instead of

1007
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:55,320
playing an individual you're
playing a corporation, or

1008
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,560
actually a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1009
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,120
for society, for the most part,
and your actual game

1010
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:03,990
winning goals are different,
depending on who you pick.

1011
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:09,420
And part of the game is also
figuring out what certain

1012
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,442
characters are trying-- how
certain characters are trying

1013
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:14,932
to win the game, because not
everybody has the same game

1014
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:15,663
winning goal.

1015
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:16,637
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK.

1016
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:18,098
Patrick, last one.

1017
00:42:18,098 --> 00:42:22,020
AUDIENCE: In the card game
Saboteur, if your role is the

1018
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,320
saboteur, then it is in the
player's best interest to act

1019
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,801
in that role.

1020
00:42:26,801 --> 00:42:28,460
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: To
perform like what?

1021
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,870
AUDIENCE: Yes, to be some person
to the other players

1022
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,316
without letting them catch on.

1023
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,510
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Well, awesome.

1024
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,590
You see, and this is why, I
think, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1025
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,160
I was asking.

1026
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:44,190
Yeah, I think the LARPing one
is the obvious case, yeah.

1027
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:48,640
In video games, what we do,
we can build character in

1028
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,070
cinematic ways and cut scenes
and whatever, but really, it's

1029
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,740
very difficult to build a
character that is at the same

1030
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,960
time you, and not you are the
player and not the player.

1031
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,240
And what we can do is give
them cues about the

1032
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,590
personality of that character.

1033
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,190
And one of the examples I wanted
to give was Sonic,

1034
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,960
because Sonic is
not really you.

1035
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,310
This is always the--

1036
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,905
a bit of this trouble in a lot
of the examples that you were

1037
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:18,875
doing, except for LARPing, where
LARPing is a bit more

1038
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,075
involved, is that it's kind
of like you but not you.

1039
00:43:21,075 --> 00:43:21,700
Who am I?

1040
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,070
I'm the saboteur, because
I'm doing this.

1041
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,820

1042
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,050
In games, we have Sonic,
for example.

1043
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,130
We are Sonic.

1044
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,350
What are we?

1045
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,645
We are a blue hedgehog.

1046
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,844
And what do we do?

1047
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:37,296
AUDIENCE: Collect rings.

1048
00:43:37,296 --> 00:43:38,486
AUDIENCE: Run.

1049
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:42,610
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So, run
and collect coins, and

1050
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:43,803
liberating cute animals.

1051
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:45,070
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1052
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,830
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yes, that too.

1053
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:54,040
And one of the things, one of
the goals of designing a

1054
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,740
character, particularly
in video games, is

1055
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,510
making it seem alive.

1056
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:00,550
Making it go beyond the
functional part.

1057
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,350
Like, oh, we are the saboteur,
we are whatever character in

1058
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,910
Clue, for example.

1059
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,080
Having that emotional
involvement, that is something

1060
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,650
that we are trying to achieve
in video games.

1061
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,860
And Sonic does it in a very
subtle, very cool way.

1062
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,720
Does anybody know what
this picture is of?

1063
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,121
What he's doing?

1064
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:23,827
AUDIENCE: When you don't do
anything, he starts tapping

1065
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:24,729
his foot and looking at you.

1066
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:25,803
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So it's
kind of like, you're not

1067
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:26,290
controlling me.

1068
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:27,330
Come on.

1069
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:28,440
I wanna go.

1070
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,270
I really have to go.

1071
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,780
I have to run, because
what I do is running.

1072
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,650
So, let's go.

1073
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,370
AUDIENCE: Mario goes to sleep.

1074
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,645
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yeah, Mario goes to

1075
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,195
sleep, that's right.

1076
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:38,920
AUDIENCE: Starts--

1077
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,390
[INAUDIBLE]

1078
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,180
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: And do
you remember any of the

1079
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,300
Earthworm Jim games?

1080
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,590
He does crazy stuff.

1081
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,540
He starts--

1082
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:53,080
he flips his head, and he
dresses up, like he is

1083
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,310
thinking, why don't I--

1084
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:54,840
Yeah.

1085
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,350
Or he gets an afro wig
at some point.

1086
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,640
What are you doing?

1087
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,300
But it's pulling attention
to, who am I?

1088
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,905
When you're not controlling me,
I'm gonna do it myself.

1089
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:10,530
And is the case of Sonic, it's
like, OK, I'm a running guy,

1090
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,160
but I need you to
run, so come on.

1091
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,057
And it's very subtle, something
that is very

1092
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:19,248
minimal, but is building
character, but is also telling

1093
00:45:19,248 --> 00:45:22,160
the player who this
character is.

1094
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,240
The last thing-- and this is
something that, again, video

1095
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,380
games can do very well-- is
something that role-playing

1096
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,950
games can do very well, or
LARPing, but I'm not sure that

1097
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,270
card games or board games can
do this, is environmental

1098
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:39,610
storytelling.

1099
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,700
It's telling the story in the
space as you go around, as

1100
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:47,680
you're examining the space
and what's going on.

1101
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,710
Video games, what they do very
well, is construction of a

1102
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,550
virtual world that we can
navigate, that we can explore,

1103
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,960
that we can interact with.

1104
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,170
And one of--

1105
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,460
those of you who've been in my
classes before, you know that

1106
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,290
I love the beginning of Bioshock
as an example of

1107
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,840
environmental story telling,
because you know what is this

1108
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:11,470
world, what has happened before,
and they don't tell it

1109
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:11,880
with a word.

1110
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,110
It's just going to the
space and figuring

1111
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,530
out what has happened.

1112
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:21,780
Another example that I really
love is Portal where a lot of

1113
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,220
the story is told, or you
figure it out, as

1114
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:28,470
you explore the world.

1115
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,120
So what is this in Portal?

1116
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,036
So, first of all, what is the
premise of Portal, the story?

1117
00:46:34,036 --> 00:46:36,780
AUDIENCE: You're a test subject
testing a new device

1118
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,010
at Aperture Labs.

1119
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:40,985
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes,
so you're a test subject.

1120
00:46:40,985 --> 00:46:42,670
But very soon, you realize
that there's

1121
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,330
something kind of wrong.

1122
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,440
This voice that keeps talking
to, kind of warps around, and

1123
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,100
she goes and comes back.

1124
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,010
But there's something broken,
and you just go on because you

1125
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,670
don't know what else to do.

1126
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,230
But here, what is this?

1127
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,510
Once you start realizing, OK,
there's something really

1128
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,460
wrong, what is this?

1129
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,880
AUDIENCE: This is when you're
trying to escape.

1130
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,110
AUDIENCE: The hole
in the wall.

1131
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:06,710
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
There's a hole--

1132
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:09,120
AUDIENCE: One of the things is
stuck forward, and you can

1133
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:09,540
sneak under it or something?

1134
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,980
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, you
go behind the scenes and

1135
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,940
you realize, OK, so there's
something really wrong here, I

1136
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:19,210
kind of guessed it, but here
we have what looks like

1137
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:24,870
somebody's refuge, like where
somebody was hiding, and they

1138
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,190
were writing all
these messages.

1139
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,020
And, of course, it's very funny,
because the famous "The

1140
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:32,880
cake is a lie," is not something
that everybody has

1141
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,360
to go through.

1142
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,080
You have to find it.

1143
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,460
You have to find
it in the game.

1144
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,160
It's part of exploring
the game.

1145
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,110
So the reason why I like--

1146
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,460
I like Portal for many,
many reasons--

1147
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,820
but one is because the
storytelling is very

1148
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,610
brilliant--and is not something
that we're told,

1149
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:52,770
this is what happened.

1150
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,830
We figure it out. by listening
to the voice, by listening to

1151
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,040
GlaDOS, by going behind
the scenes.

1152
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,980
We are piecing the
story together.

1153
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,940
Yes?

1154
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,820
AUDIENCE: If you ever pay
attention to what's written on

1155
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,680
the wall in the safe houses in
Left for Dead, there's a lot

1156
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,140
of funny stuff, as well.

1157
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,600
And I initially hadn't realized
Left for Dead had a

1158
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,320
story, really.

1159
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,640
And then, when you actually
pause and read what's written

1160
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,980
on the walls in the safe houses,
there's almost flame

1161
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,710
wars between different people
who run to the same houses and

1162
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,950
are writing facts about the
zombie apocalypse, and saying,

1163
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,880
oh, that's not true, that town
is completely overrun, no,

1164
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,200
you're totally stupid, I was
there last week, and it had

1165
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,180
these things going on and
various two bits of trivia and

1166
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:30,950
facts about the world.

1167
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,935
And it's very, very clever,
and often quite hilarious.

1168
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:35,900
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Because
what environment storytelling

1169
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,570
is doing, after all, we're
telling the story of the

1170
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,500
fictional world.

1171
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,790
That can be part of the goal of
solving games, figuring out

1172
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,735
what is the story of the
fictional world?

1173
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:49,520

1174
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,160
Yes, Andrew?

1175
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,110
AUDIENCE: Was there a conscious
decision to use

1176
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,260
environmental storytelling as
opposed to story building?

1177
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,660
Well, you mentioned the
difference between

1178
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:01,496
storytelling and story building
earlier, and you

1179
00:49:01,496 --> 00:49:03,248
mentioned that that was
environmental story telling as

1180
00:49:03,248 --> 00:49:04,010
opposed to story building.

1181
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,110
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
and probably is

1182
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,510
really story building.

1183
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,870
So the thing is that
environmental storytelling is

1184
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,140
what people call it.

1185
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,100
I'm using a phrase.

1186
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,840
But yeah, this is a type
of story building.

1187
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,030
We're building a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], build it for

1188
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,380
the player.

1189
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:23,515
But yeah, this is
story building.

1190
00:49:23,515 --> 00:49:26,000
PROFESSOR: More precisely,
you will see talks on

1191
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,880
environmental storytelling when
you go to a conference.

1192
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,533
But what they're really talking
about, so you know, is

1193
00:49:32,533 --> 00:49:35,479
just that [INAUDIBLE] involved
in research.

1194
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:38,920
AUDIENCE: So maybe the closest
to this kind of thing is in

1195
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,480
flavor text in CCG's and
other such stuff.

1196
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,770
So if you think, for instance,
of Magic the Gathering, then

1197
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,100
there is a back story
behind each of these

1198
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,390
expansions which comes out.

1199
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:51,985
And that's told through actual
fiction, where you can buy a

1200
00:49:51,985 --> 00:49:53,000
really trashy novel.

1201
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,920
[LAUGHTER]

1202
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,860
But it's also told through
little quotes between--

1203
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,010
by significant the characters
in the fiction, also the

1204
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:02,300
images which are presented
on the cards.

1205
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,544
So, maybe that's the closest
thing to environmental story

1206
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:05,080
telling in--

1207
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,900
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yes, yeah.

1208
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,900
Magic the Gathering has this
world, and it seems to be very

1209
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,060
easy expand it.

1210
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,910
I don't know if there's a
bible of the Magic the

1211
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,870
Gathering world.

1212
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah, there's an
entire creative department

1213
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:18,220
at Wizards of the Coast that's
responsible for maintaining

1214
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,490
the story and making sure it's
all consistent and stuff.

1215
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:23,780
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So it's
not really something--

1216
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,712
it's almost 4:00, so I have
still something, but we can go

1217
00:50:27,712 --> 00:50:30,167
through it very fast
if that works?

1218
00:50:30,167 --> 00:50:32,627
PROFESSOR: If we run out of
time, we can play these games

1219
00:50:32,627 --> 00:50:33,521
on Friday or something.

1220
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:33,970
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: OK.

1221
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:34,590
PROFESSOR: If that sounds
like a good idea.

1222
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,720
All right.

1223
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,850
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So, we've
been talking so far

1224
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:43,592
about designing the story of
world, designing the story of

1225
00:50:43,592 --> 00:50:45,070
the fictional world.

1226
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:47,890
What we also have, as I was
saying before, the players

1227
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,910
also construction a
story as we go.

1228
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:54,805
Things that happen to the
player, things that happen in

1229
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,390
the world, because they
happen to the player.

1230
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:59,245
And again, one of the reasons
why I was talking about games

1231
00:50:59,245 --> 00:51:02,850
of progressions versus games
of emergence is that in

1232
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:08,630
stories, we have a similar
parallel of stories that have

1233
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,590
been designed for the player,
things that they have to do in

1234
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,590
role-playing games, and I'm
talking about pen and pencil--

1235
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,560
pen and paper role-playing
games, we have the story that

1236
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:26,280
as the end we have designed,
and then there's what the

1237
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,600
players are trying to do.

1238
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,140
In video games, because
computers don't have the

1239
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,550
capacity for improvisation, what
the player has to do is a

1240
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,170
lot more constrained in a way.

1241
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,440
So what are the bosses
that they have to--

1242
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,520
how do they solve a specific
problem, or how do we get over

1243
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,610
a specific problem.

1244
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:52,170
So I like giving the example
of Legend of Zelda games,

1245
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:58,680
where we do have a story that
we're completing almost in a

1246
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,670
specific order, because if you
don't have certain objects,

1247
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,440
you can't go to the next stage
until you have certain

1248
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,360
properties.

1249
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,970
So even though we have a really
nice, relatively open

1250
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,380
world, a world that we can
navigate, we do have a

1251
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,020
specific order of events
that we have to follow.

1252
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,750
Adventure games, it might be
something like point and click

1253
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,795
adventure games, again, things
like Syberia, things like

1254
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:26,510
Myst, where there is a
pre-established sequence of

1255
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,290
events that we have
to go settle.

1256
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:32,340
And then, the other extreme, we
have games that are closer

1257
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,680
to these games like Once Upon
a Time, or Gloom where the

1258
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,130
system itself is producing
stories of

1259
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,300
sorts, like in The Sims.

1260
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,470
And in The Sims, the fact that
we have a way to record our

1261
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:48,560
own stories and share them is
proof that that's a kind of

1262
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,170
system closer to things
like Once Upon a Time.

1263
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:54,210
That is, the system can generate
narratives, and that

1264
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:59,570
playing with the system will
generate some narratives.

1265
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:06,200
So we have ways in which, as
designers, we can provide cues

1266
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:11,350
or ways to design the
story of the player.

1267
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:14,650
And the first one is the
game premise, what is

1268
00:53:14,650 --> 00:53:16,560
the goal of the game?

1269
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,250
Game events, I don't know if
I'll let that one, because

1270
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,070
that was too long.

1271
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,130
And we have [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
a narrative.

1272
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:25,490
The game premise is who are
you in the game, what

1273
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,340
do you do in it.

1274
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,660
It's kind of similar to the
title, but in this case, is

1275
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,660
very tied to who is the player,
what is the role of

1276
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,240
the player in the game?

1277
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,550
So things like Cooking
Mama, for example.

1278
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,005
You're Cooking Mama, so who
are you, Cooking Mama?

1279
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:40,240
You're not mama.

1280
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,418
Mama's complaining about you.

1281
00:53:42,418 --> 00:53:45,160
You are the person who's
cooking for Mama.

1282
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,160
That's the title they should
have, Cooking for Mama.

1283
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,900
And then now they're getting
pissed off at you because you

1284
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,730
didn't do it right.

1285
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,190
But it tells you basically
so you're a cook.

1286
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,650
Or what is it that you do.

1287
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,710
You're trying to please
Mama by cooking

1288
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,100
something nice and yummy.

1289
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:04,950
Usually, also kind of weird.

1290
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,660
A really good example of
creating the story of the

1291
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:12,170
player by the premise of who you
are in the game is this.

1292
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,700

1293
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,350
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
I love this example.

1294
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,150
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1295
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,840
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Because
it's like, who are you?

1296
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,760
You're a hacker.

1297
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,392
And it gives you--

1298
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,890
the cool thing about this
trailer is it gives you a list

1299
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:25,970
of what you do.

1300
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,240
This is your story.

1301
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,640
You are framing people,
you are framing

1302
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,310
innocent people, of course.

1303
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,960
Maintaining people's academic
records, building their

1304
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,730
devices, and all those are
activities in the game, but

1305
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,670
it's also who you are.

1306
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,460
That is your story.

1307
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,564
Those are the kinds of things
that you're going to be doing

1308
00:54:41,564 --> 00:54:43,800
in the game.

1309
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,660
So again, we were talking
about Saboteur before.

1310
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,415
Well, as saboteur, you already
have a series of actions that

1311
00:54:50,415 --> 00:54:52,720
you associated with the
your character.

1312
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,780
That is way that we can design
the story of the player, at

1313
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,670
least at the higher level,
and give it that cue.

1314
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:02,480
I'm skipping game events because
it's kind of long and

1315
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,770
it's very, very strong.

1316
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,760
Two basic video games, and
mostly [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1317
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,810
The other example that I
want to make here is

1318
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:13,600
micronarratives.

1319
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:18,550
And again, all these are more
video game things, but

1320
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,775
micronarratives are little
events, they're not even cut

1321
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:25,820
scenes, they're just little
events that happen as

1322
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,440
reactions to the player's
actions.

1323
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,590
In a way, Sonic tapping his foot
is a kind micronarrative.

1324
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,900
You're not doing anything,
come on, I want to go.

1325
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,425
Or Mario falling asleep
is kind of like a

1326
00:55:40,425 --> 00:55:41,675
micronarrative of sorts.

1327
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:44,420

1328
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,430
This is one of my favorite
micronarratives

1329
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,330
in these video games.

1330
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:54,620
This is the game Jet Set Willy,
which is from 1985,

1331
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,160
maybe, something, middle '80s.

1332
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,110
It was for Commodore 64.

1333
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,200
Well, it was originally
for the--

1334
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,450
AUDIENCE: Spectrum.

1335
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,013
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yes, thank you.

1336
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:08,170
He's prepared a presentation
on the Spectrum, yes.

1337
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,570
Commodore 64 and surrounding
this world is Z80 platforms in

1338
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:17,534
the '80s, and this was a
sequel to Manic Miner.

1339
00:56:17,534 --> 00:56:22,044
So Manic Miner, you were
Miner Willy, yes?

1340
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:22,950
Miner Willy.

1341
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,310
And you go down into the
earth, and you find a

1342
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,360
treasure, and you become
immensely rich.

1343
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,140
So with the money that you get
from the first game, you throw

1344
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,460
a party, and you throw such a
big party that your house

1345
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,510
becomes invaded by the weirdest
creatures ever.

1346
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:46,012
There are flying toilet seats,
mutant pigs, I don't know.

1347
00:56:46,012 --> 00:56:46,894
AUDIENCE: Sounds like
a good party.

1348
00:56:46,894 --> 00:56:49,780
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, such
a good party that you get

1349
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,610
people from other worlds
to come to your party.

1350
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,060
But the thing was that it was
such a good party, you wanted

1351
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:55,920
to go to bed.

1352
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,500
This is Willy.

1353
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,830
This is you in the game.

1354
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:01,850
So in Jet Set Willy, this is the
day after, and Willy is is

1355
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:04,840
hungover probably after
the super party.

1356
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,970
And he was in a bed.

1357
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:11,080
In the game, to the left, you
have the picture of the bed,

1358
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,470
and that's your goal,
go to bed.

1359
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,130
But this is your landlady, who's
seen how you trashed the

1360
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:20,830
place, and she doesn't want you
to go to bed until you've

1361
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,230
cleaned it up.

1362
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,500
So the cool thing, they
really want to get--

1363
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,630
and then, the animation here--

1364
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:32,370
is that she has her
arms like this.

1365
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,290
She's holding her arms like
this, and whenever

1366
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:37,599
you get near her--

1367
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,048
which arm is it?--

1368
00:57:39,048 --> 00:57:41,946
her left arm, she
goes like, ha!

1369
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:43,400
Go.

1370
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,410
And it's a reaction
to what you do.

1371
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,420
With this, it's a few pixels.

1372
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,060
It's probably four
or five pixels.

1373
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,940
And in four or five pixels, this
game is telling you this

1374
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,950
is what you have to do.

1375
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,190
Go that way.

1376
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:55,020
This is your goal,
you asked me.

1377
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:00,108
You've gotta come here, go that
way, and clean it up.

1378
00:58:00,108 --> 00:58:03,060
And this is eight bit pixels!

1379
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,530
And she's telling you all that
with just a few pixels.

1380
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:08,060
You don't really
need that much.

1381
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,270
But with that kind of reaction,
we always want to,

1382
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,950
again, gives cues.

1383
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:14,650
What is it that the
player has to do?

1384
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:17,250
We don't need a cut scene.

1385
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,430
With a few pixels, we know what
we have to do, right?

1386
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:22,540
And it's a very difficult game,

1387
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,230
too, for today's standards.

1388
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:29,120
Anyway, so the conclusion
here is that

1389
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,220
why do we need stories?

1390
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,200
Why do we need fictions?

1391
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,700
What do fictional worlds
do for us?

1392
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,140
What do themes do for us?

1393
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:41,085
As we were saying, humans have
a tendency the story-icize

1394
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,410
everything.

1395
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,830
We are natural storytellers.

1396
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:47,390
Some of what these games like
Once Upon a Time or

1397
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:48,370
[? Bloom ?]

1398
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,810
are playing with is because we
tell other people what has

1399
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,330
happened to us.

1400
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,520
If you complain about something,
you're complaining

1401
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,550
in the form of a story
if something might

1402
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,110
have happened to you.

1403
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:04,810
We understand our experiences
as stories, and there are

1404
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:08,320
different disciplines that
have dealt with this from

1405
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,610
computer science
to psychology.

1406
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,520
How we are making stories about
ourselves, how we are

1407
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,050
making stories about
our worlds.

1408
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:21,400
So having a story, having a
game that has a fictional

1409
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,210
world in which a story can
take place is a way of

1410
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:27,230
understanding the underlying
system.

1411
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,300
As I was saying, if we have a
game that is called Mafia

1412
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:35,230
Wars, we already have a goal, we
have sets of rules, who we

1413
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:38,500
are, what is it that
we have to do.

1414
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,680
We don't need a lot of--

1415
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,400
two words have been enough
to evoke a lot of that

1416
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,950
information.

1417
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,830
So the last thing, and this
applies a bit more to video

1418
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,470
games, is that by having a
story, we're also providing

1419
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,800
consistency to the world.

1420
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,660
When Jesper Juul is talking
about incoherent worlds, he's

1421
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,090
really talking about worlds
where there's not really a

1422
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,680
story, and there are video games
that have awful stories,

1423
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,700
that's true.

1424
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,030
But when you're forced, or when
you're thinking about

1425
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,420
your world not only as a
fictional world as a

1426
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,270
simulation, but also as a world
that has to produce a

1427
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:20,460
story that makes sense, that
is going to provide more

1428
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,340
coherence to the world
hopefully.

1429
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,820
We have to [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1430
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,690
But that means that you can take
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] for

1431
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:26,940
games, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1432
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,450

1433
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,080
And there are things that yes
there are complains about,

1434
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,510
like why does Mario
have to realize?

1435
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,760
Well, because it's
Mario, right?

1436
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,650

1437
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,090
Is that part of the story?

1438
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:49,310
That's one of those no-man's
land issues.

1439
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,460
Does that undermine the
consistency of the world?

1440
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:59,450
Maybe the anthological level,
the level of the world itself.

1441
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:02,750
But really, it's more about
making sense about the rules.

1442
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:04,310
What is it--

1443
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,160
being able to look at the
world in a critical way.

1444
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,070
I'm trying to think
of an example of--

1445
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:13,028
apart from the three
lives of Mario--

1446
01:01:13,028 --> 01:01:14,462
AUDIENCE: He was a plumber.

1447
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:15,418
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: What?

1448
01:01:15,418 --> 01:01:16,646
AUDIENCE: I thought you
said he was a plumber.

1449
01:01:16,646 --> 01:01:17,330
Oh no, that was in the theme.

1450
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:23,370
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: No,
but for example, Kirby.

1451
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:29,350
He eats other creatures
and spits them.

1452
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,160
Where does it come from?

1453
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,730
Why does it do that?

1454
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,870
What is the story of Kirby?

1455
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:39,330
He's kind of cute, but hey, I
would watch out with him,

1456
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:40,770
because he can eat almost
anything, and then

1457
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:41,190
he just dumps it?

1458
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:43,560
AUDIENCE: Kirby's a weirdly
disturbing character.

1459
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,042
[LAUGHTER]

1460
01:01:45,042 --> 01:01:46,153
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes,
if you think about

1461
01:01:46,153 --> 01:01:47,018
it in terms of stories.

1462
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:48,994
But this is kind of wow.

1463
01:01:48,994 --> 01:01:49,982
AUDIENCE: Yoshi, too, right?

1464
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:50,980
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes.

1465
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,870
And I love Yoshi.

1466
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:55,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and that's
another video game character--

1467
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,340
it seems like one of the reasons
why these arguments

1468
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,980
have been raised is because
there have been these huge

1469
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,225
piles of inconsistencies.

1470
01:02:02,225 --> 01:02:04,340
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But the
inconsistency has become--

1471
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:06,740
I think that when you try
to write the story,

1472
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:07,990
if that makes sense.

1473
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:10,650

1474
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:14,662
So Yoshi eats creatures and--

1475
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:16,030
AUDIENCE: Then he
spits them out.

1476
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:17,280
Each one.

1477
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,170

1478
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,790
Depends on which Mario you're
talking about, because if it's

1479
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,395
Super Mario World--

1480
01:02:21,395 --> 01:02:22,050
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: I'm
thinking of Yoshi's Island.

1481
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:22,960
AUDIENCE: Okay, yeah,
in Yoshi's Island,

1482
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,792
yeah, he poops eggs.

1483
01:02:23,792 --> 01:02:25,966
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, and
is like, hm, and then he

1484
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:27,690
throws it, and they're
like bombs?

1485
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he throws
his eggs at--

1486
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:30,600
he uses his eggs as weapons.

1487
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:35,125

1488
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,370
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah, but
all of those things become

1489
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,610
evident the moment that
we start his story

1490
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:39,400
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1491
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,500
So who is this person, what do
they do, why do they do this?

1492
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,740
Wow, it's kind of
falling apart.

1493
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:45,270
So the incoherence--

1494
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,620
and I'm just thinking that I
don't know if you guys will

1495
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:48,620
really like this or not--

1496
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:51,640
but the incoherence comes
from the impossibility--

1497
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,710
or not impossibility, but the
problems of trying to make

1498
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,320
this into a story and
realizing, well,

1499
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,610
this has not been--

1500
01:02:58,610 --> 01:03:01,040
this has been thought out as a
cool game, and I love Yoshi's

1501
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,480
Island, but as a story, it
kind of falls apart.

1502
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,222
Yes?

1503
01:03:08,222 --> 01:03:11,510
AUDIENCE: I think one of the
really glaring inconsistencies

1504
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:14,760
in a lot of RPGs in particular
is that in most of these

1505
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,550
worlds, there's some kind of
resurrection card, and there

1506
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:21,865
are a lot of plots which revolve
around character dying

1507
01:03:21,865 --> 01:03:24,267
and that being a bad thing,
but then you're like, why

1508
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:28,210
don't you just use your
Phoenix Down or--

1509
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,500
why do we care if the human is
being assassinated, I've got

1510
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,690
this thing in my inventory which
will bring him back.

1511
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:35,232
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes, I
wished that about Aeris like a

1512
01:03:35,232 --> 01:03:37,990
thousand times, and no, because
this guy kills her?

1513
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:38,580
Then what kind of--

1514
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:41,000
AUDIENCE: The actual conceit
there is you're not dead,

1515
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,750
you're just knocked out.

1516
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,950
So it's like smelling
salts or something.

1517
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:47,390
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But
there are games like

1518
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:50,620
Planescape: Torment where that
is incorporated in the--

1519
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:54,300
you're immortal, and that's the
thing, figuring out why

1520
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,160
you're immortal.

1521
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:58,520
They make fun of you waking
up, and you go like, oh my

1522
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,950
goodness, this really hurts,
I feel terrible!

1523
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:08,560
And then making that
problem into an

1524
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,630
essential part of the game.

1525
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:10,050
Yes?

1526
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:14,500
AUDIENCE: So, with the RPG
thing, the incoherency is how

1527
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,790
so many times when you're in
these battles, you're doing

1528
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:18,000
these incredible things.

1529
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,230
Like you're summoning asteroids
or jumping in the

1530
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,460
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1531
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:25,330
But then in the game world,
you get to a ledge, and

1532
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:26,916
they're like, oh,
it's a ledge.

1533
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:28,640
I have to go around.

1534
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,430
Or it's a gap like this wide.

1535
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:34,420
I can't step over it because
of a bush, oh no!

1536
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,750
What am I going to do?

1537
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:37,590
There's a bush in the way.

1538
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:38,520
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
But you're

1539
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:40,210
thinking diagonals, too.

1540
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,090
What?

1541
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,485
No, I cannot do diagonals.

1542
01:04:44,485 --> 01:04:46,670
AUDIENCE: I think another
egregious inconsistency that

1543
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,820
comes up a lot is the--

1544
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:52,140
and I think it's explicitly
mentioned in the reading--

1545
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,580
that you're the world savior
usually, and on the way,

1546
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:00,650
you're going to pillage, steal,
kill innocent people,

1547
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:01,860
and it's not going
to be a big deal.

1548
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,420
And even in games where they
make the endpoint variable, so

1549
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,530
all right, you can either save
the world to or be a total

1550
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,350
jerk, and that fixes one
problem, they still have the

1551
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,880
problem that during the game,
you can alternate back and

1552
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,330
forth between being really good
and really bad, and all

1553
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,510
it does is it kind of swings
you one way or the other.

1554
01:05:18,510 --> 01:05:19,630
It's one dimensional.

1555
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,045
So you're sort of just in a
spectrum, and if you do five

1556
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:23,910
really bad things and then
five really good things,

1557
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:25,280
you're back to where
you started.

1558
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,750
And that's not necessarily
consistent in terms

1559
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:30,210
storytelling.

1560
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,580
AUDIENCE: Well, there's also the
classic inconsistency of

1561
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:36,990
if I don't save the world,
everything will be destroyed,

1562
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,422
but you're still going
to charge me 100

1563
01:05:38,422 --> 01:05:39,549
gil for this phoenix?

1564
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:43,413
[LAUGHTER]

1565
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:45,400
AUDIENCE: It's still
inconsistent.

1566
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,130
AUDIENCE: Or, I have to save
the world now because bad

1567
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:48,890
things are happening.

1568
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:50,887
Let me go do these 20
side quests first.

1569
01:05:50,887 --> 01:05:52,835
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: The
whole world is that--

1570
01:05:52,835 --> 01:05:54,783
AUDIENCE: This cat's
stuck in a tree!

1571
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:56,244
[LAUGHTER]

1572
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:57,687
AUDIENCE: There're rats
in the cellar,

1573
01:05:57,687 --> 01:05:58,310
man, rats in the cellar.

1574
01:05:58,310 --> 01:06:00,550
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yes, but
the end of the world is nigh.

1575
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:03,010
Like in Final Fantasy, the end
of the world is nigh, but let

1576
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:03,160
me go around--

1577
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,580
AUDIENCE: Blitzball!

1578
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:06,767
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: --and get
more random encounters so

1579
01:06:06,767 --> 01:06:08,350
that I can bump up my stats.

1580
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:10,210
AUDIENCE: So that actually
reminds me of--

1581
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:11,230
I think it was a web-comic--

1582
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:15,880
that I read around a month ago,
and it was based around,

1583
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,360
oh my god, you're our savior!

1584
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:18,310
You know how to solve it!

1585
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,310
Yes, I am, and so the whole
time, he's just going on,

1586
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,802
like, what are you doing?

1587
01:06:22,802 --> 01:06:26,280
They're raping and pillaging
everything, they're destroying

1588
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,820
everything, what
are you doing?

1589
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:30,220
Oh, I'll do that in a second,
I just have to get this

1590
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,960
really, really cool shield.

1591
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,910
And then at one point it's like,
why, what are you doing?

1592
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:38,620
It's like, I'm fishing, so I
can get this lure, so I can

1593
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,700
catch another fish.

1594
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,570
Why would you ever be doing
this right now when the

1595
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:46,925
world's about to end, and
evil is spreading across

1596
01:06:46,925 --> 01:06:47,350
everything?

1597
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,581
He's like, don't worry
about it, I'm on it.

1598
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:51,145
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Well,
it's very interesting.

1599
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:54,400
And this is my last slide,
so if you want to--

1600
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,570
we can go on discussing.

1601
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,442
PROFESSOR: Sure.

1602
01:06:56,442 --> 01:07:00,210
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So at
times, the little cues that

1603
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,330
are building world or building
character can also backfire.

1604
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:09,330
So I've been playing one of the
DS Zelda games, and one of

1605
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:12,230
the nicest touches is that
whenever you meet a character,

1606
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,800
Link is going to look
at them in the eye.

1607
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:16,030
Hi!

1608
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:18,700
You're walking, and
it's like, hi.

1609
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,265
And at times it's super weird,
because the characters look at

1610
01:07:21,265 --> 01:07:21,730
each other.

1611
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,960
They acknowledge that they're
there, so they feel kind of

1612
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,600
alive with a very simple
algorithm, where there's

1613
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,040
another character, they
look at each other.

1614
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,520
It's like, wow, they're alive,
cool, and they react.

1615
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,430
But then, you go into somebody's
house, and they're

1616
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,140
looking at you and
you're like, hi!

1617
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,100
[BREAKING SOUND]

1618
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:38,720
You know?

1619
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,584
You break their pots
to get rupees.

1620
01:07:40,584 --> 01:07:42,914
And they're looking at you,
and you're breaking

1621
01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:44,320
everything.

1622
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:46,470
And it's just like, this
is kind of weird.

1623
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,710
They should react, because
they're looking at you while

1624
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,588
you're breaking their house.

1625
01:07:51,588 --> 01:07:57,880
And that's, again, is giving a
touch that is making those

1626
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:00,610
characters alive, but it's also
like breaking it, like,

1627
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,785
I'm still breaking your pots.

1628
01:08:01,785 --> 01:08:03,108
I don't know what's better.

1629
01:08:03,108 --> 01:08:08,440
AUDIENCE: I think that
was subverted in--

1630
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,930
no, in another Zelda game,
Link's Awakening?

1631
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:16,022
You go into the shop, and the
shop owner is always looking

1632
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,136
at you, so if you take something
off the shelf and

1633
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:19,850
try to exit, he says, no,
you can't do that,

1634
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:20,990
you can't steal it.

1635
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:24,040
But if you run around him, he's
not fast enough to keep

1636
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,456
his eye on you, so you run
around him until he's looking

1637
01:08:26,456 --> 01:08:29,410
away, and you can leave.

1638
01:08:29,410 --> 01:08:31,979
But if you come back in, he
says, you're the guy who stole

1639
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:33,689
something, and he shoots
you with a laser.

1640
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:35,689
[LAUGHTER]

1641
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,949
AUDIENCE: And then every
character in the game calls

1642
01:08:37,949 --> 01:08:39,355
you "thief" for the
rest of the game.

1643
01:08:39,355 --> 01:08:40,267
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Ah,
that's really funny.

1644
01:08:40,267 --> 01:08:42,547
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's awesome.

1645
01:08:42,547 --> 01:08:45,798
AUDIENCE: I was going to say,
Oblivion and Fallout do the

1646
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:49,330
same, where everyone watches
you if they're within--

1647
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,380
if they're acknowledging you,
and then you try to take

1648
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:53,470
something, they're run up and be
like, why the hell are you

1649
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:56,640
taking my stuff, or start
beating you up or whatever.

1650
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:56,979
AUDIENCE: Or shooting you.

1651
01:08:56,979 --> 01:08:59,180
AUDIENCE: Or calling
the town guard.

1652
01:08:59,180 --> 01:09:01,760
But it's problematic when you're
powerful enough and you

1653
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,540
can take the town guard.

1654
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,960
Then it's just really annoying
because everywhere you go,

1655
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,116
there's guys you can kill that
are kind of there, and you're

1656
01:09:07,116 --> 01:09:10,920
like, all right, come on,
get out of my way.

1657
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,629
AUDIENCE: So there was a Mega
Man Legends which I don't know

1658
01:09:14,629 --> 01:09:15,520
if anybody ever played.

1659
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,590
I don't think anyone ever
played that game.

1660
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:20,322
But essentially it was like
Mega Man, but the

1661
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,050
RPG style of game.

1662
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:25,279
But it was actually slightly
different from most RPGs.

1663
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,500
Most RPGs, you just walk around,
walking into people's

1664
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,020
houses, looking for loot.

1665
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:31,740
But you actually couldn't just
walk into people's houses.

1666
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,190
Their doors would be locked.

1667
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,573
And you could knock and see if
anybody was there, but it was

1668
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,284
kind of interesting, because it
was actually consistent, in

1669
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:40,560
the sense that you couldn't
just randomly walk into

1670
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,359
somebody's house and
steal their crap.

1671
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,010
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So one
thing that I wanted to ask--

1672
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:48,520
because all these things in
video games, after a while,

1673
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,260
they result in [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
right?

1674
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,510
Because we have the possibility
of having a

1675
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:58,780
fleshed out world that we can
interact with, that is

1676
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,280
simulated, and the times where
those cracks are showing,

1677
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,080
where the system is is showing,
when it's showing

1678
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,085
that this is limited, that we've
chosen a specific level

1679
01:10:08,085 --> 01:10:12,050
of abstraction to simulate
the world.

1680
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:18,800
But do those incongruencies
bother people in board games

1681
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,050
or card games so much?

1682
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,680

1683
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,490
AUDIENCE: I would argue that
sometimes it's a little bit of

1684
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:30,440
a speed bump to learning
what's going on.

1685
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,765
Assuming some [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
assuming

1686
01:10:32,765 --> 01:10:35,100
that is incoherent.

1687
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:39,517
It seems like because it's
almost impossible to play a

1688
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:41,409
card game or a board game
without first understanding

1689
01:10:41,409 --> 01:10:44,090
the rules, unlike in video games
where you can just jump

1690
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:49,190
right in, that is usually
something that can be

1691
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:53,772
surmounted if people say, oh,
the rules say this, but the

1692
01:10:53,772 --> 01:10:56,197
theme says that, OK, I
understand how to play by the

1693
01:10:56,197 --> 01:10:59,080
rules, and be able to
step over that.

1694
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,340
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
and I think that that's an

1695
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,060
excellent point, and when we
start playing a board game,

1696
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,970
probably what you guys do in
this class, is you get a new

1697
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:06,480
board game.

1698
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,020
What do you do?

1699
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,865
You pick up the instructions
and you're figuring out the

1700
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,630
rules first, and
not the world.

1701
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:15,850
In a lot of video games, we
figure out the world first,

1702
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,800
and then by exploring
the world, we're

1703
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,640
figuring out the rules.

1704
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,040
And even if there are games that
are giving us tutorials

1705
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:24,320
or manuals, who--

1706
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:28,370
I don't know, not many people
read the manuals, if at all.

1707
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:29,330
AUDIENCE: While the game
is installing.

1708
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,630
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

1709
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,450
But manuals is not
something that--

1710
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,600
even though it's going to be the
first thing to look at in

1711
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,260
a board game and a card game.

1712
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:47,980
And even, well, as a player, you
also look at the rule book

1713
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:51,750
at least to built your own
character most times.

1714
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,240
AUDIENCE: You mean on PC
and computer games?

1715
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:53,935
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: On
role-playing games.

1716
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,655
AUDIENCE: Oh, are you
talking about table

1717
01:11:57,655 --> 01:11:58,500
top role-play games?

1718
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,400
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yes, table top.

1719
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,115
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah, even
table top role-playing

1720
01:12:01,115 --> 01:12:02,340
games you try to start.

1721
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,890
People start by looking
at their handbooks.

1722
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,345
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
LARPing might be a

1723
01:12:06,345 --> 01:12:08,480
good example of how--

1724
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,790
LARPing, you're just
given your

1725
01:12:10,790 --> 01:12:11,590
AUDIENCE: Your character
sheet.

1726
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,900
You have to read it.

1727
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:13,230
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Your
character sheet, which is very

1728
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:15,250
interesting.

1729
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:18,370
AUDIENCE: For role-playing, I
know a lot of people who can't

1730
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:20,770
really be bothered to learn the
rules that thoroughly and

1731
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:24,375
prefer just to experience the
story and have somebody tell

1732
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,885
them how to resolve
the mechanics and

1733
01:12:25,885 --> 01:12:26,990
that kind of thing.

1734
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:30,080
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But it's
funny, because when you're

1735
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,000
building your character in a
table top role-playing game,

1736
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,610
you still have to have a look
at what is the race that you

1737
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,920
want, what is your religion,
what is your powers that you

1738
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,490
want to choose?

1739
01:12:43,490 --> 01:12:46,717
Even if you're only playing for
kicks, and you don't care

1740
01:12:46,717 --> 01:12:47,989
so much about the rule.

1741
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,375
And I'm the type of table top
role-player that prefers the

1742
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:54,980
story, and I don't care
so much about combat.

1743
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:58,270
But you still have to know the
rules even before you start

1744
01:12:58,270 --> 01:12:59,530
playing, if that makes sense.

1745
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:01,390
AUDIENCE: There are situations
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] described

1746
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:04,390
where people don't look at the
rules, but then they're

1747
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:06,543
usually relying on the GM to
tell them what's allowed and

1748
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:08,850
what's not allowed, which means
someone read the rules.

1749
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,249
It's no different from someone
explaining to you a card game,

1750
01:13:11,249 --> 01:13:12,235
as opposed to having
the rules--

1751
01:13:12,235 --> 01:13:14,700
AUDIENCE: It actually makes
the experience a bit like

1752
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,020
playing a computer game,
that the GM does the

1753
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,270
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1754
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,396
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the GM is your
computer, and in fact it's

1755
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:23,952
more powerful than a computer,
because a GM can figure out

1756
01:13:23,952 --> 01:13:25,928
what you're actually asking.

1757
01:13:25,928 --> 01:13:29,880
[LAUGHTER]

1758
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,350
[INAUDIBLE]

1759
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:34,820
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about the

1760
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:35,820
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], actually.

1761
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,250
So one thing about card games
and board games is that almost

1762
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:43,360
everything that gets revealed or
that happens in the middle

1763
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:49,000
of the game is usually
a player mechanics.

1764
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,310
Sometimes there's some loose
flexibility, like games where

1765
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:56,910
they allow open negotiation
between specific players.

1766
01:13:56,910 --> 01:13:59,080
But most of it's actually in the
play of a card, the move

1767
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,120
of a piece, something
like that.

1768
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:04,270
And especially when you're
playing cards, you have to

1769
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:07,980
play flavor text, especially for
cards where you can just

1770
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,440
play them at any time.

1771
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,100
And I've seen micronarratives
done--

1772
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:16,034
at least what I think a
micronarrative seems to be--

1773
01:14:16,034 --> 01:14:19,065
done pretty well in
those instances.

1774
01:14:19,065 --> 01:14:23,320
In fact, in the example of
cards, right, someone tries to

1775
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,410
do something that might win them
the game, but you play

1776
01:14:25,410 --> 01:14:29,390
this card, and that denies them
the win, but it is tied

1777
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:32,490
up with some sort of flavor
text, some sort of thematic

1778
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:33,810
element to that card.

1779
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,786
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Well,
it could be like--

1780
01:14:36,786 --> 01:14:39,910
in Monopoly, what is
the type of card?

1781
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:40,510
Those two types of cards.

1782
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:40,970
AUDIENCE: Go to jail?

1783
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:41,962
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: No.

1784
01:14:41,962 --> 01:14:42,760
AUDIENCE: Community
Chest and Chance?

1785
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,690
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Yeah,
like the Chance.

1786
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,930
There's Chance when there's
something that happens to you,

1787
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:48,005
but there's also--

1788
01:14:48,005 --> 01:14:48,770
AUDIENCE: Community Chest.

1789
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,730
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: --the
Community Chest, thank you,

1790
01:14:50,730 --> 01:14:51,920
which is something
that you play.

1791
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:55,200
The differences in
micronarratives here, what it

1792
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,920
means is something, it's a
reaction to player's events.

1793
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:03,680
It's not something that the
player chooses to do.

1794
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:07,610
Those reaction cards, those are
also part of the player's

1795
01:15:07,610 --> 01:15:12,190
narrative, and in a way, the
player is choosing, this is

1796
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:14,440
going to happen now.

1797
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,470
This is what Gloom is about, and
these are what these two

1798
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:18,420
games are about most
of the time.

1799
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:22,110
It's like you're trying to
construct a story, and you're

1800
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:25,500
trying to tamper into somebody
else's story, so it's that

1801
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,400
kind of reaction.

1802
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,720
Yeah, we would have to
find a name for it.

1803
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:34,020
But yeah, the micronarrative is
referring to something that

1804
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,490
happens as reaction.

1805
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:38,696
It's not something that
the player does.

1806
01:15:38,696 --> 01:15:40,310
AUDIENCE: It's often in reaction
to what another

1807
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,830
player is doing.

1808
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,698
So it depends on whose point
of view you are taking.

1809
01:15:43,698 --> 01:15:47,480
So, I've got a Community Chest
card, and I'm holding it until

1810
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,710
somebody else is about to take
advantage of a position, and

1811
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,690
then I deny them that.

1812
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,114
So it's still a reaction
to what the

1813
01:15:56,114 --> 01:15:57,060
other player is doing.

1814
01:15:57,060 --> 01:15:59,290
AUDIENCE: Well, I just wanted
to mention, in terms of

1815
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:01,386
micronarrative, I don't
know, would this

1816
01:16:01,386 --> 01:16:02,600
be a possible example?

1817
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,674
In the board game that we're
designing, there's a computer

1818
01:16:04,674 --> 01:16:06,909
in the center that you want to
hack, and every time someone

1819
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:07,970
tries to hack it,
it gets weaker.

1820
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,564
So it's sort of a response to
someone doing an action on it.

1821
01:16:11,564 --> 01:16:13,110
Would that count as a
micronarrative, or is that

1822
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,441
more of a mechanic?

1823
01:16:15,441 --> 01:16:20,630
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: It
seems as an event it's

1824
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:21,360
an important event.

1825
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:22,350
It's a change of state.

1826
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:25,680
But I don't know how much
of a story it is.

1827
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,370
And there's no science to what
constitutes an event or not.

1828
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:31,636
It's something that's part of
my research, it's something

1829
01:16:31,636 --> 01:16:34,480
that I'm going to figure out.

1830
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,160
How can we identify what's an
event that is a rule and is

1831
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,550
also an event in the story?

1832
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:42,650
Because things like
disconnecting the computer, or

1833
01:16:42,650 --> 01:16:46,320
hacking the computer,
yeah, that seems to

1834
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,550
be clearly an event.

1835
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:51,300
What if we had each time that
it becomes weaker, there is

1836
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:53,440
something else that
you can do.

1837
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:57,485
So by hacking the computer,
there is a new action.

1838
01:16:57,485 --> 01:17:00,610
You get access to new areas
of the game, or you

1839
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:03,080
get a new power up.

1840
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:05,500
Or it's easier--

1841
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,890
for example, if--

1842
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:10,060
I'm totally hypothesizing
about what your game is

1843
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,040
about-- but if you will have a
computer that is controlling

1844
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,660
the security of a place,
whenever you hack a certain

1845
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:23,050
part of the system, it's
letting you move faster

1846
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:25,600
through the board.

1847
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:32,240
In a way, that might be closer
to a micronarrative, because

1848
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:34,240
it's a reaction, but it's
also a consequence.

1849
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,016
AUDIENCE: In that case, in
Careers for Girls, when you

1850
01:17:37,016 --> 01:17:39,140
choose to go down a path, is
that a micronarrative?

1851
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:42,406
Because the player chooses and
then sort of changes the

1852
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:43,550
state, [INAUDIBLE].

1853
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:46,520
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: I don't
know the choices, but the

1854
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,420
events that happen, like what
happens when you land on

1855
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,430
something, might be closer.

1856
01:17:51,430 --> 01:17:55,690
And again, it's kind of like,
it's a micronarrative?

1857
01:17:55,690 --> 01:18:00,480
AUDIENCE: Careers and Careers
for Girls, which I both see as

1858
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,562
really, really appalling--

1859
01:18:02,562 --> 01:18:03,430
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: I agree.

1860
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:06,000
AUDIENCE: Seems to be built on
micronarratives, the whole

1861
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,480
idea that everywhere you land,
something's happening--

1862
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,660
you're granted something.

1863
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,240
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: But the
choice-- what I'm saying is

1864
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,965
that the choice itself is not
the micronarrative, it's the

1865
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:15,215
landing and what happens
when you land.

1866
01:18:15,215 --> 01:18:17,770

1867
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:19,270
Oh wow.

1868
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,770
It's almost time.

1869
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,270
Anything else?

1870
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:23,870
AUDIENCE: I actually wanted to
make one last comment about

1871
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:27,530
emergent stories, particularly
the example of The Sims.

1872
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:29,890
Is anybody familiar with
Alice and Kev?

1873
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:31,030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1874
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:32,840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so Alice
and Kev was this really

1875
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,430
interesting experiment that this
guy did where he created

1876
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,630
two homeless Sims,
a father and--

1877
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,360
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: Ah, yes!

1878
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,220
AUDIENCE: --a daughter.

1879
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,050
AUDIENCE: I think we
talked about this--

1880
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:46,020
AUDIENCE: And just did a sort
of a web-comic style display

1881
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,630
of the lives of these two
homeless Sims as she grew up

1882
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,470
and he got older.

1883
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:58,680
And it almost seemed like it
became a role-playing game,

1884
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:03,380
where the guy playing The Sims
became the dungeon master, who

1885
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:07,470
had created these characters,
and then the AIs were playing

1886
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:09,890
these characters for him.

1887
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:14,380
In particular, there was this
one moment where he gets to a

1888
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:18,990
part of the story where the
daughter has just gotten her

1889
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:21,100
first paycheck, and
she decides to

1890
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,580
donate it to charity.

1891
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:25,316
And he keeps trying to keep
her from donating it to

1892
01:19:25,316 --> 01:19:27,740
charity, but she keeps
saying I want to

1893
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,040
donate it to charity.

1894
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,910
So eventually he lets her
donate it to charity.

1895
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,710
And it was almost like it
was the character's

1896
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:36,130
choice to donate it.

1897
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:39,450
At the end of this blog that
he did about this specific

1898
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:43,920
event, he's talking about what
does it mean when a video game

1899
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,320
character that you created makes
you question your own

1900
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,074
life choices?

1901
01:19:48,074 --> 01:19:49,062
[LAUGHTER]

1902
01:19:49,062 --> 01:19:51,370
AUDIENCE: This is a really
interesting thing.

1903
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,630
If you haven't read it, you
should check it out.

1904
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:53,710
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Yeah, on what blog?

1905
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,382
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: I think
it's aliceandkev.com,

1906
01:19:55,382 --> 01:19:57,692
something like that.

1907
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,060
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: It's
a story of the Sims 3.

1908
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,883
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1909
01:20:01,883 --> 01:20:03,356
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA:
Any more?

1910
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:06,547
AUDIENCE: Talking about
non-digital games being very

1911
01:20:06,547 --> 01:20:09,130
involved in your character, and
I felt like one game I've

1912
01:20:09,130 --> 01:20:11,405
played where I've been very
involved with a character is

1913
01:20:11,405 --> 01:20:13,750
Mafia, where there's
not a lot of actual

1914
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:14,550
information given to you.

1915
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:16,660
People are yelling at you, like,
you're the Mafia, the

1916
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,560
way you smiled at him!

1917
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,216
Clearly you guys--

1918
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:20,572
I don't know.

1919
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:23,280
CLARA FERNANDEZ-VARA: So you
become the character more by

1920
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:27,570
how people see you than
how you play it?

1921
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,690
AUDIENCE: I guess you're also
assigning character to other

1922
01:20:29,690 --> 01:20:33,660
people, reading into their
actions and things.

1923
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:37,130
PROFESSOR: That's a game where
the roles are designed by the

1924
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:38,035
designer, right?

1925
01:20:38,035 --> 01:20:39,470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but there's
only two roles.

1926
01:20:39,470 --> 01:20:39,870
It's not like--

1927
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,385
AUDIENCE: Well no, there
can be a lot of roles.

1928
01:20:41,385 --> 01:20:42,115
AUDIENCE: There's a few roles.

1929
01:20:42,115 --> 01:20:44,910
AUDIENCE: I've seen websites
with a whole list of roles,

1930
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,870
and some of them
are hilarious.

1931
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,930
AUDIENCE: Seems good.

1932
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:54,697
In digital games, I feel like
there are the games where you

1933
01:20:54,697 --> 01:20:57,020
have a very defined character,
unlike this.

1934
01:20:57,020 --> 01:20:59,200
If you have a very defined
character in a video game, you

1935
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,370
tend to get into it more,
whereas Fable, your character

1936
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:04,205
isn't defined, and changes based
on the actions you use.

1937
01:21:04,205 --> 01:21:06,580
If you're evil, he becomes
ugly and he gets

1938
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,530
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] things.

1939
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,410
But I never felt like I
identified with the character

1940
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:13,104
at all versus games that already
give me a very strong

1941
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:15,444
character, and I play
a certain way.

1942
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:18,850
PROFESSOR: That's odd because
that's completely--

1943
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:21,110
that runs against what you
would be trying to do, at

1944
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:23,100
least, that's why they're
marketing games that are

1945
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:24,590
trying to do it, to make you
feel closer to the character

1946
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:27,505
because it's the reflection
of who you are.

1947
01:21:27,505 --> 01:21:30,217
AUDIENCE: I think that Bioshock
does a better job of

1948
01:21:30,217 --> 01:21:32,075
that, where you never
see the guy.

1949
01:21:32,075 --> 01:21:35,610
So you're always just looking
through his eyes, and he has

1950
01:21:35,610 --> 01:21:40,021
essentially no personality, at
least, no personality is

1951
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,500
displayed in the game.

1952
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,030
So it's almost as if
you are directly

1953
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,860
interacting with the world.

1954
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,540
PROFESSOR: You're given
a space to to be--

1955
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:50,570
AUDIENCE: To actually project
yourself into the game, which

1956
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:55,030
I think is sort of what Fable
was trying to do, but doesn't

1957
01:21:55,030 --> 01:21:56,062
really do a good job of it.

1958
01:21:56,062 --> 01:21:57,890
Because you see him
right there, and

1959
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,350
he's clearly not you.

1960
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:01,580
AUDIENCE: I feel like Torment
is a really--

1961
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,560
Planescape: Torment has a really
interesting take on

1962
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:08,430
this, where the character is
essentially who it is that you

1963
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,517
play in that, but there's more
to it than that, because

1964
01:22:11,517 --> 01:22:13,892
there's also back story to the
character, which you, the

1965
01:22:13,892 --> 01:22:15,660
character, have forgotten,
and it's

1966
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:16,590
revealed to you over time.

1967
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:21,550
But you know more of that
character, who your character

1968
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:24,710
was back then, than you know
about your character now.

1969
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:27,220
So your nature changes over
time, and you've gone through

1970
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:29,140
several iterations of this.

1971
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,371
And none of them is the truer
or more correct you.

1972
01:22:31,371 --> 01:22:33,450
AUDIENCE: The funny thing about
Planescape: Torment,

1973
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:37,390
it's kind of like a
personality test.

1974
01:22:37,390 --> 01:22:41,450
I've been playing it again, and
the first time I played

1975
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:45,040
through, I was chaotic good?

1976
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,500
And I was trying to
play different.

1977
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:49,200
I'm still chaotic good.

1978
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,650
So I'm kind of freaking out.

1979
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:56,150
OK, I'm really trying to do
something different, but I'm

1980
01:22:56,150 --> 01:22:58,390
still in the same alignment.

1981
01:22:58,390 --> 01:23:01,380
Because a lot of your
definition of--

1982
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,940
and actually, your alignment can
also decide items that you

1983
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,310
can get or things that
you can do--

1984
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:13,360
but it's based on your choices
and how you tackle a quest.

1985
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,410
If you lie, for example, or
if you do crazy things.

1986
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:19,970

1987
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:22,300
It's not something--

1988
01:23:22,300 --> 01:23:26,660
once you realize what the effect
of your choices is, you

1989
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:27,720
can kind of control it.

1990
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,010
But there's--

1991
01:23:29,010 --> 01:23:31,630
playing Planescape is--

1992
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:35,490
it's going to be about you and
how your game playing style is

1993
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:36,825
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] humanity.

1994
01:23:36,825 --> 01:23:39,437
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's
interesting effects in Knights

1995
01:23:39,437 --> 01:23:43,670
of the Old Republic if anybody's
played that.

1996
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:47,240
You can explicitly
make decisions to

1997
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,470
go to the dark side.

1998
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:52,770
I remember when I played it,
every time it came up with a

1999
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:55,030
decision where I could--

2000
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,970
the dark side has all the
awesome powers, right?

2001
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,030
So I kept thinking, I'm gonna be
on the dark side, I'm gonna

2002
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:02,620
have all the awesome powers,
it's gonna be grand.

2003
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:06,210
Then you get to the decisions,
and I was almost uncomfortable

2004
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:09,010
with choosing the evil options,
such that I couldn't

2005
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:12,182
actually bring myself to
go to the dark side.

2006
01:24:12,182 --> 01:24:15,140
PROFESSOR: We are actually
out of time.

2007
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:18,005
But I wouldn't say that--

2008
01:24:18,005 --> 01:24:22,630
the options are thankfully all--
or, actually, let's save

2009
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:24,590
discussion of Knights of the Old
Republic for another class

2010
01:24:24,590 --> 01:24:26,930
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

2011
