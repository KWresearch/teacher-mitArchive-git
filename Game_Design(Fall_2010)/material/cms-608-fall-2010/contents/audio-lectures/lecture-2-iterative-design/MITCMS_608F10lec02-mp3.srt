PROFESSOR: This is our first lab
session for CMS.608 and,

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,732
for folks, who wasn't here
this past Wednesday?

00:00:28,732 --> 00:00:30,148
One, two--

12
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:30,900
AUDIENCE: Who wasn't?

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,180
PROFESSOR: Who was not
here on Wednesday?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

15
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,110
PROFESSOR: And so,
you weren't here.

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,979
Let's see, we have some blank
index cards underneath the--

AUDIENCE: The plastic
Tupperware, I think.

[INAUDIBLE]

19
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:47,240
PROFESSOR: So you can just fill
in your name, your email

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,816
address plus favorite board
game or card game.

21
00:00:50,816 --> 00:00:53,440
The email address, basically,
just gets added

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,880
to the email list.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,290
Did anyone not get an email
from Jason yesterday?

24
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, last night.

25
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,130
PROFESSOR: You didn't
get an email?

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,240
AUDIENCE: I don't think so.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,850
PROFESSOR: OK.

28
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,520
So the email basically said
that there was a swap

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,440
PROFESSOR: --of Friday the
17th, and the 20th.

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,690
So, basically, we're swapping
your readings around--

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,060
and that's really the
only thing, right?

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,630
AUDIENCE: Oh, and I fixed the
link for Zimmerman's article.

34
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,460
PROFESSOR: And, unfortunately,
Eric Zimmerman didn't migrate

his website terribly well,
so all of his pictures--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

37
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,270
PROFESSOR: I actually have one
of his games, SISSYFIGHT 3000.

38
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,790
In fact, this is before
SISSYFIGHT 3000, so this is

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,110
probably 2999, which is going to
be the non-digital version,

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,175
which is the whole point.

41
00:01:41,175 --> 00:01:42,700
It is actually a
computer game.

42
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,750
It is a pretty decent flash
multiplayer game, back in the

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,130
day when flash multiplayer games
were not that common.

44
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,620
And if you haven't played it
before online, after today,

45
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,150
especially if you had a chance
to play with the card deck,

46
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,920
try out the online version.

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,180
Do a Google search
for SISSYFIGHT

48
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,030
3000, and try it online.

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,770
Hopefully, there are still
people playing it, because you

50
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,694
need kind of like a minimum
of five people to

51
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,114
get a good game going.

52
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,566
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
one that was taken down.

53
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,018
AUDIENCE: Aw, suck.

54
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,954
It was such a great game.

55
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,950
PROFESSOR: Never mind.

56
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:20,975
Basically, what you had was, you
got avatar customization

57
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:21,720
in your game.

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,410
You could create your character,
and you could--

59
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:31,780
you had this really cool retro
pixelated look back in the day

60
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,590
when retro pixelated stuff
was not that popular yet.

61
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,050
But the game-play was pretty
much exactly the same as what

62
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,300
a card game has.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,860

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,410
The readings today basically
covered a lot of jargon that

65
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,470
we're going to be using
a lot of that for

66
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,010
the rest of the class.

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,700
For the most part, I'm not
going to go through every

68
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,885
single one of them because
you folks can read.

69
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:02,280
And if I mention something and
you don't get it, you can

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,650
always check back there.

71
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,020
So just remember that the first
chapter in Braithwaite

72
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,560
is a pretty good glossary of
terminology that we're going

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,070
to keep using.

74
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,660
But one of the big things that
they ask is, what is a game?

75
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,360
And it's one of those--

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,450
Does anybody actually want
to offer their definition

77
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,700
of what a game is?

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,759

79
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:35,440
AUDIENCE: A game is something
that involves players and they

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,940
set up, define rules beforehand,
rules that you

81
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,670
have to abide by, whether they
be, you can't go outside this

82
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,340
limit, you have to abide by
certain questions and orders.

83
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,840
Something that has structure
that is meant for one person

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,020
to go from Point A to Point B.

85
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,804
PROFESSOR: OK.

86
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:04,560
Structure, rules,
limits, players.

87
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,305
Anything--

88
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,825
AUDIENCE: It's fun.

89
00:04:06,825 --> 00:04:09,329
AUDIENCE: Fun.

90
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,440
AUDIENCE: It accomplishes
some goal.

91
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,220
PROFESSOR: Goal.

92
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,470
AUDIENCE: So you always
have some goal.

93
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,388
AUDIENCE: You're working
towards something.

94
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,252
PROFESSOR: Anything else?

95
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:19,279
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

96
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,160
AUDIENCE: Or it's an
abstract system.

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,180
Often an abstraction of
some real system.

98
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,430
PROFESSOR: An abstract system.

99
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,310

100
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,450
So these are actually pretty
good benchmarks.

101
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,240
Now there are, again, as Brandon
describes, there isn't

102
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,410
one that's just the canonical
answer for everything.

103
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,250
It really depends on which
theorist you are reading at

104
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,630
any given time.

105
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,030
But usually it will involve a
significant subset of all of

106
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,330
these in the definition.

107
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,870
And I like to keep things broad
and vague because, for

108
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,080
the most part, if you define
yourselves too strictly, it

109
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,810
might be useful.

110
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,756
You're an academic and you need
to write papers about it,

111
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:06,030
but if you're a designer and
you're just trying to create

112
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,510
something fun--

113
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,420
the word I would use is
"engaging," because fun means

114
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,700
a lot of different things to
a lot of different people.

115
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,370
Engaging basically means that
this is going to be something

116
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,940
that you're going to want to
do for a while, that is

117
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,800
motivating.

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,190
It might be terrifying
you out of your wits.

119
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,800
Some people enjoy that, or would
find that experience

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,750
compelling.

121
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,340
I mean they may not
call it fun.

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,812
So I call that engagement.

123
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:40,450
The problem with using fun and
engaging as a metric for

124
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,800
defining what a game is, is
that that means that a bad

125
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,410
game is not a game.

126
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:48,930
A game that fails to achieve
fun, that fails to be

127
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,440
engaging, is not a game.

128
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,900
But I wouldn't go that far,
largely because that means a

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,480
lot of stuff that I created
is not a game.

130
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,930

131
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,250
But it should give you the--

132
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,070
there is no magic point where
a game becomes --the thing

133
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,030
that you're building becomes
fun and then

134
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,110
suddenly becomes a game.

135
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,620
I can't even imagine someone
making that argument, that

136
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,120
it's not a game until
it's fun.

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,680
But I much rather sort of say,
fun and engagement is kind of

138
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,460
more of a metric of how well
designed your game is, not

139
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,050
necessarily whether your
game is a game.

140
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,370
But that is a goal of a game
designer, to try to create an

141
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,870
engaging experience, something
that people are

142
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,770
going to want to do.

143
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,890
I know some game designers
who think that is not,

144
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,910
in fact, their job.

145
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,650
Their job is to maximize
revenue, for instance.

146
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,440
Especially if you work in social
games, there's a lot of

147
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,020
discussion now in how business
and game design is basically

148
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,190
just one thing now.

149
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,995
The whole point of game design
is, how do we get people to

150
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:58,994
pay a little bit more?

151
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:02,025
Zynga's going to be in town
on September 20th,

152
00:07:02,025 --> 00:07:05,530
they're giving a talk.

153
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,225
That has those two
points in it.

154
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:09,125
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

155
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:14,000
PROFESSOR: So I always thought
of design as something that

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,570
you're working towards.

157
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,825
But all these other things--

158
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:20,190
a game should have players.

159
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,010
Again, I don't want to be too
strict on that because I've

160
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,580
certainly seen games that
play themselves.

161
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,520
Anyone here involved
in Battle Code?

162
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,470
That game pretty much
plays itself, right?

163
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,360
I mean, you set it going and
then one side wins, but

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,050
there's no human person at least
during the time when the

165
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,400
games actually being played.

166
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Or you could argue that the
whole course of Battle Code--

167
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,360
for those people who don't know
it, it's an IP course, I

168
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,380
believe, where Course 6 students
basically write bits

169
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,780
of AI to play a real-time
strategy game against some of

170
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,210
other team's AI.

171
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,460
And the basic idea is that, you
win a real-time strategy

172
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,610
game, your AI wins, but there's
no human actually

173
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,940
playing it at a given time.

174
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,440
But, of course, there are humans
writing the AI, so if

175
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,640
you think of the entire class
as a game, then there are

176
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,890
players, there are people.

177
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,380

178
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,160
I suddenly see people make a
case that there are games that

179
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,540
are zero player, and I've heard,
for example, there's a

180
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,740
game out there called Novick,
which is largely a game about

181
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,320
coming up with rules.

182
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,760
And there is a system, which
are actually in the rules

183
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,280
themselves, about how
you change rules.

184
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,039
And, of course, those rules
themselves can be changed.

185
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,460
And that changes the way how you
change rules and, by the

186
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,110
time you actually play the game,
someone's already won.

187
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,550
Because somebody in the game
has no legal moves.

188
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,990
That's the whole game, is
basically making it impossible

189
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,680
for someone else, or someone
else except for you, to win.

190
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,180
So does that game actually
have players?

191
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,600
Well, yes, it does because you
guys are arguing over all the

192
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,180
rule changes through the
rules of the game.

193
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,660
But, in a sense, it had no
players because the game never

194
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,520
actually got played.

195
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,960
The rules are basically stating,
this is an unplayable

196
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,060
game for everybody except
for one person

197
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,210
who's playing the game.

198
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,520
Goals are one of those things
that I used to be very, very

199
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,590
adamant about.

200
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,820
Like a game had to
have a goal.

201
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,970
You have to know what they're
going towards, and if you

202
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,440
don't have that, then it's a
toy or something, it's a

203
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,430
dollhouse, it's an experiment.

204
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,066
The Sims was the one that I was
like railing about when I

205
00:09:38,066 --> 00:09:39,850
was an undergraduate.

206
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,600
You know-- that's not a game.

207
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,500
And, of course, I was working
with many colleagues and

208
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,620
eventually came across, came
over to decide that it doesn't

209
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
matter whether I think
it is a game or not.

210
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,690
If it's in the game shelf of
Best Buy, it's a game.

211
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,330

212
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,700
Because people think it's a
game, and if enough people

213
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,390
think it's a game, then it
might as well be a game.

214
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,090
Otherwise--

215
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,080
because that's what people
think it's going to be.

216
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,860
So when you come up with your
game, I would say that goals

217
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,700
are one of those things that
helps steer player behavior.

218
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,910
So it's one of those tools that
you have as a designer to

219
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,450
basically say, this is
important, this is not.

220
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,640
Reaching the end of 100 meters
is important for a sprinter.

221
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,360
That end is really not
interesting for somebody who

222
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,180
is running 400 meters
or a 50 meter dash.

223
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,990
But that gives someone
a direction

224
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,590
for them to go towards.

225
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,630
But there are plenty of games
where you have to

226
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,680
invent your own goals.

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,040
Other than Sims, can anyone
think of any?

228
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
Where inventing your own goals
is kind of the fun.

229
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,245
AUDIENCE: A lot of NLRPGs.

230
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:56,460
PROFESSOR: A lot of NLRPGs.

231
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,380
They have goals.

232
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,000
They have quests.

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,210
But that's not where a lot
of fun is, necessarily.

234
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,990
AUDIENCE: Second Life.

235
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,050
PROFESSOR: Second Life.

236
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,270
A lot of virtual worlds.

237
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,581
AUDIENCE: A game like EVE?

238
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,400
PROFESSOR: EVE?

239
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,310
Yeah.

240
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,680
EVE, you kind of, want to, like
you have to set your own

241
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,890
goals, because whatever is in
the game is only good enough

242
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,380
for a single player--

243
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,940
to tell whether a single player
whether they're doing

244
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,640
well or not.

245
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,655
But EVE is not about
a single player.

246
00:11:20,655 --> 00:11:24,280
EVE is about thousands and
thousands of people playing

247
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,530
simultaneously.

248
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,760

249
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,840
Actually, have people
heard of EVE?

250
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,821
All right.

251
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:31,312
Yeah.

252
00:11:31,312 --> 00:11:32,048
So, cool.

253
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:32,294
Cool.

254
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:33,767
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

255
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:35,250
PROFESSOR: Oh, cool.

256
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:35,680
In Iceland?

257
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

258
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,655
PROFESSOR: Was it like
really cheap when

259
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,470
you went over there?

260
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,310
AUDIENCE: Yes.

261
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,663
PROFESSOR: Could you have bought
the entire studio?

262
00:11:41,663 --> 00:11:43,587
AUDIENCE: No.

263
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:44,068
Unfortunately.

264
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,954
But it was really cheap.

265
00:11:46,954 --> 00:11:49,145
PROFESSOR: So they must
have been making tons

266
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:50,177
of money over there.

267
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,369
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they're
making money in US

268
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:52,562
Dollars and the Euro.

269
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:55,424
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

270
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,845
PROFESSOR: They probably hire
most, yeah, support most of

271
00:11:57,845 --> 00:11:58,205
the economy.

272
00:11:58,205 --> 00:11:59,438
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

273
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:00,416
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

274
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:00,905
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

275
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:10,205
AUDIENCE: The capitol is
20,000 people so...

276
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:13,440
PROFESSOR: So I'll say goals are
very important tools and

277
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,160
as a result of that you see them
in a lot of the games.

278
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,220
And for most of the games that
you guys are going to be

279
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,370
building, you're going to give a
very clear goal of this what

280
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,230
you want to do--

281
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,480
earn a certain amount of money,
prevent your opponent

282
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,440
from doing anything else,
take over all the land.

283
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,940
That sort of thing.

284
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,720
Let's see.

285
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,415
Oh, I'll get to the
rules last.

286
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:43,730
But, system.

287
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,270
Systems are--

288
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,960
I might already have mentioned
this in the last class, but

289
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,340
games are systems in a way that
most MIT engineers would

290
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,230
think of systems.

291
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,430
They're a bunch of
interconnected little modules,

292
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,910
all of them with sort of
predictable behavior, and then

293
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,070
you put them into a big
interconnected system, and it

294
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,247
is no longer really all that
predictable anymore.

295
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:07,140
At least that's the kind of
games that we're interested in

296
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,530
in this class.

297
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,350
There's also the game-theory
games, where the whole point

298
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,890
of it is trying to predict what
could possibly happen.

299
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,410
And those are great thought
experiments and there's some

300
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,980
really, really interesting math
behind all them and some

301
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,170
interesting rules of thumb
that can come out.

302
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,680
But for the most part, we aren't
going to go into too

303
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,580
much detail about that, largely
because I'm not a

304
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,980
mathematician or economist, so
I don't really have a good

305
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,130
sense of game theory.

306
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,640
Just be aware that there is
this whole field of game

307
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,200
theory in economics.

308
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,730
If you're doing a game like an
auction system, if you're

309
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,090
doing a game where people are
doing either a lot of

310
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,610
simultaneous moves or the whole
point of the game is

311
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,610
trying to predict what strategy
your opponent's going

312
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,570
to do, you might actually want
to read up a little bit on

313
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,600
game theory, if nothing else,
just to give you some

314
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,350
vocabulary to talk about it with
your teammates, and some

315
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,575
tools to be able to think
through some of the design

316
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:05,030
problems that you've got.

317
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,420
And we do have one session
where I'll

318
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,670
introduce some of that.

319
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,910

320
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,840
Finally, we are getting
to rules.

321
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,490
The things that give your game
structure and the constraints

322
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,895
of the things you can't do.

323
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:23,750
You can't move from here to
there without having your foot

324
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,540
tied to another player, that
sort of constraint.

325
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,017
Or a rule being you can't see
anything during a certain part

326
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,267
of the game.

327
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:36,390

328
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,330
There are two bits of
terminology introduced by

329
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,470
Brenda and Ian Schreiber in
their book, which is in Core

330
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,650
Mechanic and Core Dynamic.

331
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,710
So before I'm going to go into
the core mechanic and core

332
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,430
dynamic, I'm going to talk about
mechanic and dynamic.

333
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,276
Anyone want to throw out the
definition of mechanic?

334
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:59,270
AUDIENCE: I reckon it's sort of
the actions like a player

335
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,785
takes during a game like the
physical actions he takes.

336
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:04,760
PROFESSOR: OK.

337
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,460
The actions that a player
decides to take?

338
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,710
AUDIENCE: Decides
to take, yeah.

339
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,388

340
00:15:13,388 --> 00:15:14,260
PROFESSOR: Sorry if this
is a little low,

341
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,870
I saw Patrick and--

342
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,174
or did those hands
just go down?

343
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:21,066
I thought I saw a
few more hands.

344
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,280
AUDIENCE: Actions
that are sort of

345
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,186
designed by the game designer.

346
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,668
So it's intended actions.

347
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:29,632

348
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:32,940
PROFESSOR: Design is definitely
a good point.

349
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,660
A game mechanic is definitely
something that you as a game

350
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,800
designer control.

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,083
There are--

352
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:46,220
if a player decides to do
something in the game that you

353
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,600
did not explicitly think
about, and you did not

354
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,040
explicitly say, all right this
is what players are going to

355
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,660
be doing in a game,
then it might not

356
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,950
actually be a mechanic.

357
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,760
It might be something that
you're discovering in your

358
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,920
play testing that you will
turn into a mechanic.

359
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,292
But because it's not designed,
it's kind of--

360
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:04,530
it becomes more like a strategy,
actually, like an

361
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:04,990
emergent strategy.

362
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,355
Sorry.

363
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:06,580
You were saying, Jeremy?

364
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,356
AUDIENCE: Is it more
like a dynamic ?

365
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:09,540
PROFESSOR: Possibly.

366
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,540
There are times where it is.

367
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,820
Yeah.

368
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,030
Actually let's throw out
definitions of dynamic, what

369
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,280
do people--

370
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,170

371
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,040
well, Jeremy?

372
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,884
AUDIENCE: It's behavior that
emerges from mechanics?

373
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:24,826
PROFESSOR: It's emergent
behavior?

374
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:28,560

375
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,880
What else?

376
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,240
AUDIENCE: Use of mechanics that
isn't directly stated in

377
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,734
the rules of the game.

378
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,710
PROFESSOR: OK.

379
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,686
So unstated.

380
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:42,650
I'm running out of space here.

381
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,108
I thought I saw a hand
on this side.

382
00:16:46,108 --> 00:16:46,602
No?

383
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:48,084
OK.

384
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:48,580
All right.

385
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,020
So, yeah, dynamics
are basically

386
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,670
interactions of mechanics.

387
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,670
It's like you don't have
anything that may necessarily

388
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,860
explicitly say, because of this
one rule and because of

389
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,970
this other rule, and because of
the things that the players

390
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,020
can do in that, a good
strategy is to

391
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,560
do something else.

392
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,030
So let me see whether I can
think of an example.

393
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,316
Right now, everything
that's coming

394
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:18,460
to my head is StarCraft.

395
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,960
AUDIENCE: Has that been the case
for the last few weeks?

396
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,200
PROFESSOR: Unfortunately, yes.

397
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,329
By the way, if anybody
is playing

398
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,194
StarCraft, I need testers.

399
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:27,985
AUDIENCE: StarCraft
II or StarCraft I?

400
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:28,740
PROFESSOR: Two.

401
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:28,990
AUDIENCE: Ah, yes.

402
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,776
PROFESSOR: I need testers for
a math game I'm designing.

403
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:33,990
AUDIENCE: I play Zerg.

404
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

405
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,890

406
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,210
PROFESSOR: OK.

407
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,580
AUDIENCE: So there's this role
selection mechanic where

408
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,542
everybody picks the thing which
they want to happen

409
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:45,898
during their turn.

410
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

411
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,180
AUDIENCE: and mostly everybody
chooses to build

412
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,690
a particular cross.

413
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,380
And the dynamic that emerges
from the sequence of play,

414
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,590
which goes clockwise is that
it's best to optimize your

415
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,620
strategy so that you were doing,
so you were benefiting

416
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,240
from the role of the person
to your right,

417
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,563
is likely to choose.

418
00:18:10,563 --> 00:18:13,322
But you're making the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] of the person

419
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:16,972
you elect is most likely
win a ship.

420
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:21,935
So mechanically it's role
selection and turn order and

421
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,904
then the dynamic
is the strategy

422
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,790
written by the program.

423
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,130
PROFESSOR: Which gives
you some idea what

424
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,600
to select as opposed--

425
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,415
the mechanic is you
can select.

426
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:34,380
The dynamic is, here are a
couple of strategies that you

427
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,310
can use in sort of assessing
what would best to select.

428
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,480
And if all the players start
to understand that, then it

429
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,850
almost becomes like a second
layer of rules almost.

430
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,220
If anyone has played a game
like Bridge, for instance,

431
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,470
there's actually a ton of things
that are assumed in the

432
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,490
play which are not actually in
the rules of Bridge when it

433
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,140
comes to bidding.

434
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,140
Like when you call out a bid,
it's highly dependent on what

435
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,030
you actually have in
your card hand.

436
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,570
And that's not actually written
in the rules anywhere.

437
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,720
But the assumption is that there
is optimal way to do it.

438
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,950
And since there's optimal way to
do it, everyone's expected

439
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,760
to know those optimal ways.

440
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,870
The example in the book was
chess moves, like every single

441
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,190
piece of chess has a set
of moves that it

442
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:19,970
can perform, right?

443
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,410
Pawns go one or two
squares, depending

444
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,290
where they're starting.

445
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,900
The bishops move diagonally.

446
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,350
But there are also
opening gambits.

447
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,370

448
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:34,610
Opening gambits that are also
well known, at least among

449
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,300
professional chess players, and
the idea being, oh, this

450
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,290
person is using this opening,
therefore, if I counter it

451
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,140
with this response, I actually
have a reasonable chance of

452
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,740
actually winning this game,
and professional chess

453
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,440
players know this.

454
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,020
The other thing that comes up in
chess, which is not in the

455
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,600
book, is there is the concept
of threatened squares.

456
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,130

457
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,730
If you move, if there is a
square where there is no piece

458
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,680
on a chess board--

459
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,800
everyone here knows the rules
of chess, more or less?

460
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,230
So say you've got a bishop--

461
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,805
and this is quite a simple chess
board-- and you've got

462
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:21,390
the bishop, and it can move
like that, right?

463
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:25,820
So every single square on these
lines is threatened.

464
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,320
It's something which the
bishop could move to.

465
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,594
Unless, of course, it's lost by
a pawn or something, then

466
00:20:34,594 --> 00:20:36,610
these are not going to be
threatened by the pawns.

467
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,410

468
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,950
If your knight obviously is no
longer straight lines, it

469
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,460
becomes a specific or sort of
like stochastic pattern of

470
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,710
squares that become
threatened.

471
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,100

472
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,520
But the idea of here's this
square now that nobody dares

473
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,780
move into until something's
done about that bishop.

474
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,746
Either something gets moved in
its way, or something takes

475
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,487
out the bishop or forces the
bishop to move by threatening

476
00:21:04,487 --> 00:21:08,210
it instead in a way that
it cannot respond.

477
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:14,610
So threatened squares is not a
rule in chess, but it greatly

478
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,130
shapes your decision making
and that's the difference

479
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,070
between dynamic and mechanic.

480
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,440
There's a lot of strong
correspondence between

481
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,890
mechanics and rules.

482
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,320
But--

483
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,210
and I had a long, long little
rant about exactly what the

484
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,860
difference is between
mechanics and rules.

485
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,760
And what I basically--

486
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,290
I know I'm going to get the rant
right now, but it's like

487
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,520
overlapping venn diagram.

488
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,830
There's a very, very large area
where it's exactly the

489
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,760
same thing.

490
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,430
My general rubric for trying
to figure out whether

491
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,330
something is a mechanic or not
is whether this is the thing

492
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,310
that changes the state
of the game.

493
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,200
It is an action.

494
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,230
It is something that someone is
going to be doing to change

495
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:04,220
the state of what the game is.

496
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,475
In chess, that's largely the
movement of the piece.

497
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:13,100

498
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,370
If it's ultimate.

499
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,600
It could be just physical
movement.

500
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,900
You are limited on when you
can physically move.

501
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,862
If you have that frisbee,
you're not moving.

502
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,680
Well, your feet are
not moving.

503
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,260
I believe that's a
rule of Ultimate.

504
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,650

505
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:34,180
So the reason why I use that
definition is because there

506
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,100
are occasionally times when I
need to talk about mechanics

507
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,650
that players aren't
actually doing.

508
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:43,550
The game requires certain pieces
to move in a certain

509
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,800
way, certain things to
happen in the game in

510
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,900
such and such a time.

511
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,860
For instance, you have
these die rolls and--

512
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,521
actually, that's not
a good example.

513
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,630
Let me think.

514
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,440
Right at the beginning of
Settlers of Catan there is the

515
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,033
way how you set up the board,
and that establishes what a

516
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,640
game state is going to be.

517
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,070
It changes game state by giving
you a game state in the

518
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,320
first place.

519
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,250

520
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,690
I consider that a mechanic.

521
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,700
That is something
that's going--

522
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,930
that's not one rule.

523
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,442
That's actually a whole
collection of rules.

524
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,916
And if you're interested in
finding out what those rules

525
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:21,244
are, the box is actually in
that closet over there.

526
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:24,045
There are something like five or
six different rules on how

527
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:25,220
you set up your board.

528
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,130
It's going to be, set up your
game state, and I consider

529
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,460
that a mechanic.

530
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,740
How people do bidding
and buying things

531
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,625
in Settlers of Catan?

532
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,100
That's dynamic.

533
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,440
There are no real rules on
how much something costs.

534
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,780
That's up to the players to
work out on your own.

535
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,646
So that's how I sort of consider
the difference

536
00:23:45,646 --> 00:23:50,083
between dynamic and mechanic.

537
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,610
They're really, really useful
concepts because really, for

538
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,640
the most part, as a designer you
have an idea of what kind

539
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,040
of dynamics are interesting.

540
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,870
And the more games that you
play, the more inspiration you

541
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:09,130
get from various sources, your
range of different ideas of

542
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,480
what kind of dynamics might be

543
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,195
interesting is going to expand.

544
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:15,455
But all you have control on are
mechanics, the specific

545
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:21,670
rules that you're giving, note
that game mechanics don't

546
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:26,730
necessarily need to be written
or described out.

547
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,020
This is one thing that I think
you and your teammates should

548
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,480
figure out when you're
talking about

549
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,570
mechanics for a given project.

550
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,800
Are we just talking about the
things we are writing down?

551
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,670
Because there are
some assumptions

552
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,760
that are just given.

553
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,060
We are playing a game, and we're
not playing some sort of

554
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,570
schoolyard game or something,
hitting people with solid

555
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,650
objects that's disallowed.

556
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,590
Not necessarily something
you need to write down.

557
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:00,940
Unless you're playing
with certain people.

558
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,420
You can assume that
the game again --

559
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,750
things like how fast people
normally do things.

560
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,650
There's a game over here called
Falling, which is

561
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,410
actually a real-time
card game.

562
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:17,920
It goes as fast you can possibly
play it, and there is

563
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,920
no there is no limit on how fast
you can play these cards.

564
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,360
But there is a real physical
limit on how fast you could

565
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,100
physically grab the card out of
your hand and put it down.

566
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,766
So, actually, it's not even on
your hand, your just moving

567
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:30,810
cards on table.

568
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,510
So make sure you give
that a try today.

569
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:41,140

570
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,050
Finally, we'll be getting
to aesthetics, I think--

571
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,352
next class?

572
00:25:47,352 --> 00:25:49,090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

573
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,160
PROFESSOR: So, which
is another thing

574
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,150
which a game designer--

575
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,010
in fact, what I would like game
designers to actually

576
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,750
spend more time thinking about,
which is, what is the

577
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,620
feeling you want your
player to have?

578
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,360
As opposed to, this
might be fun, or

579
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,020
this might be engaging.

580
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,560
And specifically,
how is it fun?

581
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,660
And how is it engaging?

582
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,560
Is it fun as in like,
yes, victory!

583
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,110
I have crushed all
my opponents.

584
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,410
Or is it fun as if, well, we
had a really good time

585
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,790
together and we got to know
each other really well.

586
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,472
There are games that are
designed for both of those.

587
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,350

588
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,570
And what is the aesthetic
you're going for?

589
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,145
Are you going for something
poetic?

590
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:27,040
Are you going for something
fiercely competitive?

591
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,080
Tournament competitive?

592
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,572
Are you going for just a nice
little social experiment?

593
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:34,290

594
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,570
Core mechanics and core dynamics
are a tool, again,

595
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,060
for designers.

596
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,010
The idea of--

597
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:44,410
there really isn't a huge
difference between what's a

598
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,870
core mechanic and what's just
a mechanic, except inside a

599
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,610
designer or design team's
discussion.

600
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,880
The idea of having a core
mechanic is you identify this

601
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,435
is what our game's about.

602
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,840
Or a core dynamic means this
is what our game's about.

603
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,950
And a lot of core mechanics in
first person shooters is

604
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,590
pointing and shooting.

605
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,880
I'm going to point at something
and I'm going to

606
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,080
launch a projectile that way,
and that projectile is going

607
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,840
to move in some physical
properties.

608
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,736
Maybe it arcs, maybe
it goes straight.

609
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:17,690

610
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,480
I would say that the core
mechanic of Halo isn't

611
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,420
actually that.

612
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,640
Who has not played Halo or
seen someone play Halo?

613
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,620
OK.

614
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,460
So the idea, core mechanic--

615
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:36,700
or I think my Bungie calls it
the core game play loop--

616
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,670

617
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:44,860
of Halo is, you shoot at
something, you take cover, you

618
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,940
throw a grenade at it, you wait
for the grenade to go

619
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,030
off, and then you shoot at
it again until it dies.

620
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,090
That's pretty much all
you are doing for the

621
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,310
entirety of Halo 1.

622
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:01,730
I'm sure Halo 2, Halo 3 gets
complicated, but de-identify

623
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,280
that as you actually read the
post-mortems and if you read

624
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,500
the talks that are given,
they say those--

625
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,180
I can't remember if it was 20
seconds or five seconds of

626
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,010
game play which is used
to describe that.

627
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,030
I think that five seconds
of game play is what

628
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,500
they focused on.

629
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,850
And if they could get every
little thing in that sequence

630
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:23,330
correct, they can repeat that
same thing at infinitum, and

631
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:25,800
you'll still will
be having fun.

632
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,430
Halo 1, everyone.

633
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:29,930

634
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,180
They're kinda right.

635
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,090
But the idea being, if you've
got a core mechanic, and

636
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,300
you've got one thing in your
game that someone's going to

637
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,500
be doing over and over and over
again, all your players

638
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
are going to be doing over and
over again-- maybe it's

639
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,900
bidding because it may be some
kind of auction game.

640
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,790
In Falling and Pit,
it's transferring

641
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,100
cards to other people.

642
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,300
I'm trying to think of the other
games that we got here.

643
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:59,820
In SISSYFIGHT, I would imagine
the main core mechanic would

644
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,690
be putting down the card and
everyone revealing the cards

645
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,790
simultaneously, because of you
all take simultaneous turns.

646
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,440
Make sure that's really,
really fun.

647
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,060
And Yahtzee is rolling dice.

648
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,630
That action, that thing that
you're going to be doing over

649
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,660
and over again, has to be at
least fairly engaging.

650
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,755
Because if you can't get that
right, then what happens is

651
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:26,590
that that same movement, that
happens 30 to 50 times in your

652
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,640
game, just--

653
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,980
the badness just gets multiplied
by 30 or 50.

654
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,640
And you don't want that.

655
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,085
So for core mechanics, I would
say the thing that happens in

656
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:40,510
your game the most--

657
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,120
and you want to make sure that
that part is as engaging as

658
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,970
possible because it gives you a
rubric to say, what's not a

659
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,360
core mechanic might be,
in fact, expendable.

660
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,530
You might not actually
need it in your game.

661
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,860
So if you've got a problem--
this game takes too long to

662
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,820
play, this game's too hard to
learn, this game's over too

663
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,430
fast, it's too random
or something--

664
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,040
take a look at all the
things that are--

665
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,350
but first make sure that your
core mechanics not the cause

666
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,180
of the problem.

667
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,220
But if the core mechanics
doesn't seem to be causing the

668
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,190
problem, that seems to be
working, something else in the

669
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,080
game is not working.

670
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,820
Everything else expendable.

671
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,030
And so you can look at
everything else in the game,

672
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,770
all these other rules that
you've got, and say, how does

673
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,270
that work with a
core mechanic?

674
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,110
How does that help?

675
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,670
How does that hurt the
core mechanic?

676
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,990
It just helps your discussion
as a team.

677
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,860
Or as an individual game
designer, it helps you to

678
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,200
think about what could
we throw out?

679
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,390
What could we keep?

680
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,120
Similarly for core dynamic.

681
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,280
It's like here's this particular
interaction that we

682
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,990
really, really want.

683
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,830
And SISSYFIGHT is guessing
what other people

684
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,080
are going to do.

685
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,520

686
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,780
I'm trying to think
of other examples.

687
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,440
And like territorial
space acquisition.

688
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,000
I guess Go is about taking
over territory in space.

689
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,600
If that's your core dynamic,
you say that's kind of fun,

690
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,680
just making sure that I'm in
control of space and nobody

691
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,170
else can do anything they
want to do in a

692
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,500
certain part of the board.

693
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,100
That's fun.

694
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,490
That's what I'm going for;
that's my core dynamic.

695
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,660
That's what this game
is all about.

696
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,730
Then you can look at every
single mechanic, even your

697
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,382
core mechanics, and say, is
it all serving that goal?

698
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:25,050
Now there's a whole bunch of
tips right at the end of

699
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:30,700
chapter one of Challenges for
Game Designers about how to

700
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,530
break designer's block.

701
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,420
But I would say, actually, those
things are just things

702
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,740
you should be doing all
the time, not just

703
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,520
when you have a problem.

704
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,870
But you should be
experimenting.

705
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,750
Things like, OK, you've
got a variable.

706
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,530
Draw two cards every
turn or something.

707
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,530
Multiply it by two.

708
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:46,680
See what it does to your game.

709
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,150
Halve it.

710
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,000
Draw one card.

711
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,430
See what it does to your game.

712
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,490
Through a rule-out, and that
sort of gets you to the whole

713
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,870
iterative design thing, is
that you don't actually,

714
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,880
because games are systems,
these complex little

715
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,560
collections of seemingly simple
things, you don't

716
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,060
actually know how these changes
are really going to

717
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,720
affect the game.

718
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,060
You may have a hunch, but until
you actually play it

719
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,870
out, you don't actually know.

720
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,910
So the whole point of
iterative design in

721
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,440
engineering as well as in
game design is that

722
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,190
you make the change.

723
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,350
It has to be a substantial
change.

724
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,520
And then you actually
put it to the test

725
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,400
and see what happens.

726
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,310
This means, of course, testing,
and testing takes a

727
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:35,180
long time and if you're going to
be making a game that takes

728
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,500
a long time, then your testing
gets even longer.

729
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,560
So for the first project that's
going to be coming up,

730
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,200
assignment one, you want to be
aiming for games that take

731
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,390
really not very long to play.

732
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,880
These games that we got today,
I'm not sure about

733
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,636
[INAUDIBLE], but I know
everything else that we got on

734
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,550
that table, is pretty
darn fast.

735
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,900
Which means if you play an hour
with four people who've

736
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,130
never played your game before,
you get through two or three

737
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,480
rounds, four rounds, of them.

738
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,480
Each time, you'll be teaching
a rule once, sharing and

739
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,650
seeing how that changed
the game.

740
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,850
If you've got a game that takes
an hour to play, and

741
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,870
believe me, a lot of the
projects that we've gotten

742
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,070
from previous semesters take
at least an hour to play.

743
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,100
You've got four people for an
hour and another definition of

744
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,170
a single-player game.

745
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,620
Because by the time they finish
learning your game ,

746
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,730
half your time's up.

747
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,160
So that's a process that we will
like you all to be using

748
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,100
in your teams and your
assignments, is iterative

749
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,490
design process.

750
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,167
Right from the beginning--

751
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:43,190
I wish I had more space--

752
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,960
but we're going to start
with brainstorming.

753
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,920
That's actually going to be
Friday, the 17th, where we'll

754
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,400
actually sort of--

755
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,330
for folks who haven't
necessarily formally learned

756
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,780
brainstorming we're just going
to do a quick refresher so

757
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,420
that everyone sort of
is on the same page.

758
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,670
You learn how to do
brainstorming.

759
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,740
You come up with a basic idea
of a game, and you start to

760
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,060
identify things that could
be your core dynamics.

761
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:15,330
You think of what sort of core
mechanics could address that.

762
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,889
Knock something up really,
really quickly with the

763
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:20,790
crappiest materials you
can get your hands

764
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,320
on and start playing.

765
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,040
Since nobody on your team
knows, really, what game

766
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,975
you're making at that point of
time, you can probably test it

767
00:34:27,975 --> 00:34:28,449
with your team.

768
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:30,739
As soon as you do it a few
times, your team becomes

769
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:34,167
useless as testers because you
already know too much about

770
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:37,380
the game and what the game
could have been.

771
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,159
And you start playing it in
ways that a fresh person,

772
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,719
who's never seen your
game before,

773
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,540
wouldn't even consider.

774
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,840
So you actually want to keep
looking for people who've

775
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,750
never played your game before.

776
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,260
So the next step would be to
broaden it to other teams in

777
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,620
this class.

778
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,679
Because everyone's going to be
broken up in more or less

779
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,780
teams of three or four.

780
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:57,360
That's pretty much, I'm going
to take this game that we

781
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,260
designed for a team of three or
four, and give it to that

782
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,170
team of three or four.

783
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,790
And then you play their game,
and give each other feedback.

784
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:06,790
And that lasts for about one
more session, and after that,

785
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,050
everyone in the class
is useless now.

786
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:13,471
So you have to look for
dormmates, friends, people on

787
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:16,176
the street, just go right ahead
and try to get as much

788
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,426
feedback as you can.

789
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:20,720

790
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,750
There is some value in
replaying, especially later on

791
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,550
once your rules are pretty
set in that people start

792
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,780
developing strategies, still
some of them emergent

793
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,370
behaviors, things to
understanding sort of higher

794
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:39,130
level play of the game, and
you do want to test that.

795
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,960
But don't let that prevent
you from also

796
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,300
testing with fresh players.

797
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,830
Because in the end, you
have to get past

798
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,720
that initial hurdle.

799
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,770
Anytime someone sees your game,
they are going to have

800
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,210
to learn your game from
scratch at least once.

801
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:55,680
And if they don't even get
that far, they're never

802
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,530
playing your game a second
or third time.

803
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,180
So don't optimize for the people
who play your game for

804
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,055
four weeks, because you really
want the people who've only

805
00:36:06,055 --> 00:36:10,020
played it once to have
a good time as well.

806
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,920
That's not necessarily the case
if you're making a huge,

807
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,780
well-funded game based
on a franchise

808
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,360
that's been around forever.

809
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,100
If you're doing Halo 3 or Modern
Warfare 3 or something

810
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:24,040
like that, then sure you can
sort of cater to the fans

811
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,570
who've already developed these
strategies and skills.

812
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,720
But in our case, we're going
after a new audience.

813
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,690
We're going after someone who's
never played anything

814
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,024
like what you've played
with before.

815
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:38,870

816
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,002
Cool.

817
00:36:39,002 --> 00:36:41,770
Any questions?

818
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:46,476
Feel like we've been soapboxing
here for a while.

819
00:36:46,476 --> 00:36:47,726
Is there anything?

820
00:36:47,726 --> 00:36:51,236

821
00:36:51,236 --> 00:36:54,310
AUDIENCE: I guess the thing I
would add from my experience,

822
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,740
especially with iterative design
is, a big trick of it

823
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,955
is learning to kind of distance
yourself emotionally

824
00:37:00,955 --> 00:37:05,175
from what you're working on,
because half the time you end

825
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,080
up chucking things that
you really liked.

826
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,042
You think, oh, this would be
so great, but it's best to

827
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:10,990
just remove it.

828
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,800
And it helps to think of it as
kind of putting it on the

829
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,330
shelf for later, and saying, OK,
I'll deal with this later,

830
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,440
or I can try this
in another game.

831
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,830
And on a related note, I don't
know about you, but I found

832
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,100
that, when games I'm designing
have a problem, it's almost

833
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,780
always fixed by removing
something as opposed to adding

834
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,840
more stuff on it.

835
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,500
Unless you're going for
something, I think, really

836
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,010
complex off to start, I always
prefer to try to take

837
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,140
something out and simplify it.

838
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,392
Especially on short projects
like these it almost always

839
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:39,642
works better.

840
00:37:39,642 --> 00:37:43,620

841
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,230
And then, in terms of testing,
too, one thing just kind of a

842
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,570
tip that I find works, is if
you're designing a game that

843
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,740
has a lot of different, like,
passive victory and this is a

844
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,600
little bit higher level, which
you'll see when we get there,

845
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,810
where if you want a game that
has different viable

846
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:01,470
strategies, a really good
testing method is to have

847
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:03,790
different people kind of
play like a perfect

848
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,060
version of that strategy.

849
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,470
And you say, I'm going to do
this strategy, or I'm always

850
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,740
going to do X, and it doesn't
matter if I think it's dumb,

851
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,730
I'm just going to do it.

852
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,920
Because that will really help
you find rules that are

853
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,356
appropriate, or find something
that's overpowered.

854
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,345
AUDIENCE: A good example would
be Settlers right.

855
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:22,220
Like if you say, obviously this
wouldn't work because,

856
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,030
the game's a good game, but
like, I'm always going to

857
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:24,480
build roads.

858
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,695
You know what I mean?

859
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:27,430
In practice, that would be
stupid,but when you're

860
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,030
designing a game, you do that
kind of strategy, and you just

861
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,635
limit yourself to one action,
you can really find things

862
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,028
that are broken really
quickly.

863
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:41,450

864
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:44,414
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

865
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:45,896
Much appreciated.

866
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:46,390
Cookies.

867
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,366
Good, we have cookies.

868
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:53,800

869
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,060
Let's see.

870
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,900
So I think after this, we're
just going to play games.

871
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,100
We do have pre-testing as a
topic coming up later in the

872
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,590
semester, where I will actually
sort of talk about

873
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,330
the discipline on how
do you do testing.

874
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,840

875
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:16,160
Honestly, you shouldn't wait for
that class to necessarily

876
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,410
start practicing.

877
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,010

878
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:22,775
It could be as simple as just
grabbing a unit that you have

879
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,490
never seen before and just
trying to get a whole bunch of

880
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,290
people to play it.

881
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,870
And critiquing it at
the same time.

882
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,730
It's like, why did I do that?

883
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:29,730
Why did you do that?

884
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,170
Why did you do that move?

885
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,900
And there are sort of practices
to make sure that

886
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,420
when it's your game, you are
not sort of telling the

887
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,990
players what they should be
doing while they are trying to

888
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,570
play the game, because that
affects their play of the game

889
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,410
in a way that biases it.

890
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,580
Well, we'll get to that
later in the semester.

891
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:56,200
For now just be aware, the more
that you're testing, the

892
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,510
more you're sort of tweaking
your rules in between tests

893
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,110
and then getting another chance
to test and test and

894
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,210
test, the closer you are to
getting a game that is

895
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,530
actually fun and engaging
to play.

896
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,440
And that's what we're
looking for.

897
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,710
That's the process that we
expect you folks to suceed in.

898
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,220
When do we ever get to
fun and engaging?

899
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,170
Who knows?

900
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:13,850
We don't know whether you're
going to get there, so we're

901
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,820
not grading you based on that.

902
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,470
Just remember that.

903
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,926
We're not grading you on how
engaging your games are.

904
00:40:17,926 --> 00:40:19,710
But how well do you stick
to the process?

905
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,655
Yes.

906
00:40:20,655 --> 00:40:22,080
Absolutely.

907
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,615
There was a question in the
forums about when do you stop?

908
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:31,600

909
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,300
I didn't get a chance to
look too closely at it.

910
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,130
What--can you repeat it?

911
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,140
AUDIENCE: It's essentially,
it's the question of, say,

912
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,070
there is this iterative
design process.

913
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,070
When do you know when
to just sort of

914
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,574
get out of that process?

915
00:40:41,574 --> 00:40:42,022
But--

916
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,918
AUDIENCE: Due date.

917
00:40:42,918 --> 00:40:43,660
AUDIENCE: Due date.

918
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,420
OK.

919
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,780
That's always a good reason.

920
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,540
I guess, if you didn't have a
due date, like how would you

921
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,570
know when to shift?

922
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,610
Well, let's say you have control
over the due date.

923
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:56,645
I guess part of that is, you
should always be updating,

924
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:58,520
blah blah, so I guess the
question is when do you know

925
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,590
when you have something you can
put out into the world?

926
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,110
PROFESSOR: So the cynical answer
is that, yeah, is that

927
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:07,770
you wait for --

928
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,704
you have to ship, right, or
you're not getting any cash.

929
00:41:11,704 --> 00:41:17,560
I personally think it would
be sooner than you think.

930
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,070
As, like, my game's almost
ready but I know there's

931
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,360
something wrong with
it, especially

932
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,890
when you're a student.

933
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,650
Right now, I'm in this mode with
my StarCraft games, which

934
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,490
is, this path is cracked.

935
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,780
I know there's something
wrong with it.

936
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,160
I have no idea what it is.

937
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,140
Therefore, I'm going
to release it.

938
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,480
Because until I do that,
I have no idea

939
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,600
what's wrong with it.

940
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,950
I need to get that
information.

941
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,140
The nice thing about stuff like
computer games is that

942
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,000
you can ship updates.

943
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,840
It's annoying but you can.

944
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,460
But even board games and card
games now have rule revisions,

945
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,970
rule clarifications that you
can release over the net.

946
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,710
For the most part, if you're
going to go professional, your

947
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,990
publisher will tell you.

948
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,010
And then the answer really
is due date.

949
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,170
It's going to the presses
on this date.

950
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:12,260
And that's one maxim,
which is, game

951
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,430
projects are never finished.

952
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,610
They're just abandoned.

953
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,570
It's just horrible.

954
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,425
I can't do anything else about
this because I'm out of time.

955
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:20,560
Ship it.

956
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,740
But one thing that you can
do to prepare for that--

957
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,220
Let me see.

958
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,536
Is there a laser around here?

959
00:42:25,536 --> 00:42:32,230

960
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:37,210
There is a guy who runs a
blog called Lost Garden.

961
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,000
His name is Dan Cook.

962
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,940
He works over in Microsoft.

963
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,270
And he talks a lot about
game design.

964
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,640
Specifically about video game
design, but actually his stuff

965
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,522
is actually really,
really impeccable.

966
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:51,090
And he has this concept that
game design-- or iterative

967
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:59,290
game design kind of goes in this
kind of cycle, where this

968
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:01,020
list down here is the
number of features

969
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,700
you've got in the game.

970
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,790
The trick, though, is that what
you're really doing is,

971
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,690
you are taking-- let me
see if this is right.

972
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:15,440

973
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,860
So this is all the good stuff.

974
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,330
This is all the stuff
that's not so good.

975
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:28,330
And the whole idea of sort of
like using iterative design is

976
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:32,850
to allow yourself to the space
to come up with a whole bunch

977
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,340
of ideas, not knowing whether
they're good or bad.

978
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:39,950
But it also gives you a gate to
cut out all the bad stuff.

979
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:44,100
So at frequent periodic
intervals, you have a

980
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,040
collection of rules, of cards,
of designs, of whatever

981
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,230
consists your game, that, is
pretty much as good as it

982
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,935
possibly could have been
given the amount of

983
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:54,850
time that you got.

984
00:43:54,850 --> 00:43:57,420
And that could ship.

985
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:01,930
So if ship date was here, you
had as good a game as you

986
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,950
possibly could do it.

987
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,240
If ship date turned out to be
there, all of a sudden you've

988
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,692
still had the opportunity to put
out all of the stuff that

989
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:13,310
you knew was bad.

990
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:16,550
So iterative design is not
about, let's just keep

991
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:19,470
accreting more and more and
more and more features.

992
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,610
It's more about, we're going to
add some features and then

993
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,210
we're going to remove the
ones that don't work.

994
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:26,700
And that's really,
really important.

995
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,780
So at any given time,
you are prepared to

996
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,520
sort of release it.

997
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,670
As for when you actually decide
that this is now ready

998
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,620
to go out, again I will repeat,
sooner day than you

999
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,570
think because you need
that feedback.

1000
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,270
Sometimes you don't know how a
market is going to respond

1001
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,690
until you actually do it, but
you can do a soft launch.

1002
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:50,190
If you are doing a commercial
product, you can do things

1003
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,580
where, we're going to release it
to a few select stores and

1004
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,060
get that feedback before we
go into major print run.

1005
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:02,510
Or for 10,000 different copies
of the same board game.

1006
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:06,000
We're going to 200 copies and
see how that does for us.

1007
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,340
Gives you the opportunity to
make a revision, but it's

1008
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,240
still an official release,
because those 200 people think

1009
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,880
that this is the final
packaged product.

1010
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,280
That's pretty much how a lot
of manufacturing industries

1011
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,350
actually work, anyway, so you
think about any kind of

1012
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,685
product design, a lot of them
have a sort of a trial period.

1013
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:26,930
AUDIENCE: Soft drinks
you get a lot.

1014
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,660
PROFESSOR: Soft drinks
you get a lot.

1015
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,540
Japanese electronics,
and other things.

1016
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,550
You release it in Tokyo, and
then you release it in the

1017
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,980
rest of Japan.

1018
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,160
And sometimes it never makes it
out of Japan because that

1019
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,550
initial test--

1020
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,920
yeah, it was a good product but
not enough people bought

1021
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,970
it because of these problems.

1022
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,220
So instead of releasing it into
the world, we're going to

1023
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,928
make version two, and maybe
that will be one we

1024
00:45:49,928 --> 00:45:51,930
release to the world.

1025
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,050
That's one example.

1026
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,276
All right, so we have games.

1027
00:45:58,276 --> 00:46:01,650
Who has not played Uno?

1028
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:04,966
OK, we have more games that--

1029
00:46:04,966 --> 00:46:05,462
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1030
00:46:05,462 --> 00:46:06,950
[LAUGHTER]

1031
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,310
OK.

1032
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:11,520
So Jason, you're going
to do a Euchre table?

1033
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,292
So--

1034
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:15,633
AUDIENCE: It sounds like 4
player trick taking game, kind

1035
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:16,954
of like bane or current

1037
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,152
PROFESSOR: Looks like we have
exactly four people-- one,

1038
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:26,638
two, three, four, one,
two, three--

1039
00:46:26,638 --> 00:46:29,626
it's an average of three
people per table.

1040
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:32,180

1041
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,352
I think most of these games
are three to five player,

1042
00:46:36,352 --> 00:46:39,638
although I'm going to
be absolutely sure.

1043
00:46:39,638 --> 00:46:44,830

PROFESSOR: You guys might
actually want to try the round

to play bowling.

1052
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,470
PROFESSOR: So basically, take
a game from the table.

1053
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,930
I'll bring some out and
I'll see --play them.

1054
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,000
Once you've had a chance
to play a few times,

1055
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,590
feel free to switch.

1056
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,876
And try to get as many games
played as possible during the

1057
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,126
next couple of hours.
