9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,919
PROFESSOR: One example will be
what happens when the battery

10
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:26,100
runs up on the computer
and what bubbles

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,500
up when it's running.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,520
And there's certain computers
that might [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

13
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,050
hard drives.

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,090
Some computers just keep it in
RAM when you restart it.

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,670
There's no big difference.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,188
What happens when an IM window
pops up in the middle of the

17
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,667
game and leaves the
control screen?

18
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:46,152
And all the keys start
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

19
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:48,140
IM window.

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,836
Ideally, they give you pop
ups that doesn't work.

21
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:54,730
But catching those is one of our
favorite things that we do

22
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:59,032
when we're making digital games
here in the lab is like

23
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,260
slamming all of our fingers on
the keyboard at once and see

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,860
what happens.

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,250
And we're kind of looking
for those things.

26
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,650
We're also looking for subtler
things like is the amount of

27
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,342
RAM that those games are taking
up in the computer

28
00:01:13,342 --> 00:01:17,240
slowly going up all the time?

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,090
And of course, comparing it
against a spec grade.

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,470
So a character is supposed to
be able to create a certain

31
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,120
file hold style or something
when you enter this key

32
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,865
sequence, and 99 times out of
100 that works and that 1 out

33
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:37,110
of 100 doesn't and we need
to figure out why.

34
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,670
That's our feat.

35
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,920
So in a lot of those situations,
what happens is

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,850
that output comes back in the
form of other parts and-- how

37
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,092
many of you actually
do programming?

38
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:52,570
Oh, OK.

39
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,935
How many of you have found
a book report?

40
00:01:55,935 --> 00:01:57,753
OK, not that many.

41
00:01:57,753 --> 00:02:00,770

42
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,130
There are a couple of best
practices where you follow a

43
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,583
book report and this one
translates a little bit into

44
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,290
when you're really working
in a team in a game.

45
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,430
How do you communicate that
something is wrong to someone

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,850
else who is also responsible
for the game, but may not

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,500
necessarily have seen
the problem?

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,630
First of all, you describe what
you were expecting to

49
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,550
happen and what you
were doing.

50
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,795
I was expecting to go right when
I push the right button.

51
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,070
And then you write down
what happened.

52
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,410
You try to get as much detail as
possible for the person to

53
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,230
re-release this problem.

54
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,660
Now, when it comes to war games,
in many situations, the

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,480
kind of detail that you need
to provide largely comes up

56
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,720
against it.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,160
So 'a' had this much money, 'b'
had that much money, they

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,010
try to do this game mechanic
and no one knew what to do

59
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,085
because the way the rules are
written there's only one way

60
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,450
to interpret it.

61
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,590
And that gives your team enough
information to be able

62
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,920
to start acting on it.

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,150
Because you are bargaining and
your rules are kind of right

64
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,330
out there in the open, there's
usually less of a mystery to

65
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,810
see where the problem occurs.

66
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,470
But you know there's problem
and it could end and you

67
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,060
largely see where it lies.

68
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,590
You may not know what to do
to correct it, and that's

69
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,320
actually where beta
testing comes in.

70
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,160
So but I'll get to the
testing shortly.

71
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,935
But technical testing, a lot
of it again is comparing a

72
00:03:32,935 --> 00:03:33,950
given spec.

73
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,382
Sometimes that spec is created
from your team.

74
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,330
This is what we want
our game to do.

75
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,340
This is what we expected to
happen when we made this game.

76
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,280
We expect that mid in the game,
a certain game mechanic

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,710
will start to take priority
over other mechanics.

78
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,900
Early on, everyone's buying
property is a monopoly.

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,990
Later on, everyone's going to
be building houses and then

80
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,910
even at the end, people start
to mortgage stuff.

81
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,920
That's what we kind of
expected out of it.

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,630
And then you play the game and
you start realizing you

83
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,400
mortgaging something way too
early here, something's out of

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,700
whack here.

85
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,910
So that's the kind of technical

86
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,780
testing you do in games.

87
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,340
This is what we expect, why
isn't it happening?

88
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,940
The other side over here is
kind of like being the

89
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,750
defender of the player, being
the player's advocate.

90
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,360

91
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,130
How, can you be the person on
the team that is actively

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,516
looking for things in your game
that are going to hurt

93
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:36,648
your players and then mentioning
it and saying,

94
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:38,395
maybe we should do something
about that.

95
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:42,810
It's as simple as, here's the
information that we want our

96
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,760
players to have at
a certain time.

97
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,050
Here's the game state.

98
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,790
Your characters have
a certain state.

99
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,790
They are this close to winning,
but are this far away

100
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,120
from winning to have
these results here.

101
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,445
Do the players understand
that?

102
00:04:57,445 --> 00:05:00,730
Have you provided them with
enough information to be able

103
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,340
to make a good decision?

104
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,145
If they know the game state, do
they know what options they

105
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:09,380
have in front of them?

106
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,730
So as we play more and more
board games this semester, you

107
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:19,620
can actually look at the way
how rules are presented

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:19,870
redundantly.

109
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,510
Sometimes they're written up in
the rule sheet, but and of

110
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,400
course you've got your index
card-sized thing which goes

111
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,270
through step one, two, three,
four, these are the four

112
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,238
things you've got to remember
every single turn.

113
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,581
You've got to get it, and
everybody has a copy right in

114
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:37,000
front of you because somebody on
the team decided that that

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,980
was a good idea.

116
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,495
How did they come to
that conclusion?

117
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:47,170
Occasionally, they are doing it
because they see there's a

118
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,390
problem right away.

119
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,060
There's too much information,
and you just don't expect any

120
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,690
player is ever going to be
able to grasp all this

121
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,485
information.

122
00:05:55,485 --> 00:06:00,423
So that's come out with a couple
of ways to simplify it.

123
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:03,734
Sometimes that involves taking
up the mechanics, making

124
00:06:03,734 --> 00:06:07,750
something that was written up a
text graphic report and some

125
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,846
icons, reducing all the numbers
by two so the math

126
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,060
becomes easier.

127
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:18,200
But sometimes, you do it by
usability testing, and that's

128
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,260
one kind of testing
that often comes

129
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,640
together with beta testing.

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,850
I've invited Sara Verrilli, our
development director, to

131
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,709
come in here and talk about the
kind of pre-testing that

132
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,699
you can do, which is illustrated
by this picture.

133
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,700

134
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,500
And the book goes through
several different kinds of

135
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,410
environments where you do
pre-testing that's sitting

136
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,625
one-on-one with people
and doing site

137
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:51,320
testing for the group.

138
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,422
Because this style is all about
board games and card

139
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:57,150
games, for the most part, we're
designing games for

140
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,050
three or four people
to play at a time.

141
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,440
The chances are, almost every
single test that you're going

142
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,016
to do [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
at a single time.

143
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,674
That's just the environment
you're in

144
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,570
that's meant to be played.

145
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,390
That's why you end
up testing it.

146
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,056
Obviously, a single-play
computer game, that's not

147
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,800
necessarily the environment
you're testing in.

148
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,985
Actually, before I transition
over, there is one thing I

149
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,670
want to mention about
technical testing.

150
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,855
Sometimes the specs you're
testing against are not the

151
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:26,710
ones that came up that would
necessarily come up

152
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,640
with phi over t.

153
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,520
If you're doing a
computer game--

154
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,510
say for an Xbox or
a PS3 or a Wii.

155
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:37,001
There are these things called
technical [? evaluation ?]

156
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:42,280
requirements, which are
basically huge lists of things

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,391
that your game must do before
Microsoft will sign your title

158
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:50,720
or allow it to be released
under that title.

159
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,796
PC obviously doesn't have this,
but if you release it on

160
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,900
speed or something, then chances
are, you'll have

161
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,110
requirements.

162
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,730
It could be something as
simple as generally, it

163
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,596
doesn't crash--

164
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:06,830
and games do crash, even
on PS3 and Xbox--

165
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:12,330
you get things like what happens
when you're playing a

166
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,442
game on the PS3 or Xbox--

167
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:18,012
I guess more the PS2 and the
first Xbox-- and someone yanks

168
00:08:18,012 --> 00:08:20,880
out the cable?

169
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,510
All you're thinking is that
you're-- and then the keyboard

170
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,805
comes out, what happens?

171
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,390
Does it continue?

172
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,740
STUDENT: It buzzes.

173
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,900
PROFESSOR: It goes into
pause, right?

174
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,289
And usually it tells you, your
controller is disconnected.

175
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,950
And that's a requirement.

176
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,111
Someone had to write that code
specifically to detect that

177
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:44,610
situation and then throughout
the suite across the game.

178
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,590
And the reason everybody had
to do that was because

179
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,560
Microsoft and Sony
and Nintendo--

180
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,730
well, not so much Nintendo
nowadays

181
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,230
because Nintendo is wireless--

182
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,880
but these are the kinds of
requirements that they expect.

183
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,248
If you lose your connection to
Xbox live halfway through the

184
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,650
game then something's
going to happen.

185
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:08,595
And so again, for that kind of
technical testing, you're sort

186
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:11,416
of comparing it against spec,
but spec may not necessarily

187
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,392
be something that you're
keeping up with.

188
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:18,860
It may be something that the
publisher or your platform

189
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,230
developer, platform manufacturer
mandated.

190
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,750
How does it affect the board
games is that sometimes, board

191
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,225
games are actually going
to require half the

192
00:09:27,225 --> 00:09:28,480
requirements to that.

193
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,543
If you're responsible for the
design of the box, for

194
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:33,930
instance, there are things
they're going to require on

195
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,046
the outside of the box, like
what ages are the game

196
00:09:38,046 --> 00:09:40,820
applicable for, how long is it
meant to be played, how many

197
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,680
people are going to be
playing your game.

198
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,800
I think Days of Wonder, which
is a publisher, actually

199
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,370
requires a character
to be on the box.

200
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,120
Even if your game has no
characters, there must be a

201
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,750
human-like presence on the box
or your players are on the box

202
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,010
because they think that it
increases sales, and they

203
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,720
probably have the numbers
to back it up.

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,180
That's why if you look at things
like Ticket for Ride,

205
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,168
for instance, has people.

206
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:16,450
If you play Ticket to Ride, it
has no people in it, but it

207
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,940
has people on the box because
they want people to think

208
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,335
that's what users are.

209
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:25,070

210
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,397
So that's just an example of
things that a board game

211
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:32,790
publisher may require
you to do.

212
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,180
Very common that you'll have to
do translations in a range

213
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,920
of different translations for
the different countries it's

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,016
going to be released in.

215
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,435
It may not be your job to do it,
the publishers may end up

216
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,027
being the ones helping you with
the translation, getting

217
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:49,260
all the publishing data
formatted decently, but

218
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,560
someone along the stage is
making sure that happens

219
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,274
before the game hits
the shelf.

220
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:58,340

221
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,618
OK, that's technical testing.

222
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:05,956
That's a little bit about
becoming a player and so let's

223
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,372
talk about data center a bit.

224
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:13,764
SARA VERRILLI: Let me bump
you a little here,

225
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:14,460
if you don't care.

226
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,710
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

227
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:37,466

228
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:38,954
SARA VERRILLI: OK.

229
00:11:38,954 --> 00:11:39,946
Let's see.

230
00:11:39,946 --> 00:11:41,930
Let's actually go ahead.

231
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:45,898

232
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:47,882
So focus testing.

233
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,767
This is a very similar track for
the summer program folks.

234
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:53,840
I have about 10 minutes to go
back and relook at my notes

235
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,980
and relook at the lecture, so
if it's a little stumbly in

236
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,209
parts, it's because I haven't
given it for a while and

237
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:01,460
haven't thought about it.

238
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,766
It's much more geared, the
original talk is much more

239
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:05,140
geared towards computer
testing, and testing

240
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,890
specifically single-player
computer games than it's

241
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,770
testing board games, which
are almost a multi-user.

242
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,598
So first of all, focus testing
is actually dissimilar.

243
00:12:16,598 --> 00:12:20,370
Focus testing is only a specific
case of user testing,

244
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,720
which is to say, you're testing
your game using actual

245
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,910
users, not your development
team, not people who play

246
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,484
board games 12 hours a day
because that's what they love

247
00:12:28,484 --> 00:12:31,100
to do all the time, but more the
sort of average person who

248
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,645
might want to pick up your game
off the shelf, go buy it

249
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:37,300
and then go play it with their
family and then go out to

250
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,198
dinner at Chuck E. Cheese
or something.

251
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:44,245
Another type of user tester is
usability testing, which is

252
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,770
fairly similar to focus testing
in as much as you're

253
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,360
still using users for it.

254
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,860
Focus testing is usually much
more geared towards are people

255
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,073
enjoying your game?

256
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:55,370
Do people want to
play your game?

257
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,060
Are people going through the
sort of play experiences you

258
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,290
want them to have as they
play their game?

259
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,920
Because usually when you
create a game, you're

260
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,410
thinking, oh, like for Settlers
of Catan, you expect

261
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,950
people to spend a lot of time
talking with each other

262
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,326
trading things back and forth.

263
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:12,960
When you're making Diplomacy,
you expect people to spend a

264
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,200
lot of time arguing with each
other over well, if you invade

265
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,060
that country, I'll invade that
country and we'll gang up on

266
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,280
him and we'll all come out of
the game and then we'll just

267
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,098
divide four between the two of
us and win while you're making

268
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:25,618
secret underhanded arrangements
with the other

269
00:13:25,618 --> 00:13:28,000
guys, but OK, so he's going to
attack you on this ground, we

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,330
both know that, that sort of
thing, as opposed to, say,

271
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,192
Transamerica which is just more
putting pieces down and

272
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:38,420
it's pretty much independent
play in many ways.

273
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,420

274
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,612
Usability testing is much more
about how you easy is it for

275
00:13:45,612 --> 00:13:46,920
people to play your game.

276
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,150
Do they understand your rules?

277
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,490
Are the mechanics clear?

278
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,100
When they sit down and start
sorting out the tokens, can

279
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,055
they tell which tokens are the
player pieces and which cards

280
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:58,056
are which and how
you use those?

281
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,220
Do the icons on your game
make sense to people?

282
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,570
Do they understand them?

283
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,020
Things like that.

284
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,162
It's not really about whether
or not people like your game

285
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,400
or are enjoying your game.

286
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,056
It's about can people understand
your game and start

287
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:12,306
playing it.

288
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:14,500

289
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,545
So here we go.

290
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:23,703
One big problem we run into when
people sit down and we

291
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:25,385
have people playing your game
and giving lots of comments,

292
00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,670
this was really fun or this
really sucked, or I hate this

293
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,080
part where I have to spend
time talking to the other

294
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,120
players, I want to be able to
stare at just my cards and

295
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,350
board completely without
interacting with anyone else.

296
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,710
Focus testers will give you
lots and lots of feedback,

297
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,140
some of it is useful,
some of it is not.

298
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,986
And you need to remember that
focus testers are not actually

299
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:46,890
people building the game.

300
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,740
Focus testers are the people
who you are trying to get

301
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,020
information about your game from
and one problem that we

302
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,890
often see in experienced game
developers and people making

303
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,560
games doing is, oh, the focus
tester said we have to make

304
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,840
the whole game red, quick, let's
make everything red.

305
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,180
So and that's usually,
that's not a very

306
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,957
good solution, right?

307
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:13,780
Who knows what the problem with
this actually was, but

308
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,970
what you need to do is find out
why did the players want

309
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,010
to make everything red?

310
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,550
Is it because they don't
like the artistic

311
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,858
design of the game?

312
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:22,340
Is it because someone in
the game is colorblind?

313
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,196
Someone playing the game
currently is colorblind, is

314
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,088
having a hard time telling
things apart so they'd like

315
00:15:29,088 --> 00:15:31,304
everything to be the same color
so everyone's having the

316
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:32,275
same problem they are.

317
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,250
I mean, who knows?

318
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,720
It's hard to tell what
people are thinking.

319
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,320
When they give you advice, and
when they give you these

320
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,560
comments, you have to have
some way to filter those

321
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,260
comments, some way to think
about them and some way to

322
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,500
decide what actually is the
right reaction to take in view

323
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,525
of what you want your game to do
and how you want people to

324
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:52,660
play the game.

325
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,887
Since you're the game designers
and developers, you

326
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,100
have to make those decisions.

327
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,014
Focus testers can only
give you data.

328
00:16:00,014 --> 00:16:02,882
You shouldn't ask them to design
your game for you.

329
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:05,750
Maybe you actually have good
ideas that you want to use,

330
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,316
but you want to make sure that
they're good ideas that you do

331
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:10,800
want to use.

332
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,866
So you may notice, these are
both my lectures, and these

333
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:20,170
are pictures that Mike
[? Dropho ?] drew for a

334
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,720
poster, and we love
him so much.

335
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,150
So in the ideal focus testing
situation, you're really

336
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,090
trying to get as much data as
you can about your player

337
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,765
playing the game without
spoiling the information.

338
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:36,060
What you'd really like to
recreate in a lot of ways is,

339
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,826
so you just bought
the game and have

340
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:38,610
gotten home, what happens?

341
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,100
And that's what this picture is
all about, there's somebody

342
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,240
luring somebody to play the game
without any information.

343
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,117

344
00:16:53,117 --> 00:17:03,995
So things to think about when
you're planning your focus

345
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:09,520
testing is, what are
you testing?

346
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,900
What questions do
you want to ask?

347
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,328
What information do you
want to get out of it?

348
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:15,940
How are you going to test it?

349
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,490
How many players do you need?

350
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,170
What kind of interactions
do you want to see?

351
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,554
On the backhand, who are
you testing with?

352
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,582
What kind of people are going
to make your game?

353
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:30,912
Are you making a game for
children age 9 to 15?

354
00:17:30,912 --> 00:17:33,407
Are you making it for
college-age students?

355
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:37,648
Are you making a game that you
think that older players will

356
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:38,896
want to play?

357
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:41,391
Because if you're making a game
that you think is going

358
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:43,387
to be popular with the senior
citizens market, testing it

359
00:17:43,387 --> 00:17:45,882
with a bunch of elementary
school kids probably isn't

360
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:48,876
going to go very will.

361
00:17:48,876 --> 00:17:52,312
Trivial Pursuit Classic Edition,
a game that came out

362
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:56,130
about 20-odd years ago, I
suspect that if you sat down a

363
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:00,082
group of high school students
with it and had them play it,

364
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:00,786
about three quarters of the
questions they'd just stare at

365
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:05,022
you and be like, I've
never heard of that.

366
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:09,468
So, that's certainly where
the audience comes in.

367
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:14,408
So, the what, planning out the
questions that you think

368
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:15,396
you're going to get
information for.

369
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:19,350
When you know what information
for focus testing, it's a lot

370
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,630
easier to know what to keep
track of, how to take notes,

371
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,981
what reactions you're most
interested in as people are

372
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,238
playing the game.

373
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:30,136
So, what questions are
you going to ask?

374
00:18:30,136 --> 00:18:32,080
What data it takes to answer
your question?

375
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,930
And how are you going
to get that data?

376
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,220
Are you going to go all through

377
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,780
observation taking notes?

378
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,620
Are you going to just step
in and out of questions?

379
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,249
So why did you move that
character from there, just out

380
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,873
of curiosity I'm wondering
why you made that move.

381
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,308
Will you tell me about it?

382
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:49,230
Or, you can ask them to fill
out a questionnaire

383
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,717
at the end of it.

384
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:53,126
Depending on what data
you want, different

385
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:54,610
methods will work best.

386
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:01,684
In general, usually the best way
to do it is observation.

387
00:19:01,684 --> 00:19:05,636
As soon as you ask someone
questions, you sort of perturb

388
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,366
the system and when you ask
them to fill out a survey,

389
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,930
it's after they've done it.

390
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,030
They've kind of forgotten
what they were doing.

391
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,520
They may not exactly remember,
and to be perfectly honest,

392
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,530
people would really rather
play your game

393
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,140
than fill out a form.

394
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,650
So they'll be more engaged
more interested and more

395
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,606
interactive when they're playing
a game and that's when

396
00:19:24,606 --> 00:19:25,770
you're going to get
your best data.

397
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,190
But there are times when you
want to ask someone something

398
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,920
sort of analytical and you
don't want someone to be

399
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,910
thinking analytically while
they're playing the game in a

400
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,614
lot of ways , and so there are
times when that reflection

401
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:39,125
comes out so much better and
it's better to have that

402
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,320
written down and get it
in your own words.

403
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,505
STUDENT: You would hope it plays
better than a survey.

404
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,920
SARA VERRILLI: If your game is
better than a survey, you

405
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,358
probably already observed a
problem right there and you're

406
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,310
probably glad you found it.

407
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,230

408
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,390
So how?

409
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,030
In order to get all that data,
you're going to have to

410
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,250
actually interact with the user,
someone who's never seen

411
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,300
your game before, someone who
doesn't actually care whether

412
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,550
or not you get good
information out of

413
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,250
playing this game.

414
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,330
They came here to sit down and
play the game, and while they

415
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:14,260
would like to help you by giving
you information, that's

416
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,030
not their primary goal
in a lot of ways.

417
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,074
Usually, their primary goal is
to sit down, and play the

418
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:19,190
game, and have a good time.

419
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,610
So you need to be able to
structure the interaction with

420
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,210
them so that getting the
data to you is as

421
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,310
easy for them as possible.

422
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,115
So we need to think about what
this player needs before he or

423
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:30,740
she sits down to play.

424
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,464
Usually, in a board game
or a card game,

425
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:33,990
that's the set of rules.

426
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,520
In a computer, it's
always trickier.

427
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,700
Usually when we're bringing in
people to test the first

428
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,690
prototypes, we have a game that
works, but we don't have

429
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,490
any instructions in game.

430
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,390
If we're going to have a
tutorial or anything like

431
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,080
that, that's usually one of the
last things that goes in.

432
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,620
So when you're testing computer
games early in the

433
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,170
process, usually you end up
sitting down and writing out,

434
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,820
well, this is what the tutorial
would look like if we

435
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,120
had it, so read this and then
sit down and play it.

436
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,005
With board games and card games,
it's actually a little

437
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:01,610
bit easier, because you can say,
a ha, this is the rules

438
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,530
that are going to package
with the games.

439
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,810
Give you the rules, step back
and see what happens.

440
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,920
So, it's actually an
easier aspect for

441
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,330
testing board games.

442
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,636
And finally, treat the
players politely.

443
00:21:14,636 --> 00:21:16,995
When they find a misspelling
in your rules or when they

444
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:20,050
discover that you've left out
six of the key cards to play

445
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,005
the game, oh, yeah, you're
right, thank you for pointing

446
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:25,868
that out, I wouldn't have
noticed that if you hadn't

447
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,260
shown it to me.

448
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,255
Whether you would have or not
doesn't really matter.

449
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:30,490
They're doing you a favor by
playing your game that isn't

450
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,460
quite working well, so you want
them to know that their

451
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,557
contribution is invaluable and
you appreciate the time and

452
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:38,807
effort they've put into it.

453
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:42,850

454
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,110
A few things, the more they talk
about your game and the

455
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,390
mechanics they find that break
or that do or don't work,

456
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,482
that's all data right there,
That's all great.

457
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,077
Another great advantage of
testing board games is you

458
00:21:54,077 --> 00:21:56,240
usually get groups of players,
like two or three or four

459
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,520
players, and when you have
multiple players, they'll talk

460
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,526
to each other about it.

461
00:22:00,526 --> 00:22:01,080
Oh, I noticed this.

462
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,390
Did you notice this strategy?

463
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,115
Yeah, I did, but I noticed that
if you add that strategy

464
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,780
that you can do this thing and
this other thing and that's

465
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,240
all really neat.

466
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,926
When you're testing
single-player computer games

467
00:22:10,926 --> 00:22:13,940
like we usually do in the summer
program, you've got a

468
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,990
single user that is sitting
there between

469
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,020
them and the computer.

470
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,735
You have to watch and figure
out what they're thinking.

471
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,776
When you have a group, it's not
usually that hard to get

472
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,553
them talking about what they're
doing and what they're

473
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:27,347
thinking, and so that's a
really good way to try

474
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,073
and get more data.

475
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:34,020

476
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,215
So yeah, here's sort
of the end summary.

477
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:40,100
Have a specific question
and questions in mind.

478
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,380
Know what you're doing in focus
testing, know why you're

479
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,330
doing usability testing.

480
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,150
If you don't know what you're
trying to test for, then your

481
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,370
data is going to be a
lot harder to figure

482
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,220
out what to do with.

483
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,810
So you always want to we have
that question in mind.

484
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,250
That's actually a
really big one.

485
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,974
What data you need to answer
that question so you can

486
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:03,040
collect it and know how to
collect it, and make sure that

487
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,750
you can give the information to
the players, a standardized

488
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,925
set of information to the
players and step away so

489
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,200
you're not sort of coloring
the information and giving

490
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,770
them the things you're talking
about by, oh I forgot to

491
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:17,290
mention, oh and did I say, so
you've actually got sort of a

492
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:23,635
standardized standard size play
group scenario set down.

493
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,605
OK, I think that's actually
what [? I came for. ?]

494
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:29,580

495
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,496
PROFESSOR: So a couple of
words about when to be

496
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:37,104
testing, which is really
as soon as possible.

497
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:40,540
Usually, before you think it's
possible, you should be

498
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,780
already starting to plan your
fist test because at that

499
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,228
point, you're probably going for
the lowest-hanging fruit,

500
00:23:47,228 --> 00:23:50,216
which will be probably somebody
else in this class

501
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:53,900
because they're going to give
you feedback anyways, you can

502
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,340
use that favor in exchange.

503
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,480
The whole point of making
testing as simple as possible

504
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,830
is you want to be able to get
information while you still

505
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,550
have time to fix it, to do
something with that data.

506
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,050
What has happened a lot of times
in this class is we have

507
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,650
a project team where they come
up with a game requires say,

508
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:20,100
generating so many cards or that
they're going to spend

509
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,150
most of the project deadline
actually creating those cards.

510
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:26,710
They'll test it, but they'll
test it on themselves because

511
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,830
the team already gets
it and they're not

512
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:29,720
looking for other people.

513
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,696
They have a plan to ask their
friends to come in for a

514
00:24:34,696 --> 00:24:35,374
specific time, they've
set aside an hour or

515
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,330
something like that.

516
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,200
So what happens is that the
last week comes around and

517
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,270
they start playing it with
people who haven't seen the

518
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,020
game before and then discovered
problems.

519
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,970
Unfortunately, the game
has 100 cards that all

520
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,350
now need to be fixed.

521
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,540
This is a problem because
you just discovered

522
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,826
that problem too late.

523
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:54,730
A couple of ways to handle
that, though, one, don't

524
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:59,236
decide on a game where making
changes across the entire game

525
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:02,140
is going to take you more time
than to test it because that's

526
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,820
going to make it impossible
to fix anything.

527
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,910
But the other one is
just testing early.

528
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,335
As soon as you've got a couple
of key mechanics down, sure

529
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:12,580
you are planning to play
this game with 100

530
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,360
cards, start with 20.

531
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,150
Start with a small of group of
cards, hence your core can see

532
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,540
people and understand that
they're going to discover

533
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,190
things in the production of
those 20 cards and in the

534
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,160
testing of those 20 cards that
maybe you don't want to be

535
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,790
doing for the next test and you
can redo those 20 cards

536
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,930
pretty quickly the way that
you can't redo 100 cards.

537
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,280
Just an example.

538
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,530
I'm really not encouraging
people to do a 100-card game,

539
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,805
by the way.

540
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,986
A regular poker deck, 52 cards,
that's all you need for

541
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,236
a really interesting game.

542
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,600

543
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,760
Let's see.

544
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,140
Some other things.

545
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,520
Say you're doing a test,
but it's not with

546
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,880
your entire team present.

547
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,620
Say it's just you and your
teammates are all living in

548
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,700
different dorms and you
decided to play with

549
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,120
those in your dorm.

550
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,370
That's great, because it's a
cool game and you've got your

551
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,060
feedback, how do you
communicate that

552
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,020
back to your team?

553
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,890
I talked a little bit about
writing up a little report,

554
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,976
but here's a couple of other
tips because one thing you

555
00:26:14,976 --> 00:26:17,520
have to remember is that chances
are, every single idea

556
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,400
in the game, somebody in your
team is probably really

557
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,970
passionate about it and what
you're basically trying to do

558
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,733
is try to convince someone in
your team that maybe this idea

559
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:27,550
should be changed.

560
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,370
And your game will probably be
better for it, but there are

561
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,470
some tactful was of
telling that.

562
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:36,900
So let's see.

563
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,680
Keep it short, this also applies
to book reports.

564
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,580
I talked about you giving people
enough information to

565
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,710
reproduce what the problem was
so that they can understand

566
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,940
the state of the game and why
the problem is occurring.

567
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,380
And the flip side of that is not
too much information, not

568
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,320
more information than is
necessary to keep it short.

569
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,870
Little [? farm ?] codes, give
them something that's easy for

570
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,220
people to scan.

571
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,149
Don't make them read and essay
for them to figure out what

572
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,250
comments will be solved.

573
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,610
Now actually, one thing to keep
in mind and if you keep

574
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,060
in mind and think about what
Sara said earlier about the

575
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,470
data that you decide to collect,
one problem with

576
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,850
board games is with all the
interesting conversations

577
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:19,960
happening around the table and
multiple players suggesting

578
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,992
strategies to each other, you
can come up with reams of

579
00:27:22,992 --> 00:27:24,390
notes in a single play
test session.

580
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:29,180
How do you decide to digest
that is really important.

581
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:33,735
And you're the only person
there and you're the only

582
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,611
person on your team, you need
to try to let the rest

583
00:27:35,611 --> 00:27:36,840
of your team know.

584
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,050
You need to put in the work
of digesting all of that

585
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,860
information before necessarily
giving it over to your team.

586
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,780
SARA VERRILLI: One possible
solution also is you can get

587
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,680
permission from play testers
for a tape recorder.

588
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,476
Just get a digital recorder
and record all of the

589
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:59,060
conversation as it goes on.

590
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,596
PROFESSOR: But you still want
to pick out the keys, you

591
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,090
don't want to revisit the
entire conversation.

592
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,873
Because if the game took an
hour, and every single one of

593
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:11,240
your team members visits, by now
you've lost three hours.

594
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,350
So you want to find that, do
that little bit of work to

595
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,580
save yourself the detail.

596
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,570
But that's the way because you
can focus, you can take down

597
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,110
notes on the main points and
just let the tape recorder

598
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,370
record all the details so that
you don't have to worry about

599
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,295
recording and really, the main
points are the things that you

600
00:28:29,295 --> 00:28:30,130
want to make sure you get
across to your team.

601
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,526
The tape recorder is
just evidence.

602
00:28:32,526 --> 00:28:37,460
You could use video depending on
who you're recording with.

603
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,604
Sometimes people get kind
of antsy when they

604
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:41,880
know there's a camera.

605
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,109
That being said--

606
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:48,099
SARA VERRILLI: And also, just
put the video tilted at the

607
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:48,941
board so you're not recording
the players, you're

608
00:28:48,941 --> 00:28:49,097
recording the game.

609
00:28:49,097 --> 00:28:50,842
PROFESSOR: Actually webcams
are really good for

610
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:51,093
that sort of thing.

611
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:51,592
SARA VERRILLI: Yeah.

612
00:28:51,592 --> 00:28:55,782
PROFESSOR: You don't run out of
tape, just record straight

613
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:56,083
to hard drive.

614
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:56,582
SARA VERRILLI: Easy to fast
forward through, also.

615
00:28:56,582 --> 00:29:00,740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, with
your editing tools.

616
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,560
Let's see.

617
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,820
So when you're reporting to
other people, think like

618
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,640
bullet points for instance.

619
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,410
Huge long paragraphs of
prose, not so much.

620
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,490
Let's see.

621
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,930
Try to avoid using the following
words, broken,

622
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:25,000
problem, unusable, confusing,
kind of odd, you can get more

623
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,680
specific than that, but these
are words that kind of like

624
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,150
imply not only is there a
problem, someone made a

625
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,900
mistake in his design
of the game.

626
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,589
And truth be told, most of the
time it wasn't a mistake, you

627
00:29:39,589 --> 00:29:41,923
just didn't have the complete
play testing, you probably

628
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:42,740
just had the designer.

629
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,575
But you don't want to make
someone feel like they've made

630
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:49,060
a mistake because that makes
them defensive and then

631
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,814
they're going to try to defend
how what they wrote in the

632
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:55,230
first place is actually correct,
which is actually not

633
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,480
correct either.

634
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,850

635
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,934
You can talk about features
that need attention.

636
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:06,774
With attention, this feature
could be confused.

637
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:10,270
I guess that's actually
on the edge there.

638
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:18,722
So but just generally, pick your
words carefully and one

639
00:30:18,722 --> 00:30:23,024
thing that Sara mentioned
earlier was that testers are

640
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:26,080
not designers and key designers
are actually not a

641
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,397
good testing team.

642
00:30:27,397 --> 00:30:31,728
So for the most part, you are
immediately going to exclude

643
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,737
yourself from your target
audience because you know too

644
00:30:34,737 --> 00:30:35,010
much of the game.

645
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,590
This is also covered
in your book.

646
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,210
As soon as you've played through
your game once or

647
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,290
twice, that's it.

648
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,800
Your kind of work is finished.

649
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,626
You can still be a good
technical tester, I guess.

650
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:49,914
You can still check whether some
mechanics are working the

651
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:53,240
way that you want to work, but
you can't tell whether the

652
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,232
dynamics in your settings
are working anymore.

653
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,718
You have to get your
focus testing done.

654
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:02,204
SARA VERRILLI: You also really
can't tell, you can never

655
00:31:02,204 --> 00:31:05,690
tell-- you can never share
your usability tester.

656
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,184
It will always make
sense to you.

657
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:10,504
It's amazing that what makes
sense to you is completely

658
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:14,156
incomprehensible to the very
intelligent person you give

659
00:31:14,156 --> 00:31:15,152
the game to.

660
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:16,397
Really, truly, I've
been thinking

661
00:31:16,397 --> 00:31:17,144
about this one myself.

662
00:31:17,144 --> 00:31:22,124
PROFESSOR: Usability testing,
by the way, is one of those

663
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:24,655
things that even if you only
have the chance to do a pop-up

664
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:29,170
partial test like, all I have
is this one card, the game's

665
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:34,130
not complete, but grab someone
walking down the corridor on

666
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,939
the way to the washroom and say,
come in here and take a

667
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:38,980
look at this thing
I'm working on.

668
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,950
Even that is better
information.

669
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,990
STUDENT: Hey kid,
come in here.

670
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,120
Come in here, I have something
to show you?

671
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,590
I have a surprise for you.

672
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,530
[LAUGHTER]

673
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,220
SARA VERRILLI: Actually, you
can get going testing for

674
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,090
[? serious. ?]

675
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,175
STUDENT: Free candy.

676
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:56,676
PROFESSOR: [? Mona ?] actually
calls it employee kidnapping.

677
00:31:56,676 --> 00:31:59,870
[LAUGHTER]

678
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:07,400
Of course, he's the creative
director, so he can do that.

679
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,786
SARA VERRILLI: It works best
if you're accosting people

680
00:32:10,786 --> 00:32:13,370
whom you have power over.

681
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,610
PROFESSOR: The audio thing, by
the way, is one of those

682
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,730
things that could be really
useful if people are difficult

683
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,580
[? pundits ?].

684
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:22,415
And so it might be one of those
things that you want to

685
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:25,880
keep in reserve, it's like, OK,
there is a problem here

686
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,005
and the team goes, I don't think
there's a problem here.

687
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:30,280
I don't understand why anyone's
having problems here.

688
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,522
Then you quit, because it's
kind of a bludgeon

689
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:37,560
actually on the team.

690
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,410
On one hand, if you have a good
agent team, they're going

691
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,400
hear it and go, oh my god, we
have a problem and immediately

692
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,417
try to fix it.

693
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:45,770
But it's awesome.

694
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,868
On the other hand, it's like,
well, do you need to do a

695
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,510
recording for every single
offer that we have?

696
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,730
That's something to
be known about, so

697
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,456
keep that in reserve.

698
00:32:57,456 --> 00:33:01,210

699
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,010
I think that's pretty much it.

700
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:09,310

701
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,610
I have an exercise, but I
think [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

702
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,410
so I can turn that off.

703
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,010

704
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,810
Do you have any questions
while I

705
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,310
graph the data segments?

706
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:21,610
No?

707
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:22,860
OK.

708
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,160
