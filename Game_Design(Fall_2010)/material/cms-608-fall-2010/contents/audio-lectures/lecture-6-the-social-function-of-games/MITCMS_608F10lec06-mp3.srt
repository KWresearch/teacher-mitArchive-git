00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:24,890
PROFESSOR: So a lot of folks,
for instance, the rise in

11
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,420
online poker or something.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,400
And they will say that, oh,
we don't fall into the tax

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,210
bracket for gambling because
we're a skill-based game.

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,340
But literally [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,360
is about competition.

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,190
In some ways, you can
class it as sport.

17
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:46,480
But the reason why I was asking
entirely is because the

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,540
way how Caillois writes it, or
at least the way how Roger

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,820
Caillois has been translated,
kind of makes it sound like

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,640
he's actually drawing hard
divisions between all these

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,180
categories.

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,750
But really they're
all adjectives.

23
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,350
AUDIENCE: What was the
original language?

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,311
PROFESSOR: French, I believe.

25
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:05,137
AUDIENCE: I believe that's
the original version.

00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:07,963

can confirm that,

that would be awesome.

31
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:17,768

you're on it.

JEREMY: Yeah, I'll try
and confirm that

34
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,060
it's actually French.

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,364
I'll confirm it, and then write
an obnoxious post about

translation errors.

have been translated in far

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,256
more interesting language,
because it's kind of dull.

actually it is French.

Yay!

But [? Ellings ?]

48
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,910
will be, I use the word vertigo
a lot, because it

49
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,356
sometimes gets sort
of substituted.

50
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:55,725
But vertigo, I think people
have a very specific

51
00:01:55,725 --> 00:02:00,730
understanding of vertigo
as getting

52
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,500
dizzy because of heights.

53
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,270
And obviously not all games
are about heights.

54
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,840
But people, sure, they use it
to describe the sensation of

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,390
taking a roller coaster, which
literally is about heights.

56
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,770
But it's also about speed.

57
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,810
And you can use the
same thing.

58
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,956
Have everyone played the game
called Descent on the PC back

59
00:02:20,956 --> 00:02:22,520
in the day?

60
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,145
So imagine a first-person
shooter.

61
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,720

62
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,510
The game is filling up
the entire screen.

63
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,550
But there is no up.

64
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,000
There's no gravity.

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,120
Whenever you want, you can
turn yourself this way.

66
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,390
And you just stay that way
until you want to turn

67
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,700
yourself again.

68
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,490
By the way, the controls work
just pretty much the same way

69
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,370
as a first-person shooter.

70
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,915
That was Descent.

71
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:53,650
And the whole pleasure of that
game, you'll be doing this all

72
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,066
the friggin' time.

73
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:56,310
I'm going down this
straight corridor.

74
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,110
And I never just go down
the straight corridor.

75
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,556
I go down the straight
corridor, and I turn

76
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:01,966
[INAUDIBLE].

77
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:02,930

79
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,822
PROFESSOR: Yeah!

80
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,268
That sort of thing.

81
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:10,530
If you ever get a chance to play
the game Prey, which is

82
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,640
probably like five dogs on like
a pre-owned nowadays.

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,240
You have that same
sort of thing.

84
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,230
And Portal has a lot of that
kind of loss of control,

85
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,410
physical sensation.

86
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,390
They're trying to get that.

87
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,750
But obviously real physical
experiences

88
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,690
that are half an inch.

89
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:34,410
They're talking about
three-legged races or that

90
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,150
horrible game where you
spin around on a

91
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,806
bat with your head.

92
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:45,050
[LAUGHTER]

93
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,790
PROFESSOR: And [? Ellings ?]
can be used to describe any

94
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,410
one of those things.

95
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,070
I like to use it as describing
the sort of fun

96
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,580
of the loss of control.

97
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,000
But that's not necessarily
the case.

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,535
Just the sheer physicality of
the game that's part of the

99
00:03:59,535 --> 00:04:03,857
experience in a way that digital
chess doesn't really

100
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,444
have any of that.

101
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:06,845
Even real chess [INAUDIBLE].

102
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:09,650

103
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,010
So actually I'm just going to
write out those words for

104
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,554
those folks who didn't
get a chance to read

105
00:04:16,554 --> 00:04:18,399
through that page.

106
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,470
So [INAUDIBLE]

107
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,242
is kind of like intercompetition
skill.

108
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:26,409

109
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:29,216
I talked about [? Ellings ?]
which is kind of jumping down

110
00:04:29,216 --> 00:04:31,656
through the last one of
these such as-- am I

111
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:34,190
spelling this right--

112
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,643
where just kind of physicality
just kind of sucks.

113
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:40,998
[LAUGHTER]

114
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,770
PROFESSOR: Actually Jason,
can you turn the

115
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,722
light in the room on.

116
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:44,972
Its extremely dark.

117
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:48,490

118
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,957
Loss of control.

119
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:57,540

120
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,580
Other ones were--

121
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,610

122
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,650

was that again?

123
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,144

126
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:15,110
You guys know the phrase
[INAUDIBLE]?

127
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,950
AUDIENCE: The die
had been cast.

128
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,480
PROFESSOR: Yes.

129
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,730
Yes, the die has been cast
right before Caesar

130
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,143
[INAUDIBLE]

131
00:05:21,143 --> 00:05:23,969
and says I now am able
to attack someone.

132
00:05:23,969 --> 00:05:26,800
I couldn't remember who.

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,970
But Javier needs
dice basically.

134
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,300
PROFESSOR: Actually--

135
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,590
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

136
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,295
PROFESSOR: Say what?

137
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:36,670
AUDIENCE: He matched on
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

138
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,380
PROFESSOR: Matched?

139
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,250
AUDIENCE: Matched on
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

140
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

141
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,050

142
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,846
Although I've heard two
translations of The Die Has

143
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,560
Been Cast as a phrase
actually.

144
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,345
Because on one hand, you
can think of it as the

145
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:50,980
die has been cast.

146
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,800
So we'll see where fortune takes
us, and there's nothing

147
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,350
we can do wrong.

148
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,260
But I've also heard it described
as the die as in the

149
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,600
thing that you put molten
metal into, as in cast.

150
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,695
And so whatever we were
making is now set.

151
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:17,702

152
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:22,790
And they had that same idea, but
because we had because one

153
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,920
way that you can think of is
this is not auto control.

154
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,070
And the other way you can think
of this is and now this

155
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,170
is set in stone.

156
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,370
Which are two very different
connotations, but both saying

157
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,670
we don't really have control
of the situation.

158
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,030
AUDIENCE: Yassa means thrown.

159
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,325
PROFESSOR: Thrown away, yeah.

160
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:38,750
Yeah.

161
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,780
But the English phrase,
[INAUDIBLE].

162
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,290
AUDIENCE: Are there words in
English that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

163
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,400
root to mean random?

164
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,820
In French the word for
random is aleatoire.

165
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,780
Come straight from
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

166
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,320
PROFESSOR: Sure.

167
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,390
Yeah.

168
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,175
PROFESSOR: Which is undoubtably
why he chose that

169
00:06:56,175 --> 00:06:57,710
word I just checked,
he is French.

170
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:00,610

171
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,925
PROFESSOR: Obviously that's
why Caillois used it.

172
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,340
But yeah, I can't think of any
English words that use that as

173
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,672
a root, although there
might be some.

174
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,320
I know there's a
game committee.

175
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,206

176
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,649
And I think they actually
make strategic games.

177
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:24,090

178
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,922
And there's one more
which is--

179
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,172
AUDIENCE: Mimicry.

180
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:32,188

181
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:35,160
PROFESSOR: Which is kind of odd
because that's in English,

182
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,410
not in French.

183
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,630

184
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,750
Mimicry's mimicry.

185
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,200
It's actually in English,
so role playing,

186
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,790
dress up, let's pretend.

187
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,045
Simulations sometimes?

188
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:52,870
You know, it might actually
fall into that.

189
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,660
So you can imagine in tactical
simulation, for instance,

190
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,530
being very much about
competition and skills.

191
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,950
But then if it's a tactical
simulation about Russian

192
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,360
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], something
like that, then

193
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,610
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

194
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,180

195
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,600
territory.

196
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:18,875
Do you--

197
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,195
It's part of the pleasure of
believing that you are

198
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:24,200
something else, as opposed
to I'm just guy playing

199
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,280
[INAUDIBLE]

200
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,208
as opposed to I am this 17th
century scholar [INAUDIBLE].

201
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:35,100
And making a game about that.

202
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,340
So these are the adjectives
that he talks about to

203
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,640
describe games, but in the bit
where we actually ask you to

204
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,750
read, it's more about why.

205
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,600
These words give you a clue to
think about why are people

206
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,852
playing games.

207
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:58,393
These are types of fun, much in
a way that gets touched on

208
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:03,820
by the MDA paper that we
had you read last week.

209
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,090
What are these aesthetics that
people are going for?

210
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,892
Are they going for the thrill
of competition or

211
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,360
the thrill of luck?

212
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,901
Are they going for physical
motion and how that feels, or

213
00:09:14,901 --> 00:09:18,510
are they going for the feeling
of being someone else?

214
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,330
And it's not--

215
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,980
Again, these are not mutually
exclusive terms.

216
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,220
These are things that you could
have one game that has

217
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,025
all of this.

218
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:29,400
You could have one game that
has two in some strong

219
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,136
competition and the rest
are all minimized.

220
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:33,905
That's fine.

221
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,977
But understanding that this is
why people are enjoying the

222
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:39,410
game more, and more importantly
this is what

223
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,950
people are enjoying playing
with each other for.

224
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,770
One nice thing about this
is that fodder for

225
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,580
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

226
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,250
and for mimicry, it's really,
really difficult to think

227
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,960
about those two in particular
without

228
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,880
thinking about the players.

229
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,998
Competition sucks if
there's no one else

230
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,950
you're competing with.

231
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,342
Sure playing against computers
nowadays, but

232
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:08,270
traditionally we couldn't.

233
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,198
At least you were playing
against the designer, and

234
00:10:11,198 --> 00:10:13,590
especially when it
came puzzles.

235
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,728
It's really, really annoying to
pretend to be somebody else

236
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:19,584
when there's no audience, even
if that other person is

237
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,488
someone pretending
along with you.

238
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,392
[INAUDIBLE].

239
00:10:23,392 --> 00:10:24,670
Now, luck--

240
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,050
you can continue to play
a game flipping a coin.

241
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,080
But even when it comes to
luck, and it comes to

242
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,650
experiences of physical motion,
these things tend to

243
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,885
be measurable [INAUDIBLE].

244
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:42,355
And that's why these four
particular divisions that

245
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:43,285
[INAUDIBLE]

246
00:10:43,285 --> 00:10:47,005
picked out are really, really
good for [INAUDIBLE] social

247
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:47,935
[INAUDIBLE].

248
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:52,280
A game where is there a name for
this game where you put a

249
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,745
bat on the ground and
you go around?

250
00:10:55,745 --> 00:10:57,230
AUDIENCE: Bat?

251
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,705
AUDIENCE: Bat irritating.

252
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:02,680
AUDIENCE: What is he
talking about?

253
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,540
AUDIENCE: Wait, wait, and
someone gets fixed and then?

254
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,033
PROFESSOR: So there's a type of
relay race where you pick

255
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:11,175
up a baseball bat, and you
put your head on it.

256
00:11:11,175 --> 00:11:14,870
You go around it three times,
and then you just run back to

257
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,504
your team, carry the bat, and
try to hand the bat off to

258
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:20,250
somebody else on your team.

259
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,130
Usually ending up
hitting someone.

260
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,710
AUDIENCE: I've heard it
called Dizzy Bats.

261
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

262
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,450
AUDIENCE: Dizzy Bats.

263
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,740
AUDIENCE: Dizzy Bats.

264
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,880
PROFESSOR: Dizzy Bats.

265
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,090
Yeah.

266
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,650
So that game is a lot more
fun when there's

267
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,130
somebody else around.

268
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,455
[LAUGHTER]

269
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:38,710
AUDIENCE: I do that by myself.

270
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,000
AUDIENCE: You start handing
it off to yourself.

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

272
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,850
AUDIENCE: Bats flying around.

273
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,930
PROFESSOR: And even with games
of chance, I mean sure, if you

274
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,900
cook the games of chance by
itself, but for the most part

275
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,066
most of my enjoyment of the game
of chance is usually with

276
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,400
a group of four people,
actually, either playing poker

277
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,400
or playing something
like mahjong.

278
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,000
So these are all very
support [INAUDIBLE].

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,900
If you think about when
someone's going to come down

280
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:15,645
and sit in front of your game,
and what sort of frame of mind

281
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:20,409
they're going to be in
to play your game?

282
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,109
What sort of frame of mind do
you want to put them in in

283
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:24,130
order to enjoy the games?

284
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,136
Think about why they
might want to hang

285
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,369
out with other people.

286
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:29,619
Because [INAUDIBLE].

287
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:32,313

288
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:35,437
So if there's this other person
they play with, that

289
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:39,150
you may or may not know, but try
to think about how you're

290
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,530
going to construct enough
clues to sort of get

291
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,112
them to enjoy it.

292
00:12:42,112 --> 00:12:46,310
So the game is about pretending
to be someone else.

293
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,280
I'm going to make a game where I
am playing a negotiator in a

294
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,780
hostage situation,
for instance.

295
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,780
[INAUDIBLE], awesome.

296
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,968
I'm going to be the
negotiator.

297
00:12:55,968 --> 00:13:00,380
You all are going to be the
guy taking hostages.

298
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,800
And then you want to play
that out, and harm them.

299
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,240
Friday we had the game Crunch,
where people were playing

300
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,570
CEOs, I think.

301
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm hoping [INAUDIBLE]

302
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,813
that you will already
hate [INAUDIBLE].

303
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:16,005
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

304
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:16,820
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

305
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,840
less corrupt.

306
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,086
And you think about how does the
game, even from the rules,

307
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:24,167
even from the design of the box,
get you into the mood of

308
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:30,837
thinking, OK, whoever I am in
real life, I'm going to take

309
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:31,514
on this persona.

310
00:13:31,514 --> 00:13:33,550
And I'm going to enjoy taking
on this persona for a while.

311
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,320
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but then you're
really not [INAUDIBLE]

312
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,382
because they have this game's
kind of built in where you

313
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:40,455
actually hide cards
on yourself.

314
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:42,880
AUDIENCE: Did you guys catch
anyone doing that in the act?

315
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,850
AUDIENCE: I got caught.

316
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,480
AUDIENCE: No, I caught him.

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,550
AUDIENCE: I feel like
arguing about

318
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,580
that's part of the rules.

319
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,920
He already got it.

320
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,455
He had already hidden them away,
and then the cards were

321
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:56,830
sought way afterwards.

322
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,980
PROFESSOR: And even arguing
over whether something was

323
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,670
illegal or not, even when
there's evidence that it is,

324
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,316
no one caught you doing it.

325
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:08,836
It's appropriate for this theme
of being a CEO of a

326
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,570
failing bank.

327
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:16,080
It's like, well, so we have
all of these CDOs.

328
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,180
Yeah, we purchased them at some
point, but nobody caught

329
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,270
us while we were doing it.

330
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,370
So now you guys have
to help us fix it.

331
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,850
That's what the game's about.

332
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,040

333
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,270
Was there a game that was
particularly competitive that

334
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,300
people played on Friday?

335
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,635
AUDIENCE: That game
was pretty good.

336
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:35,330
PROFESSOR: Which one?

337
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,272
[INAUDIBLE].

338
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:39,710
AUDIENCE: There was a
competitive moment in Saboteur

339
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:45,330
when Alec, revealed himself to
be a saboteur and ruined our

340
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,010
chance to find the gold.

341
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,770
PROFESSOR: Saboteur is what I
would describe as cutthroat.

342
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:57,610
It's a game that's deliberately
about winning by

343
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,120
other people losing.

344
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,702
AUDIENCE: It made me
upset with Alec.

345
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,520
AUDIENCE: It made me cry.

346
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,127
PROFESSOR: And John Nash,
actually, [INAUDIBLE].

347
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:20,880

348
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,330
Oh.

349
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,320
Because he did spend some time
here at MIT, possibly when

350
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,380
visiting, but he designed one
game called Hex, which is

351
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,345
ostensibly designed based on the
washroom tiles of one of

352
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:42,300
the Building 39 or Building
37 bathrooms.

353
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,070
But anyway, that game and
another game called Screw Your

354
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,330
Buddies are all cutthroat

The only way to get them to win
this game is by screwing

over the other person playing.

press-your-luck game, right?

378
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,550
Do you dare?

379
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,026
Do you think you can?

00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:41,910

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,890
I don't think that we had any
influence specifically.

385
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,550
It's hard to get really physical
in card games.

AUDIENCE: Maybe in that
that game, Falling.

387
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:57,505
Yeah.

388
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,940
That was a pit.

389
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,580
PROFESSOR: Pit actually, you're
right, two weeks ago,

390
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,295
some of the games that
were played were

391
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,644
really kind of kinetic.

392
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:10,684
So even with card games, you
already have very good

393
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:13,160
examples of that.

394
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,962
I want you to keep in mind
because today we're actually

about the whole Eskimo part.

at the French.

come over over, chill at MIT

that's OK.

PROFESSOR: All right.

426
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:27,910
So this is what we're
going to do.

427
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,630
We're basically going to
do brainstorming today.

428
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:33,662
The basic idea is that we're
going to have a bunch of index

429
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:39,670
cards and one job to make it
easier on the job of the

430
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,180
secretary is that you'd actually
be reading off

431
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,390
something written.

432
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,910
So especially while other people
are throwing out their

433
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,250
ideas, and you get something,
and that

434
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,030
person's still talking.

435
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,630
You might as well just
write down your idea.

436
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,470
So we'll have a whole
bunch of cards.

437
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,340

438
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,280
I'd also like you to start
off by writing your

439
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
name right on top.

440
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
And the reason for this is
because I don't think every

441
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,410
single person in this room knows
each other's names yet.

442
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,835
As we do this process, it's
more that you remember oh

443
00:19:13,835 --> 00:19:17,080
yeah, it's that guy who came
up with that idea.

444
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,773
Oh, and that person's
name is so-and-so.

445
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:23,286

446
00:19:23,286 --> 00:19:24,708
AUDIENCE: That's
what you want?

447
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,236
To have all the ideas from each
person on one card, or

448
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,190
have one idea per card?

449
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,100
PROFESSOR: All on one.

450
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,930
AUDIENCE: What if the professors
took notes and we

451
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,620
could just bounce out ideas?

452
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,920
PROFESSOR: Well that's what
the tape recorder is for.

453
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,330
But the thing about writing
your ideas down is that

454
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,600
someone can look at the card
and say, yeah, that guy.

455
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,150
I want to follow up
with this guy.

456
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,820
Because we're not actually going
to form the teams for

457
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,430
you by the end of this class.

458
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:56,360
The idea is so that after this
brainstorm, you've got a pool

459
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,620
of ideas of which you
guys can make games.

460
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,875
Actually, frankly, we don't
care if two teams ended up

461
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,947
making pretty much the same
game, out of the same concept.

462
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:09,903
Because I know that two
different teams of two

463
00:20:09,903 --> 00:20:13,000
different sets of people are
going end up making different

464
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,750
games anyway, even if you
start from the same.

465
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,730
That's not a requirement.

466
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,700
You folks can make--

467
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,840
you can take any set of ideas
from the book today.

468
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,950
Obviously, if you're the one who
pitch an idea and somebody

469
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,750
else thinks, hey, that was
actually pretty cool.

470
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,215
Take that opportunity to
talk to the person and

471
00:20:35,215 --> 00:20:37,790
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

472
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,010
That pretty much is going to
happen between classes.

473
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,660
So by Wednesday, I want
you all to come in.

474
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,198
This is basically one of the
ideas of the homework, is to

475
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:51,460
tell me which team you're on,
who's on your team, and what's

476
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,210
the general one line idea that
you're working with.

477
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,960
Now, the idea that they're
giving us is

478
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,980
what you started with.

479
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,630
It may not be what
you end with.

480
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,900
That's fine.

481
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm very comfortable
that ideas change

482
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,440
while you guys work.

483
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
I think that's fine.

484
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,800
The teams shouldn't change.

485
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,140
So you're working with these
three other people,

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,160
or a team of a four.

487
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,398
Then that should be intact
for the rest of this--

488
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:18,880
for this assignment.

489
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,820

490
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,580
OK, so teams of four.

491
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,700

492
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,565
Now, one more clarification
about the project.

493
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:39,460
The card game, all the cards
need to be identically sized.

494
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,940
We do like cards that are going
to be legible, but you

495
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,920
don't need to spend
a whole lot of

496
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,350
time making them pretty.

497
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,230
I will just appreciate it that
by the time you actually hand

498
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,760
in your cards, you have
them written in ink.

499
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,952
Pencil is great when you're
prototyping because you can

500
00:21:55,952 --> 00:21:57,810
erase [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

501
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,670
Ink is great for creating the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

502
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,700

503
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,410
Your game can be playable by
two, three, or four players.

504
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:14,760
It does not need to cater to any
grouping other than what

505
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,385
you decide.

506
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:18,352
So if you're saying, this is a
two-player game, we will test

507
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:19,100
it with two people.

508
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,260
If you're saying this is two
to four, we'll test it with

509
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,420
some number with however many
people we manage to

510
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,660
rustle up to test.

511
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,160
If you say it could be
two or four, but not

512
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,392
three, that's fine.

513
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:31,865
You think I kid, but there are
some games that work really,

514
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:32,910
really well with even numbers.

515
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

516
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,270

517
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,920
PROFESSOR: Keep it
four and under.

518
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,540
Or at least make it possible
for us to grade it with a

519
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,650
maximum of four people.

520
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,780
Because if you give us a game
that requires five people, we

521
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,335
have to find five people and get
them together in order to

522
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:53,585
create your [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

523
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:58,240

524
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,420
I think there was one more
requirement for how long the

525
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,250
game could take.

526
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,270
AUDIENCE: I think it's
5 to 10 minutes.

527
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,040
AUDIENCE: It was short.

528
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040

AUDIENCE: So when you're
brainstorming for game ideas,

536
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,337
how much do we
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE] come

537
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:21,240
to up with in our brainstorm?

538
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,200
It's a cool idea.

539
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,536
It's an amusing space.

540
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,260
PROFESSOR: I will say that if
the character's the thing

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,860
that's encouraging you to

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,740

543
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,210
I have this cool game
that comes to mind.

544
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:40,855
Then that's the thing that
you're throwing out.

545
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:44,430
If instead, I want to make
a game about fish.

546
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,680
I have no game mechanics
in mind, but I

547
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,928
think fish are awesome.

548
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,302
Then, OK.

549
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,140
That's the game you're
doing now.

550
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,010
Maybe that's the first bad idea
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

551
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,230
AUDIENCE: If we have like
several game ideas, should we

552
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,500
take several index cards
and write one per?

553
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,210
PROFESSOR: Actually, no I would
rather see them all on

554
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,790
one if you can fit them.

555
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,210
And if you run out of space,
flip them over.

556
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,950
Again, the idea of the index
cards is not just to record

557
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,775
the ideas down, because what I
am going to do is I'm going to

this idea about fish.

I know there were some folks who
actually started off with

ideas already on the forum.

585
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:28,585
So why don't those folks throw
your ideas first because you

586
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:29,845
already mentioned
in the forum.

want to go ahead?

591
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,270
AUDIENCE: Two ideas, I guess.

592
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,450
AUDIENCE: But yeah,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

593
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,100
titles.

594
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,440
So the basic concept of the
game in which players are

595
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,790
forced by some game mechanic to
refer to each other by name

596
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,130
constantly throughout
the game, and at

597
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,490
a very rapid pace.

598
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,550
Their name is generated by
the game and accumulate

599
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,460
increasingly longer
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] this game as

600
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:55,990
they succeed.

601
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,790
So you would start.

602
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,900
You would be the lord of
something, and then you could

603
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,330
accumulate extra title,
son of this.

604
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,365
Like bringer of flame.

605
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:03,680
And you could just like have all
these modifiers and just

606
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,535
kind of accumulate and
accumulate until your title

607
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:06,120
becomes ridiculous.

608
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,270
And then, have people
start screwing up as

609
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,160
they say your name.

610
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,340
And it'd just be hilarious.

going to write down

00:26:13,112 --> 00:26:15,060
like, memory jogs.

613
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,530

generated names, titles.

614
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:18,770

615
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,090
AUDIENCE: Name game.

616
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,744
PROFESSOR: Yes.

617
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:24,310
AUDIENCE: You said you
had a second one?

618
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,610
AUDIENCE: Yeah, can I go
with the second one?

619
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,650
AUDIENCE: OK, so I had this
idea of sort of like a

620
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,410
survival horror game, kind
of inspired by falling.

621
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,880
Like the premise is, you have
a group of like player

622
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,365
characters that are charging
through a building, and you

623
00:26:37,365 --> 00:26:39,760
can have like a dealer that is
putting down hallways as

624
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,070
you're going through.

625
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,420
And occasionally threats come
up and you have to react

626
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,120
really quick and be like,
it's a zombie.

627
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,380
We have to go upstairs.

628
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,700
And thrown down a
card to do that.

629
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,430
Then you have to keep doing this
until you get to the end

630
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:53,510
of it and people can die, and
get eaten, and stuff.

631
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,300
AUDIENCE: That's good.

632
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,410
AUDIENCE: I like that a lot.

633
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,970
AUDIENCE: Kind of like
cooperative falling off?

634
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,280
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

635
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,400
AUDIENCE: Should we be writing
his ideas down?

636
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,490
AUDIENCE: No, I'm writing
mine down and then.

637
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,010
AUDIENCE: Cool.

638
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,850
PROFESSOR: Write down
your own ideas.

639
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,430
AUDIENCE: So I have an idea.

640
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,070
I made this up a year ago
when I took Game Design.

641
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,590
Or not Game Design, Intro
to Video Game Studies.

642
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,500
Actually, it's like
majority rule.

643
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,320
So it's kind of like crunch
where you can just

644
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,860
hide cars and stuff.

645
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,320
But if you get caught, then
you get called out.

646
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,470
And in order to be penalized
for it, you have to be--

647
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,770
a majority rule has to be
by every one playing.

648
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:36,150
And so you can actually bribe
people to vote for you.

649
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,662
It's more of like a--

650
00:27:37,662 --> 00:27:42,052
yeah, and then the way you get
points is, it depends on how

651
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:44,024
we'd [UNINTELLIGIBLE] it.

652
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,500
PROFESSOR: I'm just going
to go around this way.

653
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:46,640
AUDIENCE: OK.

654
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,120
So I have an idea of a card
game based on like having

655
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,700
success in life.

656
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,298
So the beginning of the game,
all the players are randomly

657
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:57,070
assigned different goals in
order, which are like wealth,

658
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,570
and adventure, and love,
and things like this.

659
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,310
And then all the cards represent
different activities

660
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,090
that take up a different
amount of time.

661
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:07,630
So you all these activities you
can keep in front of you.

662
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,120
And then, however much free time
you have, you draw that

663
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,180
many cards looking for
new opportunities.

664
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,630
So it's like you take
opportunities and leave

665
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,570
opportunities and things.

666
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,530
PROFESSOR: I could write out
time and opportunities.

667
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,450

668
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:24,430
Let's see.

669
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,410
Who's next?

670
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:29,000
AUDIENCE: I have a very
mechanically oriented idea.

671
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,790
Essentially I'm stealing and
trying to improve the drop

672
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,900
mechanic from Magic the
Gathering booster draft.

673
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,230
For those who don't know, the
idea is that you're trying to

674
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,930
collect a set.

675
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,820
And so let's do it in terms
of regular card games.

676
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,910
You're trying to collect a
straight flush as long as

677
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,620
possible, as high valued
as possible.

678
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,740
But other people may be trying
to collect that same suit.

679
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,230
So you want to collect
a different

680
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,300
suit from other people.

681
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,270
And you do this by looking at
the cards in your hand,

682
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,790
picking one of them, passing
the rest to the

683
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,760
person on your right.

684
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,590
and then, continuing to do this,
and then going back in

685
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,150
the other direction
with a new hand.

686
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,020
And then in the same direction
again with a third hand.

687
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,280
And the object is collect
a big, straight flush.

688
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,110
Also, guess what the person to
your right was collecting, and

689
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,190
guess what the person to your
left was collecting.

690
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:24,200
So you're trying to signal the
other people what suits are

691
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,509
open and collect the
suit which is open.

692
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:31,888

693
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:32,377
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

694
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:34,500
Who's next.

695
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,452
AUDIENCE: So it's going to be
there are different types of

696
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:40,404
cards, like action cards, like
pick up cards or lose cards.

697
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,880
But then [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

698
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,300

699
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,255
Stock pile from your friend's
hand to the discard pile.

700
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,084
You can play a different card
in a different order so the

701
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,249
rule always changes.

702
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,243
Kind of mess other people
up or help yourself out.

703
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:58,239
PROFESSOR: I will just
write that the rules

704
00:29:58,239 --> 00:29:59,736
are constantly changing.

705
00:29:59,736 --> 00:30:01,732
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but you get--

706
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:04,726
so there's actually
an order to it.

707
00:30:04,726 --> 00:30:05,724
So you can choose.

708
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:08,718
So if it's going to be your turn
and it says pick a free

709
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:11,712
card, you can put down, like
from a friend's hand or lose

710
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,209
three cards [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

711
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:17,201
Makes a lot of sense
in my mind.

712
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,451
PROFESSOR: So rules changing
with cards.

713
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:27,050

714
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:30,340
AUDIENCE: So one idea I have
is a game about character

715
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,810
growth through narrative arc.

716
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,030
So the start of the game you're
given a character, and

717
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,670
the idea is you want to follow
a certain narrative arc so

718
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,950
that they grow in terms
of the hands of

719
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,830
the game you're playing.

720
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,890
So if you start out with a cocky
character, then you may

721
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,630
want to actually lose a couple
of the hands of the game, such

722
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,925
that your character experiences
failure and his

723
00:30:47,925 --> 00:30:50,410
character growth increases.

724
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,425
And so, basically the winner of
the game is determined by

725
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:56,120
who manages to get their
character to grow the most

726
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,584
emotionally.

727
00:30:57,584 --> 00:31:01,290
AUDIENCE: It's very deep.

728
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,430
AUDIENCE: So I had this idea for
a poker-like game, except

729
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,650
it's played with more than one
deck, but the normal rules

730
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,330
still apply.

731
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,412
So if you get dealt five aces,
you can't actually play that

732
00:31:09,412 --> 00:31:11,200
hand because that would
be cheating.

733
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,630
So you have an incentive to try
and like slip cards into

734
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:16,050
your sleeve, slip
back and forth.

735
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,350
So you're almost forced to cheat
at the game to be able

736
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,900
to actually play it.

737
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,056
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

738
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:28,657
if you get caught then, just
pretty much you have to figure

739
00:31:28,657 --> 00:31:31,570
out how to get out.

740
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,070
AUDIENCE: So the idea that
I had was kind of like

741
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,070
Bananagrams, but with
a card game.

742
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,480
So you have cards with lines
or preset lines or shapes,

743
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,380
just something on the card.

744
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,890
And you have to try to connect
them all in some way on your

745
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,370
personal board, so that it
forms a closed shape.

746
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,250
And once you're done, you have
to take another from the pile

747
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,158
and try to fix your shape so
that it's still closed while

748
00:31:52,158 --> 00:31:52,848
trying to beat everyone else.

749
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:55,308
PROFESSOR: So collecting
cards, make shapes.

750
00:31:55,308 --> 00:31:59,250

751
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,766
AUDIENCE: So my idea was just
using normal poker cards and

752
00:32:02,766 --> 00:32:04,100
doing a trading game.

753
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,110
Just like trading four
kinds of pattern as

754
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,165
four kind of stocks.

755
00:32:08,165 --> 00:32:12,410
And you can randomly draw the
card to be your own stock.

756
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:15,875
And everyday, you randomly
draw a card to

757
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:16,865
determine the day price.

758
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:19,850
And you can trade with bank
or other players.

759
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,420
I think you can use 8 and 10's
as the stocks and the J, Q,

760
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,284
and the K as the special
cards [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

761
00:32:28,284 --> 00:32:30,216
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

762
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:31,670
PROFESSOR: OK.

763
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,740
AUDIENCE: So this was another
procedurally generated idea.

764
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,050
The game generates for
you encounters.

765
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:38,680
And it's supposed
to be ridiculous

766
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,125
and somewhat humorous.

767
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,300
You'd have a base card,
like a bear.

768
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,920
And then there are various
modifiers that you would draw

769
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,635
to create that encounter.

770
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,025
Or it could be like a
ninja zombie pair in

771
00:32:50,025 --> 00:32:52,790
space wrapped in bacon.

772
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,030
And then those would
all give different

773
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:55,740
attributes to that encounter.

774
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,530
And then you'd have to find
a way to beat it.

775
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,220
And your characters might also
maybe be procedurally

776
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,395
generated in similarly
ridiculous ways and you'd have

777
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,020
to counter it with--

778
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,600
basically, I like procedurally
generated ideas.

779
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,540
Cards games that are never
played the same way twice.

780
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,528

784
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,535
AUDIENCE: Of course.

785
00:33:19,535 --> 00:33:22,270
AUDIENCE: Of course you
need laser beams.

786
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,850
AUDIENCE: So my idea was a
musical RPG in which players'

787
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,860
cards and musical notes.

788
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,700
And you build chords.

789
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,130
For example, to raise your
character's strength, you

790
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,860
might make an augmented
chord, et cetera.

791
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,050
And then you can chain chord
progression to attack players.

792

AUDIENCE: I got obsessed
with drafting.

797
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:55,620
I have another drafting game.

798
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,420
Uses the same drafting mechanic
except that you're

799
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,300
drafting tiles.

800
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,020
You play the tiles in front of
you and they make a machine.

801
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,650
Drafting the same color of
machine bit or same type of

802
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,630

it in consecutive blocks.

Or they can do crazy shit.

00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:18,820

808
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,929
But the challenge being that
you have to drop the piece

809
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,533
that fits into your machine.

810
00:34:22,533 --> 00:34:24,250

00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,139

00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:28,656

815
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:38,199
AUDIENCE: So my idea to have
like a monarchy type thing.

816
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,460
So it starts out everyone is
like heir to the throne.

817
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,464
Everyone wants to become the
king, or queen, I guess.

818
00:34:45,464 --> 00:34:47,960
And the point is you have to
get the king to really like

819
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,862
you, or to assassinate him.

820
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:52,559
But if you want to assassinate
him, you have to kill off all

821
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,875
the other players first.

822
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:57,813
So it's kind of a like a
betrayal and deciet game.

823
00:34:57,813 --> 00:35:00,807
PROFESSOR: So a betrayal.

824
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,310
OK.

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:03,580
AUDIENCE: Yep.

826
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,350
So another game, it's about
reducing your opponents

827
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,020
mobility by placing cards that
represent walls, and placing

828
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,010
other cards to rotate
various walls.

829
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,700
And your opponent is doing
the same thing.

830
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,390
So you could sort of envision
the Tron Light Cycle game

831
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,180
without any hint of reflex

be really cool.

So you have different
types of zombies.

846
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,940
Like maybe you take some from
Left 4 Dead universe or

847

something, or just Resident Evil

of having cards--

00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,710
I don't know whether they would
be like words or a few

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,060
words together.

853
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,570

to build a story.

855
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,160
So each person would play a card
face down, or something.

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,610
So it'd be a mechanic like
Apples to Apples, except

thinking that maybe there
could be Harvest Moon

880
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:26,315
competitive card game.

881
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:30,010
And I guess you have a certain
amount of stamina each turn

882
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,483
and cards are actions.

883
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,083
And whoever has the biggest
harvest at the end of

884
00:37:35,083 --> 00:37:36,393
the game would win.

885
00:37:36,393 --> 00:37:39,830
I don't know how many turns
there would be.

886
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,770
PROFESSOR: So stamina
in farming.

887
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,350
AUDIENCE: So sort of building
on the monarchy of the trail

888
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:49,440
idea, this is a game about
the heir to the throne.

889
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,240
The king is dying in x turns.

890
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,380
You and the other players are
going to compete to prove who

891
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,120
is the correct heir
to the throne.

892
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,190
And you can do so through combat
directly with other

893
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,020
players, assassinations, or
political machinations, such

894
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,440
as like accusing other players
of being base born.

895
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,849

896
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:09,099
PROFESSOR: Assassinations.

897
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:14,180

898
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,270
AUDIENCE: Actually, I just have
the paper when you throw

899
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,820
out your idea, also throw out--
also mention your name

900
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,920
because I'm still learning
everyone's name.

901
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,470
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'm Ian.

902
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:28,225
So I had this idea for a game
called Admiral Snack Bar.

903
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:32,000

904
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,520
It's a competitive game where
each player is building up

905
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,140
their own sort of like
snack shop, and they

906
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,510
make a certain product.

907
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:42,280
And the other players need that
product in some way to

908
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,600
enhance their own things.

909
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,180
But you can see secretly poison
parts of your product,

910
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,040
so that when they purchase them,
they'll like get messed

911
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,050
up in some way.

912
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,380
So it's sort of like a trade-off
and you can make

913
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,202
alliances and stuff like that.

914
00:38:54,202 --> 00:38:56,086
AUDIENCE: So it's sort
of like a trap?

915
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,970
AUDIENCE: It's a trap.

916
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,368
AUDIENCE: There's the
tagline right there.

917
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:01,832
AUDIENCE: It's a snack.

918
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,400

919
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,780
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking of a
game, I guess to have like the

920
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,730
total wars mixed with
Nazi Germany.

921
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,550
So the point of the game is
you want to snatch up

922
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,630
territories.

923
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,295
And you can do this by maybe
attacking other players.

924
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:24,160
Well, in particular it's
just like cards.

925
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,890
And you can do this by attacking
other players who

926
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,180
may be making alliances, which
you can easily betray.

927
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,300
Or maybe have like all the cards
in a pile and every turn

928
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,770
you can take one and try it.

929
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,680
And you get points by getting
certain combinations of

930
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,010
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

931
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:43,855
More like Risk right
there as well.

932
00:39:43,855 --> 00:39:45,105
PROFESSOR:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

933
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:58,918

934
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:00,340
AUDIENCE: I'm Brian.

935
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,060
So I was thinking of like
a trick taking game.

936
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,490
But the idea is there's four
players, and you're trying to

937
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,230
get the second most
tricks each round.

938
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,250
And then there are cards that
allow you to swap out other

939
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,050
cards at the end of
a round and other

940
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:16,430
things that are tricky.

941
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,870
PROFESSOR: So hit the
second-best trick?

942
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,080
AUDIENCE: Or second most tricks
or something like that.

943
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,330
But yeah.

944
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:34,180

945
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,116
AUDIENCE: So I was thinking
of sort of a--

946
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:36,990
put succinctly--

947
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,970
Scrabble meets chicken.

948
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,698
PROFESSOR: Hm?

949
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:42,000
AUDIENCE: What?

950
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,180
AUDIENCE: You have a
bunch of people.

951
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,726
And they play cards in the
middle and you have

952
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,060
to make words out.

953
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,370
And if you make longer
words, you get more

954
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,230
points and so forth.

955
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,930
So maybe your letter is more
rare, it gets more points.

956
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,350
But the catch is that if the
word is longer, you can't gain

957
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,300
as much point.

958
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,350
The point gain is--

959
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,270
AUDIENCE: Diminishing.

960
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,780
AUDIENCE: It's diminished
more.

961
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,790
It's proportional to how long
the word is you make.

962
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,173

963
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:13,030
AUDIENCE: I'm Bato.

964
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,340
And I wanted to combine Mario
Karts and Chrononauts.

965
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,820
So the idea of you're
racing through time.

966
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,720
Somebody is the main guy that's

967
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,650
trying to get to someplace.

968
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,880
Everyone else is trying
to stop him.

969
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,060
And your abilities or weapons
only work in certain time

970
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,850
periods and stuff like that.

971
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:31,720
And so you have the time travel
and the items from

972
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,586
Chrononauts and the racing and
attacking from Mario Kart.

973
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:39,380
AUDIENCE: Go, Michelle.

974
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,950
AUDIENCE: My name is Michelle.

975
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,310
So I was envisioning something
like Ricochet Robots but where

976
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,070
the two people-- basically, the
point is that everyone has

977
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,565
a set of cards that have
pathways or grids or walls

978
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:53,350
that you can bounce off of.

979
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:55,940
And you build a grid
with your opponent.

980
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,190
And there's one robot piece that
you have to try to bounce

981
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,775
off the walls to reach
some specific goal.

982
00:42:02,775 --> 00:42:05,250
You can screw up the
other player.

983
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,460
PROFESSOR: Build walls and
bounce robots around.

984
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,310

985
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,250
Good.

986
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,220
AUDIENCE: I'm Patrick.

987
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:15,705
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

988
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,615
Oh, Patrick, then Jeremy.

989
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:22,240
AUDIENCE: So this is a game
where the players are owners

990
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,800
of businesses.

991
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,360
And depending on the nature of
the business, they might have

992
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,260
mutual dependencies that would
be beneficial for people to

993
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,940
get more money.

994
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:33,650
But then as the market goes
bad, they'll have to play

995
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:38,160
cards to cut off the ties
between companies.

996
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,715
And so I call it Objectivism,
The Game.

997
00:42:43,715 --> 00:42:45,200
AUDIENCE: That was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

998
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:54,110

999
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,605
PROFESSOR: OK.

1000
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,100
You?

1001
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,890
AUDIENCE: So just a slight
variation on the procedure

1002
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:03,680
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] idea but now
I'm visioning it possibly as a

1003
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,710
sort of Falling real-time
type deal.

1004
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,530
So every turn, you're
getting dealt cards.

1005
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:13,060
And you have cards that can
modify the dealing pattern so

1006
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,580
they can discard other players'
cards or can get them

1007
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,030
to be skipped, so
on and so forth.

1008
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,195
And you also have cards that can
add various modifiers to

1009
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:20,570
your beast.

1010
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,310
And the goal of the game is that
by time the deck has been

1011
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,720
entirely dealt, you have the
most bad-ass creature that

1012
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,265
you've created and that-- you'd
have to figure out-- and

1013
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:31,850
there might be an optimum way
to rearrange things, so as

1014
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,390
you're getting cards, you have
to try to figure out how to

1015
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:33,860
rearrange them.

1016
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,850
And at the same time,
other players could

1017
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,120
be discarding stuff.

1018
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,280
And you have to deal with all
these things at the same time.

1019
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,300
And then at the end of the game,
you have to freeze and

1020
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,320
see who has the best one.

1021
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,653
And it could be a really quick
game and very hilarious.

1022
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:46,018
PROFESSOR: OK, so
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1023
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:51,164
AUDIENCE: So kind of like
building a creature, plus Uno.

1024
00:43:51,164 --> 00:43:53,718
AUDIENCE: OK, this game is
Monkey or Shakespeare?

1025
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:57,850

1026
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,980
So there are several different
piles of cards.

1027
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,900
Each of them has words on them
in Shakespearean English.

1028
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,590

1029
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,430
Some of them are going to
be played by players.

1030
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,760
Some of them are going to be
like random number generators,

1031
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,966
essentially.

1032
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:19,000
The players that are playing as
covert Shakespeares select

1033
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,506
cards and then place them face
down in a common pool.

1034
00:44:22,506 --> 00:44:24,770
Then the top cards from all
the other decks get

1035
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,360
placed in the pool.

1036
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,450
And then everything
gets shuffled up.

1037
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:30,490
And then each of these different
piles is going to be

1038
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,160
a different color.

1039
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,130
And so you will spell out
sentences in the color

1040
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,370
progressively, based
on the card draws.

1041
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:39,075
And the object of the game for
the other players who aren't

1042
00:44:39,075 --> 00:44:42,640
hidden Shakespeares is to try
to work out who's the

1043
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,900
Shakespeare, who's just trying
to spell the prearranged

1044
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,904
sentence beforehand is, and
who are just monkey piles.

1045
00:44:49,904 --> 00:44:52,390
All right.

1046
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,910
So it's detect the random
number generator.

1047
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:57,780
AUDIENCE: Bato, again.

1048
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,870
I want to take that tanks versus
robot game that we

1049
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,340
played before on the paper and
make it into a card game

1050
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,640
between players.

1051
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,620
And the tanks can level up.

00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,929
kind of stuff.

1063
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,250

everyone's gone.

1067
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,420
AUDIENCE: So one mechanic is
any game that has a high

1068
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,430
amount of trading of cards.

1069
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,440
You can imagine anything from
a Go Fish type thing to

1070
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,800
something more complicated.

1071
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,560
However, you don't mechanically
enforce the

1072
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,110
traded cards.

1073
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:52,560
So there is basically lying
in that [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1074
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,030
Also, playing off of the robot
tank idea, a game where,

1075
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,350
basically, your strategy is
mitigated by the cards you

1076
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:04,650
play, rather than the actual
characteristics.

1077
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:09,810
So the cards played dictate how
another deck or another

1078
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,640
mechanic is run, rather
than you directly

1079
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,620
interfacing with that.

AUDIENCE: I am Justin.

1086
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,770
So I just have an idea about
your asylum game that seems

1087
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:31,950
very interesting.

1088
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,390
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1089
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,600
Maybe it will help if
you can play two

1090
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,440
characters instead of one.

1091
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,280
So if you have four people,
you have eight characters

1094
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,450
So two player asylum.

1095
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:47,270

1096
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:48,520
Two characters.

Andrew.

1100
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,680
So you could have something
that's sort of an MIT case.

1101
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,590
So you're an MIT student.

1102
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,402

you're doing energy

1109
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,770
Sorry, you'd force other people
to hang out at Harvard

00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,670

1112
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:30,650
PROFESSOR: Anything else?

1113
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,110
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1114
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,270
AUDIENCE: Deion.

1115
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,120
This is MIT or Harvard.

1116
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,740

1117
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,580
So let's say you're
in a design class.

1118
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,150
And you're trying to
build a project.

1119
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,320
So there's some students
that are MIT.

1120
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:49,720
Most of them are.

1121
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,110
But then there's one or
two Harvard students.

1122
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,100
And so everyone's trying
to build this project.

1123
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,330
But the Harvard student
is messing it up.

1124
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,730
Or maybe it could be Harvard,
MIT, or Caltech.

1125
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,690
So the other student, that's not
MIT, is trying to screw up

1126
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,220
your project.

1127
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,150
And so by the end of the game,
you want to figure out who

1128
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,280
that person is.

1129
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,680
Or maybe you take turns making
additions to it.

1130
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,994
Something like that.

1131
00:48:18,994 --> 00:48:22,770
AUDIENCE: So this came up only a
few seconds ago in my brain.

1132
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,080
The setting I imagine for this
might be something like a dark

1133
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,170
elf realm underground.

1134
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,750
And there's various
houses or various

1135
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,020
families of dark elves.

1136
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,971
And there's one that is not
controlled by players.

1137
00:48:35,971 --> 00:48:38,797
So I guess it's deterministic
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1138
00:48:38,797 --> 00:48:39,850
set rules.

1139
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,950
And players every turn can
place written cards to

1140
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,420
influence the behavior
of this non-player

1141
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,990
entity the next turn.

1142
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:52,012
And basically, players are vying
for influence over this

1143
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,322
non-player entity, which would
then do benevolent or

1144
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,230
malevolent things
towards players.

1145
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:59,980
And it might be only
semi-obvious, depending on how

1146
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:04,590
cards are played who exactly
took certain actions to get

1147
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:08,795
this master house to give favor
or remove favor from one

1148
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:09,750
player to another.

1149
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,130
And so it would be a game where
you're trying to beat

00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:11,720
other players.

to figure out who's on

your side, who's not on your
side, and forging alliances

1153

and betraying each other.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1228
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:08,650

1229
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:13,610
AUDIENCE: So again, it's like
an RPG card game, where you

1230
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,320
each have your set of things
you can do and

1231
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,700
equipment you have.

1232
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,410
And then there's an
encounter deck.

1233
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,560
And these keep getting
flipped over.

1234
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,270
And then people have
to react to this.

1235
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:27,290
But it's not quite cooperative
because at the end, there's

1236
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,770
something that only one
person can get.

1237
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:33,575
So maybe they have to duke it
out at the end if there's more

1238
00:52:33,575 --> 00:52:35,224
than one person left.

1239
00:52:35,224 --> 00:52:37,192
PROFESSOR: Sounds like
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1240
00:52:37,192 --> 00:52:38,670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, kind of.

1241
00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:42,010
AUDIENCE: So bringing up auction
mechanics, there's a

1242
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,690
bidding mechanic that is
interesting from a theoretical

1243
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:48,110
standpoint that I never see
implemented, where if you have

1244
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:53,230
a thing that's being
bidded for--

1245
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:55,020
or you have everyone assign
something that they

1246
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,320
get from some pile.

1247
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,700
And then if someone feels that
they are unhappy with what

1248
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,420
they have, they trade it with
someone else's, and either put

1249
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,750
some amount of money on the
other item or some decremental

1250
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:07,530
type object on their item.

1251
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,760
The bidding system comes out of
the pirates trying to split

1252
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,340
up booty and making
everyone happy.

1253
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:19,925
PROFESSOR: So bidding by
reducing other people's bids--

1254
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:22,730
is that a good description?

1255
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:24,150
AUDIENCE: It's a bidding
system in which

1256
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:25,070
everyone has something.

1257
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,910
And then you trade and add value
until everyone feels

1258
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,830
it's equal.

1259
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,270
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

1260
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,520
something.

1261
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,590

1262
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,030
Let's see.

1263
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,950
Yeah?

1264
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:44,840
AUDIENCE: So my idea
was you have two

1265
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,120
teams, maybe four players.

1266
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,030
It's like an RPG.

1267
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:55,640
And so before you start, you
have to draft the equipment

1268
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,015
and spells you can do.

1269
00:53:57,015 --> 00:54:02,180
And so then you have team
battles against each other.

1270
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,000
And the way you determine what
happens is maybe a War-like

1271
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,320
system, where each one has
a deck which is shuffled.

1272
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,770
Take the top card of the deck.

1273
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:16,270
The highest card wins.

1274
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:20,816
And so that determines
damage and such done.

1275
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:21,540
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1276
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,050
AUDIENCE: I like it.

1277
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,650
So searching off the RPG idea
but adding on a randomly

1278
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:32,665
generated fort or castle that
one player has to defend and

1279
00:54:32,665 --> 00:54:33,930
everyone else is trying
to attack into.

1280
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:37,060
And he has to set up his
defenses around.

1281
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,520
But he's also controlling
a character.

1282
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,315
And so he can move his guy
around the board to choose one

1283
00:54:41,315 --> 00:54:42,650
of the guys to defend against.

1284
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,558
So essentially an RPG
with randomly

1285
00:54:44,558 --> 00:54:45,056
generated board as well.

1286
00:54:45,056 --> 00:54:46,052

00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:50,380
AUDIENCE: I like it.

1290
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,580
AUDIENCE: So it's sort of
building off of the idea of

1291
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,450
pirate's booty.

1292
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,300
I like the idea that
you have a bunch of

1293
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,220
items within the game.

1294
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,710
The value for them is chosen
randomly so that it's unknown

1295
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,270
what the value of
the items are.

1296
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,440
So you just have the items and
various players can make

1297
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,580
various moves like choose
to appraise an item

1298
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:07,690
by paying some gold.

1299
00:55:07,690 --> 00:55:09,800
And the idea is you want to
try to get the item that's

1300
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,580
worth the most amount of money
during any round to get the

1301
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,730
most amount of gold.

bidding [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1309
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,680

factories

1310
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,910
with different products.

1311
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:39,032
So you want to bid on different
items, but for some

1312
00:55:39,032 --> 00:55:40,830
people, it might be necessary
to have a certain

1314
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,750

different values

for different people.

1316
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,155
And you could also get high-end

stuff or low-end stuff.

1318
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,600
And the randomness is going
come in where if you have

1319
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,716
low-end stuff, a user could
hate your product.

1320
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:53,144
And then you lose money
and stuff like that.

use the Hubble Telescope.

Dungeon keeper, the card game.

1341
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:39,170
So I'd imagine that there would
be several lanes, down

1342
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:42,230
which enemies would come.

1343
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,370
And you would collaborate with
other players to create

1344
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,460
buildings on the other end of
those lanes that would then

1345
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,300
generate either traps along the
way or your own units that

1346
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,240
would knock down the lanes,
taking out the enemies.

1347
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,230
And every turn, you run
the game yourself.

1348
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:57,960
So you run your opponent and it
automatically advances and

1349
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,390
sends stuff at you that's
drawn from decks.

1350
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,290
And you have to be able to time
stuff right and all that,

1351
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,394

1354
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,940
AUDIENCE: I'm just thinking
of the idea of Tower

1355

Defense, the card game.

1356
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,953
Combine that with Falling, the
idea that turns are happening

at the same time.

1358
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,890
So you have one player who's
playing the zombies invading.

1359
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:19,980
And he's just basically going,
one, two, three, four.

1360
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:22,260
That's like a zombie advance,
four steps, or something, by

1361
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:23,340
placing cards down.

1362
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,180
And then the other player is
trying to place defenses just

1363
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,390
as fast, but has to discard
cards as well.

1364
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,380

of how well you are

So you could have bluffing where
you say, oh, I'm going

1398
00:58:38,067 --> 00:58:38,311
to the bathroom.

1399
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:40,746
And then someone else could
call you out on it.

1400
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:42,450
And you either have the bathroom
card and you're

1401
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:45,129
actually going to the bathroom
or its an excuse.

1402
00:58:45,129 --> 00:58:48,538
So that's a mechanic
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1403
00:58:48,538 --> 00:58:49,512
PROFESSOR: That's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1404
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:50,762
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
full bladder card.

1405
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:53,391

1406
00:58:53,391 --> 00:58:55,440
AUDIENCE: Isn't there
a simple mechanic--

1407
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,350
you basically place cards down
to try to create a path from

1408
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:01,480
some predetermined point to
another but in that way, you

1409
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,550
can block other players
by placing cards

1410
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,050
PROFESSOR: So create impasse
and blocking them.

1411
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:07,280
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1412
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,852
AUDIENCE: I think you're done.

1413
00:59:08,852 --> 00:59:11,510
AUDIENCE: I think we're done.

1414
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:12,760
PROFESSOR:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1415
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,398

1416
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:16,856
All right.

1417
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:18,314
AUDIENCE: Just use the bottom.

1418
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:20,510
PROFESSOR: I guess I could write
down to the bottom, but

1419
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:22,530
it would be a pain for
folks to look at.

1420
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:27,790
So these are just memory jogs
of what we've got up here.

1421
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:32,170
None of these ideas need to be
taken up wholesale for your

1422
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,690
original idea for the team.

1423
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,350
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1424
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:38,394
things that folks
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1425
00:59:38,394 --> 00:59:42,330
I would actually like folks to
grab one of the thumbtacks

1426
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:42,960
over there.

1427
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,645
Once you've written down your
ideas on the card and pinned

1428
00:59:45,645 --> 00:59:47,270
them up on the wall.

1429
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,230
They don't have to be
closely packed.

1430
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:52,660
In fact, spread them out a
little bit, so that people can

1431
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,780
look at them one at a time.

1432
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,175
And the rest of the class
basically is just time for you

1433
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:57,960
guys to talk.

1434
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,370
You [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1435
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,860
get to know each other's
games better.

1436
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,280
And start discussing
about projects that

1437
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,530
you're working on.

1438
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,894
