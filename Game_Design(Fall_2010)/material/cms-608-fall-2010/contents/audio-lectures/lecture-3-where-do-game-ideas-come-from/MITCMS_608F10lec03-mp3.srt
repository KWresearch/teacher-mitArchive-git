00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,994

10
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:22,425
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

11
00:00:22,425 --> 00:00:25,287
Thanks for not dropping
the class yet.

12
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,672
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
do that right now.

13
00:00:27,672 --> 00:00:30,060
PROFESSOR: Funny you
mention that.

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,900
Let's see, just a reminder.

15
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,940
Actually one big reminder for
folks who weren't here on

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,850
Friday is that we swapped around
Friday and Monday's--

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
17th and the

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,160
20th have been swapped.

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

20
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,158
AUDIENCE: In terms of reading
that we're going

21
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:44,730
to do in the class.

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,136
PROFESSOR: So, we're still
going to be playing

23
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:49,140
the games on Friday.

24
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,249
But the brainstorming activity
that we had scheduled for

25
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:55,225
Monday is going to be on
this Friday instead.

26
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:56,620
And then later on
in the course.

27
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,310

28
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,560
Anyone manage to get through
the reading?

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,034

30
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,520
Let's see, where should
we start.

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,440
So there was a Doug Church
article that was on Gamasutra.

32
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,312
And if you're familiar with
Gamasutra, or if you're not

33
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:21,150
actually, it's a fairly
well-read news and industry

34
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,790
news blog for the video
game industry.

35
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,890
That particular article, I
think, was originally written

36
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,850
not for the website but for
the magazine that the

37
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,990
associated company publishes,
the Game Developer magazine.

38
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,940
And Doug Church is actually
an MIT alum.

39
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,764

40
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:46,154
The other article that was
read, Mark [INAUDIBLE],

41
00:01:46,154 --> 00:01:47,588
they're both MIT alums.

42
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,838
So that's one thing.

43
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,580

44
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,670
So Doug Church proposes
a set of tools.

45
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,870
And remember what
they're called?

46
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

47
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,800

48
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,590
PROFESSOR: So, and Mark's
framework which is--

49
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,840
AUDIENCE: M-A-D?

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,570

51
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,750
PROFESSOR: And we covered
mechanics

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,740
and dynamics on Friday.

53
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,260
And today we have a little
bit of time to talk about

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,440
aesthetics.

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,900
But the reason why these two
essays were put right next to

56
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,443
each other was MDA is an example
of what Doug Church

57
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,470
was describing as [INAUDIBLE].

58
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,990
In fact, at the time when MDA
came out it was pretty much

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,400
the only one that caught on.

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,840
Everybody, all of the problems
that Doug Church lays out in

61
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,678
his article about the problems
that we don't have a

62
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:50,018
vocabulary, a consistent
vocabulary, to talk about our

63
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,210
craft and thus we can't
actually deal with it.

64
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:58,680
And thus we need some formal
tools that everyone uses.

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,770
Unfortunately not much
has caught on.

66
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,950
MDA being one of the
few that has.

67
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,320
For a number of different
reasons.

68
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,580
First of all, it actually
is a useful framework.

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,960
You can think of many, many,
ways to properly look at games

70
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,716
but for a designer you need to
think of something where you

71
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:21,050
can actually apply it to help
improve your games.

72
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:27,560
And MDA actually gives you a
reason why design is hard.

73
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,450
So if nothing else, designers
like it a lot because it says

74
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,800
this is why their job is hard.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,730

76
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,920
The reason being, you get to
control the mechanics.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,340
But that's not what
you're going for.

78
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,970
You're not going for really
interesting mechanics.

79
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,870
They're going for really
interesting aesthetics.

80
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,590
They're going for a fun,
engaging, play experience.

81
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,514
There are mock--

82
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:53,330
in the MDA paper, this lists
eight kinds of fun.

83
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,810
And I've asked him about this
when we give this presentation

84
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,920
here in MIT.

85
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,210
Those eight were not meant
to be comprehensive.

86
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,130
They were meant to be, these
are the eight that I could

87
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,380
think of at the time.

88
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,215

89
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,130
After this I'm going
for [INAUDIBLE]

90
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,155
that's a bouquet of different
kinds of fun.

91
00:04:10,155 --> 00:04:12,660
Different kinds of experiences
that people are trying to get

92
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,810
out of playing games.

93
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,960
That's what a game designer
is trying to get.

94
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,060
The only problem is that a game
designer doesn't actually

95
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,565
control that experience.

96
00:04:19,565 --> 00:04:22,600
The game designer only gets
to upload mechanics.

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,010
Depending on what company you
are, maybe you have the title

98
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,777
of game designer but you're
also in charge of the art.

99
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,210
You're actually also the
lead programmer.

100
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,180
It's possible that you also have
more control over things

101
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,760
than just the mechanics.

102
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,800
But most designers, mechanics
is what the job still is.

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,860
So they write the rules, the
rules interact in some sort of

104
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,486
like ridiculously hard to
predict way, and then you get

105
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,880
the experience of playing
the game, the aesthetic.

106
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,405
And you hope that's what
you were going for.

107
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,990
It usually isn't.

108
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,020
And then you make a change to
the mechanics and try again.

109
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,710
The nice thing about that, is
that works really well with

110
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,650
the rate of design.

111
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,350
In fact, without a rate of
design it becomes really hard

112
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,960
to control this kind
of process.

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,701
Because basically, we are two
orders removed from the

114
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:14,380
experience that you're
trying to create.

115
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,350
It's like trying to draw on a
piece of paper where not only

116
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,200
can you not see the paper that
you're drawing on, you're also

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,831
controlling the brush or the
pencil tied to a stick, or

118
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,250
something like that,
blindfolded.

119
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,669
That's kind of what making
game designs are like.

120
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:34,910

121
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,860
So that's the experience of
the game design side.

122
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,620
You can control the mechanics,
and they're going towards some

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,630
sort of aesthetic.

124
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,692
And from the other side, the
player is experiencing some

125
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:50,960
kind of aesthetic and they can
sort of work their way back.

126
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,610
It's like, I'm getting this
kind of experience.

127
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,330
Why am I getting this
kind of experience?

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,415
If you've got a particularly
insightful game player, maybe

129
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:01,340
they're taking CMS.300
Introduction to Video Games,

130
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,730
and you're analyzing games.

131
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,650
And you're trying to say,
how did we get here?

132
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,130
If anything in this class,
you're going to be

133
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,250
doing that a lot.

134
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,670
This game, Heroes Might and
Magic 3 for instance, has--

135
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,210
give me a particularly--

136
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:18,740
a sensation.

137
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,538
Describe a sensation that you
got when you were playing that

138
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,870
game, that you recall.

139
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,280
AUDIENCE: Strategic.

140
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,250
Out-smarting.

141
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,830
To saying to friends.

142
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,890
Outsmart them.

143
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,550
Stump me.

144
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,596
PROFESSOR: Seem smart, make you
have to think really hard

145
00:06:33,596 --> 00:06:34,510
and everything.

146
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,925
So then you think about
what dynamics might

147
00:06:36,925 --> 00:06:40,170
have resulted in that.

148
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,940
AUDIENCE: Fog of War.

149
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,090
PROFESSOR: For you to figure
out is behind the

150
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,750
areas you can't see.

151
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,676
But it has some information
that you can see that will

152
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:49,900
give you clues.

153
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,745
And then, Fog of War might
already be a mechanic.

154
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:56,460
The idea of, there is
information that you can

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,050
deduce even though you can't
actually see it.

156
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,790
And there's some probability of
getting it right based on

157
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,660
their experience with games.

158
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,280
Fog of War being one game
that gets you there.

159
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,020
So you can analyze
it backwards.

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,110
And figure out, OK that's one
thing Fog of War gets you.

161
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,230
Sometimes Fog of War
just confuses you.

162
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,990
There could be anything
behind this corner.

163
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:22,097
I mean technically, Final
Fantasy random combat system

164
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:23,663
is like Fog of War.

165
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:25,530
I don't know if there is a
random encounter here, I will

166
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,284
walk into it.

167
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:30,534
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

168
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:36,710

169
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,010
AUDIENCE: That's where Unix
merger is complete--

170
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,732
Plan to the classic Final
Fantasy one with slides and

171
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:41,982
the classic [INAUDIBLE].

172
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:49,430

173
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,670
PROFESSOR: But there is
actually a problem--

174
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,500
actually, I don't need
to write this down.

175
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,580
There is a problem with--

176
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,680
well, maybe it's
not a problem.

177
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,170
There is an issue that I
have with [INAUDIBLE].

178
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,220

179
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,210
Doug Church uses it specifically
to say, well it

180
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,610
should be sort of a serious
business right?

181
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,850
It's formal with a capital F.
We're not talking about how

182
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,070
cool this game is, we want
to be very precise in our

183
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,320
vocabulary.

184
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,000

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,760
We want to treat it like a
serious business with a

186
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,930
capital S, capital B.

187
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,733
However, the other assumption
with the word formal comes

188
00:08:27,733 --> 00:08:29,817
from [INAUDIBLE].

189
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:32,360
You are thinking about
the form of the game.

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,730
In a way that if you were
trying to apply the same

191
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,400
technique to talk about art
you'd be talking about the

192
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,280
form of visual art.

193
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,100
The form of cinema.

194
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,660
And that is actually a very
narrow way to look at

195
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,260
something, at a topic, that
is as broad as a game.

196
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,760

197
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,760
It is as if we were trying
to analyze something like

198
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,220
[INAUDIBLE]

199
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,470
and completely ignoring the fact
that you were playing it

200
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,530
with friends from
French class.

201
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,120
That would be an example of,
well that had nothing to do

202
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,680
with the game.

203
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,238
Well actually, it probably had
a lot to do with how you

204
00:09:11,238 --> 00:09:12,488
experienced the game.

205
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:15,510

206
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,920
Play, that's the
rules of chess.

207
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,900
And you could just look
at the game based on

208
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,750
the rules of chess.

209
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,776
You could also look at
the history of chess.

210
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,644
You could also look at who
you're playing it against.

211
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:29,905
Are you playing against
a random person or

212
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,540
against your dad?

213
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,540
Big difference, or in
my case my mom.

214
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,580
Are you playing it in a club?

215
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,527
Are you playing it against the
chess master in Harvard Square

216
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,270
or something like that?

217
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,530
What does this game mean?

218
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,280
Are you using the game
metaphorically in speech?

219
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,320

220
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,820
My opponent wasn't checking
his position.

221
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,864
Doesn't necessarily mean that
you were playing chess with

222
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:09,920
someone else in order to
get your point across.

223
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,100
There's a whole range of
different ways that you can

224
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,058
look at games, even as a game
designer, that isn't

225
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,537
specifically formalist.

226
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,851
That isn't specifically
just looking at

227
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,481
the form of the game.

228
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:22,822
Just understanding what context
people are going to be

229
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,090
playing the game in.

230
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:27,090
While a lot of the games that
you guys are going to be

231
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,830
designing this semester,
specifically in this class,

232
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,890
you have to think about the fact
that a lot of these games

233
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:37,572
are actually going to be played
by your instructors.

234
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,840
Are going to be played in a
setting very similar to this

235
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,090
by your colleagues.

236
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,530

237
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,312
Are probably going to end up
being tested by dorm mates,

238
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:51,420
fraternity friends, folks
around campus.

239
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,066
And all that is going to vividly
influence the kind of

240
00:10:54,066 --> 00:10:55,316
game that you make.

241
00:10:55,316 --> 00:10:57,970

242
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,680
For better or worse, you are
pretty much making a game for

243
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,110
an MIT audience.

244
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,680
I am trying to change that
a little bit for the last

245
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,570
assignment.

246
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:11,910
But keep in mind that's not
necessarily every single game

247
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,560
that you're going to
make in the future.

248
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,960
And that shouldn't be.

249
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,443
But, knowing that, you can try
to cater to the audience that

250
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:19,693
you've got.

251
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:23,163

252
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:25,350
That has very little, in some
ways, this is going to effect

253
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,610
the design decisions that
you make in your game.

254
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:32,515
What will be perfectly
acceptable to a competitive

255
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:36,600
MIT audience might not be
perfectly acceptable to your

256
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,860
average working buyer in Target
or something like that.

257
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,260

258
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,440
And so what may be a perfectly
engrossing game, mechanic,

259
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,510
dynamic, aesthetic experience,
that you will get.

260
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,960
But just like looking at the
formal aspects of one game,

261
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,280
this will be really cool if you
understood the mechanic,

262
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,790
played it out in the way the
creator designed the dynamic

263
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,620
to give you the aesthetic
experience.

264
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,370
But if you don't have the
standard context when you're

265
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,846
playing the game, as an example,
then your player may

266
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:10,030
not even get that far.

267
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,870
Your player may look at your
game and say this game is not

268
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:17,230
for me and just walk away.

269
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,330
It might mean that you might--

270
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,393
I'm thinking of things like we
just had this good discussion

271
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:25,866
over lunch about the sort of
games that you find on

272
00:12:25,866 --> 00:12:29,315
Facebook for instance.

273
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,442
And a lot of social games--

274
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,738
I might have already made this
point, but it has been argued

275
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,870
that social games aren't
all that social.

276
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,822
All you do is really beg
and scam your friends.

277
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:42,010
That's the whole point--

278
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,135
In many ways, it's also the same
to your friends who are

279
00:12:46,135 --> 00:12:47,110
doing the same thing.

280
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,280
And we may be separated by
time, and separated by

281
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,520
distance, we're all doing
the same thing.

282
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,380
And we could be playing this
game, we could be talking

283
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,384
about a show that we are
watching in our apartments and

284
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:04,790
get to discuss it, but in many
ways this is just me telling

285
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,062
you we're doing the same thing,
that we're part of the

286
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:08,450
same group.

287
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,024
And that serves a function that
has almost, that really

288
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,820
doesn't have anything to do with
the formal analysis of

289
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,380
how a game mechanic works, but
it's still incredibly crucial

290
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,570
to the popularity
of those games.

291
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,180
So keep that in mind,
that even though

292
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,210
Church makes his point--

293
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,549
I think a lot of designers
actually ignore that when you

294
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,140
read his essay--

295
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,980
that it's only one
set of tools.

296
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,060
The formal tools are only
one set of tools, even.

297
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:49,370
That our tools at looking at
games culturally, personally,

298
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,170
and other things that video
games cast into light--

299
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,930

300
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,300
that will effect how people
experience a game and how much

301
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:01,870
pleasure they're going
to get out of a game.

302
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,200
To understand video games doing
what it does right?

303
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,310

304
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,520
That aren't, that don't have
anything to do, necessarily,

305
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,934
with just by looking at
the self-contained

306
00:14:12,934 --> 00:14:14,184
system of the game.

307
00:14:14,184 --> 00:14:18,510

308
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,370
Just as a side note, how many of
you folks have heard of the

309
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,182
narrative versus ludology
debate?

310
00:14:27,182 --> 00:14:28,432
How many of you are
sick of this?

311
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:32,594

312
00:14:32,594 --> 00:14:33,508
I'm sick of it too.

313
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:36,140
But I bring it up for one
reason, there is an

314
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,250
interesting case that if you
actually look at narratology

315
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:44,390
as a study and ludology
as a study, they're

316
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,370
both formalist studies.

317
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,820
In fact, they're more accurate
more precisely, they're both

318
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,658
structuralist.

319
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:55,060
If you look at philosophies as a
sub-sect of formalism, or at

320
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,220
least a more recent version of
it, they're both basically

321
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,300
focused on these are the
elements of this art form.

322
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,120
And this is how they
interact to produce

323
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,570
some sort of effect.

324
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,890
And all that matters is what's
contained in this art form.

325
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,770
What's outside this art
form doesn't matter.

326
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,680
That's what narratology
does for stories.

327
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,000
That's what ludology
does for games.

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,340
That's, in fact, probably why
most people who study games

329
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,616
have walked away from ludology
because it's not that

330
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:26,840
interesting.

331
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,490
You just study what's
inside a system.

332
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,740
People want to see
what's outside.

333
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,580

334
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,620
And so when you compare
structuralistic and

335
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,690
structuralism wins
that's one case.

336
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:44,160
And you only have, you may not
realize that you're actually

337
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,090
looking at your game through
a very, very, narrow lens.

338
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,670
So I'm trying to broaden
the range of

339
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,884
tools that you've got.

340
00:15:49,884 --> 00:15:52,630
This class is going to give
you a small set of them.

341
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:57,020
And it's not by any means the
be all and end all of every

342
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,150
single way and that you
can look at a game.

343
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,310
And again, you're not just
restricted to the tools that I

344
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,700
specifically teach you
in this class.

345
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,921
So keep looking out for
all the new ones.

346
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:12,171
Let's see.

347
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,190

348
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,640
Any questions so far?

349
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,890
That was my rant.

350
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:22,416

351
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,330
OK, no more ranting.

352
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,720
We have an activity.

353
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,660
Do you want to run through?

354
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,544
GUEST SPEAKER: OK I'm going to
pass around-- this is my

355
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:37,978
crappy race game.

356
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:42,182
So you're going to be getting
one copy per pair.

357
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:45,165
There's also some nifty
set of dice.

358
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:47,640
You'll need one copy
per, one die per.

359
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,570

360
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,776
And then, each person's
going to need three

361
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:59,050
of these poker chips.

362
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,792
It doesn't matter the color
so just grab three.

363
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:08,157

364
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,612
You're each going to need a
marker to indicate yourself.

365
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,558
And I recommend just grabbing
any given value--

366
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:21,414

367
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:22,887
There should be more
than enough copies.

368
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:31,860

369
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,110
So you only need one
board per group.

370
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:44,379

371
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:47,432
PROFESSOR: So one die for
every two people?

372
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,800
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, one
of those six-sided

373
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,170
die for every two.

374
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,960
And then you need markers
for yourselves

375
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,065
and then bonus markers.

376
00:17:53,065 --> 00:17:56,830
And that's what the poker
chips are for.

377
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,640
So keep the poker chips
circulating.

378
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,120
AUDIENCE: Three per person?

379
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,920
GUEST SPEAKER: Three
per person.

380
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,800
AUDIENCE: One playing
piece per person.

381
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,892
GUEST SPEAKER: You can use
coins, you can use die--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

383
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,190
paper, whatever you want.

384
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:17,070

385
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,410
PROFESSOR: So we have three
of the important questions

386
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,660
[INAUDIBLE].

387
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:26,940

388
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,240
AUDIENCE: How many [INAUDIBLE]
take back?

389
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,050
GUEST SPEAKER: If you need
markers for yourself, you can

390
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,724
try one of the multi-sided
polyhedral dice over here.

391
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:34,678
I guess--

392
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:37,270
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

393
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,520
AUDIENCE: OK, OK, what now?

394
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:45,715

395
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:46,705
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm more
well-versed in the--

396
00:18:46,705 --> 00:19:04,544
GUEST SPEAKER: The
die is to roll

397
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,360
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, so can
everyone hold on for a second?

398
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,190
So what we're going to ask you
to do is just play through

399
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,690
this game a couple times?

400
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,030
Then we're going to come back
and apply the MDA framework to

401
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,860
the game itself.

402
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,510
And then if we have time, I
think we're going to spend

403
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,890
some time tweaking it?

404
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,890
OK, cool.

405
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,140
So we'll interrupt you guys--

406
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,238

407
00:19:24,238 --> 00:19:25,729
actually, ten minutes
probably.

408
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:26,979
It's a pretty quick game.

409
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,815

410
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:32,960
This has sort of gone flat.

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,560
So what we'd kind of like
to do is hear about--

412
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,862
I guess we'll just go around
the room in pairs

413
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,140
and ask you to talk.

414
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,680
Or do you want a minute to talk,
to apply MDA to this and

415
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,030
focus on some things?

416
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,340
So I'm not like calling
anyone on the spot.

417
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,810
PROFESSOR: Anybody want to
volunteer what, how they felt?

418
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,846
What was the aesthetic
of this game?

419
00:19:49,846 --> 00:19:51,096
AUDIENCE: There is none.

420
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:54,666

421
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:57,880
GUEST SPEAKER: There's
no emotional affect.

422
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,455
PROFESSOR: It felt
competitive.

423
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:02,070
AUDIENCE: The thing is, it's
a very simple aesthetic.

424
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,060
So in the paper they say you're
going to the pleasure

425
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,163
of using the aesthetic, but here
you go straight to the

426
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,413
mechanic and you're wondering
about it.

427
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:11,620

428
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,204
PROFESSOR: You, it definitely
is easy especially because

429
00:20:14,204 --> 00:20:16,413
especially for board games the
mechanics are written down

430
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:17,772
right in front of you,
it's really easy

431
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:18,680
when you look at that.

432
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,746
But how did you feel while you
were playing this game?

433
00:20:21,746 --> 00:20:23,940
AUDIENCE: There was a
sense of tension.

434
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,264
There was maybe a sense of
[INAUDIBLE] perhaps?

435
00:20:29,264 --> 00:20:30,480
There was a sense of--

436
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,470
I mean there was the
intellectual challenge of

437
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,440
working out is there
really a meaningful

438
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,690
decision to be made here?

439
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,358

440
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:47,775
And if there is, what is
the correct decision?

441
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:51,220

442
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,595
PROFESSOR: So thinking
can I optimize this?

443
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:59,553
Especially with this crowd, I
think there was an immediate

444
00:20:59,553 --> 00:21:03,497
try to figure out what
the right thing is.

445
00:21:03,497 --> 00:21:06,340
And I know you were trying
to figure it out.

446
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,300
AUDIENCE: I think he correctly
figured it out.

447
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,540
PROFESSOR: So is there an
optimal way to play this game?

448
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,800
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK, so
if you're losing--

449
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,440
If you keep putting
tokens down you're

450
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,330
going to lose anyway.

451
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,080
So you want to be rolling
in order to

452
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,040
increase the variance.

453
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,541
And if you're winning, you want
to be putting tokens down

454
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,155
in order to move the variance.

455
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:30,700
You can imagine if it's
like a distribution.

456
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,190

457
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,625
If you're below the winning line
you want to widen it out

458
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,071
as much as possible so as much
of that distribution is above

459
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:41,810
the winning line.

460
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,825
And if you're above the winning
line you want it to be

461
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:44,660
as narrow as possible so you
stay above the winning line.

462
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,080
PROFESSOR: So your strategy is
basically based on what's the

463
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,050
currency of the game.

464
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, until the last
turn where obviously you don't

465
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,160
want to put a token down if
you're two from the end.

466
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,770

467
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,090
As long as no one can win on
this turn, if I'm behind him

468
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:01,734
I'm rolling the die.

469
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:04,532
And if I'm ahead of him I'm
putting down a token.

470
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,750
GUEST SPEAKER: Did anyone prefer
a strategy before you

471
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,232
started thinking about what
was the best one?

472
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:11,708
AUDIENCE: I'm too lazy
to use the tokens

473
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,020
so I just keep rolling.

474
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,178
GUEST SPEAKER: And that's
also part of the

475
00:22:17,178 --> 00:22:18,582
aesthetic of it right?

476
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,460
You just happen to prefer
the die roll.

477
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,680
AUDIENCE: On the first three
spaces you should be getting

478
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,748
the average if you
roll [INAUDIBLE]

479
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:25,732
if you put a token down.

480
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:27,208
I personally like being
conservative.

481
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:28,684
PROFESSOR: You win
no matter what.

482
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:31,634

483
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:32,116
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm sorry what?

484
00:22:32,116 --> 00:22:33,080
AUDIENCE: That's more
exciting because it

485
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,972
does different things.

486
00:22:35,972 --> 00:22:36,936
AUDIENCE: The token gives you
the illusion that you're

487
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:38,186
actually playing.

488
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:42,720

489
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
PROFESSOR: Did anyone like get
in the situation where they

490
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,490
are really far behind in
a different color?

491
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,740
AUDIENCE: No.

492
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:58,400

493
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,810
PROFESSOR: The actual
difference--

494
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,590
one of the things that you do
get in this game is the

495
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,530
perceived distance
between players.

496
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,872
It's actually not that far.

497
00:23:10,872 --> 00:23:14,580
If the one behind actually
has to still get in.

498
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,010
I think people refer
to this as the

499
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,520
American Gladiators effect.

500
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,020
You know how, American
Gladiators--

501
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,700
actually, is this your example
that I'm stealing?

502
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,600
GUEST SPEAKER: I don't
remember, honestly.

503
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,090
PROFESSOR: Someone I can't
help from stealing.

504
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,110
GUEST SPEAKER: I think it's in
the book at some point, but I

505
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,380
think we had applied
it to this.

506
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,766
AUDIENCE: Plagiarism!

507
00:23:32,766 --> 00:23:34,490
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes,
well I'm crediting

508
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,960
someone for this question.

509
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,020

510
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,270
Citation needed.

511
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,490

512
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,250
The basic idea being--

513
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,880
who's seen American
Gladiators?

514
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,788
GUEST SPEAKER: They
might be too old.

515
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,610
AUDIENCE: No, no, we had
American Gladiators.

516
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,220
AUDIENCE: I've never--

517
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,772
I don't know what it is.

518
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:00,445
PROFESSOR: OK, there are also
a number of Japanese game

519
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:02,146
shows which are similar
to this.

520
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:05,116

521
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,920
The basic idea of American
Gladiators is that it's

522
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,537
basically an obstacle
course where the

523
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:11,930
obstacles are people.

524
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:17,940
Happen to be these athletic
dudes and women who are either

525
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,603
pummeling you with waffle sticks
or shooting tennis

526
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:23,436
balls at you out of a gun
and stuff like that.

527
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:25,740
And you basically have to get
from the beginning to the end

528
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,710
faster than the other team.

529
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,310
Actually, faster than
the other player.

530
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,080
So it's two regular dudes and a
whole bunch of athletes who

531
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,330
are throwing things at you.

532
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,380

533
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,800
Every time you get hit you have
to go back a little bit.

534
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,540
But the thing about American
Gladiators is that you have

535
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,506
this long obstacle course.

536
00:24:44,506 --> 00:24:45,550
In fact, this was one
of the events.

537
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:49,910
This was always the final event
of the entire TV show.

538
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,310
Is that, you will have two
people doing the same course.

539
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,470
They will have to climb up a
wall and then they will have

540
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,260
to go down a zip line.

541
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,600
GUEST SPEAKER: But it was a
cargo net specifically.

542
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,960
So it was really difficult
to climb up it.

543
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the big
webbing kind of thing.

544
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,610
It was like climbing the
rigging off a ship.

545
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,990
It was really, really,
difficult.

546
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,840
So what happens is that if you
have two people who are

547
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,690
really, really, far apart--

548
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,500
one person is way ahead--

549
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,700
and that person starts climbing
the cargo net?

550
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,795
It takes that person forever to
get to the end of the cargo

551
00:25:26,795 --> 00:25:29,294
net, because climbing up cargo
net is really, really, hard no

552
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,340
matter who you are.

553
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,390
That gives the person behind
plenty of time to catch up and

554
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,510
start climbing the cargo net.

555
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,000
But then, the person who was the
leader in the first place

556
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,765
hits the zip line.

557
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:44,220
And all of a sudden there's a
huge increase in distance.

558
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,205
So this whole idea that
they never really

559
00:25:47,205 --> 00:25:49,890
were all that far--

560
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:51,340
they never really changed
their position.

561
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:56,800
For most Gladiators games the
winner has already been

562
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,110
decided by their points.

563
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,240
Because the first person who
reaches the cargo net tends to

564
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,780
win the match.

565
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,950
But it looks like the lead just
shrank because suddenly

566
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,270
you've got both of them
in one camera shot.

567
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:13,140
And then you've got
that cute--

568
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,280
mom likes to call that
dramatic tension.

569
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,790
Which I think is a better
description than it's other

570
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,330
term for the same thing
which is drama.

571
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,320
Because it's not drama.

572
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,570
It' s just tension really.

573
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,720

574
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,290
But that's an aesthetic.

575
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,290
You're going for the aesthetic
of tension and coming up with

576
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:31,250
a game that makes you feel like
the fight is closer than

577
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,650
it actually is.

578
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,630
Or allowing someone to close the
gap quickly because, many

579
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,690
of you have pointed about, these
things probabilistically

580
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,040
mean exactly the same
thing as a die roll.

581
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,560

582
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,810
Let's see.

583
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,660

584
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:56,520
But the ability to increase a
awkward gap to open up and

585
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,410
then to close, that's
actually a dynamic.

586
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,410
That's actually a result of a
number of different rules that

587
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,480
are in the particular
of the game.

588
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,810
It's not written down that
it's going to happen.

589
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,505
But it's pretty much going to
happen if you have two people

590
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,112
playing those particular
strategies, and one thing that

591
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:14,362
happens pretty often.

592
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:22,850

593
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,200
What are the constraints that
you're seeing in the design of

594
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,450
this game here?

595
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,120

596
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,484
What did this game have to do in
order for it to be a viable

597
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:35,967
in-class exercise?

598
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:37,899
AUDIENCE: Fit on a
sheet of paper.

599
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:39,831
PROFESSOR: Fit on a
sheet of paper.

600
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:41,210
That's a huge one actually.

601
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,410
Because first of all,
it limits how many

602
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,590
spaces you've got.

603
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,130
Assuming everyone's using
something like a die or a coin

604
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,540
or something.

605
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,950
GUEST SPEAKER: I mean, you can
laugh at that but it's

606
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,930
literally how it went.

607
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:56,450
I wanted it to fit on a sheet of
paper and the spaces had to

608
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,000
accommodate a die.

609
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,430
So the number of spaces
is a result of that.

610
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,902
AUDIENCE: It was almost
like an accident.

611
00:28:02,902 --> 00:28:06,830

612
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,410
PROFESSOR: Well you probably
could have fit a few more

613
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,725
squares in there.

614
00:28:09,725 --> 00:28:11,697
GUEST SPEAKER: Probably, but
you place some margins.

615
00:28:11,697 --> 00:28:12,947
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

616
00:28:12,947 --> 00:28:15,641

617
00:28:15,641 --> 00:28:16,873
AUDIENCE: The rules
have to fit on one

618
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:18,120
sheet of paper as well.

619
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,260
So the rules can't be
that complicated.

620
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,812
PROFESSOR: Most of these rules
are single sentences for the

621
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:26,060
most part, because we are
more than [INAUDIBLE].

622
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,963

623
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:32,248
It had to be quick.

624
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,538
It had to work within
10 minutes.

625
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,590
In fact, it had to work so you
get through a few games within

626
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,075
10 minutes.

627
00:28:39,075 --> 00:28:40,325
Anyone only manage to
get through one?

628
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:43,051

629
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,301
AUDIENCE: That'd
be really hard.

630
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:53,270

631
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:56,930
PROFESSOR: So different
aesthetics.

632
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,490
So, this game tries to get
really, really, tense.

633
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,436
But obviously, the decisions
that you're actually making in

634
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:07,840
this game is minimal.

635
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,880
You get to say, well if you are
already losing, that has

636
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,680
[INAUDIBLE].

637
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,870
One rational thing to do.

638
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:19,935
But if you were playing this
game, as Jason recommended, if

639
00:29:19,935 --> 00:29:22,198
I were playing this game against
myself there really is

640
00:29:22,198 --> 00:29:23,325
no optimal strategy.

641
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:26,223
I could pick two different
strategies for each side.

642
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,990
AUDIENCE: It's whoever plays
first basically.

643
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,210
Whoever plays first is by
default going to win.

644
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:31,460
PROFESSOR: On average.

645
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,650

646
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,690
AUDIENCE: I won every
game but one.

647
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,740
I did bad rolling dice.

648
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,020
GUEST SPEAKER: Because if
you roll them now--

649
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,610

650
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:45,720
PROFESSOR: So I would like
actually, folks to try mixing

651
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,060
this up a little bit.

652
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,580
Pick a rule in here, any
rule, and alter it.

653
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,040
You can do things like
adding more squares.

654
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,340
You can change the
movement chart.

655
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,080

656
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,750
One idea that I had, and someone
was thinking probably

657
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,750
more recent than me, which is
what happens if you use the

658
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,340
higher of two dice rolls
instead of just one?

659
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,940
[INAUDIBLE] to the
probability.

660
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,290
Play around with that.

661
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:19,202
See what that feels like.

662
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:23,650
And if that feels just boring
try doing something else.

663
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,140
So we've got 15 minutes?

664
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,340
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's reasonable.

665
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,870
PROFESSOR: And then, you'll tell
the class about what you

666
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:35,098
changed and how that changed
the feeling of the game.

667
00:30:35,098 --> 00:30:38,080
Cool?

668
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,420
So, every two people,
work with a team.

669
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,630
Explain how your game, how your
version works, and have

670
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:52,570
the other group play
it and vice versa.

671
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:58,663
And what we're going to do once
everyone's done, you will

672
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:03,460
tell the class what
you felt the other

673
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,910
group's game felt like.

674
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,430
So let someone else figure out
what your game aesthetic is.

675
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:13,340
So, does any team want to just
go first in describing the

676
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,070
other team's game?

677
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,065
OK, starting with you.

678
00:31:18,065 --> 00:31:19,425
AUDIENCE: Do you want
us to describe

679
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:20,700
the rules they changed?

680
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,100
PROFESSOR: Uh, sure.

681
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,130
AUDIENCE: Or just say--

682
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,520
the main change in this version
was that it's modular.

683
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,340
So you have to land exactly
on the end or

684
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,630
otherwise you wrap around.

685
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,170

686
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,010
It changed the aesthetic a lot
because it stopped being a

687
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,590
race against your opponent and
became more of trying to

688
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,630
figure out how you can use your
tokens to precision just

689
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,490
hit the end.

690
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,770
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

691
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,120
AUDIENCE: More methodical
and thoughtful.

692
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,740
You decide whether or not you're
going to stockpile

693
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,360
tokens to give you more winning
squares and then you

694
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,660
just waited until you landed
on a winning square.

695
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,960
PROFESSOR: So you get
a dis-computational

696
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,410
motive to the game?

697
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,280
AUDIENCE: It was not
as competitive.

698
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,270
AUDIENCE: So one of the
discussions we had was, what

699
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,070
if you had three tokens you
could just get to the end.

700
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,290
Because we made our tokens
move four spaces.

701
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:05,690
PROFESSOR: OK.

702
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,154
AUDIENCE: But I just realized,
you have to do the die roll

703
00:32:07,154 --> 00:32:08,130
after that.

704
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,372
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

705
00:32:09,372 --> 00:32:10,900
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

706
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:17,370

707
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,090
AUDIENCE: They had a really
creative role where

708
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,790
they had a 10 here.

709
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,940
So it goes from 0 to 9.

710
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,670
And you roll under a cup and
that's the number of spaces

711
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,880
away from the end.

712
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,300
So from 0 to 9 that the
winning point is.

713
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,040
And at your turn you can either
play normally or you

714
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,910
can check to see where
the winning point is.

715
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,010
If you've won, that triggers
you winning.

716
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,510
But you cannot win unless you
physically check and confirm

717
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:45,228
that you've won.

718
00:32:45,228 --> 00:32:49,195
So it eats up a turn, but it
could be that after two rolls

719
00:32:49,195 --> 00:32:51,436
of two and this was
a nine you've won.

720
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,960

721
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,150
And it was a lot of fun
basically because we had to

722
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,240
figure out the optimal strategy
but it was just fun.

723
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,610
PROFESSOR: So what's it feel
like when you're trying to

724
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,310
figure out what you're
going to do?

725
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,840
AUDIENCE: He beat me by checking
when it was far away

726
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,090
and being lucky.

727
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,230

728
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,900
PROFESSOR: So if you don't check
you have to reach the

729
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,700
end to win.

730
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,330
So you have to check,
usually, anyway.

731
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,290
AUDIENCE: One thing Alecia had
in mind when we were thinking

732
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:27,000
about the rule was there ought
to be information that you can

733
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,902
get from how your opponent
reacts after they

734
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:31,130
look under the cup.

735
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,220
So if they then go and start
rolling again or what have

736
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,880
you, or they then
start options.

737
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,880
But there must be some way that
you can get a leak of

738
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,980
information from their behavior
which makes it

739
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,030
interesting in a
different way.

740
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,930
AUDIENCE: If you've have already
seen the cup, and you

741
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:50,000
get past the point, do you
have to check to win?

742
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,726
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we played
two different variants.

743
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:52,110
One where you did.

744
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:52,600
One where you didn't.

745
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,840
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

746
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,280
AUDIENCE: Well, you don't have
to check the second time.

747
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,970
If you check the first time and
then you pass it you win.

748
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,220
AUDIENCE: So that's why there's
one way of playing it.

749
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,480
PROFESSOR: So the person who
checks could win even they're

750
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,810
already passed the point?

751
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,830
Am I understanding this right?

752
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,820
AUDIENCE: Well, if he's the
first past the point.

753
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,324
If you don't have check to win,
so if you just need the

754
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:17,220
knowledge of what the endpoint
is, then if he

755
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:18,409
passes it first he wins.

756
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,444
If when he checks both
players are at that

757
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,600
spot then it's a tie.

758
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,484
PROFESSOR: Oh, ok.

759
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:25,239
AUDIENCE: But since it's
a sequential game it's

760
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:25,820
impossible.

761
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,170
Other than, at the moment of the
check if both players are

762
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,723
at the same spot is it possible
for them to win at

763
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:30,313
the same time.

764
00:34:30,313 --> 00:34:32,250
So that's not really an issue.

765
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,659
AUDIENCE: What if I check, and
you're past me, and you have

766
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,440
passed the check spot?

767
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,565
AUDIENCE: I don't win.

768
00:34:36,565 --> 00:34:37,179
AUDIENCE: OK.

769
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,110
AUDIENCE: Because
I never checked.

770
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,262
So as long as I don't
know I don't win.

771
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:42,840

772
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,790
PROFESSOR: Hey, he makes me
think of a different variant.

773
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,040
But OK.

774
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,420

775
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,810
AUDIENCE: So what they did
was they introduced

776
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,560
a couple new rules.

777
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,366
The first rule being that, the
person who rolls first on

778
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:59,100
their first turn they cannot
put down a token.

779
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,720
So they actually have to roll.

780
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,730
The second rule is, whenever you
roll if you have a bonus

781
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,990
token on the stockpile
you have two

782
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,160
options after you roll.

783
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,610
One is, you can take
it off and move

784
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,840
two spaces like normal.

785
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,030
The second is, you can choose to
make that block impassible.

786
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,640
So what this does is your
opponent cannot

787
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,265
land on that block.

788
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:21,095
If they are already on that
block they get pushed one

789
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:22,130
block back.

790
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,040
If they are behind it, and they
roll and they move to

791
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,460
that block, they get pushed
one block behind it.

792
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,763
PROFESSOR: So they're
changing the block

793
00:35:28,763 --> 00:35:29,455
while you're playing.

794
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:30,165
AUDIENCE: Yes.

795
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,120
PROFESSOR: And how did
that feel while you

796
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,100
were actually playing?

797
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,350
AUDIENCE: We didn't actually
use it that much.

798
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:39,520

799
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,245
AUDIENCE: I felt like the
penalty for the impassable

800
00:35:41,245 --> 00:35:42,540
block should have been more.

801
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,675
Because if you land on the block
that they're on, and

802
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:46,940
make them move back one, that
token would otherwise have

803
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,745
made you move forward two.

804
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,040
So it doesn't really reward
you for that.

805
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,830
I felt it could have been really
awesome if the penalty

806
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,640
was significantly more severe.

807
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,800
Because it's hard to get in
front of them enough to

808
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,945
actually make a block impassable
and have them land

809
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:04,710
on it later.

810
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,470
AUDIENCE: Probably to all the
way back or something.

811
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,240
AUDIENCE: Yeah exactly.

812
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,550
PROFESSOR: So try multiplying
it by two

813
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,800
and see what happens.

814
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:17,706

815
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:21,650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and then you
can always go land on it.

816
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,570
PROFESSOR: If you're like, hmm,
that should have changed

817
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:24,820
the game play but that didn't.

818
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,410

819
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,020
One of the tricks in chapter
one was just make it bigger

820
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,090
and see what happens.

821
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,170
If nothing else it will just
give you more information on

822
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,430
whether you should be
spending any more

823
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,390
time with this direction.

824
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:43,373
Or whether it really isn't going
to affect the way how

825
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,510
people play because people don't
end up caring about it.

826
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,916
So the rule of twos is just
multiply something by two, or

827
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,807
half it by two, and
see what happens.

828
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:54,390
Obviously halving by two
would not in this work.

829
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,720
Who else?

830
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,660
AUDIENCE: So actually they had
these tokens as power-ups.

831
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,200
And you would never actually
take them off

832
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,530
to move more spaces.

833
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,400
You would just keep adding
tokens and you could roll.

834
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,570
So you can spend one turn
to put a token on and in

835
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,120
consequent rolls you could
essentially say, I have N

836
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,830
tokens therefore I roll N plus
1 dice and subtract N.

837
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,080
PROFESSOR: I think
that's one dice.

838
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,920

839
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

840
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,690
AUDIENCE: --and then you roll a
die for each token you have,

841
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,740
and then you move back one space
for each token you have.

842
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,500
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

843
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,300
AUDIENCE: So it moves your
average and your

844
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,091
maximum up each time.

845
00:37:33,091 --> 00:37:35,130
AUDIENCE: So you could act it
as a power yourself up.

846
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,880
AUDIENCE: And you could also
remove tokens to take away

847
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,512
tokens from the other
guy, right?

848
00:37:39,512 --> 00:37:41,074
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

849
00:37:41,074 --> 00:37:42,550
AUDIENCE: Which we never
actually did.

850
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,540

851
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,835
AUDIENCE: I guess we forgot to
go into that, you don't take

852
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,190
out all the tokens when you
do your special move.

853
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,870
They stay in there.

854
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,670
Because, mathematically speaking
if you take them off

855
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,860
it makes it worse.

856
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:03,823
PROFESSOR: So, I mean, that's an
important object lesson in

857
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,520
how to explain the rules
to the people.

858
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,950
How'd it feel while you were
playing their version?

859
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,755
AUDIENCE: It made my mind tired,
being N plus 1 minus N.

860
00:38:13,755 --> 00:38:15,240
But, it was interesting.

861
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,080
I actually used it.

862
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,530
Before I said I would only use
the die, but this time I

863
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,100
actually used tokens.

864
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,000
PROFESSOR: And what
happened when you

865
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
actually used the token?

866
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,394
Was it like yes!

867
00:38:23,394 --> 00:38:27,870
AUDIENCE: Like I said, the
math made it too hard.

868
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,110
PROFESSOR: Well something
happened.

869
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,940
It made you use the tokens as
opposed to ignoring them.

870
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,190
AUDIENCE: It was interesting.

871
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:39,070

872
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,500
AUDIENCE: So, the rule that they
gave was that if you are

873
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,820
behind the player--

874
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:50,580
by behind, they mean if your
piece is behind the other one.

875
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,663
AUDIENCE: Losing,
in second place.

876
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:56,100
AUDIENCE: Right, but not
in the imaginary sense.

877
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,350
Well, whatever.

878
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,044

879
00:39:00,044 --> 00:39:03,320
If you're physically behind them
then when you use a token

880
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,270
you get to use one extra
space ahead.

881
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,226
PROFESSOR: OK, if you use two
tokens do you end up getting?

882
00:39:09,226 --> 00:39:10,590
AUDIENCE: It's still
one space.

883
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,380
PROFESSOR: So how
did that feel?

884
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,970
AUDIENCE: It actually changed
the strategy a little bit

885
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,590
because in the beginning you
basically don't want to be the

886
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,027
person that moves first.

887
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:21,010
Because then your opponent can
just use all their tokens and

888
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,470
get a lot better than you.

889
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,720
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

890
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,590

891
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,446
GUEST SPEAKER: You may want to
talk about tokens and what it

892
00:39:28,446 --> 00:39:30,890
feels playing it ahead of
you so that you can

893
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,220
use them, you can--

894
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,372
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

895
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,815
AUDIENCE: Rather then
you just sit at the

896
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:37,790
start point every time.

897
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:40,254
AUDIENCE: So pretty much the
person who goes second?

898
00:39:40,254 --> 00:39:43,160
AUDIENCE: Is at an advantage.

899
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,620
PROFESSOR: So that should be a
negative feedback loop, which

900
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,310
we'll we get to I guess in the
next class, but the whole idea

901
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,140
being there is a gap
between players.

902
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,250
And you have game mechanics
specifically designed to

903
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,380
narrow the gap.

904
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,580
Those are negative
feedback loops.

905
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,810
AUDIENCE: Mario Kart!

906
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,730
PROFESSOR: Mario Kart's blue
shell, it's the other

907
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,540
direction right?

908
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,565
To knock back the person who's
leading rather than helping

909
00:40:07,565 --> 00:40:09,710
you catch up.

910
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,564
Actually, a lot of Mario Kart's
mechanics are basically

911
00:40:12,564 --> 00:40:14,350
designed to help reduce
the lead.

912
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,600
All right, cool.

913
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,110

914
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,680
AUDIENCE: They add one rule in
keeping everything else equal.

915
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,030
They add a second die and then
the way it worked was you

916
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,280
arbitrarily assigned people
odd or even numbers.

917
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,580
And then you roll and would go
on that particular turn.

918
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,216
And then that person,
whoever it was

919
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,030
assigned to, would play.

920
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,660
And then you would roll again to
see who would went the next

921
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,660
turn and so on and so forth?

922
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,026
PROFESSOR: How'd that feel?

923
00:40:42,026 --> 00:40:45,232

924
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:49,070
AUDIENCE: I got a tad memory
with Mario Kart.

925
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:50,320
PROFESSOR: It's like
what, again?

926
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,330

927
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:58,475
AUDIENCE: Many mechanics
describe as very Mario Kart.

928
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,840
PROFESSOR: Well, Mario Kart is
actually a collection of a lot

929
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:06,240
of fairly fundamental
mechanics.

930
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,080
AUDIENCE: I felt like just
rolling to see who'd win.

931
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,860
The sense that you were
just playing for luck.

932
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,210
PROFESSOR: So it amplified
the randomness basically?

933
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,704
AUDIENCE: Yeah, which I actually
detest personally.

934
00:41:18,704 --> 00:41:21,692

935
00:41:21,692 --> 00:41:24,606
AUDIENCE: That rule is like
initiative rule in Star Wars

936
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:25,856
Miniatures and Dungeons
and Dragons.

937
00:41:25,856 --> 00:41:27,930

938
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:31,210
And like in that case where
there's actual strategic

939
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,370
decisions to be made
it's actually cool.

940
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,820
Because it means that you never
know whether you're

941
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,780
going to be able to capitalize
on the position that you're in

942
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,750
at the end of the turn.

943
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,530
AUDIENCE: But since we both know
optimal strategy for the

944
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,748
original game it was
just pure luck.

945
00:41:46,748 --> 00:41:48,180
So there was no strategy.

946
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,680
PROFESSOR: So it almost becomes
like a gambling game

947
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,554
or a game of chance.

948
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:54,949
Cool.

949
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:58,084
AUDIENCE: They added different
dice you could roll for

950
00:41:58,084 --> 00:42:00,008
different effects.

951
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:02,894
Such as, if you roll the D20
you can go 10 spaces.

952
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,337
If you need to go 17, 18--

953
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:04,818
AUDIENCE: Or 18, 19, 20.

954
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:04,978
AUDIENCE: --

955
00:42:04,978 --> 00:42:06,742
Or 18, 19, 20.

956
00:42:06,742 --> 00:42:11,492
So they added the D10
which also had

957
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:13,384
similar effects and deviate.

958
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:16,060
So Patrick and I pretty much
experimented with-- well, he

959
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,310
just rolled D20 the
entire time.

960
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:20,820

961
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:29,855
And I experimented with rolling
the D8 and the D10.

962
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:33,030
AUDIENCE: Why would you
not roll the D10?

963
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,886
AUDIENCE: I started
feeling impatient.

964
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,315
I would forget everything
about Alec and what

965
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:38,290
he wanted to do.

966
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:40,520
And every turn I would roll
the D20 hoping to

967
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,025
get 18, 19, or 20.

968
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:44,477
AUDIENCE: By the way, with the
D20 if you don't roll any of

969
00:42:44,477 --> 00:42:46,070
those you go zero spaces.

970
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,216
So that's actually the risk.

971
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:50,940
PROFESSOR: So you could either
win the game or go nowhere.

972
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,390

973
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:55,390
AUDIENCE: So I roll the D20
wanting to get 18,19, or 20.

974
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,980
And not until I roll the 18, 19,
or 20 would I care where

975
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,592
he was on the board.

976
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,772
PROFESSOR: It's you
and the dice.

977
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:05,694
It's just you and
the randomness.

978
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:09,052

979
00:43:09,052 --> 00:43:10,302
AUDIENCE: I rolled twice too.

980
00:43:10,302 --> 00:43:13,870

981
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,090
PROFESSOR: Like what you
described earlier is that

982
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,220
whether you're behind or in
front of someone changed the

983
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,280
way that you would play in
the original version.

984
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,570
Now, no longer really matters
anymore, right?

985
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,110
It's just you and the dice.

986
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:28,104
And when the universe
loves you, you just

987
00:43:28,104 --> 00:43:28,680
automatically win.

988
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,910
AUDIENCE: The intention was to
have the D20 for when you were

989
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,530
way behind and the other
one if you were

990
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:34,950
only slightly behind.

991
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:38,310
Apparently that's not
how it was used.

992
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,090
[INAUDIBLE] design, right?

993
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,415
PROFESSOR: Well, a good example
of the aesthetic you

994
00:43:42,415 --> 00:43:44,522
were going for not being the
aesthetic that was actually

995
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:45,740
experienced.

996
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,821
So, it's still a powerful
aesthetic it's just a

997
00:43:48,821 --> 00:43:51,767
different thing than
what you planned.

998
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:53,980
I think I might have
skipped you guys?

999
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,120
Sorry about that.

1000
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,670
AUDIENCE: So their new rule
was, if you are physically

1001
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,990
ahead and you roll a six instead
of only going three

1002
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:04,220
you would go four.

1003
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,340
PROFESSOR: If you're physically
ahead and you roll

1004
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,790
a six you go?

1005
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,040
Oh, OK.

1006
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,040

1007
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1008
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,195

1009
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,950
AUDIENCE: At first, we tried
playing it in a similar way of

1010
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,750
how we did before.

1011
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,710
And it really felt like the
person who was ahead

1012
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,890
was ahead even more.

1013
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:24,785
And now everyone's rolling,
because as soon as you roll

1014
00:44:24,785 --> 00:44:26,725
you get a higher expectation
value.

1015
00:44:26,725 --> 00:44:30,490

1016
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,200
PROFESSOR: So you prefer the
low-ball luck rather than the?

1017
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,740
AUDIENCE: So the problem is if
you put a token down and they

1018
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:41,395
roll at least a one so you're
guaranteed you're

1019
00:44:41,395 --> 00:44:41,900
going to be the high.

1020
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,870
And then they have a
higher expectation.

1021
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:47,778
PROFESSOR: How does
it feel to play?

1022
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:51,400
Mathematically that's
what it means, but--

1023
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,090
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1024
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,253
AUDIENCE: Actually, in playing
the first game I don't think

1025
00:44:56,253 --> 00:44:57,500
it actually came up at all.

1026
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:03,526
AUDIENCE: And then in the second
game, I believe it did?

1027
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:06,610
And to me it didn't really
feel like it changed.

1028
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,780
AUDIENCE: For me, the entire
time I felt like the person

1029
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,460
who was ahead was more ahead.

1030
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,900
AUDIENCE: It would come up more
if your board was longer.

1031
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,114
It really encourages you
to stockpile for

1032
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:20,524
the first few turns.

1033
00:45:20,524 --> 00:45:22,934
But if you're encouraged more
than you might want to search.

1034
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:25,344
That's contrary to--

1035
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:26,910
GUEST SPEAKER: When you guys
were going over mistakes did

1036
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:29,220
you feel like it changed
your strategy?

1037
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,470
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1038
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,090

1039
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,590
AUDIENCE: It made rolling
feel like a [INAUDIBLE].

1040
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:38,060
Which was the point right?

1041
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,802
That's what you guys
were aiming for?

1042
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:42,540
AUDIENCE: The alternate rule
that we had toyed with was, if

1043
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,895
you're ahead and you put down
a token you have to roll.

1044
00:45:45,895 --> 00:45:48,250
And if you get a six you have
to move one step back.

1045
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,741
So there's a one in six chance
that there'll be a penalty for

1046
00:45:51,741 --> 00:45:52,540
[INAUDIBLE].

1047
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,453
Because precisely what you
mentioned, which is that when

1048
00:45:54,453 --> 00:45:55,436
you're ahead the dominant
strategy is

1049
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:56,300
to reduce the variance.

1050
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:57,708
So we were just playing with
stuff to make you want to roll

1051
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,190
more basically.

1052
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:08,380
PROFESSOR: OK, so dynamically
that tells you to roll more.

1053
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,700
I would say aesthetically you
have the whole Monopoly

1054
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,140
situation where the
person who's

1055
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:13,730
winning just keeps winning.

1056
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:18,240
And there are times when you
actually want that feeling.

1057
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,530
Especially when it came to the
game of Monopoly, the whole

1058
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,003
point of the game was huge
financial embarrassments.

1059
00:46:24,003 --> 00:46:26,000
And it's like, wow I have no
money and I'm just going to

1060
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,360
keep losing money.

1061
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,220
That was the point of
the game actually.

1062
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,660
That's why it's called
Monopoly.

1063
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,780
AUDIENCE: The thing about
it is, the person who's

1064
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:34,620
physically ahead may not
actually be ahead in terms of

1065
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,490
absolute game play because
the other person

1066
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,960
has stockpiled tokens.

1067
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,909
And we weren't sure whether
determining who was ahead by

1068
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:45,700
counting the tokens in the
equation or not was a better

1069
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,700
game rule if we didn't have
that type of test.

1070
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,430
PROFESSOR: Give it a
shot [INAUDIBLE].

1071
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,530
The one thing we came
up with was--

1072
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,140
at first we thought it wouldn't
change the game at

1073
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,820
all I guess.

1074
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,650
Which was basically, instead
of spending tokens to go

1075
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,786
forward two steps you spend
tokens to knock your opponent

1076
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,974
back two steps.

1077
00:47:04,974 --> 00:47:07,890
Completely changed
the game play.

1078
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:08,862
AUDIENCE: We tried that.

1079
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:10,112
It sucks.

1080
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:12,680

1081
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,280
AUDIENCE: Stock piled first and
then you knock people back

1082
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,770
so you didn't go anywhere
for the first 10 turns.

1083
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,198
And then you realize that
nothing is going to happen.

1084
00:47:20,198 --> 00:47:21,150
AUDIENCE: And then we
just kept rolling.

1085
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:24,010
AUDIENCE: Rolled the
rest of the time.

1086
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:24,860
PROFESSOR: Which is a completely
different way to

1087
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,110
play the game.

1088
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,830

1089
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,000
That whole process of
stockpiling right at the

1090
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,570
beginning is--

1091
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:33,470
sure, we could have both started
with a stack of three

1092
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,740
each because that's really what
happened three turns in.

1093
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,940
But the whole act of--

1094
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,960

1095
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,860
that felt really like,
OK clearly you're

1096
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,110
setting out to kill me.

1097
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,656

1098
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:54,800
AUDIENCE: Can you move?

1099
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,500
PROFESSOR: No, we had it so it
wouldn't be a point spending

1100
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,030
it when you're right
at the beginning.

1101
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,960
But there was that whole arms
race feel that really didn't

1102
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,210
happen the first game.

1103
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,910

1104
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:13,820
All it did really was make the
game longer, but it felt mean.

1105
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:20,060
OK, that's pretty much
it for today I guess.

1106
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,530
GUEST SPEAKER: And we need the
poker chips and all the dice

1107
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:23,054
back but you can keep the
game boards if you're

1108
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:24,304
really happy with them.

1109
00:48:24,304 --> 00:48:31,994

1110
00:48:31,994 --> 00:48:34,160
AUDIENCE: How long did this
game take you to make?

1111
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,630
GUEST SPEAKER: It took longer
to make the board

1112
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,880
than to make the rules.

1113
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,449
