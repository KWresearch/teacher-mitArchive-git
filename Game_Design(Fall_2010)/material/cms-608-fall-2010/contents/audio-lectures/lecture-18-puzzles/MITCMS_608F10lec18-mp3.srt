9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,010
PROFESSOR: Before we move on
to the rest of the topics,

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,740
maybe just some administrative
stuff about the next

11
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,470
assignment.

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,940
So the idea is to model
a system, right?

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,600
So the idea is to pick some
sort of dual system.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,690

15
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:42,100
In the past people have picked
stuff like applying for

16
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,550
college because they knew
all about that.

17
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,400
People have talked about any
type of idea, you know,

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,050
running a nuclear reactor
or something.

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,655
Specifically there's a--

20
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:59,438
but hey, any of you nuclear
science majors?--

21
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:02,070
oh, perfect.

22
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,674
One of my favorite Apple II
games was actually nuclear

23
00:01:05,674 --> 00:01:09,119
reactor simulation, and
it always melted down.

24
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,430
That's why it was fun.

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,930
But pick a real world system
to start modeling.

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,240
Obviously, you're trying
to find the fun.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,100
Obviously, you're trying to make
something that people are

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,450
going to enjoy playing.

29
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,510
But the idea is to start from
a slightly different place

30
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,590
from where we had in the
first assignment.

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,080
Now a couple of you guys already
did that for the first

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,600
assignment, though.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,490
I mean things like picking
up girls at a party.

34
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,620
You know, modeling real
systems and things.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,958
Still haven't played yet,
a genealogy game yet.

36
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,303
So, we're going to
play next March.

37
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:47,553
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

38
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:50,530

39
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,530
The survival horror game, I
would say it's not a real

40
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,565
world system.

41
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:59,466
It was a system.

42
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:02,410
Horror, wizards, trolls.

43
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,470
So, yeah, pick something within

44
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,620
games negotiating around--

45
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,220
like negotiating greenhouse gas
emissions, that was one

46
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,160
which was really, really
cutthroat.

47
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,350
That's what probably
you imagine.

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,282
Actually I'll try to get
that team to come in

49
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:23,350
later in the semester.

50
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,670
They did this and like talk
about their card game.

51
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,490
It was a freshman team
on Terrascope.

52
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,320
Let's see, On Wednesday, we're
going to do the usual

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,780
brainstorming inside of
the second half of the

54
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,310
upper-class.

55
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,912
You know, everybody throw
out your ideas.

56
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:41,110
Come in with a bunch of ideas,
we'll try to build on that.

57
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,750
But this time around you're
allowed to actually

58
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,512
pre-build your team.

59
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:48,470
You're allowed to ask people,
hey, you guys

60
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,180
want to work together?

61
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,730
You don't actually have to
figure it out on the spot if

62
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,090
you don't want to.

63
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,480
I don't really care how you do
it, as long as by Friday you

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,750
know who your team is.

65
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,540
And who's on your team.

66
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,580
Team sizes are the same.

67
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,330
So, any questions?

68
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,440
AUDIENCE: Are we allowed to
simulate things that aren't

69
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,730
from this era?

70
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, like
normal history?

71
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,070
PROFESSOR: OK, not from
like the future.

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,320
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,310

75
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm serious.

76
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,300
This is how I think
[INAUDIBLE].

77
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,590
OK, yes, absolutely there are
no historical stuff--

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,170

79
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,240
but you do have some
liberties.

80
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,510
I'm not saying that your game
has to be a faithful

81
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:34,815
simulation.

82
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,630
You can even build your model
simulation [INAUDIBLE].

83
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,930
But it doesn't have to be a
faithful simulation, that's

84
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,110
certainly a poor design.

85
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,210
But, you know, in a sense you're
trying to capture the

86
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,200
spirit of it.

87
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,880
If the point is, I'm running
a nuclear reactor.

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,123
And you can sort of capture
the, oh my God, it's so

89
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:55,954
dangerous , or the, oh my God,
it's so boring aspect of it.

90
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:58,060
Have you actually put the
nuclear reactor--

91
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,000
AUDIENCE:: Well, like,
what's there.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,230
And I know the mechanics of
it, I think, were there.

93
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,620
PROFESSOR: I have been told it's
not necessarily the most

94
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,350
exciting job in the world.

95
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,750
AUDIENCE: No, you just sit there
and do your homework.

96
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,835
And every once in a
while you look up.

97
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,510
Very reasonable.

98
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,010
And you get paid for it.

99
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,985
Like $12 or $13 an hour.

100
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:21,364
PROFESSOR: So if your whole idea
of the game is let's try

101
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,940
to get as much homework done
without letting [INAUDIBLE].

102
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,700
That might be more entertaining
than just looking

103
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,950
[INAUDIBLE].

104
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,820

105
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,725
But I got my problems in then.

106
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:37,630
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

107
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,880
You have to do [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

108
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,220

109
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

111
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,880
PROFESSOR: And besides, I think
we still have a time

112
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,950
limit, like half an hour.

113
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,390
It's not [INAUDIBLE]

114
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,550
homework, it's really
easy homework.

115
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,050
Really not homework.

116
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,300
Let's see, just a reminder for
everyone who has been falling

117
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,270
off on the foreign posts, please
make sure that you keep

118
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,980
up on your foreign posts.

119
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,030
Those things actually do
affect your grade.

120
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:15,570
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

121
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,760
one person, not one team.

122
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,610
If you have any--

123
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,910
since we're in between reading
assignments right now, you can

124
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,770
write about the assignment.

125
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,900
But if you wrote up something,
let's say a reflection on how

126
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,680
the class assignment
went, that's fine.

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,052
We're not expecting more than
one foreign post a week.

128
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,010
Of course, feel free to comment
on other people's

129
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,520
foreign posts as well.

130
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,890
If a discussion or a point has
been raised that's kind of

131
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,420
interesting, you want to kind
of develop on that.

132
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,870
Put some thought into it.

133
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,715
Write something interesting
you're going to keep on the

134
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:49,720
compilation, that counts too.

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,985
And that's fine.

00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:54,130

137
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,490
OK, so puzzles.

So Brenda's, before we start
with Brenda's, let's start

140
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,990
with Scott's.

141
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,520
What were some of the
definitions, or some of the

142
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,310
things that Scott's game was
mentioning, that were good for

143
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,810
puzzle design

144
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,810
AUDIENCE: The book or
not in the book?

145
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,310
PROFESSOR: This was
on the web page.

146
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:24,805
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

147
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:29,130
AUDIENCE: --and had
the right answer.

148
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,380
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

149
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,292

150
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:37,550
PROFESSOR: He didn't really
differentiate between puzzles

151
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,226
that could be generated like a
pseudo-GUI or something, where

152
00:06:42,226 --> 00:06:44,760
you kind of have an algorithm
that lets you

153
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,970
create multiple puzzles.

154
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:51,180
But as long as that particular
iteration had one answer.

155
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,530
So that was really there.

156
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,250
Anything else you remember?

157
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,792
AUDIENCE: Tactical difficulty.

158
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:01,555
Make it accessible but
not super easy.

159
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:03,835
I think targeting a
specific audience.

160
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:08,180
It was also the ability to
change difficulty, it was

161
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,050
dynamic difficulty.

162
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,650
So some areas may actually be
easier settings, and then

163
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,850
actually what they want to
be is harder settings.

164
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,240
PROFESSOR: I think that
was Brenda's.

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,420
But, yeah, am I wrong?

166
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,898
AUDIENCE: There's also the
distinction between types of

167
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:26,370
difficulty.

168
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,400
Things where, you know, the
letter puzzle you had at the

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,765
beginning where it requires
thinking about

170
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,960
it, figuring it out.

171
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,600
It was patients versus
something else.

172
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,365
I can't remember what
the editor used.

173
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,610
But then you have things like
mazes and locations where you

174
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,610
have to be very careful, and
separate your way through.

175
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,500
PROFESSOR: And sometimes they
bring in information from

176
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,990
other domains.

177
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,770
From outside the puzzle, it's
not just like all the

178
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,320
information that you currently
need in the puzzle.

179
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,340
But the interesting thing
about the puzzle that he

180
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,050
particularly shows, is that he
shows a range of different

181
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,530
ways to actually solve it.

182
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,720
None of which are actually
satisfying except for the

183
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,680
final answer.

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,515
Which irritated me,
I'm telling you.

185
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm not giving you
another puzzle.

186
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,440
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

187
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,060
But it's kind of interesting to
think about, actually, what

188
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,420
audience it's for those kinds
of specific puzzles.

189
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,500
I mean, there are magazines
out of there like Games

190
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,670
magazine in particular, but
sometimes you see stuff

191
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,150
nestled into magazines that
are not just about games.

192
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,177
You see stuff like crossword
puzzles in newspapers and

193
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:34,880
things like that.

194
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,260
And now things like Sudoku and
all that are way more popular

195
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,510
that are meant to be really
in mass audience.

196
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,230
Whereas a magazine that is
specifically targeted at

197
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,380
puzzle enthusiasts can
be super hardcore.

198
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,270
With puzzles through the whole
magazine then you can have a

199
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,480
whole range of different
difficulties in there.

200
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,744
The assumption that you can
solve something not so hard.

201
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:02,050
AUDIENCE: I'm kind of
interested, does anybody know

202
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,000
how people in newspapers
generate crossword puzzles and

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,940
Sudoku puzzles?

204
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,110
Does anybody know what the
actual process behind that is?

205
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,530
I mean, I can imagine
how you might do it.

206
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,730
You might start with the filled
out thing and then

207
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,815
remove bits to get
your Sudoku.

208
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:21,990
Or you might brute force,
dictionary search to come up

209
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,950
with words which fit together in
order to form a crossword.

210
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,820
AUDIENCE: What they do with
Sudoku now is, they have some

211
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,830
computer algorithm--

212
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,940
and it has scales
of difficulty--

213
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,775
and it generates a random Sudoku
puzzle from your input.

214
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:39,790
AUDIENCE: Sudoku is solved
enough that you can actually

215
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,660
just algorithmically generate
[INAUDIBLE].

216
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,360
An actual numerical
difficulty.

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,990
You scale it from 1 to 10, 10
being where where there's like

218
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,650
literally only one step
to take in each point.

219
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:58,720
AUDIENCE: The one that took them
three months to solve.

220
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,190
AUDIENCE: But like crosswords,
there's people who actually

221
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,242
just get paid to sit down
and generate those.

222
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:07,190

223
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,360
AUDIENCE: I know that Premiere
takes submissions from other

224
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,580
people and they're edited
by [INAUDIBLE].

225
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,484
And then people submit
that and he kind of

226
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:18,010
like steps it up.

227
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,660
AUDIENCE: So he kind of

228
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,710
crowdsources crossword puzzles.

229
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,070
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

230
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,890
PROFESSOR: But the difficulty
in a crossword puzzles isn't

231
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,170
just in the geometrically
how the words go.

232
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,200
The specific clues that they
give you can be more or less

233
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
obfuscated in some ways.

234
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,280
And New York Times, in
particular, is super

235
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,670
irritating with this.

236
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,760
They'll give you two words with
no grammatical context

237
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,588
about how they're supposed
to fit in.

238
00:10:47,588 --> 00:10:50,330

239
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,640
So you can actually compare it
to see how they're difficulty

240
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,230
scaling just by looking
at the clues.

241
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,044
Not even looking at
the puzzle itself.

242
00:10:59,044 --> 00:11:02,800
And I thought the other thing
about crosswords is, just to

243
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,420
bring up a point that we talked
about in the earlier

244
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,770
class, the crosswords,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

245
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,080
that these are dependent
upon the redundancy

246
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,020
of the English language.

247
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,170
You don't see every single
letter of a word in order to

248
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,330
figure out what the word is.

249
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,250
So that if it's a word that you
couldn't otherwise have

250
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,265
gotten from a clue, you can
still get just by seeing the

251
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:23,880
letters that are available.

252
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,660
Because the English language is
kind of about [INAUDIBLE],

253
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,220
redundant information.

254
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,620
If you dropped every single
vowel in a sentence, you could

255
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,522
probably still make out
what that sentence is.

256
00:11:34,522 --> 00:11:37,736
And you don't necessarily
get that with Chinese.

257
00:11:37,736 --> 00:11:40,630

258
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,365
How many folks here
have, [INAUDIBLE].

259
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:45,470
There are probably other
languages here where like

260
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:48,635
every single character means a
word or something like that.

261
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:51,116
AUDIENCE: Hebrew has
no vowels, right?

262
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:55,070
AUDIENCE: Well, they do up until
third grade and we start

263
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,140
dropping them after that.

264
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,790
So it's basically, because it
is understandable without

265
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:01,300
vowels, you eventually
just stop using them.

266
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,970
PROFESSOR: So that's
interesting.

267
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,300
If you had a crossword in
Hebrew, where you were

268
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,530
expected to write in the words
with vowels, you probably

269
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:14,433
could actually do one very
similar to an English one.

270
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,650
AUDIENCE: It's difficult because
the vowels in Hebrew

271
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,010
are attached to a letter, not
a separate character.

272
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,370
They're just down at the bottom
of the lower letter.

crossword the letter can make

a different sound in both.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

278

could be vo, or va, or

ve, you don't know.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

282
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
like "c" could be sss or ca.

283
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,320
Like a hard or soft c.

284
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,576
Or "g" could be ga or ja.

285
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:51,170
PROFESSOR: That is true, but
although in English in

286
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:56,110
particular the phonetic meaning,
the way how a certain

287
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,397
word is pronounced isn't
necessarily essential for

solving a crossword puzzle.

289
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,520
Unless the clues happen
to be phonetic clues.

290
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,710
You know, sounds like a fish.

to play when it comes to

earlier about Sudoku.

JASON: It was a comment about
the algorithmic [INAUDIBLE].

296
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,773
PROFESSOR: Also, one thing
about algorithmic, about

297
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:27,310
Sudoku difficulty, a lot of
it comes from the selected

298
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,875
removal of numbers.

299
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,770
There's not what is the final
pattern going to look like

300
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,520
that's actually the
difficulty.

301
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,660
It's how do we remove the
numbers in a way that gives

302
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,900
multiple possible answers or
multiple possible dead ends,

303
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,690
because really there's
only one solution.

304
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,420
I'm not actually familiar
with the algorithm with

305
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,200
which it does so.

306
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,880
But it seems to be very clear
that there are at least two

307
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,130
algorithms.

308
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,910
One of which is very easy,
which is just provide a

309
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,080
legitimate Sudoku solution.

310
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,280
And then the one that is
slightly harder is now which

311
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,760
number is to be removed so
that's it's still solvable.

312

all played Picross?

Someone want to describe it
for the folks who aren't

familiar with it?

sure.

one works better.

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,600
I remember green is
better than black.

with the [INAUDIBLE]

323
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:34,710

324
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,012
AUDIENCE:: Sorry to put you on
the spot Nick, as always.

325
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:40,788
NICK: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

326
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:45,324
Here you'll have
written poems.

327
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:49,992
And then they all have something
[INAUDIBLE].

328
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,560
AUDIENCE: Oh, this.

329
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,560

330
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,288
This one where you spell
in the blocks.

331
00:14:57,288 --> 00:15:01,610
NICK: And then given bits of
information, we have to work

332
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,063
out which of these blocks
is built and

333
00:15:04,063 --> 00:15:05,460
which can be removed.

334
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,340
So the idea is the number tells
you the number of blocks

335
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,285
in that row or column which
has a filled block in it.

336
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:19,060
So in this case, nothing
is in it's column.

337
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,562
This column and that column
have nothing in it.

338
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:27,936
And this is probably not
actually a very good example

339
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:31,270
because I just pulled the
numbers out of my head.

340
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,410
AUDIENCE: Then you have the
sums are not the same.

341
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,160
NICK: So it's not going to work,
but you get the idea.

342
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,800
And things can get more
complicated, traditionally

343
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,055
there's just, I think,
three that are names.

344
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,533
That's there a connected
block of three.

345
00:15:45,533 --> 00:15:48,431
So, for instance, this,
that, and that.

346
00:15:48,431 --> 00:15:49,710
And I thought it had
to be broken.

347
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,515
But if there's a three which,
I think, is in a square or

348
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:56,025
something along these lines,
that means there are three in

349
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:56,940
that column.

350
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,480
But there's a gap in
there somewhere.

351
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,360
And then if it's like a three
inch circle or something else

352
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,820
complicated like that.

353
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,650
Then that means that there are
three but they all have gaps

354
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,732
between them.

355
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:09,335
AUDIENCE: But I've also seen
versions where they have just

356
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,760
a list of numbers.

357
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,470
And those are the--

358
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,072
there are [INAUDIBLE] blocks
of that length.

359
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:19,000
PROFESSOR: So if there's four in
a column you might say two,

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,020
three, five.

361
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Which means there is a block of
two, followed by a block of

362
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,674
three, followed by
a block of five.

363
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,884
AUDIENCE: And they have to
have a gap between them.

364
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,390
PROFESSOR: And they will have to
have a gap in between them.

365
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,413
So it's not like you can
actually get a block of eight

366
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:29,965
in there somewhere.

367
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:35,420
But the whole idea is that
you've got this information

368
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,021
that is actually redundant.

369
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,598
You've got more information in
there than you necessarily

370
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,001
need to be able to figure out
which box and the situation to

371
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:43,604
be filled in.

372
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:45,185
Whether this should be empty.

373
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:48,635
But it's presented to you
in this obfuscated way.

374
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:52,630
The evidence, the clues that are
given to you in a way that

375
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,750
requires you to perform these
algorithms in order to figure

376
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,840
out which ones should
be changed.

377
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,380
And usually that's an algorithm

378
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,070
you can use to solve.

379
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:03,960
Although, I think Kim was the
one that was talking about

380
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,210
pattern matching.

381
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,470

382
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,434
But eventually as you get good
at these things, you start to

383
00:17:11,434 --> 00:17:13,505
recognize patterns
right of the bat.

384
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,270
Like, that's a zero.

385
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,800
So that entire row is empty.

386
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,612
That's the sort of thing
that I do that becomes

387
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:20,862
automatic for you.

388
00:17:20,862 --> 00:17:25,645

389
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,210
AUDIENCE: So, let's see.

390
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,490
I don't have much left more to
talk about Scott [INAUDIBLE].

391
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,884
Now these are, these are
more generated stuff.

392
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,880
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

393
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,750
So this basically is along the
lines of what Scott [? Pim ?]

394
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,040
is talking about.

395
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,613
But obviously this is more
physical not the pen and paper

396
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:51,084
kind of thing.

397
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,968
AUDIENCE: Will you
print up a copy?

398
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:54,852
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
want the copy?

399
00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:58,080
No, because I just want
you to look at this.

400
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,336
Look at this first, don't
look at that.

401
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:02,135
Don't look at that.

402
00:18:02,135 --> 00:18:06,390
So the basic idea is, let me
just start with one, you get a

403
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,455
card that is actually
a puzzle.

404
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,245
I wish we were doing these
outside now, because we're

405
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,240
going to zoom this out.

406
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,670
But the puzzle basically just
tells you how you are supposed

407
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,620
to set up your board
initially.

408
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,010
So, there's a-- oops
wrong [INAUDIBLE].

409
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,490
There's a green guy there.

410
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,960
There's a green guy there.

411
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,690
This is supposed to be an easy
puzzle, I hope it is.

412
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:32,028
Because I'm getting
bad at this.

413
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:35,352
Red guy go to [INAUDIBLE]

414
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:36,530
I think.

415
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,000
Yeah, and that's the puzzle.

416
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,850
And there's one little
square on it, and

417
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,130
that you have to check.

418
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,340

419
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,700
So the basic idea is you
tip over the pieces so

420
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,740
that the guy moves.

421
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,160
And you don't want to be tipping
over the pieces in a

422
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,180
way where the white guy
can't move anymore.

423
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,540

424
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so you're
tipping over things to make a

425
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,980
path that he can walk
along, right.

426
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,830
AUDIENCE: If I make a
closed loop, he has

427
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,480
to touch every piece?

428
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,520
AUDIENCE: I think he just
has to get to this one.

429
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you have
to get to the red one.

430
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,590
AUDIENCE: There's a plus mark.

433
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,220
PROFESSOR: I'm not exactly sure
how to solve this one.

434
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,370
AUDIENCE: Yellow that way,
green, yellow that way.

435
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,032
AUDIENCE: Wait, you're allowed
to tip him over?

436
00:19:32,032 --> 00:19:33,330
How do you die?

437
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,570
PROFESSOR: My understanding is
that he needs to fall onto

438
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,370
another piece, actually.

439
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,905
So let me just confirm I set
this up right, actually.

440
00:19:40,905 --> 00:19:41,690
Yeah, I did.

441
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,680
AUDIENCE: No, so you push
the yellow that way.

442
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,780
And then the green that way.

443
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,760
And the other green that way.

444
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,680
AUDIENCE: So put the
yellow ones first?

445
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,140
AUDIENCE: So do the
green ones first.

446
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,970
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I don't
actually have the

447
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,218

to move on anything

that's contiguously connected.

455
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,770
So, as long as you can
continuously connect up to

this, you're fine.

now, if you tip that.

them over means more brown

then you can't reach

the red after it.

467
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,220
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I am absolutely
sure it means that

468
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,770
you're supposed to tip it
over in a way that--

00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,503
You can actually do it.

483
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,750
PROFESSOR: But, you know, this
is not entirely unlike the

484
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,020
kind of puzzle that
Scott does.

485
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,860
I mean, sure, this is one
particular piece of plastic

486
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,570
that the game is designed
to work with.

487
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,735
But basically it's just
like a book, right?

488
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:35,120
It's like a book of puzzles.

489
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,095
So there are also solutions in
here, but I find the solutions

490
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,873
harder to read.

491
00:21:41,873 --> 00:21:43,040
AUDIENCE: The [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

492
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,825
was in the book.

493
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:45,800
PROFESSOR: It was in
Brenda's book?

494
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

495
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,700
PROFESSOR: So, actually, that's
probably a good excuse

496
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,380
to switch over to Brenda's.

497
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,102
Well, actually, before
that I want to take

498
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:57,706
a look at the tangrams.

499
00:21:57,706 --> 00:21:58,956
Everyone play the tangrams?

500
00:21:58,956 --> 00:22:02,100

501
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,808
So, the basic idea is you've
got these shapes.

502
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:08,055
Does this one get
in, like this?

503
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:13,980
You've got these shapes, and if
you assemble them right as

504
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,950
is usually described on the
side of the box somewhere.

505
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,420
Where the heck?

506
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
AUDIENCE: It's on the inside.

507
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,040
PROFESSOR: I've got a big
picture on the side.

508
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,430
Is that you can actually fit
all of these shapes inside

509
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,530
that square.

510
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,472
So these are basically just a
square that's been divided in

511
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,530
a specific way.

512
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:41,820
So once I've got this assembled
everyone can just

513
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,142
pass this around.

514
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:47,370
Anyone who has already seen
it can pass it on.

515
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:51,080
That one doesn't fit very
well, but it works.

516
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,480
Hey, that's, ta da.

517
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,110
OK, so this is the basic side.

518
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,690

519
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,410
Now this is how it's been sold,
at least, is that this

520
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,730
is actually a calendar.

521
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,260
So every day you get
a different shape.

522
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,200
It's a cute little thing.

523
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,780
It's a pretty rudimentary
geometrical shape.

524
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,035
Some of them have, I think
this is supposed to be a

525
00:23:15,035 --> 00:23:16,340
sphynx or something.

526
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,164
It looks like a frog.

527
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,108
This looks like a
Pac Man thing.

528
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:30,460

529
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,455
So the idea is that you
rearrange those particular

530
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,780
shapes into all of these
different shapes.

531
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:44,260
And you could play the game
without getting these puzzle

532
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,970
solutions, right?

533
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,770
And it talks a lot about, if
you've got a toy that's worth

534
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,408
playing with, you've got the
beginning of something that

535
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:52,650
might make a good game.

536
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:52,818
The nice thing about tipover
is that it's kind of fun to

537
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:54,068
tip over things.

538
00:23:54,068 --> 00:23:56,850

539
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,435
And the thing about tangrams
is that I actually had more

540
00:23:59,435 --> 00:24:01,260
fun playing with tangrams than
trying to solve specific

541
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,440
problems just by just trying
to rearrange these.

542
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,210
Who hasn't seen these before?

543
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,750
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

544
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,580
AUDIENCE: Kind of
embarrassing.

545
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,420
AUDIENCE: You should be
ashamed of yourself.

546
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,936
And all the work that
you did is gone.

547
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:19,212

548
00:24:19,212 --> 00:24:22,600
PROFESSOR: But the thing is,
as a toy it doesn't really

549
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,140
matter, right?

550
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,940
Because it's just a certain
piece of anything.

551
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,785
And you kind of want to take it
apart and make new shapes

552
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,860
with it, like a little house.

553
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:38,260
So if you've got something
that's kind of fun to fiddle

554
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,960
with to begin with, you've got
possibly the beginning of a

555
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,552
game in general.

556
00:24:43,552 --> 00:24:47,120
But the way how Scott was
talking about it, there's this

557
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,490
intermediate step where
it's a puzzle.

558
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,940
It's a toy with a specific
solution that you're

559
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,820
trying to get to.

560
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,330
And a game is kind of one step
beyond that where now there is

561
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,010
multiple solutions
and competitive.

562
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,420
At least, that's how
he's describing it.

563
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,866
He's not really a
game theorist.

564
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:03,830
He just works with puzzles.

565
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,070
AUDIENCE: He talks about it
in terms of a goal, right?

566
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,910
So then with a toy that you
don't have a goal with them.

567
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,910
With a puzzle, you have one
goal with no interaction.

568
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,330
And then a game is
with interaction.

569
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,120
PROFESSOR: And possibly multiple
goals as well.

570
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,190
But again it becomes more and
more directed as toys

571
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,310
are very free form.

572
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,680
So there are people who describe
games, like the Sims

573
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,490
for instance, as
actually toys.

574
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,300
In the same way that you
describe a doll house as a

575
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,760
toy, they're saying it's kind of
like a digital doll house.

576
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,010
But later versions of the
Sims added more and

577
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:37,980
more specific goals.

578
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,090
Like now you have to throw a
party with at least five

579
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,490
people in it.

580
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,440
Or you have to attain
career level five or

581
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,468
something like that.

582
00:25:47,468 --> 00:25:50,744
I can't remember exactly
how they measured it.

583
00:25:50,744 --> 00:25:53,170
But that kind of has a goal.

584
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,585
We are going to give more and
more specific things for you

585
00:25:55,585 --> 00:25:56,420
to work towards.

586
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,320
But the Sims is very careful
not to lose it's toy sense.

587
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,760
This adds up.

588
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,983
If you really want to just dick
around with these guys,

589
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,530
go right ahead.

590
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,540
Just play around with them
and see what happens.

591
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:15,280
AUDIENCE: Why is there a
distinction for physical

592
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,830
objects between toys and games,
but for like video

593
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,700
games-- like Mindcraft it is
technically still a game but--

594
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,880
PROFESSOR: It kind of
has different modes.

595
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,330
Yeah.

596
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,400
AUDIENCE: I guess it has
different modes, but it's more

597
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:26,890
of a toy, I think.

598
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:30,020
PROFESSOR: I would say that's
entirely marketing.

599
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:34,170
The only reason is people
haven't figured out how to

600
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,570
sell digital toys.

601
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:41,380
And there are games aisles in
like Best Buy and so, well,

602
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,160
this is a fun thing we're
going to put it

603
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,210
into the game section.

604
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,310
Everyone starts calling
it games.

605
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,980
And that's kind of the same
thing with the Sims.

606
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,800
It's that really the Sims should
be it's own genre, but

607
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,066
you can't sell it's own
genre that well.

608
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:53,316
[INAUDIBLE]

609
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:55,890

610
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,324
Was there a hand over here?

611
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,680

612
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,120
OK, so let's start
with Brenda's--

613
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,760

614
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,996
if it stops reading, so let's
just move on to Brenda's.

615
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:14,790
And she's very specific about
the kinds of puzzles that

616
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,530
she's talking about.

617
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,950
Is that these things that get in
the way of a very specific

618
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,690
narrative experience
that a game wants

619
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,070
to guide you through.

620
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,950
She describes them more as
roadblocks than anything else.

621
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,180
But, you know, things to make
the challenge higher, but

622
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,150
possibly so high that no
one is going to be

623
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:35,010
able to get past them.

624
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,307
Some of her examples are things
that come up as, sort

625
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:40,450
of, intermittent but optional
mechanics like

626
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,140
hacking in Bio Shop.

627
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,450
And sometimes there are things
that you have to solve,

628
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,445
especially in adventure games.

629
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,690
There's this, you have to
combine this object with that

630
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,050
object and bring it to
a specific location.

631
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:58,407
And then now you can proceed
with whatever narrative

632
00:27:58,407 --> 00:27:58,896
they've got.

633
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:04,350
AUDIENCE: She had this specific
axe to grind against

634
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,675
puzzles having meaningful
rewards or not being

635
00:28:07,675 --> 00:28:08,560
completely bought in.

636
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,200
So, for instance, she says you
should never have a puzzle

637
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,320
being required to open a door.

638
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,300
She said, solve a puzzle and
then get some kind of tangible

639
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,510
reward like loot or something.

640
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,240
This is after I just spent the
bus ride to New York City

641
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,570
playing Professor Layton's.

642
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,450

643
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,278
Which was nonstop, with on the
door, it's got a lock on it,

644
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,528
looks like a puzzle.

645
00:28:33,528 --> 00:28:36,030

646
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,792
So I wasn't entirely to sure
what to make of that.

647
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:41,210
I thought that my Professor
Layton experience was fine,

648
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:45,510
and I didn't need to get fat
Layton loot from some

649
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,470
[INAUDIBLE].

650
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:50,760
PROFESSOR: That's actually
something, and there's a

651
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,140
really good article actually
written by

652
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,250
Clara over in our lab.

653
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,255
Actually, it wasn't an article,
it was the transcript

654
00:28:58,255 --> 00:29:00,700
of a talk that she gave
at Austin University--

655
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,760
I'll send on the link
to everyone--

656
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,650
about how you can integrate, and
why you should integrate,

657
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,260
puzzles really, really well
into the narrative.

658
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:11,040
It's like really why is there
a puzzle in your game at all

659
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,470
unless it's been integrated
into the narrative?

660
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:18,750
And Brenda seems to be, sort
of, providing a cautionary

661
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,990
tale of the--

662
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,570
But if you do it badly, no one
can get on with the story.

663
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:25,150
No one can enjoy the
rest of the game.

664
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,770
It becomes this one thing that
prevents you from proceeding?

665
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,260
Is there anyone who
had that moment?

666
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,530
Yeah.

667
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:33,748
AUDIENCE: About five
minutes into Mist.

668
00:29:33,748 --> 00:29:43,330

669
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,270
I don't know.

670
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:47,770
It had some sort of cool live
action video and stuff.

671
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,810
And it looked like it could
be an interesting story.

672
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,594
That's kind using technological
prowess of

673
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:54,050
integrating video into 3D.

674
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,396
And then suddenly I looked
in to the picture

675
00:29:56,396 --> 00:29:57,322
and I was on an island.

676
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:59,637
And then there was nothing
happening and I had to turn

677
00:29:59,637 --> 00:30:00,563
things to face each other.

678
00:30:00,563 --> 00:30:04,070
And I couldn't figure it out.

679
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,620
AUDIENCE: When I originally
played The Legend of Zelda.

680
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,730
The original one.

681
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,960
So they don't tell you
anything pretty much.

682
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,620
And so the temples, you just
walk around the sun, then it's

683
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,850
like, OK, there's a
tree and a forest.

684
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,580
You're supposed to
burn [INAUDIBLE]

685
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,070
and there's the entrance to
this temple that you can't

686
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,350
proceed until you
do this thing.

687
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,750
And so, it's just like, how am
I supposed to know that I'm

688
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,720
supposed to burn this particular
tree in the middle

689
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,750
of this huge map?

690
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,230
PROFESSOR: Did you beat
any of the other--

691
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,340
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and they
didn't say anything.

692
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,320
PROFESSOR: No, I mean
the other Zeldas?

693
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, actually
yesterday we [INAUDIBLE].

694
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,660

695
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,510
AUDIENCE: I was just saying,
so the interesting thing is

696
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,096
most people nowadays they end
up playing, like the Ocarina

697
00:30:54,096 --> 00:30:56,740
of Time, Majora's Mask, they
are moving backwards.

698
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,115
So they end up playing the
first Zelda after having

699
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,470
played these old ones.

700
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,610
So you sort of know that you're
expected to do these

701
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,520
random things to get
like across.

702
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,670
So I feel like it's easier
for people, but then--

703
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,490
AUDIENCE: But with the
original Zelda--

704
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,086
you know how in new ones they
have, let's say, a wall that

705
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:14,840
you can blow up.

706
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,150
It's discolored or something.

707
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,510
In this one every tree looks
exactly the same.

708
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,840
They use the same stripes.

709
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,760
AUDIENCE: If I remember
correctly, though, it's placed

710
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,920
such that it's in the center
of your screen, right?

711
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,475
So it does look a little
bit different.

712
00:31:28,475 --> 00:31:31,450
AUDIENCE: No, it was
just a random tree.

713
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,830
It was just a whole
bunch of trees.

714
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,520
And so you just really have to
get, whatever a type of thing

715
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,010
to burn it-- a specific one--

716
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,390
and burn it.

717
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,630
AUDIENCE: I remember it was
a little suspicious.

718
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:51,510
Because I think there was a one
tile column, you kind of

719
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,180
navigate around just
this loop.

720
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,350
You just entered and--

721
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,506
AUDIENCE: That's suspicious.

722
00:31:57,506 --> 00:32:02,470
AUDIENCE: And I'll feel very
frustrated by games that

723
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,830
require walk-throughs in
order to play them.

724
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:07,720
PROFESSOR: Sure, and that was
the other thing that she

725
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,230
suggested some game
designers do.

726
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,480
They put the solution
in the Prima Guide.

727
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,485
So that you have to buy the
Prima Guide in order to

728
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:16,880
[INAUDIBLE].

729
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,890
AUDIENCE: Does Prima have
a deal with the--

730
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,550
PROFESSOR: Oh, they must have.

731
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:26,786
AUDIENCE: They say "official"
on the top for a reason.

732
00:32:26,786 --> 00:32:31,470
AUDIENCE: It's also ironic,
because modern Zelda games,

733
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,520
it's very obvious that you have
to use this or that item.

734
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,625
AUDIENCE: You've got a key.

735
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:36,270
Use this key to open.

736
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,110
AUDIENCE: Oh, you got this
item in the dungeon.

737
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:40,640
You have to use this item
to kill the boss.

738
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,480
That sort of thing.

739
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,950
It's blatant.

740
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,940
AUDIENCE: Well, for people who
are really, really hopeless,

741
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,930
there's that little fairy.

742
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,688
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

743
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:55,300
PROFESSOR: They're usually less
useful than you think.

744
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,590
So one big difference between
the old Zelda games and the

745
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,380
new Zelda games is just this
continual refinement in their

746
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,970
user interface.

747
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:09,880
And it goes all the way from
little things like the notes

748
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,650
that you hear when you
find a new dungeon.

749
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:16,462
And exactly when, precisely,
you hear the sound of, you

750
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,201
know, too da loo--

751
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,943
at least I think that's
how it sounds.

752
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:25,080
You know, as a clue that now
you have opened a door.

753
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,600
That's one of those things
that, if you look at post

754
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,030
[INAUDIBLE]

755
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,950
Ocarina of Time.

756
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,090
I think there's a couple on
Gamasutra, exactly when that

757
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,367
sounds plays is a decision
that was

758
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,920
very carefully designed.

759
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,750
And it seems to me that in
digital puzzles those kinds

760
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,620
of, especially in some sort of
narrative structure like in

761
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,680
Ocarina, that's the big problem

762
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,470
that you have to solve.

763
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,660
You have to give enough clues.

764
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,880
You have to give enough
UI feedback.

765
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,600
And you have to think about your
UI so hard in a way that

766
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,190
is going to make it possible
so that we get all the

767
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:56,910
information [INAUDIBLE].

768
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,580
So, say that burning fire tree
situation, if there is nowhere

769
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,615
else in the world where you can
get that information, then

770
00:34:04,615 --> 00:34:05,690
it's back inside puzzle.

771
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,010
If there is a guy in--

772
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,850
I can't remember Zelda I--

773
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,699
but there is a guy who actually
tells you that that's

774
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,949
the tree that you
need to burn.

775
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,627
But if it's not obvious,
especially for someone who

776
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,730
hasn't encountered that guy,
that that's where you get that

777
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,750
information it's still a
bad designed puzzle.

778
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,260
Even though now there's
a solution.

779
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,000
But thinking about, and some
examples will be in a lot of

780
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,645
tech space adventures as well
as text heavy graphical

781
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:31,610
adventures.

782
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,260
You have a, I can't solve this
puzzle, but what my character

783
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,090
says to the player about why you
can't solve the puzzle is

784
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,250
itself a clue.

785
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,218
It's like, hm, I must not
have the right item.

786
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:46,110
Maybe there's something
else I can use.

787
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:48,016
That's a huge clue.

788
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:50,553
AUDIENCE: I feel like digital
popular games have gotten

789
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:56,120
really good at integrating hint
systems in recent years.

790
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,420
But I can't think of any
physical puzzles that I've

791
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,465
come across that may just not
have quite been up to speed

792
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:06,685
with crossword puzzles.

793
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:11,690
That have that kind of not
totally revealing the solution

794
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,002
but giving you a gradual
hint which can help

795
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:15,496
you figure it out.

796
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:20,560
AUDIENCE: Well, mystery puzzles
kind of do that.

797
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,810
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

798
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,930

799
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,515
PROFESSOR: Describe the mystery
puzzle for folks who

800
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:26,920
don't have--

801
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,740
AUDIENCE: It's basically, it's
a competition run by MIT over

802
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,890
IAP where teams of people
compete to solve a bunch of

803
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,085
puzzles, like 70 puzzles, that
kind of build on each other.

804
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:40,310
So you have, say,
20 base puzzles.

805
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,947
And if you solve those
20 puzzles you

806
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:43,255
get 20 words as solutions.

807
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:45,860
And then those 20 words become
a new puzzle, and that's the

808
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,790
meta-puzzle.

809
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,460
And it kind of keeps them like
that for a couple layers.

810
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,770
But the point is the winning
team from the previous year

811
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,950
writes the next year's
mystery hunt.

812
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,310
So you get all kinds of varying
puzzles of varying

813
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:57,610
difficulties and styles.

814
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,060
A very well-designed puzzle
actually does that, because

815
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,530
you have this thing
called, flavor--

816
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,840
Oh, I guess I should say that
the puzzles aren't like Sudoku

817
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,300
or crosswords.

818
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,730
You literally just get something
on a screen or

819
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,580
something on a piece of paper,
and you have to figure out

820
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,190
what to do with it.

821
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,861
You're not given any
instructions for how to solve

822
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:12,750
it whatsoever.

823
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,780
And the only clues you get are
either by the title of the

824
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,970
puzzle, by the group of puzzles
that it's in, or by

825
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:20,610
this thing called flavor text.

826
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,480
Which is like, they say some
kind of random phrase that

827
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,360
seems to not have anything
to do with anything.

828
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,140
But that kind of gives you a
clue about what to do in the

829
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,846
thick of this puzzle.

830
00:36:29,846 --> 00:36:31,680
So that's kind of like what
you were describing.

831
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,380
AUDIENCE: That's interesting,
because it's really

832
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,022
challenging when you don't have
any mechanism for giving

833
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:39,860
feedback to the person who
is working a puzzle.

834
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,860
In Zelda, or what have you, you
can see that they've spent

835
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,410
a long time dicking around.

836
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,551
PROFESSOR: It's kind of a
double-edged sword, in that

837
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:51,380
particular case, because you
have so many mechanisms and

838
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:57,050
now you're expected to use all
of them in a game like that.

839
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,386
You use sound, you have to use
contextual buttons, you have

840
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,896
to use the inventory.

841
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:06,180
The position of the player
matters or something.

842
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,182
I've seen games where the main
clues is what is the character

843
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:11,270
looking at, for instance.

844
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,333
And you walk around, why does my
character keep looking that

845
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,660
way every time something
happens?

846
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:15,750
Oh, that's because--

847
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,470
you know.

848
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,490
So, yeah, as far as of a lot of
physical stuff, I would say

849
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:26,120
that one of the reasons is
they're just starting to build

850
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,420
these physical games
from toys.

851
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,080

852
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,490
A lot of the importance is,
a lot of things you could

853
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,650
possibly do, are kind of built
into the physical object.

854
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,650
And if you're building a puzzle
based on what you could

855
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:44,920
do with these things as a toy,
then you're necessarily

856
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,772
already using the constraints of
what you can do with it as

857
00:37:48,772 --> 00:37:52,546
a toy in order to create
the puzzle.

858
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,480

859
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,080
This might be a good exercise
actually, if time--

860
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,490
we could take a shot at this.

861
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,930
And just by, you know, trying
to come up with

862
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,080
a puzzle and see.

863
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,870
But instead of imagining one
in a digital space, try to

864
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,620
imagine one in a
physical space.

865
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,680
Because I suspect what you
actually get is, you get a

866
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,880
free language with
physical puzzles.

867
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,998
Because things physically have
interactions that we

868
00:38:18,998 --> 00:38:21,413
[INAUDIBLE] from a
digital puzzle.

869
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:26,170
ADAM: I feel like Coral Reef
or something, and that's a

870
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,770
game where like the puzzle--

871
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,480
I mean obviously it's still a
digital game-- but the puzzles

872
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,610
are very much physical
puzzles.

873
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:37,310
Like you kind of have
an idea about what--

874
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,940
has Patrick played Portal,
of course?

875
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,390
Or know the idea?

876
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:46,540
I mean, you have these two
portals and you understand

877
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,310
what the physics is
going to be like.

878
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,590
So the puzzles aren't
frustrating in the sense that

879
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,635
it's like, oh, you realize
there's this

880
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:53,420
random statue here.

881
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:56,610
And if you pull the lever it
raises the water level or

882
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,680
something like that.

883
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,610
But it's very intuitive.

884
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,800
It feels like a physical puzzle
in a sense that I know

885
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,900
what will happen if I do this.

886
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,470
And I just figure out how to
put the pieces together.

887
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,290
And also Portal what I think it
does a really good job of,

888
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,720
as well as some physical
puzzles do, is having a

889
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,545
learning curve.

890
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:20,430
Like Tangram will have some
basic puzzles, or I'm sure the

891
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,691
falling thing, a lot
of them do it.

892
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:25,255
Physical puzzle things where you
like, I don't know, how to

893
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:28,240
jump over pieces or whatever,
have basic levels--

894
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,260
basic boards--

895
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,810
where they show you various
techniques.

896
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:34,410
And you only have to figure out
one technique, and it's

897
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,460
very obvious what
you have to do.

898
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,530
And later on you have to
use those techniques.

899
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,530
PROFESSOR: Well in Tickle Her,
this particular example does

900
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,520
something that multiple portals
does really well.

901
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,710
Is that the very first puzzle
that we did earlier only has

902
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,650
one solution.

903
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,185
And you do not get that solution
unless you understand

904
00:39:50,185 --> 00:39:51,550
all the mechanics of the game.

905
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,110
But we tried to solve
it a whole bunch

906
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,430
of different times.

907
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,220
And it's like because we didn't
quite understand the

908
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,868
rules, we couldn't get it
until we understood the

909
00:39:57,868 --> 00:39:58,760
mechanics of the game.

910
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,150
Now we can suddenly solve it.

911
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,767
So from puzzle number two
onwards, we can't be confident

912
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,138
unless you know it.

913
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:06,970
Portal, and even--

914
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,210
actually just about any
well-designed game-- but I

915
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,160
would say Portal is a fine
example-- if you've beaten a

916
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,490
game, you can play through the
game again with developer

917
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,640
commentary.

918
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,780
And when you show that, you
actually realize that every

919
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,070
single fairly intuitive physical
thing that you pick

920
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,490
up in the game had to
be taught to you.

921
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,700
And they've designed the
level very clearly.

922
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,920
So right in the beginning of
the game, if folks can't

923
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,950
remember, you're trapped
in the middle cell.

924
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:41,410
And the GlaDOS talk to you, and
a portal opens and you can

925
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:42,230
walk through it.

926
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,935
What do you see out of the
first portal that opens?

927
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:46,830
AUDIENCE: You see yourself
going into the other one.

928
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,800
PROFESSOR: You see
yourself going

929
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,720
through the other portal.

930
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,180
And it's like, they force you
to have to look at what the

931
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,390
basic game mechanic is going
to be before you can do

932
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:57,580
anything else that's productive
in the game.

933
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,440
You know, you can pick
up the radio, but--

934
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,230

935
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,130
So that was a design decision.

936
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,860
They could have decided
not to make it.

937
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,690
They could have just made you
go through that into a

938
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,130
different room, and the learning
opportunity would

939
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,050
have dissolved right there.

940
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,335
So if you've got a copy of
Portal, I would suggest go

941
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:21,490
back and page through
the commentaries

942
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,670
because they are hilarious.

943
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,350
And you're also rereading good
form, demonstrating in this

944
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:30,390
room, this is what we had
to do in order to

945
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,025
make people get it.

946
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:35,490
I'm also thinking of games like
Mario World I where you

947
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,332
don't get very far on
this kind of basic

948
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,020
game mechanics now.

949
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,682
But they make it really gentle
in that I don't think there

950
00:41:44,682 --> 00:41:47,880
are any hits that instantly
kill you.

951
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,340
AUDIENCE: That's exactly what
I was thinking in Mario.

952
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,195
In the first Gamasutra article
we read on late-game

953
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:56,042
abstractions, we read
about a Mario world.

954
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:59,444
He's like, we expect the same
kind of actions, key the

955
00:41:59,444 --> 00:42:00,902
system, all the time-jumping.

956
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:03,818
And I guess you can kind of
look at different things

957
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:04,790
there, like double-jumping.

958
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,248
And things like that in
a specific puzzle.

959
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:08,010
And the physical [INAUDIBLE]
also.

960
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,380
PROFESSOR: I mean a lot of
Mario's worlds are laid out

961
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,980
basically as spatial
puzzles, right?

962
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,680
It's like you know you have to
get there, but you don't know

963
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,075
exactly how you're going to use
all of the mechanics that

964
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:19,844
you've got.

965
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:25,220
AUDIENCE: In Mario 64, I think
their way of solving the

966
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,355
impasse problem of not locking
up all the content in the game

967
00:42:28,355 --> 00:42:30,520
because of the one puzzle you
can't get, they're giving you

968
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,680
so much to do that even if they
don't really tell you--

969
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,106
even if a good 30%, 40% are
going to remain mysterious to

970
00:42:36,106 --> 00:42:38,050
you, you're not really going
to figure them out--

971
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,800
there's so much [INAUDIBLE]
between, you never walked off

972
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,106
with a significant amount
of content.

973
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:45,170
PROFESSOR: So if you've got a
hub-like structure you can do

974
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:48,360
any one of five different things
at any given time.

975
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,960
Plus you have some secondary
solutions, like you can always

976
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,450
go back to a world that you've
been to before and try to

977
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,780
collect all the stars,
for instance.

978
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,700
I think that's kind of what
Brenda was kind of indicating.

979
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,630
You don't necessarily want, if
you're putting puzzles in your

980
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,870
game, she was advocating for--

981
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,860
Brenda and Ian were
advocating for--

982
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:13,160
something that wouldn't
necessarily progress

983
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,390
on to the next one.

984
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:20,220
But I think that's not
a requirement.

985
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,400
I think that's a, if you want to
make your life easier, this

986
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,225
is what you do.

987
00:43:24,225 --> 00:43:27,600
If you decide that you're up to
the task, you can achieve

988
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,980
some really amazing effects
by having your puzzles

989
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,075
narratively incorporate it.

990
00:43:33,075 --> 00:43:36,340

991
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,840
Has anyone heard of the game
called Eternal Darkness?

992
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:44,235
It's a sort of Lovecraftian
horror game on the GameCube.

993
00:43:44,235 --> 00:43:47,200
I'll sort of describe it, but
basically the whole basic idea

994
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,180
is that you have four gods all
warring against each other.

995
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,450
Three of them hate one of them,
but then those three

996
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,480
also hate each other.

997
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,750
And most of the puzzles are
just sort of understanding

998
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,010
that there is this
mystical object.

999
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:06,310
One god defeats another god
defeats another god in a rock,

1000
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,300
paper, scissors circle.

1001
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,500
And all of them hate this
one other [INAUDIBLE].

1002
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,900
So early on in the game there
is actually a puzzle, there

1003
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,100
are actually a number of
different puzzles, where you

1004
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,020
see the symbols of these gods.

1005
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,602
And you have to kind
of rearrange them

1006
00:44:19,602 --> 00:44:21,190
in the correct order.

1007
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,800
And the rest of the game is all
going to be variations of

1008
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,320
understanding what these
gods do to each other.

1009
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,000
So those are all puzzles
that inform you of

1010
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,132
how the world works.

1011
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,640
And that kind of works
in two ways.

1012
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,195
One, information that you've
already gathered about the

1013
00:44:37,195 --> 00:44:39,390
world-- about how this
world works--

1014
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:42,390
gives you clues on how
to beat the puzzles.

1015
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,650
Beating the puzzles, finding the
solutions for the clues,

1016
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,810
gives you information about
how the world works.

1017
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,740
And that's kind of like the
holy grail for a puzzle

1018
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,710
designer in a digital game, is
that you're going to design a

1019
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,130
puzzle that's going to reinforce
how the world works.

1020
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,535
There's a chap--

1021
00:44:57,535 --> 00:45:00,175
who gave a talk, and I believe
his name is Jeff Howard.

1022
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:05,290
He came to Camp [INAUDIBLE]
and gave a talk last year.

1023
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:11,240
And he makes this case that
games, and the logic that you

1024
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:19,750
present in games, do basically
the equivalent of what magic

1025
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,370
systems actually do
in the real world.

1026
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:28,530
What people like cultists or
astrologers do is they

1027
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:35,340
basically give you logics
that explain how the

1028
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,750
world is going to work.

1029
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,012
And while that may not
necessarily be obvious, but if

1030
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:41,420
it is viewed as a whole
knowledge you'll be able to

1031
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,520
understand how it's [INAUDIBLE]
in you.

1032
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,081
But more importantly you'd be
able to do things in the world

1033
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:50,250
that allow you to accomplish
things that you wouldn't

1034
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,420
otherwise do.

1035
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,690
Learning a game is very much
like that, it's like I don't

1036
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,580
know how this world works but
if I understood these

1037
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,520
particular rules I
could be able to

1038
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,180
accomplish greater things.

1039
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,210
And puzzles can be one
of those things where

1040
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,390
it becomes a test.

1041
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,560
And it becomes a test of, just
exactly how well do you

1042
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,850
understand this?

1043
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:14,010
Even if it is like in a combat
game like Quake or God of War

1044
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,030
or something.

1045
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,710
I can understand how the combat
system basically works

1046
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,088
if I just keep mashing the
x button or something.

1047
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:23,200
Or just shoot everything
with rockets.

1048
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,430
But if I really, really
understand the combat system,

1049
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,390
I might be able to hit something
that I wouldn't

1050
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,926
necessarily be able to hit.

1051
00:46:31,926 --> 00:46:36,900
I might be able to take down a
horde of enemies instead of

1052
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,220
hitting them down
one at a time.

1053
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,670
I might be able to
beat a boss.

1054
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,940
And actually a lot of boss
battles in digital games are

1055
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:44,760
actually puzzles.

1056
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,700
There's not, how well do you
generally react, it's can you

1057
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,740
figure out the pattern.

1058
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,360
But that pattern doesn't mean
anything unless [INAUDIBLE]

1059
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,370
how all your other combat
skills work.

1060
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,930
So a boss battle in Zelda only
makes sense if you figured out

1061
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,420
how that one item that you
picked up in that dungeon

1062
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,010
works really, really well.

1063
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,320
OK, it shoots fire.

1064
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,890
That means that not only does it
hurt them from distance, it

1065
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:14,110
also lights some of the
things on fire.

1066
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,880
And that's what I'll tell the
boss, basically, is combining

1067
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,700
this leaders ability
to hook up.

1068
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,050
Like everything else that
you've done before

1069
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,120
into taking it out.

1070
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,015
That's why boss battles, that
always kind of puzzled me.

1071
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:28,997

1072
00:47:28,997 --> 00:47:31,500
AUDIENCE: One thing I wanted
to say, before I get going,

1073
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,210
you were asking about hints
and a physical puzzle.

1074
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:38,240
The one thing that jumped to my
mind was a couple years ago

1075
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,370
the weekly Day--

1076
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,040
I don't know if anyone
reads it, it's like

1077
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,030
a free Boston newspaper.

1078
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,373
And they always have
crossword puzzles.

1079
00:47:43,373 --> 00:47:47,240
For the longest time they were
thematic, and so you would

1080
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,260
have a guest crossword.

1081
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:52,143
The first one I ever
did was Hulk Hogan.

1082
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:55,800
So all of the hints in the
crossword puzzles are related

1083
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:56,640
to Hulk Hogan.

1084
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,320
So it's a question of, not what
does this mean to me but

1085
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,740
what would it mean
to Hulk Hogan?

1086
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,480
And they don't do it anymore,
which is really depressing,

1087
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,560
because every week it was
something different and it was

1088
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,735
like a built-in hand
write as you went.

1089
00:48:10,735 --> 00:48:13,465
You didn't just pick them out
literally, you have to kind of

1090
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:13,920
contextualize it.

1091
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,450
PROFESSOR: You can think about
all the things that come with

1092
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,890
the puzzle, that potential
hook, [INAUDIBLE].

1093
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,808
Like a title, like a data
text-- as you were

1094
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:27,740
describing-- the fact that you
get in puzzle and mystery

1095
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,490
crimes, they may be
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and they may

1096
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,830
be disillusioned but it lies
on a different puzzle.

1097
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:35,630
Not the one I'm currently
looking at right now, because

1098
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:36,880
that's how [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1099
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,860

1100
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:46,290
Metal Gear Solid has a really,
really bizarre one where--

1101
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,145
AUDIENCE: Look in
the back case.

1102
00:48:48,145 --> 00:48:50,890
PROFESSOR: Where they tell you,
oh, there's a specific

1103
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,750
radio frequency that you need.

1104
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:53,780
It's written in the
back of box.

1105
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,560
And it's like, the
back of the box?

1106
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,556
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1107
00:48:57,556 --> 00:48:58,060
Anti-piracy.

1108
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,920
PROFESSOR: Yes, but it's
still a puzzle.

1109
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,485
And I was like, I know
how to solve that.

1110
00:49:02,485 --> 00:49:05,800
I mean, it was pretty obvious,
because maybe it's just me,

1111
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,200
because it about half an hour
to figure that one out.

1112
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,180
It took me some effort.

1113
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,750
AUDIENCE: I mean Metal
Gear Solid a lot of

1114
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,200
meta-puzzles like that.

1115
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,910
Like when you fought Psycho
Mantis for the first time.

1116
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,925
Well, so the scene you had to do
is you went to unplug your

1117
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:22,610
controller and plug it into
the second port because he

1118
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:24,620
would read your movements.

1119
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,850
And it was this cool, physical
layer of it where you're

1120
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:29,490
playing the game.

1121
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,510
Then you realize I have to
interact with the physical

1122
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,420
world so that he can't
see what I'm doing.

1123
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:36,100
PROFESSOR: But that one
[? cannot do, ?]

1124
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,770
because in that particular
example that one gave you a

1125
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:44,600
very big clue because right at
the beginning of that match

1126
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,920
that boss tells you to put your
control on the ground.

1127
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,860
And he says, I'm going
to control this

1128
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,840
controller with my mind.

1129
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,210
And actually, just
[INAUDIBLE].

1130
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,810
AUDIENCE: That's only if
you have dualtech.

1131
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:57,480
So, because on PlayStation,
if you didn't he just

1132
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,390
ignored that part.

1133
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,750
And you didn't get
that clue at all.

1134
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,695
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
that's a problem.

1135
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,536
But it's still very cool.

1136
00:50:04,536 --> 00:50:09,060
AUDIENCE: There were other
clues, like you would talk

1137
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,830
about how you had been playing
certain games by reading saves

1138
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,920
on your [INAUDIBLE].

1139
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,590
At least not in Castlevania.

1140
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,630
I just remember being like--

1141
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:17,895
[INAUDIBLE].

1142
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:22,390
PROFESSOR: So basically it's
giving you a clue that there's

1143
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,310
got to be something better
about the way that you're

1144
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:25,296
currently playing.

1145
00:50:25,296 --> 00:50:29,130
The funny thing about the radio
channel is that one

1146
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,050
really did not give you
any clue that there

1147
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:31,630
was something better.

1148
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,130
It just told you about
the back of the box.

1149
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,672
It was like, it didn't tell you
the back of the video game

1150
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:39,550
case, right.

1151
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,870
It's not going to be
that specific.

1152
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:43,800
AUDIENCE: It said CD
case, specifically.

1153
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,394
I was really confused, because I
think mine came in a slip of

1154
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:48,602
paper or something.

1155
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:50,650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if you buy
it used or something.

1156
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it's
anti-used game

1157
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,560
protection, as well.

1158
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,176
But yeah, mine was I think I
actually said on the back of

1159
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:00,384
the CD case, but I was playing
like a [INAUDIBLE] or

1160
00:51:00,384 --> 00:51:03,040
something and that came
in the DVD case.

1161
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,680
So I didn't make a connection.

1162
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,010
But if you look at the back of
it, you see what the radio

1163
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:14,090
frequency is in the
screenshot.

1164
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:17,590
One of the eight screenshots
that they show to demonstrate

1165
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:20,180
this is what the game is all
about, there's the number and

1166
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,660
it's just right in there.

1167
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,380
And then key it in.

1168
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,665
AUDIENCE: Has anyone played any
of those breakout games?

1169
00:51:27,665 --> 00:51:30,830
Where it's lock you in a
room and you have to--

1170
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,316
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1171
00:51:33,316 --> 00:51:36,910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you find the
thing, you find a slip of

1172
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,300
paper and escape [INAUDIBLE].

1173
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:42,670
PROFESSOR: So, actually
who doesn't know

1174
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,976
what these are about?

1175
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:44,892
Escape the room.

1176
00:51:44,892 --> 00:51:49,764
OK, so escape the room--
actually, could we bring up

1177
00:51:49,764 --> 00:51:51,210
something on your computer?

1178
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,656
AUDIENCE: I have to go
grab the video thing.

1179
00:51:52,656 --> 00:51:54,102
PROFESSOR: Oh, the
video cable.

1180
00:51:54,102 --> 00:51:55,820
AUDIENCE: It's back there
in my office.

1181
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,519
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK cool.

1182
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:00,200
Call [? Becky ?] to send it.

1183
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,420
Escape the room games are
typically flash games.

1184
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,150
And they're kind of like
adventure games because

1185
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,250
there's usually only one room,
although sometimes you have

1186
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:10,720
multiple rooms.

1187
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,870
It's a much smaller world
in most adventure games.

1188
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,100
But the basic idea
is the same.

1189
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,390
You pick up objects, you use
objects in a room, and you try

1190
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,050
to make things happen.

1191
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:24,490
You know, if you haven't made
anything, you are not

1192
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,360
progressing in the game.

1193
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,560
If you made something happen,
you are almost always making

1194
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,870
forward progress in the game.

1195
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:33,965
And there is, actually, a guide
for playing adventure

1196
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:38,850
games written by Roberta
Williams, who did the Original

1197
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,480
King's Quest series.

1198
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:43,640
And her guide is like, pick-up
everything, go everywhere, use

1199
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,020
everything on everything.

1200
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,450
That's actually what escape
the room really is.

1201
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,460
But there's a little bit more to
escape the room games, but

1202
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,420
there's just not that many
things that you can explore.

1203
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,120
That's the idea is that you're
stuck in a room.

1204
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,485
And basically it comes down
to just use everything on

1205
00:52:58,485 --> 00:53:01,440
everything until you figure
out what comes up.

1206
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,860
Rarely is it logical, often
pretty entertaining, because

1207
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,530
they're animation heavy.

1208
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,470
So every time you do something
right, you

1209
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:08,520
get some crazy animation.

1210
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:12,410
I put the fish into
the mail slot and

1211
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:15,490
out appears an octopus.

1212
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:17,870
It's fun to watch.

1213
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:22,210
For us, the kind of
comparatively opposite of

1214
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:25,040
those are the Grow games.

1215
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,870
And they're a series of
games called Grow.

1216
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,840
I think the guy who does them
is called Eyezmaze.

1217
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,070

1218
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:40,280
And the whole basic idea is that
imagine that you have a

1219
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,850
flower pot.

1220
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,705
And every time you
add something to

1221
00:53:44,705 --> 00:53:46,260
it something happens.

1222
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,077
But the order in which you are
adding things to it makes

1223
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:50,210
different things happen.

1224
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,680
And there are solutions,
basically, in making the

1225
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,490
optimal number of things happen
if you do it right.

1226
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:03,920
So what you can do is not
a mystery at all.

1227
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,470
You have these six things that
I could add to my pot.

1228
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,050
And I know those are the only
six things I could add.

1229
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:14,030
The question is what
order do I do them?

1230
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,830
And doing them in different
orders give

1231
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:19,160
you different results.

1232
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,750
And I feel that these two genres
are kind of linked, but

1233
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,060
they're playing off very
different things.

1234
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,090
One of them is, I don't know
what I'm going to do.

1235
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:31,710
But I know that whatever I do
has got to leave this space.

1236
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,810
And the other one is very much,
I know exactly what I

1237
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,462
can possibly do, I just don't
know what order to do them in.

1238
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:39,430
So a couple of puzzles
that you see online.

1239
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:43,830
These are fairly encapsulated
things.

1240
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,712
One game is one series
of puzzles.

1241
00:54:45,712 --> 00:54:48,142
There's not like a
professor-made encyclopedia

1242
00:54:48,142 --> 00:54:49,392
puzzle kind of thing.

1243
00:54:49,392 --> 00:54:54,460

1244
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,420
What time is it?

1245
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,075
OK, I think I'm actually going
to grab a few more puzzles and

1246
00:55:01,075 --> 00:55:01,690
bring them in.

1247
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:05,360
But I do actually want to try
to see whether we can put

1248
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,540
together a list of the kinds
of puzzles that we haven't

1249
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,430
talked about today.

1250
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:11,260
These could be physical puzzles,
these could be

1251
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,700
puzzles that you've seen in
a book by their genre.

1252
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,550
Logic puzzles, you know, of a
certain kind that you either

1253
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,270
really, really like or you
really, really loathe.

1254
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,283
And just break up
in groups of--

1255
00:55:23,283 --> 00:55:27,046
three, six, nine, Heather
[INAUDIBLE], ten, eleven,

1256
00:55:27,046 --> 00:55:30,648
twelve, seventeen people.

1257
00:55:30,648 --> 00:55:32,121
Seventeen people?

1258
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:34,085
That doesn't divide at all.

1259
00:55:34,085 --> 00:55:41,020

1260
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:42,330
OK, two or three.

1261
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,430
Groups of two or three
and just like--

1262
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,965
AUDIENCE: Jason should
be back.

1263
00:55:45,965 --> 00:55:48,630
PROFESSOR: OK, all right,
then groups of three.

1264
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:54,485

1265
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:56,080
How about we--

1266
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,634
just like--

1267
00:55:58,634 --> 00:56:00,360
you know, just a couple of
puzzles that we haven't

1268
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,670
discussed and a description
about what they're like.

1269
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:07,715
And we'll quickly run through
the class to sort of give

1270
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:11,030
everyone an idea of what--

1271
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,980
As a toy, playing with a Rubik's
Cube is more fun than

1272
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,530
the algorithm to solve it.

1273
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,252
That's not fun at all,
in my opinion.

1274
00:56:18,252 --> 00:56:21,030
AUDIENCE: It's fascinating,
you can also solve it.

1275
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,013
But it's [INAUDIBLE],
very tempting when

1276
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,486
you look at it also.

1277
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:27,923

1278
00:56:27,923 --> 00:56:30,869
AUDIENCE: So, one of the things
you were talking about

1279
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:34,797
was interactive fiction.

1280
00:56:34,797 --> 00:56:36,280
Text adventures.

1281
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:40,882
And how sometimes they could
be considered just like if

1282
00:56:40,882 --> 00:56:43,056
you're playing a regular
adventure game but just with

1283
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:44,042
text instead.

1284
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:48,600
And so the puzzle could be how
you interact with the world,

1285
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,540
or it could be trying to figure
out what actions are

1286
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,110
available to the user.

1287
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,950
Like sometimes not all
actions are there.

1288
00:56:54,950 --> 00:57:00,510
But also in some games the
nature of text gives you

1289
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:02,250
different ways to
have a puzzle.

1290
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,800
Like in Lost Pig, because
you're playing an orc he

1291
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,440
doesn't know English
very well.

1292
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,498
Or doesn't have full control of
language, so you're trying

1293
00:57:12,498 --> 00:57:14,161
to decipher his words
to figure out what

1294
00:57:14,161 --> 00:57:15,991
he's actually seeing.

1295
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:18,005
PROFESSOR: Do you have an
example you can do?

1296
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:19,775
To give with that to
make it clearer?

1297
00:57:19,775 --> 00:57:20,660
Because I haven't played it.

1298
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,320
AUDIENCE: In that game, there
is one part where he's

1299
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,500
describing a box and
it has a slot.

1300
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,790
And you put something in it
and then it gives you

1301
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:31,120
something out.

1302
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,740
But the way he's describing it,
you don't really know what

1303
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,672
he's describing until you
realize he's talking about a

1304
00:57:34,672 --> 00:57:36,675
vending machine.

1305
00:57:36,675 --> 00:57:42,260
He describes it as a tall
box with a slot in it.

1306
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,110
And another example we were
talking about was the game

1307
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:49,870
Aisle, which is you're this
guy in a grocery store.

1308
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,250
And it gives you this
big prologue.

1309
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,440
And you have one action
that you can do.

1310
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,700
So after you type in your one
action, it tells you what

1311
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,780
happens and gives
you an epilogue.

1312
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,990
And then the game starts over.

1313
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:07,490
But then using the information
from that epilogue, you have a

1314
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:09,560
different choice of actions
that you can take and

1315
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,770
different key words to use.

1316
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,752
And so by playing it over and
over you're uncovering more of

1317
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:17,630
the story until you
get somewhere.

1318
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,390
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1319
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,270
AUDIENCE: Aisle.

1320
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:27,206
A-I-S-L-E.

1321
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:32,170
AUDIENCE: We also thought about
puzzles that were games

1322
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:34,250
put into a very contrived
scenario.

1323
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:37,250
Like bridge puzzles, or chess
puzzles, or back when the

1324
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,700
Duelist magazine still existed
they had Magic

1325
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,680
the Gathering puzzles.

1326
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,637
PROFESSOR: So like
chess puzzles are

1327
00:58:42,637 --> 00:58:43,780
like, here's this board.

1328
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,210
What was the move that
led to this board.

1329
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,640
AUDIENCE: Or like, black
to win in three moves.

1330
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,110
Something like that.

1331
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,040
PROFESSOR: So that's like, you
are now placing additional

1332
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,620
constraints on the game.

1333
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,940
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

1334
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,630
It already puts you in a
situation like, pretend you're

1335
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:01,490
in this game.

1336
00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:04,220
Now, we promise you there's a
way you can automatically win,

1337
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:07,255
you have to find it.

1338
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:10,876
PROFESSOR: There's a number of
computer games like ChuChu

1339
00:59:10,876 --> 00:59:12,700
Rocket and everything
where it does like

1340
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,008
completely separate modes.

1341
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:17,880

1342
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,130
ChuChu Rocket is a frenetic
both player--

1343
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,800
AUDIENCE: It's a mice-herding
game.

1344
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,750
You have to get them
into rocket ships,

1345
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,000
so they go in space.

1346
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,222

1347
00:59:31,222 --> 00:59:32,980
It was for the Dreamcast.

1348
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,230
It's so good.

1349
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:37,230

1350
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,180
The idea's really simple.

1351
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:40,486
A bunch of mice wander around
the streets, and each player

1352
00:59:40,486 --> 00:59:41,930
gets to place three arrows.

1353
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,525
And when the mice run
under the arrow

1354
00:59:43,525 --> 00:59:44,705
they follow the arrow.

1355
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:47,010
So you want to get all your mice
on your ship, and want to

1356
00:59:47,010 --> 00:59:48,880
get the cats on the other ship
so that they eat their mice.

1357
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,090
PROFESSOR: In puzzle-mode, you
have three arrows in these

1358
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:52,735
particular directions.

1359
00:59:52,735 --> 00:59:55,308
But the way you place them, you
have as much time as you

1360
00:59:55,308 --> 00:59:57,070
want, but there's only
one right answer.

1361
00:59:57,070 --> 00:59:58,790
And that immediately shows you
the difference between a game

1362
00:59:58,790 --> 00:59:59,030
and puzzle.

1363
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,990
Right there.

1364
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:03,350
Even though they are all
in the same package.

1365
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,720
AUDIENCE: So, first off I don't
like jigsaw puzzles, but

1366
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,070
Michelle loves them.

1367
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,390
And then we also talked
about whodunit's.

1368
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,190
And I really love whodunit's
because you have to pay

1369
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,820
attention to the detail
in the stories.

1370
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,990
Like the one thing that--

1371
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,690
I guess the example that we
were talking about is, if

1372
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,480
there's a mailman and it happens
to be on a Sunday, he

1373
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,290
probably committed the crime.

1374
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,860
Because they don't have
mail on Sundays.

1375
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,675
And it's like small
details like that.

1376
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:30,995
PROFESSOR: Are you talking about
mystery books or just

1377
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:31,995
like little paragraphs?

1378
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:34,302
AUDIENCE: Well, it's usually
like a story.

1379
01:00:34,302 --> 01:00:36,360
And they say, oh, here's the
scenario, here's the

1380
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,188
background story, who
is the murderer?

1381
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:43,571
PROFESSOR: They compare it
though, [INAUDIBLE].

1382
01:00:43,571 --> 01:00:46,725
AUDIENCE: People have parties
like that, like full-on

1383
01:00:46,725 --> 01:00:47,060
whodunit parties.

1384
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,430
AUDIENCE: That's very true.

1385
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:50,366
I didn't see who was talking
for a second.

1386
01:00:50,366 --> 01:00:54,240

1387
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,490
Who's talking?

1388
01:00:55,490 --> 01:01:02,610

1389
01:01:02,610 --> 01:01:06,620
AUDIENCE: Another puzzle we
came up with, was the ones

1390
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,725
that you did in elementary
school with like the big grid.

1391
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:12,350
And you would have someone's
name, and maybe their favorite

1392
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,693
food, that you would give them
a bunch of clues and you have

1393
01:01:14,693 --> 01:01:15,760
to match them.

1394
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,640
Yes, with something like the
checks and the xs and stuff.

1395
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,045
PROFESSOR: So, that's just
generally called logic

1396
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,400
puzzles, I believe.

1397
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,540
It's just you are given the
incomplete set of information

1398
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,331
but enough constraints that you
can figure out the rest of

1399
01:01:30,331 --> 01:01:31,450
the information.

1400
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:34,870
And really the way to solve it
is just write everybody's

1401
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:39,440
name, all the characters that
you're given in the prose.

1402
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,400
Write down all the characters
on one column.

1403
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,770
Write down all the things you're
trying to figure out,

1404
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,662
like who's wearing what colored
shirt, for instance,

1405
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,080
so just write out all the colors
on the other column.

1406
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,540
And just by the process of
elimination, just figuring

1407
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,610
out, usually the answers
are mutually exclusive.

1408
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:59,772
So if somebody is wearing a red
shirt, can not be wearing

1409
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:02,128
a green shirt.

1410
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:07,584
AUDIENCE: So part of the much
harder ones are every fourth

1411
01:02:07,584 --> 01:02:08,576
statement is false.

1412
01:02:08,576 --> 01:02:11,056
Like you don't know if one
statement is definitely false.

1413
01:02:11,056 --> 01:02:12,792
And I've seen one where
every statement is

1414
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:14,032
false except for one.

1415
01:02:14,032 --> 01:02:17,860
And I can bring in my book and
there's like [INAUDIBLE].

1416
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:23,452
PROFESSOR: The worst version
of it is figuring out how

1417
01:02:23,452 --> 01:02:25,444
puzzles see people
in the world.

1418
01:02:25,444 --> 01:02:29,926

1419
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:32,416
AUDIENCE: They wouldn't fix it
before because he pushed it

1420
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,666
out last week.

1421
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,948

1422
01:02:36,948 --> 01:02:38,766
PROFESSOR: You guys want
to throw in any?

1423
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:42,715
AUDIENCE: Sure, we started by
trying to think of all the

1424
01:02:42,715 --> 01:02:44,170
puzzles that we really
dislike.

1425
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,080
And we came up with
a couple here.

1426
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,505
The sliding square puzzles, you
know where you have like--

1427
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:52,420

1428
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,069
Basically just a variation on
a jigsaw puzzle where the

1429
01:02:55,069 --> 01:02:57,803
rules are more constrained.

1430
01:02:57,803 --> 01:02:59,791
I don't like jigsaw
puzzles either.

1431
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:03,270
So we're like-minded there.

1432
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,258
And then John had a couple.

1433
01:03:05,258 --> 01:03:08,737
I guess there's a Light's
Out puzzle.

1434
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:14,204
Inside the image you touch
certain areas and [INAUDIBLE].

1435
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:17,640
PROFESSOR: So you've got like
a grid of buttons and every

1436
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,085
button you push will invert all
those neighboring buttons.

1437
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:26,830
Like implanting the top button,
left and right, will--

1438
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:28,080
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1439
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,954

1440
01:03:29,954 --> 01:03:34,924
AUDIENCE: And then I guess
I already described the

1441
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:36,070
concentric circle thing.

1442
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:38,481
Yeah, their puzzles are similar
that we're taking an

1443
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,270
action on one item
in the scene.

1444
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,982
These are incredibly difficult,
the concentric

1445
01:03:42,982 --> 01:03:45,994
circle ones, will have
an effect on other

1446
01:03:45,994 --> 01:03:47,850
things in the system.

1447
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,061
And typically these are used in
games where there will be a

1448
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:55,260
center podium with a pathway
leading off.

1449
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:56,760
On one side of the podium,
then there will be a

1450
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,821
concentric circle around the
concentric ring with a pathway

1451
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:01,533
off of that ring and
another interval.

1452
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:05,498
Then more and more circles to
each side and you get to

1453
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:08,746
rotate individual circles and
that will rotate the other

1454
01:04:08,746 --> 01:04:09,674
circles different ways.

1455
01:04:09,674 --> 01:04:10,975
And you need to create
a pathway.

1456
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:12,310
AUDIENCE: Every time I
rotate one, something

1457
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:13,535
else is going to rotate.

1458
01:04:13,535 --> 01:04:17,720
AUDIENCE: Then it's always
going right before you're

1459
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,100
[INAUDIBLE].

1460
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:23,062
AUDIENCE: I guess three of those
are examples of games

1461
01:04:23,062 --> 01:04:26,020
where you have to take action
on an environment, but your

1462
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,732
action has direct effects
throughout the environment.

1463
01:04:28,732 --> 01:04:32,018
And it's just really annoying
figuring out

1464
01:04:32,018 --> 01:04:33,190
how to optimize that.

1465
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:35,020
PROFESSOR: But they are
predictable effects.

1466
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,225
It's like every time I rotate
this one left, that one's

1467
01:04:37,225 --> 01:04:39,960
going to rotate right.

1468
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,290
AUDIENCE: I think it's kind of
funny how the context has a

1469
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:44,490
lot to do with whether these
puzzles are annoying or not.

1470
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:47,911
Because I do enjoy Professor
Layton quite a bit.

1471
01:04:47,911 --> 01:04:54,170
And it's the most, through an
arbitrary character in order

1472
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:57,040
to justifying that you're
trying [INAUDIBLE].

1473
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,393
It's just fun.

1474
01:04:58,393 --> 01:05:01,045
Your intention on even playing
the game is that you're going

1475
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:01,570
to be solving puzzles.

1476
01:05:01,570 --> 01:05:03,340
Not as [INAUDIBLE].

1477
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:03,700
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1478
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:08,880
AUDIENCE: Also, the way that is
presented makes it funny in

1479
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,850
that as well, right.

1480
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,705
So the mafia goons come up to
you and say, we're going to

1481
01:05:12,705 --> 01:05:14,660
stop you from coming in here
unless you solve this puzzle.

1482
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,392

1483
01:05:17,392 --> 01:05:20,780
Shouldn't you just shoot me?

1484
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,420
It would solve all
your problems.

1485
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,740
No, no, solve this puzzle.

1486
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,542

1487
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:30,750
PROFESSOR: It's like they're
making fun of themselves even.

1488
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,000
All right, cool.

1489
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,735

1490
01:05:34,735 --> 01:05:37,475
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if we
really commented on what we

1491
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,670
liked or didn't like.

1492
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:42,415
But some things that we came
up with that haven't been

1493
01:05:42,415 --> 01:05:46,880
brought up yet are cryptics,
which are kind of a

1494
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,780
combination between crosswords
and riddles, riddles,

1495
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,740
combinatory games as
a puzzle apparatus.

1496
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,270

1497
01:05:57,270 --> 01:06:00,636
Logic puzzles in general, not
just like typical logic

1498
01:06:00,636 --> 01:06:01,450
puzzles like that.

1499
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:07,280
You can have state machines,
or Sudoku, or any type of

1500
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:08,710
numerical puzzle.

1501
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,340
We also want to differentiate
that a lot of those games, or

1502
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,670
some of those games,
are spatially

1503
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,020
oriented and some aren't.

1504
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:17,010
Which we thought was an
important aspect, but not

1505
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,590
necessarily definitive of a
completely different genre.

1506
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,830
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure I've
seen a state machine puzzle,

1507
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,702
actually, outside of a computer
science textbook.

1508
01:06:24,702 --> 01:06:26,094
AUDIENCE: I know some.

1509
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:28,916
PROFESSOR: I'll never ask you.

1510
01:06:28,916 --> 01:06:30,850
I expect it's going to
be more involved than

1511
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,470
we have time for.

1512
01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,340
By combinatory puzzles
you mean stuff like--

1513
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:38,450
AUDIENCE: Combinatory games.

1514
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,260
All the games that fall under
combinatory game theory.

1515
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,590
AUDIENCE: Like Nim's.

1516
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:47,400
[INAUDIBLE]

1517
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:51,110
AUDIENCE: These are sort of
exploration, so games where

1518
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:56,690
you have to see everything
around you to know what is

1519
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,900
available for use.

1520
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,600
On the [INAUDIBLE]

1521
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,995
so in the book they
talked about

1522
01:07:02,995 --> 01:07:06,530
actually Zelda, and just--

1523
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:10,780
So a situation in a game that
I didn't like is, you're

1524
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,270
playing a game and something
happens you don't step too

1525
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,640
fast or something.

1526
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,820
And because of that,
you get too inert.

1527
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,960
You're in a spot where you don't
have the tools necessary

1528
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,140
to beat the enemy right
in front of you.

1529
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,990
But you also are trapped
and can't go back.

1530
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,420
It happened to me one time.

1531
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:30,005
It was the Star Wars: Knights
of the Old Republic.

1532
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:34,390

1533
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,530
There's an enemy, you couldn't
go forward, and there was a

1534
01:07:37,530 --> 01:07:39,800
cliff so you couldn't
get back up.

1535
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,550
And so, since I couldn't do
anything I was forced to

1536
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:46,410
completely go back
to the last save.

1537
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:50,652
PROFESSOR: But is that a puzzle,
or is that just a bug?

1538
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:55,130
AUDIENCE: I mean, it's time
worth expiration and

1539
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,010
it's an item use.

1540
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:00,360
So you need to get an
item to go ahead.

1541
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,185
If you have this item, then
the enemy that you--

1542
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:06,650
I think it was like a Rancor
or something--

1543
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,950
you could beat the Rancor or at
least put it to sleep and

1544
01:08:08,950 --> 01:08:09,970
walk by it.

1545
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:13,340
But without it, you had
to try and beat it or

1546
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:15,480
it would kill you.

1547
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,569
PROFESSOR: OK, so it was a
item that would have made

1548
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:21,270
combat easier, basically.

1549
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:25,990
But they kind of made it
this one way with--

1550
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,010
yeah.

1551
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:29,136
So you see a lot of puzzle games
where they have easy

1552
01:08:29,136 --> 01:08:29,930
reset, right.

1553
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:32,875
And it's like you can stop
trying to solve it and you

1554
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:35,485
really screw up something along
the way You hit reset

1555
01:08:35,485 --> 01:08:36,970
and go right back to
the beginning.

1556
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:40,435
Nice that the Republic
has no easy reset.

1557
01:08:40,435 --> 01:08:42,167
You live with the consequences,
I guess that's

1558
01:08:42,167 --> 01:08:43,900
what they were trying
to go for.

1559
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:48,688
AUDIENCE: All right,
so we've also had a

1560
01:08:48,688 --> 01:08:50,770
loathing sliding puzzles--

1561
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,731
AUDIENCE: Either with numbers or
pictures, both of them are

1562
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:55,540
equally annoying.

1563
01:08:55,540 --> 01:09:00,829
But, on the other hand,
Alec loves Rush Hour.

1564
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:03,170
AUDIENCE: It's the traffic red
light game where you have to

1565
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:06,186
fly cars out of the way
to form a path.

1566
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:08,951
AUDIENCE: In Professor Layton
there are an awful lot of

1567
01:09:08,951 --> 01:09:12,270
sliding puzzles that have
differently shaped pieces, or

1568
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,069
oddly shaped pieces.

1569
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:18,200
Which is slightly more
interesting, or less annoying

1570
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:22,520
than regular sliding puzzles
but it's still incredibly

1571
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:22,820
frustrating.

1572
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,769
AUDIENCE: Well, I think the
difference there is that when

1573
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:27,189
you have differently
sized pieces--

1574
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:29,310
When you're doing just like a
sliding puzzle where you're

1575
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:32,010
trying to recreate an image
there's definite patterns that

1576
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:33,800
you keep using over and over
again, because you're just

1577
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,520
like a rotating spaces.

1578
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:37,700
So it's not actually
interesting.

1579
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,899
Whereas Rush Hour you actually
have to think

1580
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,840
about things fit together.

1581
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,800
So one other puzzle type that
we haven't really mentioned,

1582
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,350
that I actually really enjoy,
is pictographic puzzles.

1583
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,689
Where it relies on sort of your
association with visual

1584
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:52,979
images and wordplay and stuff.

1585
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:56,580
Like, for example, you'll have
a puzzle that's just an image

1586
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:02,210
of an eyeball, a bumblebee,
and a screen shot of Judi

1587
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,090
Dench in a James Bond movie.

1588
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:09,390
And the idea is it's IBM.

1589
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:12,310
So I love puzzles like that.

1590
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,560
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1591
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,130

1592
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:17,760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so stuff like
that where it relies on

1593
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,820
someone, like a human being,
actually associating

1594
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:23,490
information with something
visual.

1595
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,290
Rather than it being just a
straight modern puzzle where

1596
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:30,337
you have this information and
you use this to derive the

1597
01:10:30,337 --> 01:10:30,880
rest of the information.

1598
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,110
PROFESSOR: There's R-E-B-U-S,
and of course those are very

1599
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:37,935
language focused even though
they're image-based.

1600
01:10:37,935 --> 01:10:41,476
AUDIENCE: What one has the two
lines and then [INAUDIBLE] in

1601
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:42,260
the middle?

1602
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,470
AUDIENCE: Well, things
like that, yeah.

1603
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:47,340
PROFESSOR: You had Rebus where
you are trying to basically

1604
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,420
reconstruct a sentence.

1605
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:53,060
And then I forget what's the
classification of puzzles

1606
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,693
where you're given a certain
lead of images and you're

1607
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:58,052
trying to write enough.

1608
01:10:58,052 --> 01:11:05,790
But if I wrote it in--

1609
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:10,882
this is not a good puzzle but
just to give an example-- if I

1610
01:11:10,882 --> 01:11:14,470
put [INAUDIBLE].

1611
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:18,950

1612
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:22,640
I think there is a specific word
for these kind of things.

1613
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,781
But the whole idea is you're
trying to reconstruct these

1614
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,900
sayings or these [INAUDIBLE]

1615
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,295
from individual theories.

1616
01:11:28,295 --> 01:11:32,180

1617
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:39,236
So I mean, these are usually
spatial to begin with.

1618
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:41,447
I think there was a whole
game show in the '80s

1619
01:11:41,447 --> 01:11:42,790
that was just all--

1620
01:11:42,790 --> 01:11:45,590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1621
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:47,954
AUDIENCE: Australia had
a show called Catch

1622
01:11:47,954 --> 01:11:49,415
Phrase which was--

1623
01:11:49,415 --> 01:11:51,850
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think Catch
Phrase was the show.

1624
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:56,770
AUDIENCE: So we wrote a B-list
of different types of puzzles,

1625
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:59,770
so let's just run
through them.

1626
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:00,750
All right, we've got
lots of different

1627
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,900
sliding puzzle variants.

1628
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,315
We've got hidden object finding,
the variance on

1629
01:12:04,315 --> 01:12:08,560
Where's Waldo and then it's
kind of [INAUDIBLE].

1630
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,165
We have riddles, various kinds
of logic puzzles, particularly

1631
01:12:13,165 --> 01:12:16,170
two of which we've
mentioned before.

1632
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:17,760
Several people, witnesses,
give statements.

1633
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,376
One of them is a liar,
which one's the liar.

1634
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,756
So find the hidden
sinister person.

1635
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:25,700
And then there's the figment
property x is next to figment

1636
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:28,030
property y, what order
are they sitting in?

1637
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:28,992
That kind of puzzle.

1638
01:12:28,992 --> 01:12:33,330
There's a million of them
in Professor Layton.

1639
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,890
There's these kinds
of unraveling, or

1640
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,570
reverse-engineering
type, puzzles.

1641
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:43,110
Where some system has been
permuted and you have to

1642
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:44,750
restore it to its
original state.

1643
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,908
Which Rubik's Cube is like the
canonical example, I guess.

1644
01:12:47,908 --> 01:12:50,830
But then there's a bunch of
other different good ones.

1645
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:52,679
PROFESSOR: I mean that chess
games is kind of in that

1646
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:53,752
category too.

1647
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:58,850

and swapping puzzles.

hacking, but then

1649

there are 1 million other
variations on exchanging tiles

1650

or swapping them around
or this kind of thing.

Lots of different kinds
of math puzzles.

01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:14,575
This particular word
transformation puzzle type

1653
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:17,750
that I used to see all the time
when I was a kid, where

1654
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:22,480
by changing one letter or word
per step, you had to transform

1655
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,610
one word into another.

1656
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:32,890
Mazes, jigsaw puzzles, code
breaking nobody mentioned yet.

1657
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:38,360
And then also, these kind of
full experiment type puzzles.

you categorize them.

AUDIENCE: All right, so I'm
trying to remember how this

1661
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,400
works but I think it is--

1662
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,780
this one popped up on Day(9)s
podcast the other day.

1663
01:13:55,780 --> 01:13:59,245
I only give it because otherwise
if I get it wrong

1664
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:02,490
then people will go oh my God,
and try and puzzle it out.

1665
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:04,860
So it has to do with the piece
of string and burning.

1666
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:06,666
AUDIENCE: Oh, the 13 minutes?

1667
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:10,681
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do you remember
exactly how it goes?

1668
01:14:10,681 --> 01:14:13,536
AUDIENCE: OK, you have
two pieces of string.

1669
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:17,030
You know that the whole string
takes an hour to burn but it's

1670

not linear.

thinking puzzles.

this under riddles, but--

time, and see how many matches
you can burn an hour.

to that number--

01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,577
AUDIENCE: The whole thing.

1690
01:15:04,577 --> 01:15:06,767
PROFESSOR: It will take slightly
longer than the

1691
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:10,410
amount of time it takes
to get to class.

1692
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,310
We close by then.

1693
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,250
It would be nice to give
people time to

1694
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:13,870
think about it too.

1695
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:15,970
