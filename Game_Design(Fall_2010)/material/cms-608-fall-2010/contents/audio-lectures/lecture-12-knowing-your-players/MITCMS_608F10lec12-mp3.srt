9
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:24,622
PROFESSOR: We'll start with a
little bit of recap from two

10
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:26,914
Fridays ago.

11
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:31,310
But just a reminder of things to
keep in mind while you guys

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:31,800
are testing.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,635
On one hand, most of you are
pretty much the most expert

14
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:40,370
players in your game at this
point in time, [INAUDIBLE]

15
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,700
You know the game better
than anybody else.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,085
And the kind of things that--

17
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,640

18
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,600
that means you suck
as a tester.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,310
That means you still have a
role to play as testers.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,750
You can be looking for the
degenerate strategies, and you

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,120
can be looking for exploits.

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,418
Sometimes it takes more
imagination than a

23
00:01:00,418 --> 00:01:04,516
sleep-deprived MIT student has
available to them, to be able

24
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:06,210
to see these exploits.

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,495
But, because you know the
systems better than anyone

26
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,700
else, you're in a good position
to spot that.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,910
The kinds of things you're
looking for are obviously

28
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,720
value [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,580
strategy.

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:22,080
I mentioned that the last time
we were in this room.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:28,080
But also, look for those
strategies were, like, OK, I

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,610
have two [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,390
those decision points where I
could do decision A or I could

34
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,940
do the decision B, but if I
change my strategy, and nobody

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,920
else has changed their strategy,
I'm screwed.

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,110
And that makes it really really
hesitant for someone to

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,080
say, well, Strategy B could be
really interesting, I can go

38
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,330
for this kind of play, but on
the assumption that the only

39
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,270
way how this is going to be
beneficial is if everybody

40
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,730
else also changes
their strategy.

41
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,310
Now you have a situation where
nobody wants to try that

42
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,370
second option.

43
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,930
That's one way to think
about cyberpunks.

44
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:12,610
It's like, if you change your
position and the only way that

45
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,698
you can change your position is
at a cost to yourself, then

46
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:20,925
the benefits of changing that
position is going to be lower

47
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:24,940
than the risk that you're taking
on, then you've got a

48
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,716
situation where it's very
difficult to break out of one

49
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:28,950
dominant strategy.

50
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,100
So if you've got a situation
where there are three dominant

51
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,550
strategies, then none of them
are dominant anymore that's

52
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,420
great, now I have an
option of different

53
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,630
things they can choose.

54
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,065
So that's just one thing to keep
in mind if all you guys

55
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:45,560
are looking at a game.

56
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,530
If everyone just ends up
adopting the same strategy,

57
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,860
and you're just hoping for a
chance of drawing the right

58
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,445
cards, in order to win your
game, then [UNINTELLIGIBLE],

59
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,070
then you've got a game where
the individual player's

60
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,232
decisions aren't quite that
influential on the outcome.

61
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:07,955
And I still need to play your
games to be able to see what

62
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:08,840
you guys are going for.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,500
But, for the most part, it looks
like you guys are not

64
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,082
going for a purely chance-based
game.

65
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:16,305
You're looking for something
where someone's decision

66
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,610
actually matters.

67
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,590
So that's one reminder from the
game theory point of view.

68
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,260
And the other one I never really
got time to talk about

69
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,030
games or system of conflict,
and we don't have a huge

70
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,070
amount of time because
we have today's

71
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,670
readings to go through.

72
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:37,760
But if you think about games as
games where multiple people

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,580
are striving for some sort of
goal, and there are going to

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,350
be winners and there are going
to be losers, then the idea of

75
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,040
thinking of games as some kind
of conflict makes sense.

76
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,585
If you think of them as, are
games competitive, or are

77
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:54,630
games cooperative, for
throughout some games that are

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,490
known to be cooperative
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

79
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,590
there are certain modes in
certain different games that

80
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,320
flip it from competitive
to cooperative.

81
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,100
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

82
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,065
PROFESSOR: But it is designed
for four people to play, all

83
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,070
going for the same goal.

84
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,450
AUDIENCE: Gears of War

85
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,079
PROFESSOR: Gears of War
multiplayer, yeah.

86
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,320
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] interesting,
yeah.

87
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,180
Because it's kind of the
risk of cooperation.

88
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,050
Pandemic is you against
the board, actually.

89
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,000
You against the game rules.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,726
And actually, that leads into
today's lecture a bit.

91
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:38,770
So hang onto that idea
of Pandemic.

92
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,910
But there is one argument that
all games are competitive.

93
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:46,030
Even games like Left for Dead,
where you're playing against

94
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,380
the computer, or Pandemic, when
you're playing against

95
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,460
the game rules.

96
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,210
Or--

97
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,960
AUDIENCE: Shelter
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

98
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,843
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
a bit--

99
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,320
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,825
AUDIENCE: You're mostly playing

101
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:58,280
against the game rules.

102
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,060
Unless there's a trader,
there's not

103
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,240
always one in the game.

104
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,700
PROFESSOR: But the basic idea is
that even in a game that's

105
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,420
generally assumed to be
co-op, you're still

106
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,590
playing against the world.

107
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,870
So as competitive against the
world, just not here,

108
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,215
computing against the
other human people

109
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:15,770
that are playing it.

110
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,550
If they're competing against.

111
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,270
Anyone is probably going to
decide who set it up, to

112
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,300
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

113
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,150
So that's one way to think of
all games as competitive.

114
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,616
Obviously, the games that people
generally think of as

115
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,420
competitive, real-time games
like chess, for instance.

116
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,530
There's one winner, there's one
loser, and if there's a

117
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,650
draw then nobody wins.

118
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,460
Or, those games people
generally think of as

119
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,380
competitive.

120
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,290
But then, the other way to think
about cooperation is

121
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,370
that all games are
also cooperative.

122
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,390
Because if you don't agree
on the rules--

123
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,850
if you're all in fact not
playing the same rules, then

124
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,030
you don't actually
have a game.

125
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,500
So you all have to cooperate
to play.

126
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,510
We have the same set of rules
and we're going to play

127
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,270
according to them.

128
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,760
That's not necessarily the
same thing as saying that

129
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,700
everyone knows all the rules.

130
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,230
There are plenty of games,
especially computer games,

131
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,460
where you're going
into the game not

132
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,610
knowing all the rules.

133
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,960
You're going to try to figure
out the rules as the one

134
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,290
system lets you.

135
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,550
Role-playing games, where
you start off like,

136
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,930
I want to do this.

137
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,510
I want to-- you know,
get drunk now,

138
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,625
and how do I do that?

139
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,524
And then the GM tells
you the rules.

140
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:28,380
Roll against your--

141
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:28,856
AUDIENCE: Constitution.

142
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,280
PROFESSOR: Constitution,
is it constitution?

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,495
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
but.

144
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:32,930
Drunkenness.

145
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,660
PROFESSOR: Always good.

146
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,910
Possibly.

147
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,740

148
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,670
And then you get
told the rules.

149
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,076
And then you go and do it.

150
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:45,050
Live-action role-playing
games.

151
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,880
I know there's a bunch of people
here who play them.

152
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,170
You usually get a subset of
all the rules that were

153
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,380
written for the game.

154
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,330
You get the subset that
pertains to you.

155
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,940
And you assume that everybody
else has the subset that

156
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,030
pertains to them.

157
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,150
And that they're playing
according to it.

158
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,850
There's a strong honor system,
and even in a game, especially

159
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,585
the kinds that are played in
MIT, which are fiercely

160
00:07:05,585 --> 00:07:05,970
competitive.

161
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,200
There's literally
assassin games.

162
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,790
You literally want to lead
someone into a dark alley and

163
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,590
shoot them.

164
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,110
Even then, you have to assume
that whatever rules that

165
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,870
person, who you're leading down
a dark alley in order to

166
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,350
shoot them.

167
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,130
Whatever rules [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
they're

168
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,910
playing by those rules.

169
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,610
They're not going to say--

170
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,290
if you shoot them, they can
say, that didn't work.

171
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,544
You have to assume that actually
didn't work, because

172
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:32,410
they have rules that tell them
when it works and when it

173
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,040
didn't work.

174
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,820
So it's still cooperative,
even though

175
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,940
it's competitive play.

176
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,950
And, some terminology now.

177
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,810
There's systemic cooperation,
which is what I'm describing.

178
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,880
It's the, you are agreeing
that the system works.

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,740
And you are agreeing how
the system works.

180
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,530
These are the ways
how I'm going to

181
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:52,960
interact with the system.

182
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,810
If I'm going to be playing--

183
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,340
Goldeneye or [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

184
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,760
on the split screen.

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,140
Or Halo on the split screen.

186
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,890
And you agree not to look at
somebody else's screen.

187
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,330
Then, that's a systemic rule.

188
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:13,460
You might also decide, no, it's
on the screen, I can't

189
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,710
avoid seeing it, therefore
we can all look at

190
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,420
each others' screens.

191
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,830
That would be a systemic rule.

192
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,700
Even though the goals are the
same, let's shoot each other.

193
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,170
And then there's clear
cooperation, which is a little

194
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,232
bit more like the games like
Pandemic and Left for Dead,

195
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:31,220
where you're explicitly trying
to help each other in your

196
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,690
team in a shared goal.

197
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,669
And I'm just trying to
differentiate them.

198
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,110
Because it's useful sometimes
to sort of try to figure out

199
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,720
the differences.

200
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,672
There's a game that I don't
think we're making you play,

201
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,120
called The War on Terror.

202
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,130
That we have in the lab.

203
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,450
And one of the things about this
game is that it actually

204
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,230
doesn't end.

205
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,530
If you look at the rules,
it seems that there are

206
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,195
conditions for the game end,
but they're really, really

207
00:09:00,195 --> 00:09:01,530
hard to reach.

208
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:05,356
And if you're interested in
seeing how the game ends, I'll

209
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:07,750
be happy to pass you to Cory,
and he can try to figure it

210
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,290
out, or play it.

211
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,006
But of course, that's the point
that they're trying to

212
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:11,325
make, right?

213
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:13,370
It's a War on Terror, it
never really ends.

214
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,720
It'll keep going.

215
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,140
It perpetuates yourself, and
it's designed to be a

216
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,420
competitive game.

217
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,910
Everybody tries to take down
all the other states.

218
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,300
The other nation states, by
sponsoring terrorist activity,

219
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,952
or trying to defend themselves
from terrorist activity.

220
00:09:31,952 --> 00:09:35,068
Which means everybody's
responsible for terrorism in

221
00:09:35,068 --> 00:09:37,360
the end, in that game.

222
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,310
But in the end, what you're
hoping is at some point in

223
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,853
time, the players are going to
cooperate, because this game's

224
00:09:43,853 --> 00:09:44,680
not going to end.

225
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,380
That's the whole point
of the game.

226
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,980
And the entire group coming to
that conclusion in a shared

227
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,790
way, is what the game
designers were

228
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,690
trying to go for.

229
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,630
It's a funny game.

230
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,280
Anybody who played Crunch, it
was done by the same folks.

231
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,988
But it's a little bit more of
the, we have an opinion and we

232
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:07,398
want you to share it, then
this is a game that you

233
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,170
actually want to try to win.

234
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,910
It's funny.

235
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

236
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,160

237
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,430
So, that's some opinions about
cooperation, and that is,

238
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,620
systemic cooperation, where
you're agreeing on the rules,

239
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,500
or you agree that the
system works.

240
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,660
And that's their cooperation,
where players are actually

241
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,710
agreeing towards some
sort of shared goal.

242
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,100
And there are games where
it flips between player

243
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,220
cooperation and player
competition.

244
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,800
It's like--

245
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,820
Castle Crashers, who's played
Castle Crashers?

246
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,360
It's a great game, xBox
Live arcade game.

247
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,770
You run around, it's a side
scrolling game, where a little

248
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,830
knight with a sword--

249
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,320
AUDIENCE: It's a sword?

250
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,970
AUDIENCE: No, it
can be an axe.

251
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,310
It can be a fish.

252
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,178
PROFESSOR: Some sort of
bludgeoning device.

253
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,950
Fish is awesome.

254
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:08,400
And in general, if you're
playing with three other

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,840
people with controllers right
to you on the couch, you're

256
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,970
pretty much going for
the same goal.

257
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,520
There are you four, and there
are a whole bunch of baddies

258
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,350
on screen, and you're trying
to kill it all.

259
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,000
But then, as soon as you beat
the last one, the game

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,140
switches from defeat all the
baddies to save the princess.

261
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,280
And, wait a minute--

262
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,422
AUDIENCE: No, you've already
saved the princess.

263
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:32,100
It goes to get the princess.

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,470
PROFESSOR: It becomes
get the princess.

265
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,520
There's one princess, there's
four knights, and it becomes a

266
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,190
competitive game.

267
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,082
All of a sudden, everything that
you were using against

268
00:11:39,082 --> 00:11:41,145
the baddies becomes
something that

269
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:43,680
you use on your teammates.

270
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,210
And there are games that
flip-flop between that.

271
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:51,460
Diplomacy is a really fluid
game in that sense.

272
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,260
You have to assume everybody's
competitive in that game.

273
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,600
But the only way to obtain your
goals is to cooperate

274
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,210
occasionally.

275
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,940
And so you can adapt.

276
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,140
All that's clear cooperation.

277
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,030
No-one's disagreeing on rules.

278
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,820
So that's systemic cooperation
all the way through, but then

279
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,755
there's player competition
and cooperation

280
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:12,940
going back and forth.

281
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,260
So, that's cooperation.

282
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:24,550
Finally, think a little bit
about level playing field and

283
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,820
what it means in your games,
whether they're

284
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,330
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

285
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,500
In many of your games,
especially card games, they're

286
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,620
going to start with
some sort of deal.

287
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,000
They're going to start with some
sort of hand, or maybe a

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,750
drawing in some sort
of systematic way

289
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,095
from a shuffled deck.

290
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,560
That pretty much means that
you're starting out with

291
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,250
something that's effectively
random.

292
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,500
But then it could be also
influenced by your knowledge

293
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,410
of the game, by your
skill at the game.

294
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,260
And you want to see how--

295
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,100
at what point, how do you want
to balance it between

296
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,180
someone's skill, familiarity
with the game,

297
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,160
against pure chance.

298
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,980
And a level playing field means
different things to a

299
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,170
lot of different people.

300
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,177
For some people, it may mean,
no matter what skill level I

301
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:14,560
am, I have a chance
at winning.

302
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,500
So you're sort of biasing
towards chance.

303
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,500
For some people a level playing
field is, no matter

304
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,000
what hand I get given, there
is a valid strategy.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,090
Or the goals that get set
in a way that allows

306
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,810
me to obtain it.

307
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,560
A lot of trick-kicking games,
especially games with bidding,

308
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,380
actually have an automatic
ranking system.

309
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,660
In various lives that you
only bid a game that you

310
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,160
think you can win.

311
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,290
And the whole idea is, the game
is to push your opponent

312
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,790
to bid on something which they
couldn't actually get.

313
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,640
So, that's a level
playing field.

314
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:01,460
I can have a crappy hand, but
that's not chance so much as

315
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,730
the decisions that
you're making.

316
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:13,680
So, what I would advocate,
in this class, if

317
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,930
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

318
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,380

319
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,550
is, when you're trying to
balance it out towards

320
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,330
whatever your interpretation
of a level playing field is

321
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,660
going to be, try to pick
decisions that push you in the

322
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,320
direction of meaningful
decisions.

323
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,610
Things that players can make a
decision on, and can see the

324
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,000
consequences.

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,050
They can understand how
those consequences

326
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,800
play out in the game.

327
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,099
And the outcome of the
overall game is going

328
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:50,720
to be resolved then.

329
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,020
That is, again, not necessarily
the only

330
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,750
definition.

331
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,430
So I want to be very
very clear.

332
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,220
What I'm asking of you here is
not necessarily the only

333
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,750
definition of a well-designed
game.

334
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,350
Because designing a game to be
played from ages 3 to 90, you

335
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,690
probably want a game where
making a meaningful decision

336
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,544
isn't going to bias the game
to the point where

337
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:16,360
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] people, or
really smart because that's

338
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,880
just not [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

339
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,110
And this particular task.

340
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,570
Try and bias it so that, in that
competitive sense, you

341
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,320
want everyone to feel like they
have a chance of winning.

342
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,080
But I want you to bias your
game towards the--

343
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,350
and whether you win or lose is
going to be based on the

344
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,490
outcome of these decisions.

345
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:40,358
Clearly understanding the
outcome of the decision that

346
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,100
you make in the game.

347
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,620
Not necessarily just what you
wish , or what you were dealt.

348
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,220

349
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,300
You can still use those
things in your game.

350
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,135
Sometimes it's the whole idea of
the, oh my God, I hope it's

351
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:59,440
the right card, aargh.

352
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,310
But then there's things
like probability.

353
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,640
There's, how much information
are you giving to the player

354
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,810
about what the probability that
you have the right card

355
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,410
going to be.

356
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,400
Are you letting them look at
the deck ahead of time?

357
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,510
Are you giving them information
about how many of

358
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,220
those cards are in the deck, so
that you can actually make

359
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,450
guesses on-- all right, we
played through half this deck

360
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:22,042
and we haven't seen any of those
cards yet, that means

361
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,410
the probability of that card
showing up has now gone up.

362
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,350
And now we come to a decision
that you can make.

363
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,180
Do I draw, do I hold--

364
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,000
that sort of thing.

365
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,030
So that's my suggestion
for this class.

366
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:40,884
I would love to be able to see
those kinds of games come out

367
00:16:40,884 --> 00:16:42,134
of this class.

368
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:46,410

369
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,080
So that's all the things
that [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

370
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,530

371
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,360
So, actually, before we move
on, does anyone have any

372
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,610
questions regarding that?

373
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:06,535

374
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:08,900
One point of administration.

375
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,164
Who here needs to print on
the Gambit printers?

376
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:17,304
Or who here has access to other
printers that you guys

377
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,128
are fairly confident about using
for your assignment?

378
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,619
You need a printer?

379
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,757
AUDIENCE: No, did you say that
you need a printer or that you

380
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:25,140
have access.

381
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:25,700
Because you said both?

382
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:25,980
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

383
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,460
So who here needs to use
Gambit printers?

384
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,600
Who absolutely needs to
use Gambit printers.

385
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,698
Because we don't actually have
computers set up for

386
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:35,948
everybody to log in.

387
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:40,846

388
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,552
So I would suggest not using any
of the computers in this

389
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:44,790
lab because [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

390
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,180
lab work on it.

391
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,971
So you've all got access to
printers, that's awesome.

392
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,221
I think you sent out an e-mail
about card stock.

393
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,580

394
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,064
AUDIENCE: That card stock's
actually out of stock.

395
00:17:58,064 --> 00:17:59,810
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

396
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,480
AUDIENCE: I went to order and
I was like, oh, shit.

397
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,730
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

398
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,430

399
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,140
AUDIENCE: Is there like a
Staples somewhere near here?

400
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,290
PROFESSOR: Harvard
has a Staples,

401
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,850
downtown has a staples.

402
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,562
AUDIENCE: CopyTech has--

403
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,910
AUDIENCE: I went to CopyTech and
they said they can print

404
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,270
and cut your cards for you.

405
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,140
PROFESSOR: They have a pretty
awesome card printer.

406
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,805
Their cutter is harsh, harsh.

407
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:26,710
AUDIENCE: What does that mean?

408
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,910
PROFESSOR: Well, first of all,
it's really pointy on the

409
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,140
corners, which is kind of
cool if that's what

410
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,545
you're going for.

411
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,300
But [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

412
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,750
AUDIENCE: Can they round it
or do we have to use--

413
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,750
AUDIENCE: I don't
think they can.

414
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,330
PROFESSOR: They can't.

415
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,330
I have a rounder.

416
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,010
I have a corner punch that, you
have to do it four times

417
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,570
for each card, but--

418
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,537
AUDIENCE: We'll do it.

419
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:46,968
We can do it.

420
00:18:46,968 --> 00:18:49,480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

421
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,720
PROFESSOR: Just ask me and
you can borrow it.

422
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,450
You may want to do it on some
test cards before you really

423
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,150
get a sense of how it works.

424
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,540
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

425
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,390
And I wouldn't suggest
punching more than

426
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,250
one card at a time.

427
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,870
The other thing is, if you're
printing it on a, not like

428
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,760
CopyTech, where they obviously
know what kind of paper works

429
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,664
best with their printers.

430
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:14,185
If you're printing it on
something like a Laserjet, if

431
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:18,280
you go to the paper
manufacturer's website, a lot

432
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,130
of them actually specifically
state Laserjet compatible.

433
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,270
And the problem is actually
the width of the card.

434
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,720
There's not the folding
of the paper as it

435
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,170
goes through the printer.

436
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,722
It's whether the toner will
bond to the paper.

437
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:33,984
Like, does the paper get
hot enough, and open up

438
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:35,180
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

439
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,900
Does the paper get hot
enough for the

440
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,660
toner to actually bind.

441
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,940
And a lot of card stocks
actually don't, because

442
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,840
they're so thick that the heat
doesn't transfer well.

443
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,815
And as a result of that, after
print it looks great when it

444
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:47,530
comes out and it
starts leaking.

445
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,320
So, that's the problem
with the card stock.

446
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,890
Some card stocks will jam your
printer, but the majority of

447
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,940
the modern Laserjets actually
deal pretty well with that.

448

[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

449
00:20:01,552 --> 00:20:02,985
AUDIENCE: Did you want us to
print on card stock for

00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:04,750
Wednesday, or was that
for when it's due?

451
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,058
PROFESSOR: When it's due.

452
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:06,348
AUDIENCE: OK.

453
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:07,770
So Wednesday--

454
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,430

card stock for when

455
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,640
it's due is not necessary.

456
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,740
It is much appreciated.

to do for yourself, if you

want to make copies for your
friends or your team, that you

00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:22,490
actually want to
end up playing.

460
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,210
To be perfectly honest,
if you say--

461
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,210
if our printer wasn't working
and all we could do were these

462
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,260
regular white papers, if I also
cut them in the right

463
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,570
shape, so then we could just
play the game, that's fine.

And we might be able to
help you with that.

481
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,681
But in general, if you've got
access to other printers, go

482
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,154
right for it.

483
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:27,000
Because going through
us is a bottleneck.

Again, not for Wednesday.

485
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:32,610

print something.

You don't want to wait until the
last minute and you don't

00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,230
want to suddenly realize that
your paper doesn't work very

490
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,480
well with the printer
at the last minute.

491
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,290

492
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:54,782
So, today's reading was Bartle
and Chapter 11, I think, of

493
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:58,450
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

494
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,420
And in general, both of them are
asking the same question.

495
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,400
Which is, who are you designing
your game for?

496
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,852
On the assumption that
you're not designing

497
00:22:08,852 --> 00:22:10,210
the game for yourself.

498
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,770
Of course, realistically, if
you're going to get a job

499
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,160
making games, the majority of
the games that you're going to

500
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,988
design are not games for
yourself, they're going to be

501
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,720
games for some other
demographic.

502
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:29,070
And the Bartle paper is a little
bit more influential in

503
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,330
how people think about games,
because it shifted the

504
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,760
question from, what's the age
group, what's the demographic,

505
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,340
what are people out there
who are already buying

506
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,060
games going to want?

507
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,530
And you fit that into, what
sort of things are people

508
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,250
looking for in a game?

509
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,650
He doesn't actually take
it to the next

step, which is where--

511
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,742
I think he wrote that
in the 70s or late

from the 70s, actually.

519
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,610
Because that's when he
made the first MUD.

520
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,070
RIchard Bartle [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

521
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,340
AUDIENCE: What exactly
is a MUD?

522
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,430
They never actually
described it.

523
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,450
They just assumed everyone
knew what a MUD was.

524
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,870
PROFESSOR: MUD stands for
Multi-User Dungeon.

525
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,780
Anyone want to describe one?

526
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:36,360
AUDIENCE: It's like, an online
text-adventure thing, where

527
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,800
everyone's interacting
with the same

528
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,050
text-based dungeon thing.

529
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,040
AUDIENCE: The best way to
describe it is, imagine if WoW

530
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,100
was presented entirely
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

531
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,000

532
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,180
AUDIENCE: I found that kind
of annoying in the text.

533
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,893
He just assumed everyone
knew what a MUD was.

534
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:58,060
But never actually said,
this is what a MUD is.

535
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

536
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,770
Because the whole sort of,
reading the article, actually

537
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,110
I believe he formatted
that for a forum

538
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,670
post for for community.

539
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,470
So there's an assumption.

540
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,350
But yeah, apologies for that.

541
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,330
Actually, if you're interested--
and here he does

542
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,620
define it right at the bottom.

543
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,607
Which is right at the end
of the article here.

544
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,708
He talks about specifically,
this is what I mean by MUD.

545
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,873
Somewhere in the
footnotes--these text

546
00:24:24,873 --> 00:24:28,620
adventures, text-style online
games where multiple people

547
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,300
are interacting.

548
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,900
And if you look at the rest of
the website, there's actually

549
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,860
a bunch of stuff about
how MUDs work.

550
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,200
But, for the most part, that was
sort of online multiplayer

551
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,530
gaming, back when he started.

552
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,670
He's credited for having
built the first MUD.

553
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,690
And, frankly, not all
that different from

554
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,630
MMOGs you get today.

555
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,240
The difference being that
they were all text.

556
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,050
But you still went out
hunting monsters.

557
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,270
They call them mobiles,
or mobs.

558
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,592
And in fact there's
still some of that

559
00:25:05,592 --> 00:25:08,270
terminology going around.

560
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,010
They drop loot.

561
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,570
You will pick up loot
and show it off.

562
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,995
And sometimes, some games
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

563
00:25:13,995 --> 00:25:15,180
loot.

564
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,960
Most games let you
exchange loot.

565
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,460
And then you would use your
loot to go and kill other

566
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,650
monsters and get better loot.

567
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,540
Sometimes you'd do it
with other people.

568
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:26,270
Sometimes you attack
other people.

569
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,620
Sometimes you just hang around
and chat and talk about things

570
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,180
that are completely not in game,
like what did I have for

571
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,200
lunch today.

572
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,450
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

573
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,670

574
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,620
And sometimes it will
take multiple

575
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,664
people to take a monster.

576
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,628
And it was just handled
on a how fast can you

577
00:25:43,628 --> 00:25:45,300
type kind of thing.

578
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,490
Attack monster, attack
monster.

579
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:57,380
I think you can just hit repeat
and but, the behaviors

580
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,260
are also not all
that different.

581
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,520
And how he describes it is, a
game will sight itself in a

582
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,860
position where it is variably
appealing to

583
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,990
various kinds of players.

584
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:18,110
And that's how he
described it.

585
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,100
Where game studies has kind of
gone on to since then, is the

586
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,830
realization that just
because you're--

587
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,080
some people through all the
four types that you--

588
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,116

589
00:26:31,116 --> 00:26:32,426
AUDIENCE: Explorer.

590
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,716
Killer.

591
00:26:34,716 --> 00:26:36,210
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

592
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,190
PROFESSOR: So, there are these
four types of players.

593
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,185
And just because you're an
achiever in one game doesn't

594
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,460
necessarily mean that you're
going to be an achiever in

595
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:43,800
another game.

596
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,640
Different people play different
games, or possibly

597
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,030
even different types
of the same game,

598
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,440
for different reasons.

599
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,620
And that's where we go back to
earlier concepts that we

600
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,450
brought up, is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

601
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:55,840
kinds of fun.

602
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,170
What are people trying to get
out of their game playing?

603
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,340
So, but he was--

604
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,050
if you're looking at the content
of any one of MUD, and

605
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,780
a little slice of what you saw
of somebody's personality,

606
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,754
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

607
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:12,650
and all the things that
they were doing.

608
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,260
And the kinds of things that you
tended to keep doing every

609
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,360
time you logged in, it was very
easy to stereotype them

610
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,820
into somewhere along
those lines.

611
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,954
Even he acknowledges that
nobody's really all the way on

612
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:25,560
one of these layers.

613
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,502
Griefers, I think, are the words
that I hear generally

614
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,740
used for killers nowadays.

615
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,821
But even then, that's
not quite the way

616
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:34,580
that he's using it.

617
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,880
He's actually using it as
somebody who's generally still

618
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,270
playing by the rules
of the game.

619
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,740
They are there to cause misery
to other people, but they're

620
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,150
not there to break the game.

621
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:48,980
There is a class of people
called griefers, who are

622
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,962
deliberately trying to find ways
to exploit the system, to

623
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:56,550
just make the game just
kind of silly.

624
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,390
But all the other dynamics
that he draws on

625
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,320
are very much there.

626
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,480
You get a whole bunch of
socializers together.

627
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,330
People who want to do nothing
but chat and have a good time,

628
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,670
they don't really care about the
game, and there's going to

629
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,240
be a whole bunch of people going
right after them, saying

630
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,640
these are great people
to grief.

631
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,560
Because they are enjoying
themselves so much.

632
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,810
We could end that.

633
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:19,473

634
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:24,270
Second Life gets a lot of this,
because Second Life has

635
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,640
that whole, you can do
anything you want.

636
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,216
And socializing is one
of the big things.

637
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:33,110
Personalizing is one
of the big things.

638
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:39,380
So, do keep in mind that the
way that he's talking about

639
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,290
it, sounds like all of these
different personalities are

640
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,786
somewhat mutually exclusive when
really the discussion has

641
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:52,040
now come to, how do you cater
to all of these different

642
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,940
desires at any given time?

643
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,610
I may be an achiever today, I
may be an explorer tomorrow.

644
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,040
And he even talks about
explorers thinking that

645
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,600
achievers are beginner
explorers, because it's like,

646
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,260
once you've already beaten the
game, what else is there left

647
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,858
to do but explore what
else you can do?

648
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:15,714
So he himself acknowledges that
there's some personality

649
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:19,110
transfer that can happen.

650
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:22,280
But it's kind of interesting
how he talks about the

651
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,210
feedback loops of people.

652
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:32,760
You'll get a whole bunch of
achievers, and you get a whole

653
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,010
bunch of socializers.

654
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,030

you've got the competition

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,260
But he also makes this weird
assumption that there is a

660
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,560
finite pool of people who are
going to be playing the game.

661
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:59,940
Which is actually true, even in
a 10-20 million player game

like in World of Warcraft.

663

the main thing right
now is arenas.

lot of dancing.

692
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,877

693
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:16,860
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

694
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,090
slash dance, maybe, or your
character dances.

695
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,360
And it was those things that
really is popular among

696
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,680
socialized type players
all over--

697
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,540
and Diablo.

698
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,160
But it's not just
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

699
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,823
I mean, slash dance means
other things now.

700
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:37,264
It could mean I'm bored.

701
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:40,148
It's like, I have nothing to do
right now, I have to wait

702
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,970
for this stupid thing to
respawn, slash dance.

703
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,800
It's more fun than just
standing there.

704
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,050
But there is a group in WoW.

705
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,080
And I guess--

706
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,970
maybe not a group.

707
00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:01,384
There are folks who play World
of Warcraft and they engage

708
00:32:01,384 --> 00:32:03,400
you to think on theory crafts.

709
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,520
Which is, how we optimize the
way how you build a character.

710
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,500
And the things that you equip a
character for, to make that

711
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,140
character really, really
good at doing one or

712
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,780
two different things.

713
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,070
So as you're building up a
character that's designed to

714
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,230
heal, what class should they be,
what race should they be,

715
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,470
what equipment should they be
getting, depending on what

716
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,880
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] you
are in the game.

717
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,195
And they're going to try to
derive as much of the math of

718
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:40,800
the cause and effect in the
game as they possibly can.

719
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,050
There is actually
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

720
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,500

721
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,120
which is--

722
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,370
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

723
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:54,160

724
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,280
It's actually kind of funny.

725
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,760
The Elitist Jerks' forums had
one guy who just happened to

726
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,760
write a forum post about
dressing up in real life.

727
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,648
Like, this is how you get really
nice [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

728
00:33:11,648 --> 00:33:16,530
because he worked at a
men's fashion place.

729
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,608
And it it turned out that that
community was really, really,

730
00:33:19,608 --> 00:33:22,476
really interested in learning
more about that.

731
00:33:22,476 --> 00:33:24,320
Which is actually not
all that weird.

732
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,992
It's like, you care about what
armor you get in the game.

733
00:33:26,992 --> 00:33:29,000
You care about what you
wear in real life.

734
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,160
Especially if it might have some
impact on your real life.

735
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,200
What job that you're
looking for.

736
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,590
OK, you know.

737
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,930
So, I would actually put
those more in the

738
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,700
explorers part of things.

739
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,310
Sure, they're looking
to optimize.

740
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,800
They're looking to
do their best.

741
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,990
But they're not looking to be
necessarily rewarded by the

742
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,585
game system.

743
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:49,760
They're using the game system
to test their ideas against.

744
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,452
It's like, I'm looking for a
better way to suck up more

745
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,460
damage, because I'm a tank.

746
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,110
I'm supposed to be absorbing
all the damage.

747
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,010
Or the other as they call it.

748
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,260
Or the attentions of the
characters being controlled by

749
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,010
the computer, while the rest of
my folks put out a lot of

750
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,739
damage, can do their job.

751
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:20,940
But I am not interested in what
the system has deemed to

752
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,639
be, you have absorbed tons
of damage, good job.

753
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,389
I don't care what
the system says.

754
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:29,130
I care how the system operates,
so that I could

755
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:32,746
optimize it through some sort
of metric that I've figured

756
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:35,226
out and my friends have figured
out and the community

757
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:36,714
has figured out.

758
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,512
So I want to understand
the system.

759
00:34:38,512 --> 00:34:39,690
Again, that's what
it comes down to.

760
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,109
The metric that they're using
is, how do I optimize it.

761
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,866
But for the most part, people
who engage in that kind of

762
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:49,110
theory craft, it's like about
this armor combined with those

763
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,660
pants, I've proven something,
those are well in the area of

764
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:58,595
explorers even though their
behavior seems very much,

765
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:00,370
that's the best solution.

766
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:05,040
Whereas achievers are very much
focused on, how do I get

767
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,812
to level-- it's like, how do
I get the coolest mount.

768
00:35:08,812 --> 00:35:13,340
In World of Warcraft you can
ride around and every once in

769
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,380
a while, Blizzard, the company
that makes it, will release

770
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,310
some new stuff.

771
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,540
And the achievers will say,
I've got to get that.

772
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,558
Because the space
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

773
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:25,967
it takes a lot of effort and a
lot of money to be able to get

774
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:26,630
one of those things.

775
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,922
But to be able to get it,
it gives you some

776
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:30,305
recognizable status.

777
00:35:30,305 --> 00:35:33,130
You will see someone with
the limited edition of

778
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,180
some kind of mount.

779
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,944
And you'll know that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is to spend a

780
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:41,070
heck of a lot of time in this
game and play the game really

781
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,490
well, that's the kind
of recognition

782
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,340
they're looking for.

783
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,535
So that's the difference
between

784
00:35:45,535 --> 00:35:48,330
achievers and explorers.

785
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,930
So I want to try one
little activity.

786
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:58,240
Which is, I've got the chart
that Bartle lays out.

787
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,540
The whole player versus--

788
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:02,330

789
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,920
interacting and acting,
player and the world.

790
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,530
And he uses this to describe
where your game could be at

791
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,330
any given time.

792
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:19,080
If you're acting on players
that your game's biased

793
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,000
towards killers.

794
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,105
If you're designing your game
to be more about interacting

795
00:36:24,105 --> 00:36:26,556
with other players, then you're
somewhat biasing it

796
00:36:26,556 --> 00:36:27,830
towards socializers.

797
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,060
Interacting with the world is
more for the achievers.

798
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,620
Acting on the world is more
for the achievers.

799
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,132
Given these quests, I've
beaten all the quests.

800
00:36:38,132 --> 00:36:41,660
I have 100% of the
quests complete.

801
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,700
That's achievers.

802
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,150
And interacting with the world
is more of the explorers.

803
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,800
It's like, what else can
you do in this world?

804
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,160
There are these goals that
are set, that's great.

805
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,635
But how does this world work
that I can do cool stuff.

806
00:36:53,635 --> 00:36:56,110
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
distinction between acting and

807
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:01,060
interacting, incredibly
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], I didn't

808
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,530
really understand what
he was trying to say.

809
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,210
PROFESSOR: It was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

810
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,610
I think he came across
those terms because

811
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,635
they sounded cute.

812
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:12,800
Acting, interacting,
is like a--

813
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,870
AUDIENCE: I mean, can you
interact without action?

814
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,640
PROFESSOR: Well,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

815
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,630
AUDIENCE: What does that mean?

816
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,750
And, like, the really classic
example he gives.

817
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,230
Like, the acting on a play is
like a pure [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

818
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,190
the other player fights back.

819
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,640
There's an interaction there.

820
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:33,970
PROFESSOR: Sure.

821
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,330
But the thing about it--

822
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,580
AUDIENCE: But the difference
there--

823
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,680
PROFESSOR: So I believe what he
means by that is that the

824
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,436
killer is actually less
interested in what the player

825
00:37:41,436 --> 00:37:43,610
does back to him.

826
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,450
In some sense, they are
interacting because they're

827
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:48,050
trying to see what sort
of response they get.

828
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:50,674
It's like, I'm going to do
something to this player.

829
00:37:50,674 --> 00:37:56,230
This player's either going to
die, or fight back, or whine

830
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,250
about the fact that I'm
hitting him so much.

831
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,650
But they're not looking for
the competitive bit.

832
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,718
They're not really interested in
the, and now that person's

833
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:07,702
going to turn around
and attack me.

834
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,115
AUDIENCE: I know, but the whole
point is supposed to be

835
00:38:11,115 --> 00:38:14,660
that killers are griefers, so
they really care about how

836
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,210
people respond to them.

837
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,775
He says later on that one of the
most annoying things you

838
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:23,160
can do to a griefer is
just ignore them and

839
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:23,830
not rise to the bait.

840
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,930
So interacting seems to
be the crucial thing.

841
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,230
Again, I feel like his--

842
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,480
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

843
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,680

844
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,200
AUDIENCE: I kind of see it as,
does the person care about how

845
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,190
the other works, in a sense?

846
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,590
And so it is the case that
a griefer wants to

847
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,400
get a certain reaction.

848
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,540
But beyond that it
doesn't matter.

849
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,920
So in the same case within the
game system, I want it to do

850
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,390
this thing, I want it to give me
points but why it did that

851
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:03,440
or how the mechanic works
is kind of irrelevant.

852
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,740
And that's how I
understood it.

853
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:12,060
AUDIENCE: Well, in particular,
with the interacting, when

854
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,040
somebody is like trying to
player kill or something, the

855
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,300
reaction is not necessarily--
the reaction they're looking

856
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,700
for is to piss somebody
off, right?

857
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,940
And that reaction is not
necessarily part of the game.

858
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:34,000
So, it is acting on them because
you are taking what

859
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,680
the game allows you to do, and
using this against a person.

860
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,680
But you don't care about
what they use in the

861
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,630
game against you.

862
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,750
You more care about this
abstract idea.

863
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,000
So I think the interaction is
not actually part of the game.

864
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,600
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

865
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,243
specifically to do with game
mechanics, whereas interacting

866
00:39:49,243 --> 00:39:52,250
is to do with something
which is--

867
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,980
so maybe acting is something
mechanical, whereas

868
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,380
interacting is something
dynamics-related?

869
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,310
Or?

870
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:06,480
AUDIENCE: Well, I see is as
like, acting is sort of like a

871
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,000
single direction
with mechanics.

872
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,400
So, for example, the mechanic
there is being able to hit

873
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,380
somebody in the head with
your [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

874
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,280
Whereas interacting would be the
case where you are hitting

875
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,710
each other on each others'
heads with your swords.

876
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,840
Which is an entirely
different thing.

877
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,290
And it's more of a competitive
thing rather than the, I just

878
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,540
want to make you angry.

879
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,110
AUDIENCE: I think the
unidirectional perspective

880
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,345
makes sense.

881
00:40:34,345 --> 00:40:35,436
You could think of it
as going with the

882
00:40:35,436 --> 00:40:36,570
hitting on the head example.

883
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,870
If I'm acting, then I care
that information

884
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,080
is flowing one way.

885
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,970
I am dealing damage to you.

886
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,610
If I'm interacting, I'm curious
as to how that is

887
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,483
computed and what that means
for me in return.

888
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:50,060
Does that make sense?

889
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,190
AUDIENCE: So like, if I'm really
bad at terminology--

890
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,942
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

891
00:40:52,942 --> 00:40:56,692
AUDIENCE: A bunch of other
examples of things that you do

892
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:59,320
to maximize interacting
versus acting.

893
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,430
There might be interesting
examples of things like make

894
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,470
super [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

895
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,480
And then the acting ones are
like, make [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

896
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,880

897
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,950
PROFESSOR: So, in the context
of a MUD, a puzzle is often

898
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,670
like a door.

899
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,945
So you've got to solve this
puzzle if you want to get into

900
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:21,410
a new area.

901
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,530
Because that's really
the only thing--

902
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,034
sometimes you get your loot.

903
00:41:27,034 --> 00:41:34,840
And the idea behind that is, you
are either privileging it

904
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,362
to getting people to talk with
each other more and socialize

905
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,670
with each other more.

906
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,600
Or you're privileging it to
getting people to look at the

907
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,330
world more, see more
of the world and

908
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,330
understand how it works.

909
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:52,040
Then in a sense, you don't want
to put too many barriers

910
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,320
between the people who've been
in for a very long time and

911
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,460
the people who just started
playing, the people who are in

912
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,498
one area of the world
and people in

913
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:03,120
another area of the world.

914
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,810
You kind of want quick flow.

915
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,593
So in MUDs, that's one thing
where the definition of

916
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:09,525
puzzles is very specific.

917
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:13,389
It's like, but I have to move
this set of levers.

918
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:14,390
AUDIENCE: Another point that
I've found that's really

919
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,690
strange, because I would expect
an explorer, who is

920
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:22,440
supposed to be a world
interacting person to really

921
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,430
enjoy deep puzzles, which reward
them for knowing more

922
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,840
about the world.

923
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,080
PROFESSOR: But a problem with
puzzles in MUDs is that

924
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,180
they're usually simple
solutions.

925
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,920
So there's less pleasure to be
found in a very difficult

926
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,635
puzzle, because all that
told you was, you just

927
00:42:40,635 --> 00:42:41,530
solved this one thing.

928
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,170
There is still some
pleasure there.

929
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:49,650
The interest that explorers are
way more compelled by--

930
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,040
kind of the latent dynamics--

931
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,650
is understanding the interaction
of how mechanics--

932
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,180
especially [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in a
way that might not have been

933
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,260
originally designed that way.

934
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,303
That's what they're
looking for.

935
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:04,730
They're not looking for, what
is the solution that was

936
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:05,437
designed in the game.

937
00:43:05,437 --> 00:43:07,950
They're looking for, how am I
going to get this game to do

938
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,082
something that it might not
have been designed to do

939
00:43:11,082 --> 00:43:14,940
originally, but would be cool
once I figure it out.

940
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,980
So that, unfortunately--

941
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,440
you are definitely right.

942
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,660
But that one suffers from the
very specific terminology of

943
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:27,070
what a puzzle is in a MUD, as
opposed to the more general

944
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:30,090
definition of what
a puzzle is.

945
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:34,630
The reason why, at least for
achievers, hard puzzles are

946
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,500
very important, because if you
make a puzzle that most people

947
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,158
aren't going to be able to get,
being able to get that

948
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:43,910
puzzle gives you some
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] status.

949
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,290
Usually some sort of visible
reward, even.

950
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:50,090
You are now in a location not
everybody else can get to, or

951
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,251
you now have a piece
of equipment

952
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,970
that no-one else has.

953
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:01,390
Whereas explorers, they will
probably have an advantage in

954
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,180
solving difficult puzzles.

955
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,640
But they're not necessarily the
sort of thing that makes

956
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,840
them want to interact
with the world.

957
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,110
Lots of the mechanics that
interact with each other in

958
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,680
and new and interesting ways,
are more likely to be

959
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,930
interesting to an explorer.

960
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,580

961
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:21,446
But you're right, acting and
interacting are crappy, crappy

962
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:24,620
terminology sort of thing.

963
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,782
AUDIENCE: Are you talking about
how griefers are more

964
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:31,170
like actors, where they just try
to get people to interact

965
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,390
with them, or try to get people
to get annoyed by them.

966
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:36,780
I've definitely seen,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

967
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,490
game design.

968
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:39,720
But [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

969
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,400
300.

970
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,580
Where we watched a video of
griefers in Team Fortress 2,

971
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,410
where there's a certain door
where, if they stand in a

972
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,560
certain spot, it won't open.

973
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,610
So this person started making
everyone interact.

974
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,700
OK, we're going to play
a game today.

975
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,050
If you want to leave, you have
to answer correctly.

976
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:57,460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
is the capital of--

977
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:01,280

978
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,930
AUDIENCE: That I see as more
of an explorer things.

979
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,855
Like, you bounce some weird
combination of the interaction

980
00:45:05,855 --> 00:45:09,320
with the mechanics that allows
you to do something new, which

981
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,783
is turn Team Fortress
2 into a game show.

982
00:45:12,783 --> 00:45:14,110
AUDIENCE: It was pretty funny.

983
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:16,160
AUDIENCE: But people
who can't play.

984
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,172
AUDIENCE: Griefers and explorers
are a combination of

985
00:45:18,172 --> 00:45:21,952
bottle types, if you're going
to be a successful griefer.

986
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:26,170

987
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,460
PROFESSOR: And that's
absolutely true.

988
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,740
If your personality's oriented
one way, you may have to

989
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,864
engage with some other behaviors
in order to be able

990
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,970
to maximize that core behavior
they're looking for.

991
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:43,385
So there are people who are
looking at exploits and trying

992
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:45,410
to understand how the world
works so they can cause

993
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,970
maximum damage and maximum
grief to other people.

994
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,090
That's definitely one good
way of doing it.

995
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,270
But what I find is that as soon
as they find it, they are

996
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,350
not interested in finding
more ways until that

997
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,600
first way gets boring.

998
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,160

999
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,110
Or gets fixed.

1000
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,715
So, people are going to say,
there's a lot of teleporting

1001
00:46:07,715 --> 00:46:10,110
you directly in front of a
turret, stuff like that.

1002
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,815
Teleporting your own teammates
in front of a turret, that

1003
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:13,680
sort of thing.

1004
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,930
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1005
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,826

1006
00:46:16,826 --> 00:46:19,644
AUDIENCE: I don't understand.

1007
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:20,956
PROFESSOR: You don't
understand?

1008
00:46:20,956 --> 00:46:21,630
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1009
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,180
PROFESSOR: It's fun.

1010
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:22,940
AUDIENCE: Griefers.

1011
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:26,250
AUDIENCE: No, it's not.

1012
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,590
AUDIENCE: So, I'm going
to mess with you.

1013
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,750
Just for the hell of it.

1014
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:34,020
AUDIENCE: I remember in Sims
Online, an effective way to

1015
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,460
grief would be to organize a
band of people and arrive on

1016
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,210
that property.

1017
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,580
Since there was a population
limit of 12 people or

1018
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,610
something on any given lot.

1019
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,740
In that lot, was a business that
required a lot of people

1020
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,460
to come through.

1021
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,220
And then you just had
12 of your people

1022
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,220
show up and mill around.

1023
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,660
And say a lot of profanities.

1024
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:56,323
You could tag the place and
lock it up and no-one else

1025
00:46:56,323 --> 00:46:58,078
could go there and visit it,
sometimes including owners and

1026
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:58,360
stuff like that.

1027
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,475
It was very frustrating.

1028
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:04,430
PROFESSOR: In fact, some of
the behavior they did got

1029
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,057
towards organized crime level.

1030
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:11,145
Actually, I mean it wasn't real
crime, it was virtual.

1031
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:14,290
But there are actually a good
number of articles about the

1032
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:16,240
Sims Online mafia.

1033
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,100
Because that game had so
much built in for--

1034
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:23,140
actually for socializers--

1035
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,550
to be able to communicate,
express themselves.

1036
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,000
I mean if you played the
original Sims, there's a whole

1037
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,372
range of different expressive
things that you can do to

1038
00:47:30,372 --> 00:47:33,810
communicate how you're feeling
and to be able

1039
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,780
to chat with people.

1040
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:38,320
And someone, I think it might
have been Maxis itself,

1041
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,000
actually charted out the web of

1042
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,740
influence of all the players.

1043
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,670
And there was one alpha player
who was in charge of

1044
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,240
everything.

1045
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:55,010
And if she decided that this
person wasn't wanted, she

1046
00:47:55,010 --> 00:47:58,750
didn't want, spending too much
time [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1047
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,740
because of how it pissed her off
or piss one of her friends

1048
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,080
off or something, she'd organize
something like that.

1049
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,460
Effectively.

1050
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,320
It was called the Sims mafia.

1051
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,025
and you get that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1052
00:48:11,025 --> 00:48:15,780

1053
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,520
And it's kind of interesting
to see how different worlds

1054
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,918
respond to that.

1055
00:48:19,918 --> 00:48:22,980
Even though in [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
which is--

1056
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,640
actually, one thing I'd like
to do is, I'd like to throw

1057
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,900
different games up
on that chart.

1058
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:36,060
So I am looking mostly
at multiplayer games.

1059
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,470
Preferably online multiplayer
games.

1060
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,200
But, and I don't know all the
games that are out there.

1061
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,440
So, I'd like people
to call-out games.

1062
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,070
And tell me roughly what
I should put up.

1063
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:50,637
If you disagree, then by all
means put up your hand and

1064
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:52,700
suggest that it should
be moved.

1065
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,390
AUDIENCE: Minecraft should go
definitely toward world

1066

AUDIENCE: Like, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1068
00:48:59,795 --> 00:49:03,070
far, far.

1069
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:03,910
AUDIENCE: So what
is Minecraft?

1070
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:07,093
I've heard of it, I just don't
know what exactly it's about.

1071
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:08,837
AUDIENCE: You basically go
around mining things and

1072
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:11,460
creating objects, and you can
create your own worlds.

1073
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,080
AUDIENCE: So it's like--

1074
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,240
I guess?

1075

AUDIENCE: EVE is definitely
world interacting as well.

1076

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1077
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,840
AUDIENCE: So that's
same as EVE.

1078
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,985
AUDIENCE: I would say EVE
is also player to player

1079
00:49:22,985 --> 00:49:24,206
interacting.

1081

AUDIENCE: I'd see it as
in the middle, then.

1082
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,000
AUDIENCE: In EVE you have to
form corporations with bunches

1083
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,450
of people in order
to do anything.

1084
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,440
PROFESSOR: That's true.

1085
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,403
You have to be really good in
your social skills, actually.

1086
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:40,401
It's one of the games that's
most ruthlessly

00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:46,110
AUDIENCE: If you interact
with the people

1091

and the world a lot.

1092
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,800
AUDIENCE: I think it's more
strongly player attracting and

1093
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,080
is world attracting
than most games.

huge amount of achievement and

player versus player conflict
in this kind of stuff.

AUDIENCE: You can die far down
the interacting scale.

1100
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,650
I mean, consider things in
Second Life instead.

1101
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:14,560
Which would be way further down
the interacting end of

1102
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:18,218
the spectrum than EVE

1105
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,215
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure
it's hacking.

1106
00:50:23,215 --> 00:50:25,080
Like, PvP is the opposite
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1107
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,606
AUDIENCE: I mean it's not--

1108
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:28,240
AUDIENCE: I think it's
definitely player interaction

1109
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:30,220
more than player action.

1110
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I believe
it's interaction.

1111
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,950
AUDIENCE: Something like having
PvP tournaments, I

1112
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:36,690
think, would be definitely
a lot of interaction.

1113
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:37,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1114
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,570
I think that's the distinction
between griefing and like

1115
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,075
people fighting each other.

1116
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,740
AUDIENCE: Griefing can be
an [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1117
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,550
AUDIENCE: What I got from this
article is that acting is

1118
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,013
like, I go and kill someone
and ha, I killed

1119
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:50,620
them and that's it.

1120
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,475
Or I go through the world, it's
like, I killed a monster,

1121
00:50:52,475 --> 00:50:53,190
I killed a monster.

1122
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,260
And you just have a goal.

1123
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:55,480
If you want to get the
goal instead of

1124
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,210
diverting from your goal.

1125
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:58,800
So, I don't know.

1126
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,710
I definitely think griefing
can be hugely interactive.

1127
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:04,491
But there could be a
whole bunch of--

1128
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:08,210
in EVE if you infiltrate
someone's company and you--

1129
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,310
AUDIENCE: Steal ten thousand
dollars' worth of their money.

1130
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:10,660
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

1131
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,520
That's hugely interactive
griefing.

1132
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,280
AUDIENCE: I don't think
that's griefing.

1133
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,500
AUDIENCE: Consider Team
Fortress, right.

1134
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,410
There's Team Fortress
player interaction.

1135
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,910
Because that means it's
a socializer game.

1136
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,020
PROFESSOR: I personally do not
think Team Fortress falls

1137
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,850
under player interacting
with team.

1138
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1139
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,121

for Dead is.

PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1141
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:35,940

interaction happening--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1143
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,482
AUDIENCE: I'd say probably
more-- it depends on what

1144
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:38,880
you're doing

1145
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1146
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,170
AUDIENCE: So with Left for Dead
you can play-- you're

1147
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:46,160
interacting, but then you're
also online and you can go

1148
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,840
against other players
who are actually the

1149
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,983
zombies, against you.

1150
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:51,406
PROFESSOR: Right.

1151
00:51:51,406 --> 00:51:55,370
So let's talk about the basic
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1152
00:51:55,370 --> 00:52:02,430
AUDIENCE: So the basic, most
common mode is going to be

1153
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,370
four players playing
cooperatively

1154
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,440
against the game world.

1155
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,860
AUDIENCE: That's just
interacting with the world.

1156
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:17,790
AUDIENCE: And there is a lot
of interaction that goes on

1157
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,808
between players, because you
cannot basically survive

1158
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:22,640
unless you get each
others' backs.

1159
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,080
AUDIENCE: So I would
say it's--

1160
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,440
AUDIENCE: And there's
built-in functions

1161
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,410
to help other people.

1162
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:29,860
So someone might get back up
on a ledge and he'll be

1163
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,130
holding on and you have
to pull him back up.

1164
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:31,410
AUDIENCE: Or smokers.

1165
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,730
AUDIENCE: At the same time,
there's also an intelligent

1166
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,830
engine that plans that level
for you and places zombies

1167
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:43,490
specifically to maintain you
in a state of nervousness.

1168
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,830
And so it's different every
single time you play.

1169
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:49,230
So those balance out and
probably place it somewhere in

1170
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:49,590
the middle.

1171
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:52,501
Maybe a little bit more player
biased than world biased,

1172
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:55,500
because you really have
to stick together.

1173
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,250
PROFESSOR: So, it's weird
because it's almost like, you

1174
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:59,870
want to have like a plane.

1177
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,460
AUDIENCE: I think the big
problem with this sort of

1178
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,650
graph is that you can't really
necessarily separate games

1179

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1184
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,450
AUDIENCE: It might be a little
more useful to actually draw

1185
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:25,090
areas within the graph to
represent a game, I guess.

1186
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:29,230
Draw the area that encompasses
all the pieces the game

1187
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,490
represents.

Halo multiplayer, and player

1191
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,810
versus player.

1192
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,560

1193
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:47,075
That will probably be a little
refinement, if I create some

1194
00:53:47,075 --> 00:53:50,160
sort of scatter chart
or Venn diagram.

1195
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,540
AUDIENCE: Because I could
definitely see there being a

1196
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,450
game where there's a lot of
acting on the world and

1197
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,760
interacting with players.

1198
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,610
And if you're just separating
these into distinct points,

1199
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:01,400
that isn't possible

00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,980
that acting and interacting
are--

Do people generally
accept this?

AUDIENCE: I think if you had
different values for player

and acting would

necessarily be connected.

1216
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,661
I think EVE definitely in world
is very high, and in

00:55:53,285 --> 00:55:57,110
But the real power in the game
comes when players start to

00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,880
Form areas that you can
patrol and control.

1255
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,325
And areas where you want to
agree that if you don't get

00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:13,689
along with the people who are in
control of this space, you

fly in there.

that happen are other

thousands of US dollars of

cash in any of it for real

01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,100
So, groups of four.

1372
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,175
And what I'd like
folks to do--

1373
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:34,425
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] --

1374
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:38,760

1375
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,610
I'd like folks to come
up with other axes.

1376
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:46,110
Not necessarily anything
having to do with

1377
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1378
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:52,264
Give me two things that you feel
are diametrically opposed

1379
01:00:52,264 --> 01:00:56,580
but in describing a game,
or any series of games.

1380
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,180
You can place games
on other sub-axes.

1381
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,076
If we have time, we can talk
about an attitude difference.

1382
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:08,230
But something to help describe
two people, OK, this game is

1383
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,172
on the hard extreme of one,
this game's on the hard

1384
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:13,630
extreme of the other.

1385
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:16,860
The goal here is to come up with
terms that will help you

1386
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:22,160
identify who this game might
be target towards.

1387
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,950
What kind of player might
this game be targeting?

1388
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:28,430
Not necessarily using Bartle's
terminology at all.

1389
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:30,504
Bartle's terminology, as we have
said, is kind of weak, so

1390
01:01:30,504 --> 01:01:36,015
let's throw out some
other words to

1391
01:01:36,015 --> 01:01:37,970
describe games already.

1392
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,486
If that fails, because you
haven't really thought about

1393
01:01:41,486 --> 01:01:44,150
it, to come up with
some new words.

1394
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:45,686
Real game-ish words.

PROFESSOR: Oh, very good.

1399

01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:29,150

1403
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:34,100
I'd rather use more chance or
random to get the point across

1404
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,090
pretty clearly.

1405
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,590
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1406
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:36,950
AUDIENCE: Right.

1407
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:41,220
So I think that axis should be
random, deterministic and/or

1408
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,970
reactive and deliberative.

1409

AUDIENCE: Reactive.

1414
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,034
AUDIENCE: So reactive
and delibrative.

1415
01:02:56,034 --> 01:02:58,140
AUDIENCE: Reactive
and deliberative.

1416
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,475
AUDIENCE: Or random
and deterministic.

1418
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,680
AUDIENCE: So you can definitely
still have

1419
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,030
randomness and have strategy.

1420
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:06,760
AUDIENCE: Right.

1421
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:09,210
AUDIENCE: But random
and deterministic.

1422
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,040
AUDIENCE: They would be
somewhere on the axis, right?

1423
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,770
AUDIENCE: So the problem is, you
can have incredible amount

1424
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:18,020
of randomness but if you
can just figure out the

1425
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,520
probabilities, you
can still have an

1426
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,330
optimum strategy, right?

1427
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,752
AUDIENCE: But then that's
less random.

1428
01:03:22,752 --> 01:03:26,720
PROFESSOR: In doing this, you
can't have a system that is so

complex yet deterministic that
there's no way you can predict

say, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

thing in [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1495
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,530
there's a feature in one of the

01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,980
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in other games
in the series, the story

that that was OK.

01:08:14,241 --> 01:08:15,215
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1544
01:08:15,215 --> 01:08:18,649
And I guess it goes back
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1545
01:08:18,649 --> 01:08:20,190
PROFESSOR: Because the
interesting thing about

1546
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:23,735
multiple solutions and single
solutions is that multiple

1547
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:26,620
solutions-- it could
be all design.

1548
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:29,635
I could design in the game-- in
fact, now, if you play Deus

1549
01:08:29,635 --> 01:08:34,285
Ex, or any of the sequels, they
specifically stated that

1550
01:08:34,285 --> 01:08:38,734
they made this game with
multiple solutions in mind.

1551
01:08:38,734 --> 01:08:42,970
And with the data sets to, they
designed it so that they

1552
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:45,243
thought, this puzzle needs
to have three solutions.

1553
01:08:45,243 --> 01:08:48,180
And they actually will design
an environment for it.

1554
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:54,010
So, while the game kind of tells
us, you get to play with

1555
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:56,120
the system, you get to figure
out how all these things

1556
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,270
combine and come up with
solutions on your own.

1557
01:08:57,270 --> 01:09:03,524
Really, they tried to design it
so that you have three very

1558
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:04,460
clear options at
any given time.

1559
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,856
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1560
01:09:05,856 --> 01:09:07,790
And so you can have multiple
solutions.

1561
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:12,040
Whereas this is like freedom
sandboxing, kind of applies

1562
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,851
not necessarily to design.

1563
01:09:13,851 --> 01:09:17,503
You've got lots of little things
that you can do and

1564
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:20,182
lots of different spaces that
you can explore and design.

1565
01:09:20,182 --> 01:09:23,104
It's not like you've got one
obstacle and three different

1566
01:09:23,104 --> 01:09:25,052
ways to solve it.

1567
01:09:25,052 --> 01:09:27,324
You've got all kinds of
different things that you

1568
01:09:27,324 --> 01:09:27,974
could be doing.

1569
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:28,960
You could be like
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1570
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,974
So these are different axes.

1571
01:09:30,974 --> 01:09:34,026
I just want to point out that
these are different ways of

1572
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:36,698
doing different things.

1573
01:09:36,698 --> 01:09:40,060
AUDIENCE: You can have, in terms
of rule changing games,

1574
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,766
whether it's dynamic rules
or static rules.

1575
01:09:41,766 --> 01:09:42,098
AUDIENCE: Hmm.

1576
01:09:42,098 --> 01:09:47,244
So, hyper-dynamic, static,
and then [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1577
01:09:47,244 --> 01:09:52,722

1578
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:55,010
PROFESSOR: Are the rule going to
change if [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1579
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:58,042
AUDIENCE: There are some games
where the whole point is

1580
01:09:58,042 --> 01:09:59,018
changing rules.

1581
01:09:59,018 --> 01:09:59,994
AUDIENCE: Like Flux.

1582
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:02,434
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1583
01:10:02,434 --> 01:10:04,800
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1584
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,050
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1585
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:13,160

1586
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,410
AUDIENCE: And assuming basically
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1587
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,156

1588
01:10:18,156 --> 01:10:19,647
AUDIENCE: Timescale
of decisions.

1589
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,340
PROFESSOR: So, short model?

1590
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like twitch
games versus thought games.

1591
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,354
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
decisions.

1592
01:10:26,354 --> 01:10:28,839
Sort of like that are
contemplative and reactive.

1593
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:31,324
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1594
01:10:31,324 --> 01:10:34,306
PROFESSOR: Are you guys going
for basically the same thing.

1595
01:10:34,306 --> 01:10:37,504
Like, reactive means things are
coming at you and you have

1596
01:10:37,504 --> 01:10:39,696
to respond really,
really quickly.

1597
01:10:39,696 --> 01:10:41,644
Maybe [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
about it.

1598
01:10:41,644 --> 01:10:45,540
And deliberative is like
a trivia game.

1599
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,790
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1600
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,960

1601
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,280
PROFESSOR: Doesn't necessarily
mean that.

1602
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,900
The kind of turn-based game
is very fast-paced.

1603
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,202
Because the weight of any given
decision is not going to

1604
01:10:58,202 --> 01:10:59,180
be so deep.

1605
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:02,158
So, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1606
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:05,602
I'm just going to put this up
here because I'm running out

1607
01:11:05,602 --> 01:11:07,078
of space [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1608
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:11,020

1609
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,580
that's one way of describing
a game, reactive versus

1610
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,880
deliberative.

1611
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:17,130
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1612
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:19,230

1613
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:23,633
I bet you could take two of
these and put them on an axis

1614
01:11:23,633 --> 01:11:24,945
and then we could
talk about them.

1615
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:26,860
On a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1616
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:30,490
but every once in a while
we find a game that

1617
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:32,320
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1618
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,430
Which is fine.

1619
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:35,743
Which is part of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] to talk about

1620
01:11:35,743 --> 01:11:36,993
these games.

1621
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:38,810

1622
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:42,838
These are really, really
useful terms.

PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1629
01:11:55,707 --> 01:11:59,101
it's a little bit more boxing,
it's a little bit more

1630
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:00,945
restrictive than
predetermined.
