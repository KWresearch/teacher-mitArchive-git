00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,430

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,210
PROFESSOR: Ok, cool.

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,690
So we've been reading
the assignments.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,890
And we realize that there were
a couple of things about how

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,200
to write rules that we hadn't
neccesarily gone through.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,140
One thing that we would like to
see in the next assignment

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,080
are a couple things that I'm
going to read out now.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,890
But we'll probably send
out an email, as well.

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,000
So you can have it
for reference.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,340
So having a paragraph or an
overview that broadly explains

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,375
what the game is about
is actually

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,240
really, really useful.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,870
Just jumping straight
into the--

22
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,430
this is how you set up a border
and this is how you

23
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,250
take a turn.

24
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,000
That's the meat of
the assignment.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,450
But just to help people get
a grasp, especially if you

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,500
thought about your theme
really, really hard.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,280
And this next coming assignment,
your theme is

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,020
right there, explaining who
are you in this game?

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,270
What are you trying to do?

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,880

31
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,960
What's your overall goal
in broad terms?

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,940
Not necessarily very specific
game terms.

33
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,760
Just having one paragraph is
a really, really good idea.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,150
And really, that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

35
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,400
paragraph.

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,070

37
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,736
Two, list the components.

38
00:01:35,736 --> 00:01:39,230
In a card game, it would be
like we have this many red

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,460
cards, this many blue cards.

40
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,060
Just so we know that we've
got everything.

41
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,550
It also helps, sometimes, to
be able to establish the

42
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,840
vocabulary of the game
really, really early.

43
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,030
So if all your red cards are
attack cards, and all your

44
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,180
blue cards are defense cards,
you want to say your deck

45
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,145
should have 25 red attack
cards and 25

46
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,500
blue defense cards.

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,250
And now we know if you use the
words attack card and defense

48
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,270
card later, we now know
what it means.

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,130
So this is obvious from just
looking at currents.

50
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,090
But frankly, when we are
opening up these cards,

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,500
usually, there is one person
looking at the cards and

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,950
somebody else looking
at the rules.

53
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,286
And just having the information

54
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,315
redundant is kind of nice.

55
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:20,610
Let me see.

56
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,930

57
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,830
The number of players--

58
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,580
in this particular assignment,
I'm trying to remember what

59
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,450
the requirements are for.

60
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,050
It was like two to four?

61
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,060
AUDIENCE: Two to four.

62
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,870
PROFESSOR: Two to four.

63
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,750
A number of your previous
projects

64
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,760
actually allow less players.

65
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,420
We want an explicit line that
says this is how many players

66
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,670
your game supports.

67
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,860

68
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,780
Just one line.

69
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,340
Make it like a bullet point.

70
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,320
By the way, bullet points--

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,260
be concise.

72
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,450
Making things really easy to
read is highly valued.

73
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,450
One thing that you absolutely
should do is make sure you're

74
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,620
testing your written rules
as well as your game.

75
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,790
Don't just test the rules
of your game.

76
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,930
And then, you write it down.

77
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,005
And you're never actually
testing the written version of

78
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,870
your rules on someone.

79
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,290
You need to be able to test
your rules, as well.

80
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,062
There are some games that
clearly need that.

81
00:03:22,062 --> 00:03:25,240
And some games that
clearly don't.

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,700
And it showed.

83
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,430
By the way, no one really did
badly on the last assignment.

84
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,350
I'm nitpicking because this
is, obviously, from

85
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,700
B to A. Let's see.

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,390
Expected playing time.

87
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,630
Especially in this next
assignment, if a game tends to

88
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:48,210
take 30 minutes, or if your
game tends to take 10.

89
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,930
Just state it.

90
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,855
In some games, it takes a really
long time to set up and

91
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,310
a really fast time to play.

92
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,360
Then, you just state expected
set up time, expected playing

93
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,610
time [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

94
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,090

95
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,050
There was a lot of assumption in
the rules and in the design

96
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,260
of the game that your
players are male.

97
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,320
This is a very

98
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,540
male-proportioned class right now.

99
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,142

100
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:22,791
But don't assume that
your players are

101
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,179
all going to be male.

102
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,030
It's actually really kind of
off-putting to read a set of

103
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,070
rules that just assumes that if
you're playing this game,

104
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,450
you are a guy.

105
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,790
There are a couple of things
that people have done in

106
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,480
academia to address
that issue.

107
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,750
I've seen papers where they've
used nonspecific

108
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,620
third person pronouns.

109
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,870
They just [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

110
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,410
he/she all the time unless
they're talking about a

111
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,370
specific person.

112
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,510
But in your case, when you're
thinking about your themes,

113
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,880
don't assume that your
players are male.

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,820
You can cast them in
the role of a male.

115
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,480
But don't assume that a player,
itself is male.

116
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,950
AUDIENCE: So I'm just
going to say--

117
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,700
put this out there.

118
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,170
In the English language,
it's actually

119
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,420
very masculine oriented.

120
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,670
So the proper way to say in a
third person, if you're not

121
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,530
saying one says this,
it's actually

122
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:13,790
appropriate to say he.

123
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,470
That's actually proper in
the English language.

124
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,685
PROFESSOR: And I'm saying it's
off-putting from a marketing

125
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:22,990
standpoint to assume that
your players is male.

126
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,770
It goes more than just gender
specific pronouns.

127
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,310
It goes way more than that.

128
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,560
There were a lot of
assumptions--

129
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,630

130
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,970
there were specific rules that
assumed that you were a

131
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,470
straight male in a
couple of games.

132
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,794
So let's be clear about that.

133
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:44,770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

134
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,740
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
mention that from what I've

135
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,140
seen in a lot of rule books, it
seems like a lot of people

136
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,050
solve this problem by just
replacing the assumption that

137
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,660
the player's male with
the assumption that

138
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,380
the player's female.

139
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,030
Yeah, I've noticed this.

140
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,580
Every single pronoun in every
like post second edition

141
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,059
Dungeons and Dragons
book is female.

142
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,330
It's kind of interesting.

143
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,380
PROFESSOR: That's actually kind
of an interesting way to

144
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,340
deal with it.

145
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,960
It's just like you
have a lampshade.

146
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,630
You've got to use a pronoun,
but we don't want to use

147
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,240
language that's going to turn
people off the game.

148
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
So we just want to swap all
the pronouns around.

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,630
And all of a sudden, you
actually have a more

150
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,350
marketable game.

151
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,535
You have a game where someone
is going to read the rules.

152
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,255
And if they're a straight
male reading the

153
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,300
rules, it's like OK.

154
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,290
Clearly it just was a
gender pronoun swap.

155
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,550
But I can read these,
and it makes sense.

156
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,255
Whereas, someone who
is not a straight

157
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:39,360
male reading the rules.

158
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,560
They're going, oh, this
game is not for me.

159
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,980
So I'm not going to
play the game.

160
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,130
That kind of reaction
does happen.

161
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,630
Board games are supposed
to be inclusive.

162
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:46,885
Board games and card cames are
supposed to kind of like be

163
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:54,800
these huge socially enabling
games and [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,990
So keep that in mind.

165
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,822
You want people to
feel welcome when

166
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:58,965
they read the rules.

167
00:06:58,965 --> 00:06:59,880
AUDIENCE: If I could
just interject.

168
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,760
So something that I've seen
that happens a lot in like

169
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,572
[? bridge ?] literature, is they
make your partner-- so

170
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,410
one person, specifically,
is female and

171
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,625
the others are male.

172
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,890
And that way, you kind of
have this inclusivity.

173
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,810
But that helps clarify who
you're talking about.

174
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,801
So if you are writing up
examples, or sample turns, or

175
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,573
that kind of thing, you
can think about doing

176
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:21,380
it that way as well.

177
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,934
Because it does the whole
inclusivity, but then again

178
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:26,269
kind of clarifies who you're
talking about in the set.

179
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,080

180
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,540
PROFESSOR: And we're
in university.

181
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,740
We're trying to be professors
about this.

182
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,910
AUDIENCE: I find it, generally,
people's aversion

183
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:43,639
to writing using pronouns, which
are identity neutral

184
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,372
specifically, people worry
that there's an ambiguity

185
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,821
between singular and plural.

186
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:52,720
And that's why you shouldn't
use that kind of pronoun.

187
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,390
But, for the most part, it's
almost always obvious when

188
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,127
you're talking about one
person [INAUDIBLE].

189
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:01,869

190
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:02,990
AUDIENCE: I don't even
see really why

191
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,610
this is still an issue.

192
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:04,810
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

193
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,060
It's one of those things where
it's not technically correct

194
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,000
to say if I'm referring
to a single person

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,035
to say they or their.

196
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:16,165
But then, if you're reading,
other people will say do that.

197
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,951
A lot of people are just still
using he or she now.

198
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:20,352
It's certainly awkward.

199
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,220
It's kind of [INAUDIBLE].

200
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,910
PROFESSOR: You can also use
second person language-- you.

201
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,265
When it's your turn,
you blah blah blah.

202
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:36,474
And also, the one player is a
great substitue for all that.

203
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,438
Say player one, player two.

204
00:08:38,438 --> 00:08:39,688
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

205
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:43,840

206
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,780
And it's tough.

207
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,110
It's tough to write
stuff like this.

208
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,990
But sometimes I find writing
constraints, writing gets

209
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,510
better because you're more
focused on how your writing is

210
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,480
going to be received.

211
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,250
And we're, frankly, trying to
encourage everything in your

212
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,390
games to be better.

213
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,200
I guess this is something
that I hit on earlier.

214
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,210
Try to go for short sentences.

215
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:08,070
Not paragraphs or prose.

216
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,030
Those are actually difficult to
read when you're trying to

217
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,210
also process what the moves
are going to be.

218
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,510
Go for active voice, rather
than passive voice.

219
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,925
I personally, automatically,
write passive voice when I'm

220
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:21,890
writing in a report.

221
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,010
And I have to physically
change myself and tell

222
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,520
Microsoft Word to highlight
every single instance of

223
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,190
passive voice so that I can
accurately correct that.

224
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,220
Microsoft Word doesn't do a
great job in highlighting

225
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,240
every single instance.

226
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,290
But if you do this often enough,
you start picking it

227
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,860
out yourself.

228
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,270
It's actually easier to read.

229
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,770
It's uncomfortable if you're
moving from the field of

230
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:50,390
writing chemical papers into
writing for general public.

231
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,562
But active voice is easier
for someone to read.

232
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,812
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

233
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:57,734

234
00:09:57,734 --> 00:10:00,810
This one I might need more
help and detail.

235
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,075
These substeps of actions.

236
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:06,500

237
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,630
GUEST SPEAKER: When you're
going through the

238
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,010
instructions, it's really
helpful to have numbered

239
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,254
sequences instead of having a
chunk of prose that's saying

240
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:15,222
first do this.

241
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:15,706
Then you do this.

242
00:10:15,706 --> 00:10:16,674
Just bullet point it.

243
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,126
Or make it a numbered list.

244
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:21,520
And it's a lot easier for
people to follow.

245
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,400
Generally speaking, bullets
versus numbers.

246
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,165
You should use a numbered list
if a sequence really matters

247
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,917
versus bulleted lists are more
like these are the things that

248
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:30,518
are important.

249
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:32,434
But there's not necessarily
a temporal relationship

250
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,684
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

251
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:35,790

252
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,410
PROFESSOR: So just some tips.

253
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,260
In the end, every single game
that we played, we could play.

254
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,020
It didn't take us long to figure
out what was necessary.

255
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,475
The games were good.

256
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:49,385
The games were entertaining.

257
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:51,810
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

258
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,780
extra people to come
in and play.

259
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,205
And we don't [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

260
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:58,115
to play again just
the two of us.

261
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,090
Yeah.

262
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,532
I'm actually really, really
impressed because it's a

263
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:02,780
marketing group.

264
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,226
I know with previous classes
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

265
00:11:07,226 --> 00:11:10,190
[APPLAUSE]

266
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:12,660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

267
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,380
Yay.

268
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:15,740
All right.

269
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,182
So that was the stuff
on your assignment.

270
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:22,990
And now onto intellectual
property.

271
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,202
Actually how many people figured
out that we had given

272
00:11:27,202 --> 00:11:28,525
you the wrong chapter to read.

273
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:29,845
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

274
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:30,280
PROFESSOR: OK.

275
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:30,660
All right.

276
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,320
For those of you who
ended up rereading

277
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,980
chapter three, I'm sorry.

278
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,340
It's not a huge chapter.

279
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,680
But I kind of want to talk about
two different things,

280
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,610
both of which are related to
intellectual property.

281
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,840
What is the version of
intellectual property that

282
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,380
presented to you in the book.

283
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:55,630
In that sense, that's kind of
the game designer concept of

284
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,570
what intellectual property is.

285
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,650
Often it means a franchise.

286
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:04,090
Often it means somebody else's
story wall or characters.

287
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,330
Maybe it's real people
and images, like the

288
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,725
faces and the bodies.

289
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:11,050
In sports games, you have
to deal with that a lot.

290
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:14,210
There was a conference
this last weekend.

291
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:20,100
And one of the old guards of
the Boston game development

292
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,080
team, who now runs iRacing, was
talking about the amount

293
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,232
of effort it takes to actually
license a NASCAR car.

294
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:28,520
Because it's not just a car.

295
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:33,220
But every single logo that's on
their car, and the person

296
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,560
who's inside it, and the uniform
that they're wearing,

297
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,876
every single logo on their
uniform, and their face.

298
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,732

299
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:44,205
There's a lot that goes into
licensing for that.

300
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,765
It helps that the person who now
owns iRacing is also the

301
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,698
same person who owns
the Red Sox.

302
00:12:48,698 --> 00:12:53,420
So they've got the bank roll to
be able to do all of this.

303
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,620
But that's the idea
of what IP is from

304
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,920
industry point of view.

305
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,810
And there's a couple of
things that you can

306
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,040
do to consider that.

307
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,770
Not just all right, how do we
design this game so that we

308
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,290
can minimize how much IP
we need to license?

309
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,275
Licensing IP generally means
licensing money that needs to

310
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:17,640
be exchanged.

311
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,010
That means that your splitting
up their royalties or you're

312
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,310
just putting up money
up front.

313
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,550
Of course, this goes for things
like licensed music,

314
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,860
for instance.

315
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,770
EA has an entire music
department.

316
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,400
Sega has an entire
music department.

317
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,175
Its job is either to create
their own music, or more

318
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:34,380
likely, license popular music.

319
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,950
And, of course, with Harmonix,
that's half the

320
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,560
business right there.

321
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,786
Probably be bought,
at this point.

322
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,790
The other thing they can do is
that, assuming that you are

323
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,660
working with a license.

324
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,540
And the reason why you're
working with licensing--

325
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,160
think of Star Wars, which came
up in the last class.

326
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
How do we do justice to it?

327
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,550
How do we sort of make sure
that the fans of those

328
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,000
particular intellectual property
franchises are going

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,960
to look at this game that we're
creating, and say, yeah,

330
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
that's faithful?

331
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,050
That makes sense.

332
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,630
We'll be actually playing a
lot more of those games, I

333
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,410
think, later on.

334
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,200
For things like Battlestar
Gallactica.

335
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,330
But let's take LEGO Star
Wars as one example.

336
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,810
If you're a fan of LEGO then,
you're probably a fan of

337
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,030
building things up with
little tiny blocks.

338
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,570
You like making stuff combine.

339
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,990
And you kind of like the whole
blockiness, that look of it.

340
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,390
So the folks who made
LEGO Star Wars--

341
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,256
I think they are called
Traveller's Tales.

342
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,972
And LEGO Indiana Jones
and those there

343
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:37,163
was a bunch of games--

344
00:14:37,163 --> 00:14:39,860
kind of had to play that up.

345
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,520
They made a lot of obstacles
in the game.

346
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,010
Things that you had to put
together with parts.

347
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,390
Sure, it is holding one button
into assemble it from a bunch

348
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,480
of disconnected parts.

349
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,760
But creating all that animation
and sort of making--

350
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,320
this is one of the main game
mechanics of the entire game

351
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,380
was a decision they had to
make. and they're very

352
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,750
consciously making that because
with LEGO, we're going

353
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,980
to assume people are going
to make things.

354
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,460
And then you find parts in the
entire game that you can later

355
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,480
go back to a trophy room and
can see your trophies,

356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,830
statues, and objects from the
game builds that you're trying

357
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,080
to do sort of built up.

358
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,430
So the more parts you find--
they're like the hidden

359
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,650
collectibles that you find
in Grand Theft Auto.

360
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,110
They're kind of hidden away
in secret locations.

361
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,810
And you find more of them--

362
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,510
you go back to your trophy room
and oh, wow, your X-wing.

363
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,910
Or you have part of an X-wing.

364
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,400
You haven't found half of it.

365
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,810
So all you've got
are the wings.

366
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,600
And none of the guns or
something like that.

367
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,240
They've actually figured out a
way how that weaves back into

368
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,160
basic game mechanics but is
still appealing to LEGO fans.

369
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,840
If you get chopped in half
by a lightsaber,

370
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,170
you fall into pieces.

371
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,830
You don't actually bleed.

372
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,670
When the characters walk, they
actually walk like that.

373
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,910
They're a little bit
more flexible

374
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,290
than actual LEGO pieces.

375
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,475
They don't just move down
like the right angles.

376
00:15:59,475 --> 00:16:02,010

377
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,970
But they try.

378
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,350
They try really, really
hard to make

379
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,600
everything look plasticy.

380
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,110

381
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,100
And it's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

382
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,170
The same thing goes
with Star Wars.

383
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,350
Right?

384
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,730
What are the things that people
expect from Star Wars?

385
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,460
AUDIENCE: Lightsabers.

386
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,200
PROFESSOR: Lightsabers.

387
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,890
OK.

388
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,110
Anything else?

389
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,900
AUDIENCE: The Force.

390
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,520
PROFESSOR: The Force.

391
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,390
OK.

392
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,240
AUDIENCE: Darth Vader.

393
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,870
PROFESSOR: Darth Vader.

394
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,110
You've got to have Darth--

395
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:28,520
Well, they're doing it on the
Episodes Four, Five, and Six.

396
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,930
Actually, I believe Darth Vader
is still unlockable on

397
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,360
Episode One, Two, and Three
because people expect there to

398
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,260
be a Darth Vader.

399
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,580
AUDIENCE: Generally,
they use the main

400
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,850
characters from the films.

401
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,350
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the main
characters from films.

402
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,320
AUDIENCE: Dog fights.

403
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:43,540
PROFESSOR: Dog fights?

404
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,220
You mean like--

405
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,520
that's actually interesting
because I believe they

406
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,770
actually didn't do that.

407
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,490

408
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,620
They didn't manage
to put that in.

409
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,375
But in a lot of other Lucas
games they did.

410
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:58,924
They focused mostly
on space fights.

411
00:16:58,924 --> 00:17:00,298
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

412
00:17:00,298 --> 00:17:00,760
AUDIENCE: Catch phrases.

413
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,400
PROFESSOR: Catch phrases.

414
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,890
I think they've weaved the catch
phrases into the names

415
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,420
of the levels because
they can't--

416
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,695
not that [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

417
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,742
AUDIENCE: Nobody ever
says, I've got a bad

418
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,310
feeling about this?

419
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,770
PROFESSOR: I think there's a
title of a level that says,

420
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,430
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

421
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,420
Because there's no dialog.

422
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,540
No one says anything.

423
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,966
The only thing that says
anything is R2-D2.

424
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:25,574
And that's just a voice over.

425
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:27,800
AUDIENCE: Actually, I have a
really good example of catch

426
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,930
phrases in, I think Rogue
Squadron on Nintendo 64.

427
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,015
There's this line in the Star
Wars movies, where Luke is

428
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,200
like, that stabilizer's
broken loose.

429
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,650
If you can, lock it down.

430
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,845
Every like second time
you get shot,

431
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,260
they play that recording.

432
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,400
[LAUGHTER]

433
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
And it just even like cut scene
you where this other

434
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,530
pilot is like, Luke, my
stabilizer's broken loose.

435
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:52,400
And he's like, see if you
can't have your R2

436
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,880
unit lock it down.

437
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,770
[LAUGHTER]

438
00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:01,560
So yeah, I mean a good example
of the worst end is that game.

439
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,670
PROFESSOR: You can over do it.

440
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,460
I'm trying to remember
how the force works.

441
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,097
I think you can assemble LEGO
blocks from a distance in Star

442
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:12,910
Wars if you're playing
Obi-Wan.

443
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,520
It's kind of, "oooo." And
then, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

444
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,290
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

445
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,520
PROFESSOR: Call Yoda.

446
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,860
Obviously, Darth Vader
is in there.

447
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,050
Darth Vader is in the first
cut scene, obviously.

448
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,420
AUDIENCE: Yoda is?

449
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

450
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,030
All the big characters have
got to be there, right?

451
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,840
You've got to have your Luke.

452
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,210
You've got to have your C-3PO.

453
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,260
And the interesting thing
about every LEGO game--

454
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:36,710
this is a nice mix between LEGO
and Star Wars is that you

455
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,150
can play any level with
any character.

456
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,605
So after you've beaten it once,
I think you unlock the

457
00:18:42,605 --> 00:18:45,440
ability to swap characters in,
which is more of a LEGO kind

458
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,090
of thing, right?

459
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,250
I'm just going to take the
characters from the Harry

460
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,130
Potter set and put them in the
LEGO Star Wars game and see

461
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,590
what happens.

462
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,290
But that's one thing
that you get.

463
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,550
You get to unlock all
these characters.

464
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,655
So you can play the whole game
with [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

465
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:03,400

466
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,110
GUEST SPEAKER: You want
to add the locales?

467
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,040
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

468
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,220
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah.

469
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,470
The locations.

470
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,290

471
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:14,390
At least some acknowledgment
that there is some sequence of

472
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,820
when people go to each locale.

473
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,120
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, the LEGO
games, in particular,

474
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,040
basically, follow the events of
the movies, specifically.

475
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,700
So it's like each separate event
in the movie is kind of

476
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,410
it's own level.

477
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,340
PROFESSOR: Mos Eisley
Cantina is one

478
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,390
chunk of this one level.

479
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,752
And you beat that, and you're
going to-- what happens after

480
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:33,962
the cantina?

481
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:37,350
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

482
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,600
Tatooine.

483
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,840

484
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,170
AUDIENCE: Probably in
some Death Star.

485
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,110
AUDIENCE: Death Star yeah.

486
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,582
PROFESSOR: Oh right, right.

487
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:49,080
I was going to say, someone
should invent a game where it

488
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,554
has all the LEGO games.

489
00:19:51,554 --> 00:19:52,462
And you can any of the
characters, interchangably

490
00:19:52,462 --> 00:19:53,370
between them.

491
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,180
PROFESSOR: Well, there's one
company that already has

492
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,510
technology for that.

493
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,330
And I would to see LEGO Star
Wars slash Indiana Jones.

494
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:03,120

495
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,415
Even better you can change
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

496
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:07,838
Indiana Jones, which
is about it.

497
00:20:07,838 --> 00:20:09,332
AUDIENCE: Like take
off the hat.

498
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:09,830
PROFESSOR: Blaster?

499
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,330
Whip!

500
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,680
One thing which these particular
games have done a

501
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,110
really good job with
is they'll always

502
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,390
bring the music over.

503
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,090
Actually, every single Star Wars
game has been very, very

504
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,710
careful about making sure that
it sounds like Star Wars.

505
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,246
The sound effects
and the music.

506
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:26,560
[INAUDIBLE]

507
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,990
A lot of it is actually
developed with the Lucas Arts

508
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,680
license, which is, obviously,
under the Lucas umbrella.

509
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,090
So it makes it a little
bit easier.

510
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:43,860
The company of the whole Lucas
family, Lucas Arts, Lucas Film

511
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,940
is actually really, really
tightly centrally controlled

512
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,980
by Lucas, himself.

513
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,540
Partly for quality control,
partly for

514
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,570
control freak issues.

515
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:57,320
In the end, what it does make it
really, really easy as for

516
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,288
say-- how many folks paid
for The Force Unleashed?

517
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:02,212
AUDIENCE: The live action
trailer was awesome.

518
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:04,060
The second one?

519
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,186
AUDIENCE: Oh, I haven't seen
live action trailer.

520
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,222
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] they
blend the in-game footage

521
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:09,287
and live action to get
back and forth.

522
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:13,366
And it's really hard to tell
where [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

523
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:15,150
PROFESSOR: I actually wonder
whether the character is

524
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,170
actually based on the case
of the real world.

525
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,700
AUDIENCE: It must be because
it's the exact same face.

526
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,950
PROFESSOR: OK.

527
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,560

528
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,751
A lot of the assets that are
used in the movies were

529
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,190
brought over into the game.

530
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,920
Obviously with with some tweaks
to make it run better

531
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,380
in the game.

532
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,610
A lot of stuff in the force
unleashed, like when you use

533
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,859
your force power and smash
things, which is actually most

534
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:40,500
of the game, if I recall.

535
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,040
A lot of that same technology
is actually technology that

536
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,610
they use in the films to
simulate things being smashed.

537
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,970
That being said, that particular
example is probably

538
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,310
not even a good instance of
something that any player is

539
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,710
going to notice.

540
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,410
It's like, why do I care that
things that are breaking in

541
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,380
the game, break exactly the
same way in the movie?

542
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,630
But they do.

543
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,550

544
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,230
More usefully you
see art assets.

545
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:08,055
You see the same concept art
moving between the games,

546
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:08,960
moving smoothly.

547
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,730
Traveller's Tales is actually
an illegal Star Wars game.

548
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,080
They're a little bit
further out.

549
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,580
Obviously, those are
third party.

550
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,390
Those are separate from
the Lucas family.

551
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,340
They had to actually license
both LEGO and Star Wars.

552
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,050
But they already had a
relationship with Star Wars.

553
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,350
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

554
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,445
So it was a little bit easier
for them to negotiate that.

555
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:31,790
And as a game developer issue
issue, I believe, with the

556
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,810
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and how they
actually managed that.

557
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:39,500

558
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,880
Again, they're going to
be very, very capital.

559
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,308
Even though it's not Lucas's own
company, they're going to

560
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:49,060
be very, very capital and at
least matching up with Lucas's

561
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,660
control of the product.

562
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,440
And if you're a developer
working with a license, often,

563
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,590
it's just a long process of just
earning trust back from

564
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,090
the original license holders.

565
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,580
[? Jason Beam ?]

566
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,130
is actually a partner
entering this lab.

567
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,900
And he used to work with THQ,
which made a lot of DS and Wii

568
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,560
titles, specifically on Disney
and Pixar products.

569
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,330
One problem with the DS is that
it doesn't have a huge

570
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,500
amount of 3D processing
quality.

571
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,334
Whereas, obviously Pixar movies
have all the power in

572
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:30,060
the world to do awesome
looking 3D.

573
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,080
So some of the tricks that they
have to do to be able to

574
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,650
get the characters--

575
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,990
to be faithful to the characters
in the movie are

576
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,890
kind of interesting.

577
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,660
So the folks who work
for Pixar films--

578
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,460
a lot of them have these opening
and closing sequences

579
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,410
that are actually animated in
completely different style.

580
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,835
Maybe it's hand drawn, maybe
it's paper cutouts.

581
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:55,540

582
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,306
And those are still emblematic
of Pixar style, even though

583
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:03,600
they're not super 3D,
realistically rendered.

584
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,340
And a lot of DS games that
[? Jason Beam ?] worked out

585
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,480
will use those tricks.

586
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,360
They'll make a game.

587
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,220
Instead of making it look like
it's all 3D, you can make it

588
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:16,690
look like it's all cut out of
cardboard because that's part

589
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,400
of the movies.

590
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,985
And the DS has a much easier
time with that.

591
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,780

592
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,430
One thing that's kind of useful
when you're thinking

593
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,580
about what to take from a
franchise or license is to

594
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,920
look at the verbs that come
out from that franchise.

595
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,290
I think we have enough time.

596
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:44,320
I'd like to do an exercise where
we pick out a franchise.

597
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,860
And you just try to come up
with a bunch of verbs that

598
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,820
make that franchise unique or at
least you expect to see in

599
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,010
a franchise.

600
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,520
But I'd like some examples.

601
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,490
I'm going to just start with
movies and see if you can get

602
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,740
at least one that everyone's
fairly familiar with.

603
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,375
And if not, then I'll try books
or other kinds of media

604
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,310
properties.

605
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,080
Anyone want to throw out a movie
that maybe everyone in

606
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,250
here should be familiar with?

607
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,340
AUDIENCE: Independence Day.

608
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,810
PROFESSOR: Independence Day?

609
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,180
Has anyone not seen
Independence Day?

AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

611
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,180

612
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
PROFESSOR: Actually, let's
just throw out a few

613
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
brainstorming ideas.

614
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,180
There's Independence Day.

PROFESSOR: I'm going
to go this way.

618
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:34,957
AUDIENCE: Ferris Bueller's
Day Off.

619
00:25:34,957 --> 00:25:36,406
AUDIENCE: Twilight.

620
00:25:36,406 --> 00:25:37,800

AUDIENCE: The Matrix.

625
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:43,520
PROFESSOR: OK.

626
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,350
We hit some in there.

627
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,240
And I think that's all
I can remember.

628
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,036
So Inception, Iron Man, The
Matrix, Ferris Bueller's Day

629
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:58,330
Off, Independence Day, Twilight,
Lord of the Rings.

630
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:00,900
AUDIENCE: I've never
seen Twilight.

631
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm going to pick Inception.

632
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,194
Who has not seen Inception?

633
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:05,150
AUDIENCE: You should.

634
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,460

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

636
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,310
PROFESSOR: Which

637
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:14,266
AUDIENCE: I've seen all
the other ones.

638
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,700
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

639
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,524
PROFESSOR: My problem with The

640
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,030
AUDIENCE: Has everyone seen
Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

641
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,464
AUDIENCE: Nope.

642
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,420
AUDIENCE: Have you seen it?

643
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,376
AUDIENCE: Nope.

646
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:28,750
AUDIENCE: Monty Python, yeah.

647
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,930
PROFESSOR: Monty Python?

648
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,480
Does anyone not know
Monty Python?

649
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,170
AUDIENCE: Wait--

00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,150
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

653
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,535
AUDIENCE: Home Alone.

654
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:37,785
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

655
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:40,840

656
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,562
PROFESSOR: There might have been
a Home Alone game, but I

657
00:26:42,562 --> 00:26:44,540
bet no one here has played it.

658
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,500
AUDIENCE: I have.

659
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,460
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

660
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,860
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

661
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,620
PROFESSOR: That is impressive.

662
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,470
AUDIENCE: They're for the
original Game Boy.

663
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,000
PROFESSOR: Oh, okay.

664
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,950
AUDIENCE: It's actually one of
the first Game Boy games my

665
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,090
brother ever got.

666
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,410
AUDIENCE: That's old.

667
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

668
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,566
PROFESSOR: OK.

669
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,068
Let me try Lord of the Rings but
maybe a specific Lord of

670
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:04,695
the Rings movie.

671
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:15,440
AUDIENCE: [TRANSPOSING VOICES]

672
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,910
AUDIENCE: --The Matrix.

673
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,550
How about The Matrix.

674
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,955
PROFESSOR: No, the problem with
The Matrix is that there

675
00:27:18,955 --> 00:27:21,238
are too many games on it.

676
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:23,720
AUDIENCE: The Two Towers?

677
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,580
PROFESSOR: I'm really curious
about Ferris Bueller's

678
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:29,265
Day Off as a game.

679
00:27:29,265 --> 00:27:33,050
If somebody would like to
volunteer a quick summary of

680
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,776
what Ferris Bueller's
Day Off is about?

681
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,060
AUDIENCE: Which is Matthew --

682
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,980
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

683
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,500
AUDIENCE: Well, OK.

684
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,540
So the basic idea is the main
character is Ferris Bueller

685
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:45,390
played by Matthew Broderick.

686
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,710
The idea is that he's the
infamously super popular like

687
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,850
class clown kid in school.

688
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:58,420
And he decides to just play
hooky with, essentially, his

689
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,200
girlfriend and his
best friend.

690
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,130
And the whole movie is them
going around the city getting

691
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:07,240
into wacky misadventures while
the principal tries to catch

692
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,620
him playing hooky because
he hates him.

693
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,130

694
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:12,925
AUDIENCE: That is awesome.

695
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,050
AUDIENCE: It is incredible.

696
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,942
PROFESSOR: So actually that
white board would be--

697
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:21,498
AUDIENCE: Has anyone heard the
Fight Club theory on Ferris

698
00:28:21,498 --> 00:28:21,864
Bueller's Day Off?

699
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,325
AUDIENCE: No.

PROFESSOR: --because I think,
that game would have

715
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,472
benefitted from the exercise
that we're about to do.

both controllers

bring out the note pad thing.

727
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,370
And I want people to start
thinking about verbs.

728
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,054
What are the verbs that
make Ferris Bueller's

729
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:30,710
Day Off kind of unique?

730
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,544
Or really that's what you think
of when you think of

731
00:29:35,544 --> 00:29:36,950
Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

732
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,830

What do they do?

735
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,610
What do the characters do?

736
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,498

748
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:05,850
So they sing.

749
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,072
They deceive or lie.

750
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,800
AUDIENCE: They run.

751
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,750

PROFESSOR: They get
in trouble.

770
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,390
There's not a real
verb for that.

771
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,378

is a word that should

776
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,510
probably be in there.

777
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:57,266
That might be an actually a back
of the box or tagline.

778
00:30:57,266 --> 00:30:59,560
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

779
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,470
What else?

780
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,970
Anything else they do there?

781
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:03,970

AUDIENCE: Yeah, they
take advantage.

789

790
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,510
PROFESSOR: OK.

791
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,400
They exploit [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:23,520

AUDIENCE: That's good.

796
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,682
At some point they relax.

a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

812
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:52,110
That's too easy.

813
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,780
There's a movie about that.

814
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,030
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

815

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:03,960
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

819
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,155
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

820
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,591
What else?

821
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,962
AUDIENCE: It's a classic line.

822
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:07,680
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

823
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,950
PROFESSOR: Do they ever
support each other?

824
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,476
Or do they just stress
each other out?

825
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:15,710
AUDIENCE: They may just
stress each other out.

826
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,100
AUDIENCE: They plan.

827
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,030
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

828
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,136
AUDIENCE: Scheme.

829
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,350
No, they scheme.

830
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,260
AUDIENCE: Scheme.

831
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,120
AUDIENCE: Scheme is so much
better than plan.

832
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,720
AUDIENCE: I don't like these
negative words for him.

833
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
PROFESSOR: This may not be what
the main characters do,

834
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,920
but they campaign.

835
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,790
They run a campaign
to save Ferris.

836
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,330

837
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,502
So the idea is that Ferris is
basically pretending that he's

838
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:42,410
deathly ill.

839
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,560
And so a bunch of the students
in the school are running a

840
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,657
campaign to raise funds for
his medical expenses.

841
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:49,116
AUDIENCE: Well, everyone
says it.

842
00:32:49,116 --> 00:32:52,330
Like the police station says,
tell your brother feel better.

843
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,215
And also the water tower has
Save Ferris printed on it.

844
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:57,660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

845
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

846
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,330

847
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,810
And you can think about what
those verbs associated with

848
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,890
like putting signs
up and painting.

849
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,767

850
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:13,450
And if you look at this
list, the list can

851
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:15,194
probably get much longer.

852
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,570
But this is a fairly
unique collection.

853
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,230
Maybe it's all unique if you
compare it to other, sort of,

854
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,790
hijinks movies.

855
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,510
But it's not like we've had
a lot of video games, in

856
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,390
particular, that are
in that game.

857
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,390
And we probably should have
because it sounds like it's

858
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,330
going to be a heck
of a lot of fun.

859
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,460
Actually, the one theme that
reminds me of this is actually

860
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,060
Bully, which was released
by Rockstar.

861
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,620
Where you sort of
do these things.

862
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,490
But it's much more vengeful.

863
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:52,710
It's much more I'm going to show
the other bullies in the

864
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,470
school how [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

865
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,090
Whereas this one is kind
of more good natured.

866
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,197
They parade.

867
00:34:00,197 --> 00:34:01,447
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

868
00:34:01,447 --> 00:34:04,020

869
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,580
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
is also part of the

870
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,850
singing badly part.

871
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

872
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,340
AUDIENCE: You get the girlfriend
and then they sing

873
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,629
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

874
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,310
PROFESSOR: But singing badly
wouldn't have the same impact

875
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,900
if there wasn't a brass
band behind him.

876
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,760

877
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,360
So you can think about how any
of these verbs-- and we've

878
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,850
done this exercise by taking
verbs and turning them into

879
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,550
game mechanics before.

880
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,912
And you can think about how
any of these verbs could

881
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:27,162
actually be turned
into a game.

882
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:29,580

883
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,944
Kiss might be a goal or it might
be a rule, a mechanic,

884
00:34:32,944 --> 00:34:36,020
to be able to accomplish
something.

885
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,389
Parade might be a setting.

886
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:41,785
Campaign might be a collection
of mechanics that feed off

887
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:42,150
each other.

888
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,229
It could be a whole system that
tells you how successful

889
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:46,340
your Save Ferris campaign
is going.

890
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,565
You could make a game that's
just all about saving Ferris,

891
00:34:47,565 --> 00:34:50,570
as opposed to playing Ferris
Bueller himself.

892
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:56,020

893
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:00,070
And that's kind of one exercise
that you can do when

894
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,690
you're thinking about your
reward systems and all the

895
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:04,810
systems that you guys have
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] as far as I

896
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,050
can recall.

897
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,860
You don't have to worry about
licensing the idea.

898
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,880
But you're basically working
with a real live franchise.

899
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
And if you're doing something
based on political diplomacy

900
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,040
or something like that, then
there are real life source

901
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,345
material things that you're
trying to be faithful to.

902
00:35:21,345 --> 00:35:22,940
And going through
this exercise--

903
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,860
OK.

904
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,890
What are all the verbs in this
idea that we're working with?

905
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,110
This isn't going to work--

906
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,710
What do people actually do?

907
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,142
It's a good exercise to be able
to try to be faithful to

908
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:34,830
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

909
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,750
And then, you don't have to pick
all of them, of course.

910
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,440
You're just going
to cherry pick.

911
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,510
And you want to prioritize
a little bit.

912
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:39,980
OK.

913
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,990
What things can we get rid of
and very still clearly be

914
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,340
Ferris Bueller game.

915
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,720
Running.

916
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,890
I think as long as we have some
kind of evation think,

917
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,590
physical running may
not be necessary.

918
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,780
You could do something like as
long as they're not in one

919
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,520
location where the principal
is at any given

920
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,332
time, you're good.

921
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:00,180
But you don't have to physically
move through

922
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,716
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] basically
in all that.

923
00:36:02,716 --> 00:36:03,550
AUDIENCE: Drive, probably.

924
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:03,820
PROFESSOR: Driving.

925
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,270
Yeah.

926
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,680
It's such a minor part
of the film.

927
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,840
Yeah.

928
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,293
The actual driving is such a
minor part of the film that

929
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:13,760
you can probably do
without that.

930
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,800

931
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,430
And you might actually want to
think about what if instead of

932
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:23,110
this being Ferris Bueller's day
off into Ferris Bueller's

933
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,500
multiple days off.

934
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,340
Maybe just play each
day differently.

935
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,030
And just trying to stay out
more and more days.

936
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,190
Maybe a score or number
of days you don't go

937
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,490
to school or something.

938
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,180
So that's an idea.

939
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,043
That's one approach that you
can use in your projects.

940
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:43,640

941
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,660
Before we hit two, I just want
to touch on another point.

942
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,590
Before I transition,
any questions about

943
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:53,930
dealing with IP ?

944
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:56,240
There is a point that Brenda
makes in her book--

945
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,640
the Brenda [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

946
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,230
book-- that if you go
professionally in the game

947
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,530
industry, you will most likely
at some point in time,

948
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,495
probably many times in
your career, work

949
00:37:04,495 --> 00:37:06,060
with a licensed product.

950
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,900
And it can be painful because
you do not have greater

951
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,325
control yet trying to be
faithful to what you're

952
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:14,820
working with.

953
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,105
And if you succeed, you
make a lot of money.

954
00:37:18,105 --> 00:37:19,720
And maybe you get enough
money to start

955
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,270
working on your own projects.

956
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:26,390
But it's a reality because
franchises do sell.

957
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:29,050
And they're a lot lower risk
than dealing with a

958
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,660
completely new idea.

959
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,430
By the way, if you haven't
played the new Tomb Raider

960
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,890
game, which is actually kind
of interesting because it's

961
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,140
like Tomb Raider meets Diablo.

962
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,920

963
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,010
If people have never...

964
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,580
Whose played or seen some one
play Tomb Raider before?

965
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,270
OK.

966
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,950
Who knows about this latest game
that I'm talking about.

967
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:53,410
It's kind of like 3/4
isometric view.

968
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:53,750
Yeah.

969
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,660
It is Tomb Raider meets Diablo
but it still keeps in with the

970
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,520
puzzle solving.

971
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,350
It's cooperative.

972
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,260
It's a very, very different
game in terms of

973
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,380
how you play it.

974
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,560
But it will be an interesting
exercise to sort

975
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,950
of play that game.

976
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,030
Maybe I'll load it
up here sometime.

977
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,950
And you can take a look and
how does that resemble the

978
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,545
Tomb Raider franchise so that
people who look at the game

979
00:38:15,545 --> 00:38:19,050
and still say, yeah that's Tomb
Raider even though it's a

980
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,450
very new game.

981
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,850
You can imagine like a Tomb
Raider board game, for

982
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,950
instance, and how would
that be different.

983
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,590
And how could that still
be faithful?

984
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,382
That's World of Warcraft games
and Starcraft board

985
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:30,482
games that we invent.

986
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,380
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

987
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,290
But I'd love to try it out.

988
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:37,450
Let's see.

989
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,560
So the other point I want
to get to is kind of the

990
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,610
legalistic definition of IP.

991
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,710
And I don't want to spend an
entire class on this because I

992
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,350
know you will all fall asleep.

993
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,560
I just want to point out that
there's quite a lot of

994
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,570
different ways that

995
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,470
intellectual property is protected.

996
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:57,780
People who are creating stuff
professionally, creatively,

997
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,650
want to make sure that they can
finish their product, they

998
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,340
can make sequels of their
product, they can maybe even

999
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,510
license their ideas
to someone else.

1000
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,810
Make IP for some company without
having ideas copied

1001
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,230
outright and not seeing any
compensation for that.

1002
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:20,030
If it is copyrights, there's
trademarks, there's patents.

1003
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,280
I feel like I'm missing
something.

1004
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,750

1005
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,720
I guess we have those
three first.

1006
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,920
And if anything--

1007
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,440
those are definitely
the three big ones.

1008
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,350
Copyright.

1009
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,610
Copyright basically protects
an expression of an idea.

1010
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,900
The idea, itself, is
not protected.

1011
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,670
If your basic idea is in a
world where aliens are

1012
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,010
attacked by space marines,
the idea, itself, is not

1013
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,620
protected, which is a relief
because a lot of people have

1014
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,810
many games on that idea.

1015
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,140
But the actual expression is.

1016
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,035
So the actual--

1017
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:57,150
say that you're an artist.

1018
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,350
And you're creating concept
art based on that theme.

1019
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,740
That piece of concept art is
copyrighted to either you or

1020
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,220
if you're an employee of a
company then you've probably

1021
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,980
signed over your rights
to the company.

1022
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,930
That whatever you're creating
on their dime

1023
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,600
belongs to the company.

1024
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,090
And that's defensible
in court.

1025
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,930
It's actually an automatic
protection.

1026
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,590
But it's one of those things
where it helps to be able to

1027
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,980
document that you've actually
created something.

1028
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,820
There's a copyright office that
you can send things to.

1029
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,010
But for the most part, internal
company documentation

1030
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,050
saying, this piece of art was
created on the so and so date

1031
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,500
by so and so person.

1032
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,610
It's usually good enough to
stand up in court if there's

1033
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:41,710
ever a dispute.

1034
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,070
So the same thing goes
for writing.

1035
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:49,296
The same thing goes for
audio and music.

1036
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:53,270
A lot of music is protected
under copyright.

1037
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,860
So if somebody creates a piece
of music that sounds an awful

1038
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,770
lot like your piece of music.

1039
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,580
There are specific rules that
allow for that to happen.

1040
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:08,600
But I think, if you completely
reperform the piece, you are

1041
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,910
allowed to do that.

1042
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,190
But you may have to pay the
original composers the

1043
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,850
royalties from the music.

1044
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,460
This means that if person A
composes a song, then B

1045
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:29,860
performs a song and releases
an album, then C could

1046
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,900
actually reperform that song.

1047
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,860
And the only royalties goes
back to the composer.

1048
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:41,770
It doesn't necessarily go back
to Band B. However, Band B--

1049
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,600
it depends on really how close
they sound to each other.

1050
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,860
And, of course, if Band B
happens to be also the

1051
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,010
composers, then they're going
to get royalties and win.

1052
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,120
But you see this idea that
copyright protects the

1053
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,255
expression of an idea.

1054
00:41:55,255 --> 00:41:58,200
The composers, at some point in
time, had to write down the

1055
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,357
music, the notes,
and the lyrics.

1056
00:42:00,357 --> 00:42:03,310
And that is what is protected.

1057
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,656
And you can't just copy that
without entering into some

1058
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:09,530
sort of contract saying
that you can.

1059
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,890
We have systems like Creative
Commons for instance that

1060
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,190
basically, people who are
creating your IP say, under

1061
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,106
these conditions, I am letting
people do whatever

1062
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:21,062
they want with it.

1063
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:23,996
And there are different kinds of
Creative Commons licensing.

1064
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:25,463
Some of them that you do--
literally whatever

1065
00:42:25,463 --> 00:42:26,441
you want with it.

1066
00:42:26,441 --> 00:42:28,890
They're like open
source licenses.

1067
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:31,570
And in some cases, it's like
well, you can do whatever you

1068
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,170
want with it as long as it's for
non-commercial use and you

1069
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,610
have to credit the origin
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1070
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,393
So that's why Creative
Commons evolved.

1071
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:45,323
So to enable people to freely
do stuff without necessarily

1072
00:42:45,323 --> 00:42:48,527
having to pay and enter into
separate contracts with

1073
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:50,750
everybody who is creating IP.

1074
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,140
So the problem is with code.

1075
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,970
If code and game mechanics
actually for this class is

1076
00:42:58,970 --> 00:42:59,980
something I want to consider.

1077
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,410
Because you can think
of code in two ways.

1078
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,620
One, you can think of it
as a chunk of text.

1079
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,645
It's a chunk of ASCII symbols
that you type into a

1080
00:43:08,645 --> 00:43:11,150
development environment
and you compile it.

1081
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,260
And that's an expression
of an idea.

1082
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,130
But the other way that you can
think of it is it's a machine.

1083
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:19,190
It's a bunch of instructions
that you feed into a machine

1084
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,220
for it to operate in
a certain way.

1085
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,796
And those things, machines,
inventions basically, can be

1086
00:43:24,796 --> 00:43:28,050
protected by patents.

1087
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,120
That's pretty much what the
patent system is designed for.

1088
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,600
Patent system is a lot slower
because you actually have to

1089
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,880
apply to central US Patent
Office to be able to secure

1090
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,519
those, assuming that you're
looking for patent

1091
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,610
protection in the US.

1092
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,440
Every single country, every
single region has it's own

1093
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,940
patent office and it's
own process.

1094
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,670
It's really expensive.

1095
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:50,700
What it does is basically give
you a temporary monopoly on

1096
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,280
that invention.

1097
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,020
At least, that's what they were
originally designed for.

1098
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,190
You make an invention, and
you've got like 25 years or

1099
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,580
something to be able to
capitalize on it before anyone

1100
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,830
can use your idea.

1101
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,090
And the whole reason why it was
invented is that you now

1102
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,270
have an incentive to be able
to come up with inventions.

1103
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:14,565
You might make some
profit off it.

1104
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:16,950
And after the patent expires--

1105
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,190
25 years or something--

1106
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:22,112
because you've released your
information to the patent

1107
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:26,150
office, now, all of society
can benefit.

1108
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,960
Can make derivatives
of your invention.

1109
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,690
So in a sense, it was invented
to eventually release great

1110
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,870
monopolies.

1111
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,120
I got this idea, and I am going
to be upfront and very

1112
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,940
clear about how I make
this thing work.

1113
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,830
Say Amazon patents 1-click.

1114
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:45,750
And I'm going to say for the
next 25 years, Amazon now has

1115
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:50,820
this lock on 1-click shipping
and purchasing, which is

1116
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] but it's
been [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1117
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:54,590

1118
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:00,150
But after 25 years, anyone
can do 1-click shipping.

1119
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,080
But that's the problem, right?

1120
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,770
25 years is a heck
of a long time.

1121
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,870
And by then, whatever is
invented is kind of obsolete.

1122
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,340
And a lot of the ideas that tend
to get approved by the

1123
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,430
patent office are pretty
damn obvious.

1124
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,770
I'm not going to discourage the
amount of work that Amazon

1125
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:17,240
has actually put into
1-click shipping.

1126
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,300
It's actually a really
complex process.

1127
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,700
But I am going to discourage,
say there is a patent on the

1128
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,110
giant floating arrow that
tells you where you're

1129
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:27,987
supposed to go next.

1130
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:29,360
They have a patent on this.

1131
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,600
Namco has a patent on mini games
that you play while your

1132
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,000
game is loading.

1133
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,470
That's why only Namco games
have mini games in those

1134
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:41,180
screens because they have
a patent on that.

1135
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,600
When it comes to game ideas
and game mechanics, I find

1136
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,360
this really annoying.

1137
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,330
It's a personal rant because I
think that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1138
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,340
creation is that opening it up
is really, really tough.

1139
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,304
I don't really think game
mechanics fit in the

1140
00:45:59,304 --> 00:45:59,720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1141
00:45:59,720 --> 00:45:59,900
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1142
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,220
Apple has is on all
the touching.

1143
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,511
On their gestures, a lot
of people can't get

1144
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,180
off the same thing.

1145
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,400
PROFESSOR: A lot of people have
the same issue that I

1146
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,990
have with game mechanics, with
software, in general.

1147
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,530
Software happens so quickly that
this kind of temporary

1148
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:20,765
monopoly basically means a real
monopoly over that idea.

1149
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:25,675
AUDIENCE: I thought that game
rules were not patented or

1150
00:46:25,675 --> 00:46:27,148
covered by a copyright.

1151
00:46:27,148 --> 00:46:28,621
I seem to remember hearing
that somewhere.

1152
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:31,570

1153
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:35,480
And this was an issue which came
up when Scrabulous and

1154
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,340
Scrabble were at loggerheads
with one another.

1155
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,250
There's some weird technical
detail that I don't really

1156
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,207
know, but it kind of comes down
to the actual rules of

1157
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:50,430
Scrabble, the actual game
rules themselves

1158
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,894
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] are
not copyrightable.

1159
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:54,334
But somehow, the look and
feel of your game is.

1160
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:57,270

1161
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,710
Do you know what the specific
details are?

1162
00:46:58,710 --> 00:46:59,940
PROFESSOR: I don't know
the specific details.

1163
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,350
But how you outlined it is one
very clear way on how someone

1164
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,900
who's created a game can
protect a game without

1165
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,450
necessarily being protective
of the rules.

1166
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:13,150
And Scrabble can protect the
layout of their board.

1167
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:17,310
Because in order to come to
design the layout, they had to

1168
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:21,080
express the idea of what the
board was with graphic design.

1169
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,600
It's like here's where all the
triple word scores are.

1170
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,750
Here are where the double
word scores.

1171
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,310
That's an image.

1172
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,568
Images can be copyrighted.

1173
00:47:27,568 --> 00:47:29,844
And that's protected under
copyrighting law, not under

1174
00:47:29,844 --> 00:47:30,496
patent law.

1175
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:33,330
AUDIENCE: And I think
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] of copyrights

1176
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:36,470
and trademarks, it comes down
to like confusion, right?

1177
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,712
Like if someone could-- if
Scrabulous was similar enough

1178
00:47:39,712 --> 00:47:42,936
to Scrabble, superficially,
that if someone could use

1179
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:43,680
their products.

1180
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,460
I think that is like a major
criteria, right?

1181
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,940
And then again, it comes down
to things like font, colors,

1182
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,820
titles, [INAUDIBLE].

1183
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,967
PROFESSOR: It's even more
specific when it comes to

1184
00:47:54,967 --> 00:47:56,217
trademarks.

1185
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:58,960

1186
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:06,080
If you can claim that the image
or a particular saying

1187
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,970
or something is closely
associated with your company's

1188
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,100
core brand, you can defend that
as a trademark if you

1189
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,340
registered it with the
trademark office.

1190
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,428
GAMBIT, the Singapore
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] game lab is

1191
00:48:16,428 --> 00:48:19,780
actually a registered trademark
in Singapore.

1192
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,255
And actually, we had some
trouble registering that

1193
00:48:23,255 --> 00:48:25,120
because well, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
not the first company to come

1194
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,580
along with the word GAMBIT.

1195
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:29,970
There's actually another MIT
product called GAMBIT.

1196
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:33,570
It's a game theory
modeling system.

1197
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,610
So we actually had to negotiate
some fine words to

1198
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,040
be able to separate what we were
doing was not going to be

1199
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,690
confused with what
they were doing.

1200
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:41,920
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

1201
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,280
AUDIENCE: Are copyrights and
trademarks also for 25 years?

1202
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,600
Or are they different?

1203
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,850
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1204
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:51,460

1205
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,540
PROFESSOR: Copyrights last as
long as Walt Disney is dead.

1206
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:01,060
That is because the Disney
corp keeps lobbying the

1207
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,330
various branches of the United
States to extend copyrights so

1208
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:05,580
that they can lock
down Mickey.

1209
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,840

1210
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,860
That's the easiest way to
tell exactly how long.

1211
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,010
In other words, right now,
you've got something

1212
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,770
copyrighted, it's in perpetuity
until Disney loses.

1213
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,480

1214
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,320
This is actually really
annoying.

1215
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,820
Which means there's a whole
bunch of works, literature

1216
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,100
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1217
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:30,190
that date back to the elite 20th
century that by all means

1218
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:32,285
really should be public
domain at this point.

1219
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:34,490
And then, they will pass
into public use.

1220
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:36,390
But they aren't.

1221
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,570
I know one thing for sure.

1222
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,330
H.P. Lovecraft is definitely
in public domain.

1223
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,198
That's why there are so
many games based on

1224
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:45,448
H.P. Lovecraft material.

1225
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,890

1226
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,900
Whatever is based on Disney
material, has

1227
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,020
to be made by Disney.

1228
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:53,192
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1229
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:54,442
of the copyright law.

1230
00:49:54,442 --> 00:50:04,740

1231
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:05,300
Images.

1232
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,300
If the Scrabble board is
identified as being key to the

1233
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,240
Scrabble brand, you
might be able to

1234
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,570
protect it under trademark.

1235
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:18,900
And trademark is one of those
things where all you're saying

1236
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,660
is that this is how our company

1237
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,410
is identifying ourselves.

1238
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,700
And if that is confused with
somebody else's product, that

1239
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,760
product is now hurting
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1240
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,700
to make money.

1241
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,350
So there are a lot of steps to
allow you to fight that.

1242
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:34,950
The problem with trademark
is that you have to

1243
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:36,810
keep fighting back.

1244
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,300
So Xerox, for instance,
constantly fights to keep

1245
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:43,090
Xerox as a trademark because
people keep using the word,

1246
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:47,100
Xerox, to mean photocopy, which
is a great problem for a

1247
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:47,950
company to have.

1248
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,670
But it's actually a cash
drain as well.

1249
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:55,690
Because everyone's associating
your company's name--

1250
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,960
you're thinking Google, right?

1251
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,170
AUDIENCE: I think
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1252
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,510
Too many people or lose it.

1253
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:02,450
Band-aid would for sure.

1254
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,860
PROFESSOR: So you have
to fight it.

1255
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,420
AUDIENCE: And Kleenex, yeah.

1256
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,300
PROFESSOR: As long as you keep
fighting it, you stand a

1257
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,790
chance of hanging onto it.

1258
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,610

1259
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,660
Like [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
you blink.

1260
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1261
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,540
AUDIENCE: I remember hearing
about this, so I was looking

1262
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,025
to find it.

1263
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:22,830
But Richard Garfield, who
created Magic, has a patent on

1264
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,380
methods of play for trading
card games.

1265
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:26,470
PROFESSOR: Like the

1266
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:27,030
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], for instance?

1267
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,925
AUDIENCE: And the one who owns
the patent is playing a card

1268
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,850
in a certain orientation and
then changing it's orientation

1269
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:36,650
in the game field choosing to
buy a different state of that

1270
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:38,075
character's embodiment.

1271
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:39,040
AUDIENCE: What?

1272
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,690
[LAUGHTER]

1273
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:40,997
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1274
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:43,799
AUDIENCE: That is stupid.

1275
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:45,200
AUDIENCE: He has a patent
on tapping cards?

1276
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,440
AUDIENCE: He has a patent on
tapping cards, among many

1277
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,600
other things that
are basically--

1278
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,676
So I suspect that he doesn't
enforce this patent or that it

1279
00:51:50,676 --> 00:51:52,950
is not enforceable because if
you try to enforce it, it gets

1280
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,240
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1281
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,705
PROFESSOR: It is possible, but
it's not [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1282
00:51:56,705 --> 00:51:58,160
AUDIENCE: I heard
that the actual

1283
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,070
manifestation of that is that--

1284
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,010
I don't know whether
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] contested

1285
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:03,980
people over it.

1286
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,030
But definitely, they're
anti anyone else

1287
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,570
using the term tap.

1288
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,730
So which is why whenever you
go to look at Legend of the

1289
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,428
Five Rings or whatever, they
have the turned sideways

1290
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:14,900
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1291
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,530
But it's called bowing.

1292
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,545
And the same is true in any
collectible card game that has

1293
00:52:20,545 --> 00:52:23,667
a tap mechanic, they're not
allowed to use the word, tap.

1294
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,575
AUDIENCE: But that's
a copyright.

1295
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,483
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
a copyright.

1296
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,200
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1297
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,938
AUDIENCE: So I don't know it's
been tested because I don't

1298
00:52:31,938 --> 00:52:33,720
know if that patent has
been contested.

1299
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,270
AUDIENCE: I would suspect not.

1300
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:34,990
AUDIENCE: Probably not.

1301
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:37,120
But it's interesting.

1302
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,290
If you look at any of the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], so

1303
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:40,682
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1304
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:43,450
Pokemon and I don't recall
what the others are.

1305
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:45,570
They all use the term tap.

1306
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:49,810
But because of the copyright
in which they hold, they're

1307
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:50,890
allowed to do it, but
nobody else--

1308
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:51,020
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1309
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,470
PROFESSOR: The copyright
violation probably gives

1310
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,240
evidence for a patent
violation.

1311
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,200
So if you can stay clear of the
copyright violation, the

1312
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,030
case that Wizards has to be
able to contest the same

1313
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,290
mechanic that's under
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1314
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,890
But they might still
have a case.

1315
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:11,052
AUDIENCE: I suspect that they
think that their patent is not

1316
00:53:11,052 --> 00:53:11,990
enforceable.

1317
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,710
PROFESSOR: It's possible.

1318
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,752
AUDIENCE: Otherwise, you
wouldn't even be able to get

1319
00:53:14,752 --> 00:53:16,429
away with not even calling
it tapping.

1320
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:18,235
As long as you turn a card,
you'd be able to say, hey, do

1321
00:53:18,235 --> 00:53:18,850
you have a method?

1322
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,650
AUDIENCE: It's so ridiculous.

1323
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,380
AUDIENCE: Entering
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1324
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:26,850
the first orientation at
the player's option.

1325
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,880
Turning the trick card
another orientation

1326
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,900
on the playing surface.

1327
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,440
It doesn't even say
for any reason.

1328
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,960
AUDIENCE: In Naval Battles,
you have to turn the card

1329
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,320
upside down.

1330
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,488
Like submarine cards, you can
put them upside down to

1331
00:53:39,488 --> 00:53:41,710
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1332
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,634
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1333
00:53:44,634 --> 00:53:46,520
AUDIENCE: --method of playing
games when two or more players

1334
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,780
blah, blah, blah.

1335
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,430
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1336
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,390
PROFESSOR: So you can see how
this gets annoying quick.

1337
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,870
But there's actually an,
unfortunately, good reason why

1338
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,440
things like game mechanics and
more often implementation of

1339
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,930
game mechanisms code are
protected by patents.

1340
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,490
Is in that because there are
already so many out there, if

1341
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:08,725
your company is just trying to
make a game, the likelihood

1342
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:10,786
that you're going to run into a
pile of patents is actually

1343
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:12,690
pretty high.

1344
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,560
So what do you do?

1345
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,670
If you've got something that you
know that you created, a

1346
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:21,200
lot of companies just
go and patent that.

1347
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,773
In the event that it turns out
to be a case that you run

1348
00:54:24,773 --> 00:54:27,490
afoul of a different patent,
they might actually look at

1349
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:30,430
the company that's suing them
and say, but you were running

1350
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:33,870
to file our patents because we
just also patented something

1351
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,270
pretty obvious.

1352
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:39,130
EA, Activision what?

1353
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,020
AUDIENCE: It's all just mutually
assured destruction.

1354
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,450
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1355
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,660
I mean, well, it's
not destruction.

1356
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:45,000
It's what they do is they
trade licenses.

1357
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,300
It's like we will let you use
these patents if you will let

1358
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,415
us use that patent and thus,
avoid a legal fight.

1359
00:54:51,415 --> 00:54:52,080
Final costs.

1360
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,372
Lawyers are getting paid

1361
00:54:53,372 --> 00:54:54,505
throughout this entire process.

1362
00:54:54,505 --> 00:54:56,450
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

1363
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:57,446
PROFESSOR: It's cheaper
than actually

1364
00:54:57,446 --> 00:54:58,840
bringing it to court because--

1365
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:02,535
AUDIENCE: Your patent isn't
validated if you can be shown

1366
00:55:02,535 --> 00:55:04,062
someone else came up with
it and patented

1367
00:55:04,062 --> 00:55:05,570
it earlier in time.

1368
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,110
You have to be the first person
to come up with it.

1369
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,360
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1370
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,550

1371
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,750
AUDIENCE: And that's why I'm
sure that Wizard has never

1372
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,530
tried to use their patent
against people because they

1373
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:20,070
suspect that it's not going to
hold up [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1374
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:20,570
PROFESSOR: It's possible.

1375
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:21,620
You may not want to fight it.

1376
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,890
But sometimes, the threat
of a lawsuit is

1377
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,410
a big enough threat.

1378
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:27,705
It's like you don't even have
to be able to win it.

1379
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:29,740
You just-- we are
a big company.

1380
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,720
We have lawyers.

1381
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,634
And we can pay them.

1382
00:55:31,634 --> 00:55:32,884
Do you?

1383
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:34,840

1384
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,090
So that's one reason I mean
why companies that are

1385
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,463
otherwise opposed to legal
patents will still secure

1386
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,640
patents to protect themselves.

1387
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,470
It's kind of sad.

1388
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,790
It's like one of those things
where in a city where everyone

1389
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,594
owns a gun, you want
to own one, too.

1390
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:53,300

1391
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,450
So that's patents.

1392
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,000
We talked about trademarks.

1393
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,180
We talked about copyright.

1394
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,130
One last thing I kind of want
to talk about is fair use.

1395
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:04,280
Fair use is kind of the defense
that a lot of schools

1396
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,000
fall back on.

1397
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,175
The idea that if you're doing
something, or if you're

1398
00:56:07,175 --> 00:56:11,515
appropriating some sort of
material, or some sort of IP

1399
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:17,820
for political or educational
reasons, you have a defense.

1400
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:21,688
Should the case be brought to
court, you might be able to

1401
00:56:21,688 --> 00:56:24,410
defend yourself and win that
case by saying well, this was

1402
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:24,730
the reason.

1403
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,500
So am I doing something for
satirical purposes.

1404
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,850
Am I doing something
to teach people

1405
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,130
about games, for instance.

1406
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,385
I'm going to reprint
rules or something.

1407
00:56:36,385 --> 00:56:38,630
And you guys can look at it.

1408
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,000
And you guys can sue me.

1409
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,910
And I can claim fair use.

1410
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:42,800
I may not win.

1411
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,430
That's the problem.

1412
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,130
Fair use is only a defense.

1413
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,130
Fair use is not a law that
automatically protects you

1414
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,330
from being taken to court.

1415
00:56:52,330 --> 00:56:53,750
So lawyer's fees.

1416
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:57,920

1417
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,580
Who pays the lawyers' fees
depends on the case.

1418
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,710
But frankly, I would rather not
be put in that position.

1419
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:05,960
So there is that chilling
effect.

1420
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,100

1421
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:13,160
Just keep that in mind of the
games you guys are making for

1422
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,300
the class assignments.

1423
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,000
But, of course, we don't expect
you to be say, copying

1424
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,570
text verbatim from
other rule sets.

1425
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,635
In fact, I doubt any of you
would be particularly

1426
00:57:23,635 --> 00:57:25,730
interested in doing so.

1427
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:28,560
Certainly not copying art.

1428
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:31,120
But also, keep in mind that also
applies for things like

1429
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,420
art that you find online.

1430
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,305
You could protect yourself
under fair use.

1431
00:57:35,305 --> 00:57:38,180
This is for a class assignment,
darnit.

1432
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,720
And for the most part, no one
is really going to notice.

1433
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,750
But, of course, if you want to
take these games a little bit

1434
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,410
further, maybe sell them in
the future, you'll want to

1435
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,620
rethink about every single piece
of art, every single

1436
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:49,720
piece of text that you're
using in your games.

1437
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,870
Is that coming from somewhere
else or can we claim that we

1438
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:53,365
invented that?

1439
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:56,824
AUDIENCE: Have any past students
or groups tried to

1440
00:57:56,824 --> 00:57:58,130
pitch their games anywhere?

1441
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,080
PROFESSOR: Oh, you mean like
turn it commercial?

1442
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,520
Not to my knowledge.

1443
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,440
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1444
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:04,930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, do it.

1445
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:09,260
I mean, based on the games that
we played on Tuesday,

1446
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,510
absolutely.

1447
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:14,080

1448
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,160
Actually, one of the pieces of
feedback that we got from the

1449
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,790
GAMBIT [UNINTELLIGIBLE] every
single one of those games has

1450
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:19,835
something they have not seen
before in a card game.

1451
00:58:19,835 --> 00:58:22,690

1452
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,480
Every one of those
projects had a

1453
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,910
really interesting mechanic.

1454
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,260
And as far as I can
tell, they've

1455
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:28,510
all really been tested.

1456
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,450

1457
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,035
All right.

1458
00:58:33,035 --> 00:58:33,510
OK.

1459
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:37,040
So I'm not going anymore
into IP discussions.

1460
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,015
I spend too much time talking
to IP lawyers because we

1461
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:40,790
create IP in this lab.

1462
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:42,390
We create games.

1463
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,800
And if anyone happens
to be interested.

1464
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,790
I was considering
a career in law.

1465
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:50,420
I'll be happy to go into
greater detail.

1466
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:54,270
But for now, anymore
questions?

1467
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:54,570
OK.

1468
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:55,820
Let's just play games.

1469
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:56,720
