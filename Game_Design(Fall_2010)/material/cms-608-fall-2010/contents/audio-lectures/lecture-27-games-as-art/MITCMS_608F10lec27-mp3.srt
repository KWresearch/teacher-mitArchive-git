13
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,780
GUEST SPEAKER: --to Abe, who
is going to give us a guest

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,930
lecture on art games.

15
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,760
And today's reading, the proctor
reading is kind of

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,620
like part two of a lot of the
things that Jason maybe talked

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,170
about when we did simulations.

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,450
If you guys remember, is a
quality reading that a

19
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,074
[INAUDIBLE] question, where
that came from.

20
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:57,800
One thing that I think was of
interest was that there are a

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,430
couple of responses
to that article.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,510
If you scroll all the way down
to the bottom of the article

23
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,879
that these responses
vary [INAUDIBLE]

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,400

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,010
back to them.

26
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,320
And those are kind of
interesting, because it just

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,410
carries on a conversation.

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,665
People actually just turning his
article into basically a

29
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,600
blog post and then
write on it.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,640
And they were pretty good.

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,340
But a lot of that was kind
of the state of art game

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,635
discussion back in 1999, I
think, I think a pretty old

33
00:01:27,635 --> 00:01:32,660
article, where they were very
much thinking about games have

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,540
to be simulations.

35
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,920
Games and narratives, blaaach.

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,330
Storytelling is like some
other mediums' domain.

37
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,580
It's all about the simulation.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,690

39
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,890
Arguably at that time there
wasn't a big discussion of an

40
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,490
art games movement.

41
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,040
There were other games
movements, like new games

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,160
which were really more about
people interacting with you,

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,940
trying to get games to where
people were more cooperative,

44
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,300
less competitive, and
less cutthroat.

45
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,840
There were other movements
about people--

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,200
they were probably advertising
game movements.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,270
And there was a lot of work
in people making months of

48
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,940
computer games that effectively
made it

49
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,210
unplayable, but made really
pretty images in the process.

50
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,590
So that [UNINTELLIGIBLE], for
instance, where everything

51
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,620
becomes black and white
and is striped,

52
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,460
including the monsters.

53
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,770
There's no way you can see what
the hell's going on, but

54
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,494
they look pretty cool.

55
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:34,530
AUDIENCE: Have you seen--

56
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,904
I think it's 96 kilobytes--

57
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:41,290
there was a competition in full
game [INAUDIBLE]-- no

58
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,150
it's 4 kilobytes, I think.

59
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,328
It's a 4-kilobyte game in full
3-D, with multiple levels,

60
00:02:45,328 --> 00:02:47,830
extremely clever, including
the music and everything.

61
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,500
AUDIENCE: Have you ever heard
of this or seen this?

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,070
GUEST SPEAKER: There are
a couple of those.

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,010
A lot of those come up
with the demoscene.

65
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,770
Demoscene, which I will put
off to some other time--

66
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,310
AUDIENCE: It's very
impressive, too.

67
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,120
It's like very--

68
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,940
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,100
It's kind of this weird thing
of computer hacking, really,

70
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,740
really fast and really, really
compact coding, and visualized

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,990
statics and music, which
goes more like a

72
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,890
digital music video.

73
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,360
Only there were some people who
added mouse control, and

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,210
game play into it and made
these kind of games.

75
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:24,790
But that's very different from
the art game scene that we

76
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,980
have today, or at least
what's commonly

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,810
described as art games.

78
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,140
So I'd like Abe to talk about
what happened since then,

79
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,940
since 1999.

80
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,461
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,383
Hi, guys.

82
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,305
I'm Abe.

83
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,770
I work here at the lab.

84
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,800
I play a bunch of your games.

85
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,210
I've met a bunch of you.

86
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,020
It's nice to be here.

87
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,550
Phillip asked me to come
in to talk about,

88
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,150
quote/unquote, art games.

89
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:54,720
I think largely because it's a
kind of, I'll say, sector of

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,210
game development that my work
at Gambit tends to intersect

91
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,100
with, especially recently.

92
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,563
And I think, too, that it's--

93
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,024
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

94
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:09,440
I was choking from--

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,410
GUEST SPEAKER: I think, too,
that it's a sector that's a

96
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,860
little bit confusing--

97
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,220
and possibly confusing, too.

98
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,680
And so, just to give
you guys a sense--

99
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,745
when you asked me about this
it actually made me think,

100
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:25,705
like, oh, yeah, cool, I'll
talk about this art games

101
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:28,410
movement or whatever,
but that of course--

102
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,270
ooh, wait.

103
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,070
I'm locked into some kind
of weird mode right now.

104
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,020
Sorry.

105
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,222
OK.

106
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:38,040
That brings up this question,
which is, are games art?

107
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,200
And just to give you a sense
for how this little talk

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,660
thing, whatever, is going to go,
I'm going to talk a little

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,020
bit about this question, give
you examples of what people

110
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,661
have said about this, and
opinions that I think are

111
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,420
particularly important,
particularly

112
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,880
valid on this subject.

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,040
I also after that want to show
you some examples, some

114
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,200
historical and then kind of
moving forward examples.

115
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,910
I'm actually going to get some
of you guys to just come up

116
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,020
here and maybe even play some of
these examples that I think

117
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
are particularly important.

118
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,322
And I'd really like it if we
can keep this less of a me

119
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:17,150
talking at you and you engaging
me as you have

120
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,840
questions on this.

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,420
Because me blabbing at you as
you fall asleep is maybe good

122
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,050
for a nap, but less useful for
getting anything out of this.

123
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,750
So we'll try to structure this
as a conversation, and then

124
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,500
I'll try to pull back, hearken
back, to any of my teacher

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,640
instincts and see if I
can get you engaged.

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,670
But we'll see.

127
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,060
So are games art?

128
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,878
I hate this question.

129
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:45,240
Let's start off by saying that
I fundamentally find it

130
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,490
abhorrent, and I hear
it all the time.

131
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,560
And it's aggravating to me
because I think it's

132
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,330
incontrovertibly yes.

133
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,730
I think that you can't possibly
come up with any

134
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,800
other answer other than yes,
games are art, games have art,

135
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,090
yes, yes, yes, right?

136
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,410
But it keeps coming up.

137
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,380
And it keeps becoming a
question-- and I should say,

138
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:11,910
too, that this is a wholly
biased and slanted talk.

139
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,110
This is my perspective on this,
and hopefully by the

140
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,640
time-- you'll be like, wow,
he's absolutely right.

141
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,870
There's no way that games could
be anything but art.

142
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,790
Or at least they are
art, and then some.

143
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,580
So this guy, who's a little
hard to see right now, but

144
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,300
he's handily brought up,
recently brought into the

145
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,920
fore, and that's Roger Ebert
of Siskel and Ebert fame.

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,205
Or since you guys are, some of
you, younger than me, probably

147
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:40,850
Ebert and Roeper.

148
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,430
He had some interesting,

149
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,960
controversial comments recently.

150
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,200
And I pulled this quote,
"Nevertheless, I'm being

151
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,040
convinced that in principle--"
I love that

152
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,070
he put that in italics.

153
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,770
"--video games cannot be art.

154
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,630
Perhaps it is foolish for me to
say never, because never as

155
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,380
Rick Wakeman informs us,
is a long, long time.

156
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,020
Let me just say that no video
gamer now living will survive

157
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,400
long enough to experience the
medium as an art form."

158
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,760
So apparently we should all be
dead already, according to

159
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,650
Ebert, because we wouldn't
have lived long enough to

160
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,020
experience the medium
as an art form.

161
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,610
But here's a guy who, even
though I don't think he's a

162
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,580
particularly good film critic,
is a popular film critic.

163
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,910
And he's weighing in on a
medium that he doesn't

164
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,340
particularly understand.

165
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,240
And I think it's important to
look at what exactly is he

166
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,980
doing when he makes
this statement.

167
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,510
He's in this business of
classification, right?

168
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,130
He's in this business of saying,
all right, we've got

169
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,480
this subject called art.

170
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,570
What can we say falls under that
subset and what does not?

171
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,450
So he says things like painting,
sculpture, dance,

172
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,580
opera, literature, film can all
be classified as art and

173
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,110
that games are not.

174
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,430
Probably some other things.

175
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:48,930
I don't know where he stands
on comic books.

176
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,765
I don't think he's written about
it yet, but I'm sure

177
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:51,190
he'd probably--

178
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,100
I don't know what he thinks
about pornography.

179
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,190
Although, since it's in
film form, maybe he

180
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,520
does think it's art.

181
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,230
It's unclear.

182
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,650
He hasn't weighed
in on that yet.

183
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,120
But the interesting
thing about this

184
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,700
is, this is not new.

185
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,850
This is like a high-culture,
low-culture debate that's been

186
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,550
going on for a really
long time.

187
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,560
And I think it's particularly
hilarious because

188
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,840
he would use films.

189
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
And films had to fight out of
the low-culture phenomenon to

190
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,020
gain respect as a high-culture
medium.

191
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,160
So he's working--

192
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,860
reviewing a medium that was once
conceived as low culture,

193
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,580
had to work really hard to be
considered high culture.

194
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,620
And now he's saying, look, my
films are high culture, your

195
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,770
video games are low culture.

196
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,350
Which is totally hilarious
because in the past 50 years,

197
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,780
this has been completely
collapsed by post-modernism.

198
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,031
That's a whole 'nother
talk altogether.

199
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:36,640
Maybe high culture
and low culture

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,360
don't even exist anymore.

201
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,950
So Ebert brings us all back.

202
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,780
And you get everybody upset.

203
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,840
And a bunch of trolls are on
his website saying really

204
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,240
terrible things about him
and about what he said.

205
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,450
But he kind of reinvigorated
this talk.

206
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,180
And so new scientists, inspired
by this Ebert

207
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,630
controversy and looking for con
tips on CultureLab asked

208
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,570
the question, can
games be art?

209
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,880
And they sent it out to a bunch
of game scholars saying,

210
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,725
what is your opinion on this?

211
00:09:01,725 --> 00:09:06,340
Ian Bogost is a very smart
guy and says some really

212
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,850
interesting things.

213
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,420
This is really why I'm not gonna
read the whole thing,

214
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,170
but in the first paragraph he
brings up things like Fountain

215
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,550
by Marcel Duchamp, which is a
urinal in a museum, for those

216
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,400
of you who don't
know about it.

217
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,340
And that was a statement, a
piece of art that he was

218
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,020
literally trying to confront,
what high culture defines as

219
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,520
art by taking, literally, a
urinal, putting it upside down

220
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,270
on a pedestal, entitling it
Fountain, and putting it in a

221
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,180
museum, which is the pinnacle
of high culture.

222
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,530
If you can make it in a
museum, you're art.

223
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,996
And so this is something
that--

224
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:40,220
He mentions Yoko Ono's
performance art, where she's

225
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,247
sitting in a chair, and she has
scissors next to her and

226
00:09:43,247 --> 00:09:45,510
the audience is invited to come
cut her clothes off one

227
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,500
piece at a time.

228
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,270
A lot of this kind of stuff.

229
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,480
Andy Warhol pop culture
paintings,

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,950
Mondrian's abstract paintings.

231
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,260
And he says a lot in that
first paragraph.

232
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,860
But I think this interesting
part that I've

233
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,730
pseudo-highlighted down
here is interesting.

234
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm starting in the middle.

235
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,670
He says if the purpose of art
is indeed to force us to see

236
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,560
something we thought we
understood in a new light,

237
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,995
perhaps the most fundamental
move video games have made in

238
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:14,151
the artistic tradition is in
the very eliciting of the

239
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:15,640
question, can video
games be art?

240
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,000
I think that's really
interesting.

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,030
So the fact that people are
even asking this question

242
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,380
suggests that video games are
doing something that we

243
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,070
traditionally conceive
of art doing.

244
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,470
That's, I think, a really
powerful statement, that we're

245
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,840
even having this discussion
renders the question moot in

246
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,080
some senses, which
is I would say

247
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,698
classic Bogostian wordplay.

248
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:41,626
I think I just made something
up called Bogostian.

249
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:44,730
I should tweet all about it.

250
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,070
John Sharp, from the Savannah
College of Art and Design, has

251
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,050
had a lot of thoughts on this.

252
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,950
He's actually a great person to
talk about this, because he

253
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,870
studies video games, but he does
it from an art history

254
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,940
background as well.

255
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,750
That's pretty good and useful.

256
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,310
He talks about some interesting
things here.

257
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,750
Similarly to what Ian is doing,
he's talking a bit

258
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,340
about how video games and art
are doing some similar things

259
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,510
at times, and yet games have
certain affordances that other

260
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:14,638
media do not.

261
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,440
He says at the end here, which
I think is interesting, all

262
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,990
this poses the question of why
are we concerned with giving

263
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,220
video games the status of art?

264
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,010
This is one of the reasons
why I hate this question.

265
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,940
Are we simply trying
to legitimize them?

266
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,000
Does being called, quote/unquote
art change the

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,730
qualities of video games.

268
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,056
Only if we can answer these
questions can we move the

269
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:31,620
conversation forward.

270
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,500
I think he's reacting here
to the question itself.

271
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,730
Actually, he and Ian both are
reacting to the question, Ian

272
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,150
saying the question invalidates
itself and John

273
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,820
Sharp now saying that this
question, it's not helping us.

274
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,850
Asking how does calling it art,
what does that do for the

275
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,390
medium, that's the important
question.

276
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,470
Here's some thoughts about the
question and some more

277
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,340
evidence for why I think the
question, are video games art

278
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,898
is just quite wrong.

279
00:11:57,898 --> 00:12:03,880
Mary Flanagan takes it as being
assumed that video games

280
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,170
are art, which I think
is actually great.

281
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,150
In Critical Play she doesn't go
to great lengths to define

282
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,910
video games as art.

283
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,710
She just looks at art and
she looks at games

284
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,830
and compares them.

285
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,580
She just assumes that
this is so.

286
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,500
I think this is a really nice
quote from the beginning of

287
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,520
her Critical Play book, which
is that, "Critical Play is

288
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,180
built on the premise that, as
with other media, games carry

289
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,620
beliefs within their
representation systems and

290
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,440
mechanics." This is really
important. "Artists using

291
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,012
games as a medium of
expression--" Again, good use

292
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:30,290
of italics.

293
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,230
"--,then, manipulate elements
common to games--

294
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,836
representation systems and
styles, rules of progress,

295
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:37,640
codes of conduct, context of
reception, winning and losing

296
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,442
paradigms, ways of interacting
in a game-- for they are the

297
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:43,220
material properties of games,
much like marble and chisel or

298
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,025
pen and ink bring with them
their own intended

299
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,350
possibilities, limitations,
and conventions."

300
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,280
It's a great point.

301
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,860
You would have a really hard
time making a painting with a

302
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,177
chisel and no paint, like you
were using marble and a

303
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,410
chisel, a you were trying
to make a painting.

304
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,360
Two different things.

305
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,130
Both are art.

306
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,670
It's the same thing
with games.

307
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,490
Games have rule sets, games
have systems, games have

308
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,730
win-and-loss paradigms.

309
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,955
They have all these things
that are conventions and

310
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,180
things that we associate with
even our definition of what a

311
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:14,280
game is, which is
at times faulty.

312
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,890
But those are our tools.

313
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,060
Those are how we communicate
things.

314
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,150
I think her first sentence
is really important.

315
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,210
I'm guessing with the stuff
that you've been talking

316
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,372
about-- them and Gonzalo
Frasca--

317
00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:25,670
that's coming through.

318
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,190
I actually see that
in your games.

319
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,450
You're trying to-- so, for
example I play-tested that

320
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,800
FedEx game, and I play-tested
the game about marriage.

321
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,290
There's all kinds of meaning in
those systems and meanings

322
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,200
in those choices that you get
that are being communicated.

323
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,220
And that's very similar to what
an artist would do with

324
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,156
any other medium.

325
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,310
You're communicating a message
through those.

326
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,120
And sometimes we do
it accidentally.

327
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,200
It's not always explicit.

328
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,940
We make something--

329
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,020
I would say that the graveyard
and when you get divorced and

330
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,610
you put your divorced person
in the graveyard is an

331
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,360
interesting choice for me,
because it was creating an

332
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,473
equivalence between divorce and
death, which I think is

333
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,980
kind of interesting.

334
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,540
That's just one interesting
example.

335
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,790
So Mary Flanagan in her book
talks about this art movement

336
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,210
called Fluxus.

337
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:09,980
Before I go into--

338
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,550
any kind of thoughts
or questions?

339
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,680
Does anybody else think-- does
anybody think video games

340
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,833
aren't art still?

341
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:17,520
It's okay.

342
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,544
Oh, crap, we're gonna fight.

343
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:22,125
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] when we
were designing art, so our art

344
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:25,590
project now is you have
to choose a real-world

345
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,072
system and relate it.

346
00:14:27,072 --> 00:14:28,740
That's what we're
all working on.

347
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,570
And one of the big things that
really helped us get started

348
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,303
is, what is the message we want
to get across to each set

349
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:34,580
of ablutions?

350
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,370
What is a bad ablution?

351
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,826
Do you want to say that's
random, do you want to say

352
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:37,690
that's this?

353
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,910
And how do we express that,
which [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

354
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,225
GUEST SPEAKER: Totally.

355
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:43,640
And it gets even crazier
when you take--

356
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,760
when you try to look at
systems that are not

357
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,590
particularly tangible.

358
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,500
You maybe looked at it, but
Elude is a game about

359
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,780
depression.

360
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,135
There aren't exactly tangible
kind of road maps the way

361
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,540
there are with FedEx systems,
for clinical depression.

362
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,570
And yet you're looking at
things like emotions,

363
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,660
feelings, stuff like that, that
we might call abstract,

364
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,410
or just not immediate.

365
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,205
How do you communicate
those in systems?

366
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:13,630
It's really tricky.

367
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,955
AUDIENCE: I have friends that
talk about all their games

368
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:21,626
which are like more --genic
or more abstract.

369
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:23,900
Does Ebert [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
art?

370
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,075
GUEST SPEAKER: I mean, it's
a really good question.

371
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,860
AUDIENCE: What would
he say about that?

372
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,400
GUEST SPEAKER: I think that
falls along the same lines as,

373
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,460
like I said, does Ebert consider
pornography art?

374
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,790
It's a really difficult
question.

375
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,460
That's a much larger art history
debate, about has high

376
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,200
culture and low culture
completely collapsed?

377
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,870
Has mass-media proliferation
deteriorated conceptions of

378
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,110
what really high culture art
are, versus low culture.

379
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,600

380
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,700
I don't have particularly
good answers for that.

381
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,000
I think just as all of the other
media that we looked at,

382
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
does a Jerry Bruckheimer
film count as art?

383
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,100
Just like we would look at that
and ask that question, we

384
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,720
don't then deny the entire
medium of film from the

385
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,600
possibility of being artistic.

386
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,310
There seems to be this desire,
because the majority of games

387
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,900
in our sector--

388
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,780
which I actually do,
too, because if you

389
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,290
go far enough back--

390
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:21,000
I should say video games--

391
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,847
Because most video games are
commercially intended and

392
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:28,280
involve fairly similar things,
does that preclude the medium

393
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,904
from the possibility
of being artistic?

394
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:35,140
I go back to that Ebert comment
about he says they

395
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,160
can't possibly be, or at least
he says never is a long time.

396
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,556
But not in our lifetime, it
apparently is impossible.

397
00:16:41,556 --> 00:16:42,720
It's a good point.

398
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,600
AUDIENCE: There's actually
interesting effects with the

399
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,263
game we're designing which is
essentially city building and

400
00:16:49,263 --> 00:16:53,380
city creation in the time
of the Roman Empire.

401
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,845
And we actually didn't
intend to instill any

402
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:58,880
meaning in the game.

403
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,090
But once we actually designed
the mechanics and stuff, we

404
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,940
realized that it was essentially
a game about the

405
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,760
rich getting richer and trying
to control the board.

406
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,170
So it's like there's almost
this inherent meaning that

407
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,780
came out from just designing
the game.

408
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,859
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

409
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,050
You almost can't help but have
it happen in some instances.

410
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,449
It reminds me of a good thing
that Brenda Brathwaite put in

411
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:19,589
one of her talks once, which
was about the game

412
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,560
Civilization, the mod
Colonization for sig IV, which

413
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,970
is a great mod in which you
play one of the European

414
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,910
colonizers and you come
over to the New World.

415
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,530
And there's indigenous
peoples there.

416
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,450
You have to negotiate with them
at first, but eventually

417
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:36,010
you just beat them up and take
their land, or they just give

418
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,450
it to you because you're more
powerful than they are.

419
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,160
And she was making the point,
there's this great box art,

420
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,490
the Native Americans in the
corner and the Conquistador in

421
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,290
the middle, the Spanish,
and the Dutch.

422
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,380
And it's like, if you were a
Native American how would you

423
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,610
respond to this game?

424
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,850
And I'm like, yeah, I'm totally
making America again.

425
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,160
And other people would be like,
oh my god, you basically

426
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,080
just wiped out my ancestors,
thanks.

427
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,610
So it's true, sometimes you
falling into meaning.

428
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,918
It's something.

429
00:18:00,918 --> 00:18:03,720
And I think, again, a lot
of art does that, right?

430
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,620
And some art did it quite
purposely, where they weren't

431
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:10,860
divulging the meaning, they were
inviting readings on it.

432
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,310
So, Fluxus.

433
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,770
Fluxus is this really
interesting

434
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,690
mid-20th-century art--

435
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,160
they rejected the term
"movement," they called it an

436
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,264
"attitude"--

437
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:23,200
that Mary Flanagan talks
about a bit in her

438
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,280
Critical Play book.

439
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,820
It's actually quite
interesting.

440
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,410
It really starts out early
with John Cage.

441
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,940
Have you guys heard of
him, the composer?

442
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,400
He's most famous for this piece
of music that he wrote

443
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,240
where, I forget the duration,

444
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,130
AUDIENCE: 4'33".

445
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,020
GUEST SPEAKER: 4'33", yeah.

446
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,070
it's 4 minutes and 33 seconds
of not, well, not playing.

447
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,740
AUDIENCE: He rests.

448
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,030
GUEST SPEAKER: He rests.

449
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,930
Exactly.

450
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,560
So you'd sit down
at the piano.

451
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,050
You'd pull out the music and
everyone would hush.

452
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,340
And then for 4 minutes and 33
seconds you'd sit there,

453
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,310
possibly with your hands
on the keys.

454
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:56,566
And then after the time, you
would stand up, and you'd take

455
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,670
your bow, and the audience
would erupt

456
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,370
into incredible applause.

457
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:06,110
He was really testing the idea
of what they eventually called

458
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,680
scores, or event scores.

459
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,090
This idea that music is an art
form where you can write it

460
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,060
down, and then it becomes
performable.

461
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,130
It becomes this thing that
someone can engage with.

462
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,280
We don't think of paintings
that way.

463
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,750
We don't think of paintings as
having a score, having some

464
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,060
kind of, how do I engage
with this?

465
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,790
It sounds kind of like games,
in figuring out how does

466
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:33,790
interactivity work in
artistic mediums.

467
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,080
Really interested in
indeterminacy, too.

468
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,230
I think you'll see in some of
these examples, they're really

469
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,480
kind of pushing on the
boundaries of what art has

470
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,010
been doing to this point.

471
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,910
They call it intermedia, meaning
that the more multiple

472
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:55,060
modes that you can use for
communicating it was really

473
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,520
important to the attitude.

474
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,390
Simplicity was really
big, having basic

475
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,450
systems and basic scores.

476
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,590
And then this idea of play
was really important.

477
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,020
Yoko Ono, it's funny we sort
of just attach her to John

478
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,405
Lennon, but she was an artist
before she was in a

479
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:16,270
relationship with him.

480
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,920
She's actually well known as
one of these kind of Fluxus

481
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,650
practitioners.

482
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,440
This is interesting.

483
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,460
This is the Fluxus manifesto.

484
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,090
I wanted to put this up because
I think you can get a

485
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,940
little bit of a sense for what
they were trying to go for.

486
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,810
They were taking the word
"flux" and putting

487
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,370
definition-- but then they
were mending it here, so,

488
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,310
purge the world of Bourgeois
sickness, intellectual,

489
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,220
professional, and commercialized
culture.

490
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,320
Purge the world of dead art,
imitation, artificial art,

491
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,150
abstract art, illusionistic
art, mathematical art.

492
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,762
I like this, purge the
world of Europeanism.

493
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,578
I don't think that's a word.

494
00:20:53,578 --> 00:20:55,370
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

495
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,120
GUEST SPEAKER: Promote
a revolutionary

496
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,000
flood and tide in art.

497
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Promote living art, anti-art,
non-art reality.

498
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,860
These things sound
totally crazy.

499
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,720
I love the, "to be fully
grasped," but then it crosses

500
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,380
out "fully." I don't doubt
that was completely

501
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,440
intentional, or if they wrote
fully grasped and were like,

502
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,345
oh, this is gonna be great.

503
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:14,709
I'm crossing it out so
you can see that I

504
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:15,180
crossed out fully grasped.

505
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,790
We want it to be not
fully grasped.

506
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,860
We want it to be partially
grasped by all people.

507
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,690
Not only critics feel this
class is professional.

508
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,370
It's just a really interesting
thing, and it sort of screams

509
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,520
the avant-garde.

510
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,080
They were trying to push
against boundaries.

511
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,420
They're trying to figure out
what is the edge of the medium

512
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,770
and then how can we
jump way off it?

513
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,450

514
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:41,190
Some of the classic Fluxus works
were these things called

515
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,630
Flux boxes or Flux kits.

516
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,270
Flux kits tended to
have event scores.

517
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,580
This is one of the most
famous called Water

518
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,870
Yam by George Brecht.

519
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:53,930
And basically this is a box
with 70 event scores.

520
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,460
These are an example of
these event scores.

521
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,940
It's interesting.

522
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,160
The event scores really seem
like rule systems.

523
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,070
They're like the instructions
to your board game, except

524
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,803
they're kind of whacky.

525
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:06,960
If you look at air conditioning,
the rule is move

526
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,150
through the place.

527
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,880
Which is really interesting.

528
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,522
If you encounter this game and
you're like, all right, I'm

529
00:22:12,522 --> 00:22:13,612
gonna play Water Yam.

530
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:15,540
And you're like, move
through the place.

531
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,840
I think that's pretty
characteristic of movement,

532
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,540
right, present you with some
sort of objective or some sort

533
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,601
of requirement, but one that
is abstract or nebulous, or

534
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,870
just kind of strange.

535
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,400
This one's even better.

536
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,490
On a white chair, a great tape
measure, alphabet, flag,

537
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,920
black, and spectral color.

538
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,680
In this instance, it's not
even clear what you're

539
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,920
necessarily supposed to do.

540
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,390
Are you supposed to compile
these things on a white chair?

541
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,370
Are you supposed to sit on a
white chair and hold all of

542
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:46,521
these things?

543
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:48,485
It's not particularly clear.

544
00:22:48,485 --> 00:22:51,280

545
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,810
This is the playfulness
of this movement.

546
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:59,870
This is the energy of this
of avant-garde movement.

547
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,350
You can see the relationship,
I hope, between

548
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,800
rule systems and these.

549
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,386
The next example is, I think,
an even better one.

550
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,910
But you can see how
they're playing

551
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,560
around with these ideas.

552
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,625
At least they're incorporating
interactivity

553
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,070
into these art movements.

554
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,987
And keep in mind, these are
being shown in galleries These

555
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:17,740
are being shown in
high-art places.

556
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,285
These are being sent out to
their friends as works of art.

557
00:23:23,285 --> 00:23:24,640
This one's great.

558
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,560
This is White Chess
by Yoko Ono.

559
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,490
It's often depicted on its own
and you have to imagine what

560
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:31,990
the rules are.

561
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,510
But I actually think her rules
as they are written are

562
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,010
actually pretty important
to it.

563
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:38,780
She says, play it for as long
as you remember who is your

564
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,640
opponent and who is
your own self.

565
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,750
Very interesting wordage.

566
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,665
What are the complications
with white chess.

567
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:47,160
Anyone.

568
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,440
Any thoughts?

569
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,750
Based on your perceptions
of non-white chess or

570
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,070
white-and-black chess?

571
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,070
AUDIENCE: You'd get into arguing
about is that my pawn

572
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,210
or your pawn?

573
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,760
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes, you
definitely-- it will be hard

574
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,560
to keep track of,
I would think.

575
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,670
That's why she said, "as long
as you can remember." Any

576
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,920
other weirdness from this?

577
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,150
AUDIENCE: Who is friend
and who is enemy?

578
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,620
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
certainly.

579
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,400
This sort of like, wait,
was that my piece?

580
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,100
Was that your piece?

581
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,200
Not only does that complicate
your relationship to the other

582
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,670
player, but now it's like, to
the game itself, it's like,

583
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,864
wait, what was the strategy
I was doing?

584
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:18,640
AUDIENCE: Friendly or
unfriendly fire?

585
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,472
GUEST SPEAKER: I mean, it's
really hard to keep track of

586
00:24:20,472 --> 00:24:21,150
stuff in chess.

587
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,480
What about the board?

588
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,170
AUDIENCE: He writes off the king
and the queen by mistake

589
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,730
because you don't have to--

590
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,880
AUDIENCE: There's not really any
actual boxes on the board.

591
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,780
AUDIENCE: There are boxes--

592
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,740
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
they're all white.

593
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,915
That complicates things a little
bit, too, because you

594
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:38,870
need to remember how
you were moving.

595
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,220
AUDIENCE: How large is--

596
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,712
GUEST SPEAKER: This
one's really big.

597
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,410
This is like a garden
installment of White Chess.

598
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,600
And I think the cool thing, too,
this is another example

599
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,020
of the movement.

600
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,690
As long as you have
the components you

601
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,710
could play this game.

602
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,090
You could create
this art piece.

603
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,190
I think the intent
is not go play my

604
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,560
installation of White Chess.

605
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,410
It's that this is the
rules, these are the

606
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,400
pieces, it can be played.

607
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,850
That screams game,
that screams that

608
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,540
portability of a game.

609
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,380
Again, this wasn't considered
anything but art, except

610
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,750
probably by people who
turned their nose at

611
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,260
this sort of thing.

612
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:20,100
they've Any thoughts on
what White Chess could

613
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,740
be about, in a--

614
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,150
AUDIENCE: Two different
sides merging to one.

615
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,500
And so you eventually get,
why am I fighting?

616
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,170
Who is my enemy in
this situation?

617
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:33,620
GUEST SPEAKER: Sure, sure.

618
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,440
Any other thoughts?

619
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,560
AUDIENCE: Racial relations.

620
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,830
GUEST SPEAKER: Sure,
racial relations.

621
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,730
AUDIENCE: It's probably a whole
antiwar thing of, like,

622
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,560
are we actually destroying
ourselves?

623
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,920
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, and that's
an interesting thing.

624
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,290
Yoko Ono was a decidedly antiwar
activist at the time

625
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,790
she was making this
in the early '60s.

626
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,975
One thing-- you can't take
anything for granted, but the

627
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,060
pieces aren't all black,
they're all white.

628
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,179
So I think the race thing
does play a factor.

629
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,892
The inability to remember
who you're attacking and

630
00:26:02,892 --> 00:26:04,220
who you are, even.

631
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,320
I think that's actually why
I really like her words.

632
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,801
Because, "for as long as you
can remember who's your

633
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,170
opponent and who is your own
self," there's something about

634
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,650
incorporating your own self in
there, not just saying what

635
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,710
your pieces are.

636
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,740
She's not saying can you
remember what your pieces are.

637
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,100
She's saying remember who you're
playing against versus

638
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,996
who you are.

639
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,370
That's very different
verbiage.

640
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,680
I think it's very much
a game about who are

641
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,250
you fighting, anyway?

642
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:34,428
What is the point of war, what
is the purpose of war?

643
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:37,230
And how does war particularly
function?

644
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,116
And in the rhetoric of
the time it makes a

645
00:26:39,116 --> 00:26:41,670
lot of sense, right?

646
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,140
So that's Yoko Ono's White
Chess, which is part of the

647
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,260
Fluxus [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

648
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,620
Yes, it's pretty cool.

649
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,566
Actually, Fluxus and artists in
this period have a really

650
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,180
interesting relationship
with chess.

651
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,526
There's like some quote,
and I'm gonna

652
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:53,640
butcher it, but it's--

653
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,690
I think it was Marcel Duchamp
saying that not all chess

654
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,350
players are artists, but all
artists are chess players, or

655
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,980
something like that.

656
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,050
He is particularly fascinated
with chess, and you can see

657
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,020
elements of chess in
his work, ought to

658
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,860
be painted or whatever.

659
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,110
AUDIENCE: He was completely
obsessed with chess.

660
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,830
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

661
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,805
AUDIENCE: He played
it really hard.

662
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:17,140
He wasn't necessarily
a very good player,

663
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,120
but he played a lot.

664
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,080
GUEST SPEAKER: Very into it.

665
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,830
So now I'm gonna move out
of this Fluxus movement.

666
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,075
I just wanted to show you
a couple examples.

667
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,091
But I think this next one is
actually an interesting-- this

668
00:27:27,091 --> 00:27:29,300
is a current theme that I'm
really excited about, which is

669
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,436
called Sixteen Tons.

670
00:27:32,436 --> 00:27:34,700
This is a game I unfortunately
have not been able to play

671
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,070
yet, but I've witnessed
play because it's a

672
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,900
game for four players.

673
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,640
This was created by Eric
Zimmerman and Nathalie Pozzi.

674
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,560
It's a really interesting
game.

675
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,230
It's a little hard to see
from these pictures.

676
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,490
But it's this giant circle, I
would say almost the size of

677
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,775
this room, of corrugated
cardboard, maybe even bigger,

678
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,350
a little bit bigger
than this room.

679
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,840
Inside you've got this array
of colored and circles in

680
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,010
these pretty hefty steel
tubes that have color.

681
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,920
Let's go through the rules.

682
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,330
The first thing you notice is
that they contextualize the

683
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,790
title, Sixteen Tons, with a
quote from the song, "You load

684
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,412
16 tons, and what do you get?

685
00:28:13,412 --> 00:28:15,070
Another day older and
deeper in debt."

686
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,766
This is doing an interesting
thing that John Sharp, who you

687
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:20,510
can see in the middle, thinks
is actually particularly

688
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,710
important for games and games
that are working this art

689
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:26,370
movement is that they declare
their intentionality.

690
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,570
Whether they declare what
they're meaning is or not is

691
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,640
less important.

692
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,650
To be taken seriously, you take
yourself seriously, I

693
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,030
think was one of
things he said.

694
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,450
And I think this is another
good example when you talk

695
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,600
about how games maybe in the
digital space do this.

696
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,480
But right now they're already
priming you for reading the

697
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,245
rules in a way that is different
than just, ooh,

698
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:48,750
let's play.

699
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:52,260
Could you imagine if Monopoly
had some sort of Marxist quote

700
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,940
in the front of it, or something
like that, your

701
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,360
experience of it would be
completely different.

702
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,460
You set up, you put the pieces
in this array, you stand on a

703
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,750
number and that indicates
what color you are.

704
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,480
And this is great, you
take out $3.00.

705
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,180
Although you can see in this
second picture they're playing

706
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,485
what Eric the designer has
deemed high stakes.

707
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:16,625
Sixteen Tons where you pull out
three five-dollar bills.

708
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:17,930
It says, how to win.

709
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,740
You win when the two pieces
of your color are directly

710
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,460
adjacent to each other.

711
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,142
So diagonally adjacent does
not count for a win.

712
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:25,660
The way you play is, players
take turns, starting with

713
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,285
player one.

714
00:29:26,285 --> 00:29:28,320
When it's your turn, you
say, put me to work.

715
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,530
Players may then offer to
pay you one or more

716
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,880
dollars in any order.

717
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,060
So anyone can just say,
I'll give you this.

718
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,130
You have to accept the highest
payment, except

719
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,730
if there's a tie.

720
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,420
Because with specific
denominations there is very

721
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,140
likely to be a tie.

722
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,570
Then you get to choose
which of the highest

723
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,110
bidders you can take.

724
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:50,700
The person who pays then tells
you what move to make.

725
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,480
And if no one offers to
pay you, you get to

726
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,991
decide what to do.

727
00:29:53,991 --> 00:29:56,877
And then it's the next player's
turn, and you would

728
00:29:56,877 --> 00:29:59,980
continue until one
player wins.

729
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,000
Just off the top of your heads,
having not even played

730
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,370
it-- it's tough to critique
games when you haven't played.

731
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,302
But just looking at the
rules and hearing

732
00:30:06,302 --> 00:30:06,850
about it and even--

733
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,970
I love that picture on the left,
because it embodies some

734
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,550
of the spirit of
the play, too.

735
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,755
What are some interesting things
about this rule set of

736
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,330
that you notice?

737
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,630
AUDIENCE: You play with money,
but you won't win money?

738
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,650
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, that's
an interesting question.

739
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,434
What happens to the money
at the end of the game?

740
00:30:25,434 --> 00:30:25,915
AUDIENCE: Who knows?

741
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:26,396
Do you keep it?

742
00:30:26,396 --> 00:30:27,839
AUDIENCE: It's unclear.

743
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,550
GUEST SPEAKER: Very unclear.

744
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,620
That's one of the things that's
really great about this

745
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,470
game, is that it puts you to
into these social situations

746
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,190
where now you're playing
with real currency

747
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,210
that was your own.

748
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,160
And now it's like, what
happens to this?

749
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,600
It says you win if your piece--
but maybe you feel

750
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,790
like you win if you moved those
pieces and you have the

751
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,500
most money at the
end of the game.

752
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,620
You've got this kind of
weird economy in here.

753
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,697
I think the fact that
it's not explicit in

754
00:30:54,697 --> 00:30:56,230
this rule set is great.

755
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,590
That's what creates this
potential for an interesting

756
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,380
social dynamic.

757
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,870
Other things that are
interesting about this game?

758
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,060
AUDIENCE: If you're the only
person who has money, then you

759
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,360
can basically win.

760
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,230
GUEST SPEAKER: You can basically
win if you're the

761
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,090
only person who has
money, yeah.

762
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,590
So it does require a little
bit of strategy, too.

763
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,090
AUDIENCE: Technically,
from that set of--

764
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,725
could you win on the first turn,
because it seems you

765
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:20,640
only have two pieces
of a certain color.

766
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
the right is still

767
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,410
the starting position.

768
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Iknow.

769
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,140
And so on your turn, you could
take one-- your piece and have

770
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,640
it be moved to the square
right next to yours.

771
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,200
AUDIENCE: No.

772
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,520
AUDIENCE: Move to
any adjacent--

773
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,290
AUDIENCE: Oh, you have
to move it--

774
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,305
AUDIENCE: Read the rule
in the red there.

775
00:31:37,305 --> 00:31:39,125
AUDIENCE: Oh, any adjacent
number,okay.

776
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,490
I didn't read the
adjacent part.

777
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,203
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, it's any
adjacent or empty square.

778
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:43,600
AUDIENCE: It's actually
really interesting.

779
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,690
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
a really weird--

780
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,250
I also think you're not-- the
agency you have in the game to

781
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,460
win is not by moving your own
pieces, it's by paying someone

782
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,030
to do the work for you.

783
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,448
So then we get back to this
quote at the beginning, "You

784
00:31:58,448 --> 00:31:59,344
load 16 tons and what
do you get?

785
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:00,240
Another day older and
deeper in debt."

786
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
It's like, what is
this game about.

787
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,710
It could be about
a lot of things.

788
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:06,670
And we honestly probably
shouldn't dissect it until

789
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,610
we've played it.

790
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:12,940
I think, too, the corrugated
cardboard, it gets hot inside

791
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,330
of there, if you're
not outside.

792
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,910
And that's a really interesting
thing, too.

793
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:19,570
You're in there, it's hot, it's
sweaty, you've got dirty

794
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:23,010
money in your hands, you're
moving around these sizable--

795
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,249
they have weight to them.

796
00:32:24,249 --> 00:32:25,686
That was really important,
too.

797
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:28,081
This could have been played
around a table with go-pieces

798
00:32:28,081 --> 00:32:29,518
or something, painted
go-pieces.

799
00:32:29,518 --> 00:32:34,077
But these are substantial steel
pieces that you've got

800
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,040
to pick up and move.

801
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,730
Obviously the song was
about manual labor.

802
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,530
So this is a really
interesting game.

803
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,270
This was released at the
Art History of Games

804
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,420
conference last year.

805
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,760
And it did well at IndieCade
this year.

806
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,840
It won the Developers
Choice Award.

807
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,890
And it's really cool.

808
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,640
I want to try to get it
up to MIT so that we

809
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,950
can all play it.

810
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,030
AUDIENCE: It occurs to me that
if you went by rules where you

811
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,400
keep the money you get to the
end of the game, you basically

812
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,580
could throw the game to
get all the money.

813
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,200
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
you could try.

814
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
But people are gonna know
what you're doing.

815
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,870
Because they're going
to see you're shiny.

816
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,520
So it's--

817
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,660
AUDIENCE: I'm not gonna
pay you back.

818
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,020
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, the
multiplayer gets--

819
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,690
the multiplayer, the
game gets in it.

820
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,696
Just cycling back to
what we're talking

821
00:33:16,696 --> 00:33:19,800
about, is this art?

822
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:24,260
It would be hard for me to call
it much of anything else.

823
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,000
So this is one of my
favorite games.

824
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,300
It's certainly my favorite
that Jason's ever made.

825
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,940
Who's played Gravitation here?

826
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,400
A couple of games?

827
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,070
Alright, cool.

828
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,070
And a bunch of you haven't.

829
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,785
That's awesome.

830
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:36,250
So I'll get one of
you to play it.

831
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,790
One thing I want to point out
with this-- we can talk after

832
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:43,150
someone's played Gravitation,
a little bit about what we

833
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,260
think about the game itself.

834
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,660
But I think this quote
is interesting.

835
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,980
He has artist statements
with all of his games.

836
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,510
Some of them say more, some
of them say less.

837
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,270
This one responded briefly
'cause this was after Passage

838
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:53,590
was released.

839
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,910
And I think you guys have
all seen Passage, right?

840
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,740
You can immediately identify
the aesthetic similarities

841
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,562
because the character
is exactly the same.

842
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:04,900
He was responding to criticism
from people about his pixel

843
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,435
art, and why did he
go for Pixel art.

844
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:10,639
He says, "I now see ultra-low
res pixel art as a kind of

845
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,159
digital cartooning.

846
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,150
It stands right on the line
between the symbolic and the

847
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,100
representational, leaving plenty
of room for viewer

848
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,360
interpretation.

849
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,565
Why draw sideburns when the
viewers can imagine sideburns

850
00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:21,539
on their own.

851
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,876
You just need to give them
something to pin their

852
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,948
imagination on, something
to guide them a bit.

853
00:34:24,948 --> 00:34:25,922
Cartoons are perfect for that.

854
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:27,889
I think it's a really
interesting point.

855
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:31,690
And I think what he's also
suggesting here, which is

856
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,260
maybe not clear, is that this
is doing a similar thing to

857
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,621
what that quote from
the music does.

858
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:39,384
It's priming your experience
of the play.

859
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:41,909
You load up this game, you see
that it's got this low-res

860
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:44,320
pixel art that we now associate
with this kind of

861
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,305
art game movement, and
you're ready to read

862
00:34:46,305 --> 00:34:47,889
this in another way.

863
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,060
If I gave you a first-person
shooter and told you nothing

864
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,900
about it except that it was
gonna be the fastest,

865
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,469
awesomest, multiplayer
first-person shooter

866
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:59,800
experience, but it looked like
this, would you be inclined to

867
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,750
read it like an art game?

868
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,900
I don't know.

869
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,150
But certainly in this instance
with these kind of little

870
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,500
games, this pixel-art aesthetic
that you see being

871
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:14,110
duplicated in a lot of places,
is sort of priming the pump.

872
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:17,340
It's establishing some sort
of context in which you

873
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,580
can read this game.

874
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,285
So who wants to play
Gravitation?

875
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:25,231
Oops, no, that's not what's
supposed to happen.

876
00:35:25,231 --> 00:35:26,704
Why did it click on link.

877
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:29,650
Oh, 'cause I clicked on my
screen, not on this screen.

878
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,091
All that does is take
me out of here.

879
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:31,341
Yay.

it's logged up on.

who plays.

Who wants to--

890
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,433
I can't make the choice.

891
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:56,720
Who wants to do it?

it's a version zero.

893
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,940

make that the case.

896
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,683

don't play it now, you can

we have a few.

We have a few opportunities, so
anybody jump over and play.

and then we'll do join

you wouldn't mind talking

904

about your experience to play
Gravitation as you play it.

the moment.

more to get higher?

think the start of it because

want to play.

[UNINTELLIGIBLE] too fast, and

1011
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,365
your hair's burning, that means
you just gave him too

1012
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,030
much love, and he starts
falling really fast.

1013
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,710

AUDIENCE: But there's a a
counter on the ice blocks of

1017
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,850
the stars, and you get more
points if you get them into

1018
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,570
the furnace faster.

1019
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,286
I think they went down
and he started

1020
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:55,754
warming up in the furnace.

1021
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,450
The warmer the world, the less
points you get for de-icing?

1022

global warming?

he's on drugs.

1025
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,290
He gets love from this girl, and
then the ice and the stars

1026
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,140
make you happy, but only
for a little bit.

Yeah.

1031
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,480

seems to reduce at a much

1032
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,730
faster rate.

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:43,210

1034
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,290
[INAUDIBLE]

1035
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,330
said

1036
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,370
AUDIENCE: I think it's
about drugs.

1037
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,810
I think everything's
about drugs.

1038
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,230
I mean, yeah, obviously.

1039
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:57,577

1040
00:41:57,577 --> 00:41:59,509
AUDIENCE: You can actually
catch the purple

1041
00:41:59,509 --> 00:42:00,759
guy into that cave.

1042
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:04,836

1043
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:05,655
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

1044
00:42:05,655 --> 00:42:08,875
AUDIENCE: It's a really stupid
design, going all the way back

1045
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:09,600
down there.

1046
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,830
GUEST SPEAKER: There's a
[INAUDIBLE] on the right, you

1047
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,578
can fall faster.

1048
00:42:12,578 --> 00:42:16,232
AUDIENCE: The higher you climb,
the further you fall.

1049
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:17,630
AUDIENCE: Ooh, poetic.

1050
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,622
AUDIENCE: Now I probably have a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] stars, so I

1051
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,066
think they need to play--

1052
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:22,500
AUDIENCE: She's gone.

1053
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,404
AUDIENCE: She's dead.

1054
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:25,880
You killed her.

1055
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,372
AUDIENCE: So sad.

1056
00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:29,940
And it's not the fire left.

1057
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,090
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

1058
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,740
AUDIENCE:And the fire isn't
bringing things back.

1059
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,630
AUDIENCE: Oh, my god.

1060
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,445
You didn't get any stars
for her, so she died.

1061
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:39,230
She eats stars.

1062
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,510
AUDIENCE: Oh, there you go.

1063
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,265
Is she there now?

1064
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:42,960
The fire started warming
you again.

1065
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,780

1066
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,250
AUDIENCE: Nope.

1067
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,530
She's gone forever.

1068
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,800
You can't play ball alone.

1069
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,880
AUDIENCE: When she's gone.

1070
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,265
Maybe she only comes
in the spring.

1071
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:52,490
Maybe winter's too cold.

1072
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,720
So maybe if I wait
by the fire.

1073
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,970
AUDIENCE: Does is go
faster right there?

1074
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:01,150

1075
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,790
AUDIENCE: Yeah, why is
it getting bigger?

1076
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,160
AUDIENCE: 'Cause he's
by the fire.

1077
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,298
It's getting warmer.

1078
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:07,732
AUDIENCE: That wasn't
working earlier.

1079
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:08,982
AUDIENCE: Now it is.

1080
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,360

1081
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,425
AUDIENCE: He's at rock bottom.

1082
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,810
AUDIENCE: Looks like
it's spring.

1083
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:16,600
AUDIENCE: But when she--

1084
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,570
AUDIENCE: How high can
you jump right now?

1085
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,130
AUDIENCE: Can you
hit the ball?

1086
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:20,780
AUDIENCE: Pretty high.

1087
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,342
That's a lot of jumbos.

1088
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:25,306
AUDIENCE: No, I can't
hit the ball.

1089
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:26,430
AUDIENCE: Only she
can hit the ball.

1090
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,682
AUDIENCE: While you're
increasing, you should

1091
00:43:27,682 --> 00:43:29,460
probably go up and get--

1092
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,500
AUDIENCE: Go up.

1093
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:30,950
Go up.

1094
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,301
Go up.

1095
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:34,656
AUDIENCE: Ah, there you go.

1096
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:35,930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
stop [INAUDIBLE].

1097
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,570
It stopped contracting, too.

1098
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:40,777
AUDIENCE: You're on fire now.

1099
00:43:40,777 --> 00:43:43,212
AUDIENCE: He's on fire.

1100
00:43:43,212 --> 00:43:44,673
AUDIENCE: Can you go
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1101
00:43:44,673 --> 00:43:45,923
high if he's on fire?

1102
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,543

1103
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,004
AUDIENCE: Uh-oh.

1104
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:52,952
Whoa.

1105
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:55,410
Four stars.

1106
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:57,030
AUDIENCE: Are you getting
all of them?

1107
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:01,750
AUDIENCE: That might have
been a bit of overdose.

1108
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:05,170
AUDIENCE: You totally OD'd
on stars just there.

1109
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,250
AUDIENCE: Or, or, you can only
hold four, and then it

1110
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,480
retracts and you get four
that turn to ice blocks.

1111
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,690
AUDIENCE: What?

1112
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,800
That was intense.

1113
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,950
AUDIENCE: That's a
lot of falling.

1114
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,690
AUDIENCE: There was
so much energy.

1115
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,940
AUDIENCE: Wait.

1116
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,100

1117
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,100
No.

1118
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,350
No.

1119
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:30,100

1120
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,940
AUDIENCE: You won.

1121
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,190
Yay!

1122
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,820

1123
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,390
Now what you won is
a good question.

1124
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,500
GUEST SPEAKER: That's
Gravitation.

1125
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,810
Actually, I'm not
even kidding.

1126
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,460
That's certainly my favorite
Jason Rohrer game.

1127
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,998
It's one of my favorite games.

1128
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:46,722
And I think even just the
example of you guys playing is

1129
00:44:46,722 --> 00:44:49,740
great, because you're just
shouting out all these

1130
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,400
different ideas for what
it could be about.

1131
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,840

1132
00:44:54,840 --> 00:45:00,362
There's some clear
intentionality in his design

1133
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:03,196
with this game, in terms of
the system's trying to

1134
00:45:03,196 --> 00:45:05,320
communicate something that's
other than just

1135
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,470
engagement or fun.

1136
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:10,758
Was it fun?

1137
00:45:10,758 --> 00:45:11,166
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1138
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:11,982
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, all right.

1139
00:45:11,982 --> 00:45:13,330
Cool.

1140
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,890
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1141
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:16,090
Thoughts on what it's about?

1142
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,428
I heard a couple people
be like, drugs.

1143
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,212
AUDIENCE: It's definitely
drugs.

1144
00:45:19,212 --> 00:45:21,806
I saw tons of analogies.

1145
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:24,250
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
kind of like drugs.

1146
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:24,670
AUDIENCE: Or love.

1147
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:25,680
Or both.

1148
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,370
AUDIENCE: Love is a drug.

1149
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,410
AUDIENCE: Your relationship
versus whatever you're trying

1150
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,790
to do for your career.

1151
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,040
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

1152
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,655

1153
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:36,570
I think it's like the
ultimate MIT game.

1154
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,530
If I told you that this was his
daughter, would it change

1155
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,050
your interpretations
of the game?

1156
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,390
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1157
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,940
GUEST SPEAKER: So now, if you
know that that's his daughter,

1158
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,020
what do you think it's about?

1159
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,680
AUDIENCE: Neglect.

1160
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,550
AUDIENCE: Job versus family.

1161
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:57,860
GUEST SPEAKER: He says
explicitly, before you play,

1162
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,350
that this is a game
of motivation.

1163
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:03,090
He doesn't go too far into
telling you what the game is

1164
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,000
specifically about.

1165
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,260
I think playing through
it a couple times--

1166
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,350
I will tell you the first time
I played and I came back down

1167
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,070
and she was gone, it was
very upsetting for me.

1168
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,540
I was like, and I don't know
if it's just I was ready to

1169
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:20,510
play it that way, or my life
stage or something like that.

1170
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,647
But the idea of he's playing
with his daughter, that

1171
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,700
inspires him, he travels, and
then one of these days if

1172
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,530
you're gone too long,
she grows up.

1173
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,330
I don't know if she
dies, but--

1174
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,650
AUDIENCE: He didn't bring
her any money.

1175
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:38,640
Because she had no money,
she dies [INAUDIBLE].

1176
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,120
GUEST SPEAKER: So I think
this is a really--

1177
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,360
AUDIENCE: What did they say,
it's a game about motivation?

1178
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,660
GUEST SPEAKER: It is, yeah.

1179
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,770
AUDIENCE: Or she
OD'd on drugs.

1180
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:48,350
GUEST SPEAKER: It's free.

1181
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:50,320
If you just Google-search
Gravitation Jason Rohrer,

1182
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,600
you'll find the links to it.

1183
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,510
You'll find his artist
statement, which I think is

1184
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:55,070
really good to read.

1185
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:57,850
Again, with John Sharp's point
about declare your

1186
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:58,400
intentionality.

1187
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,370
Whatever you say what game's
about is important.

1188
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,800
I think this qualifies, at
least for me, as art.

1189
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,230
It's doing things that I see
other piece of art doing.

1190
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,710
GUEST SPEAKER: OK, so
Paolo Pedercini--

1191
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:13,540
how many over time?

1192
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,610
Oh, good.

1193
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:17,240
Paolo Pedercini is one
of my favorite game

1194
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,220
designers right now.

1195
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,916
This game actually is one of his
newest ones, and I think

1196
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:24,060
it's hilarious and great.

1197
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:26,120
It's called Memory Reloaded
The Downfall.

1198
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,480
Test your concentration with
Memory Reloaded matching game

1199
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,995
for these unstable times.

1200
00:47:29,995 --> 00:47:32,830
History may be different from
that which you remember.

1201
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,330
Who would like to play
Memory Reloaded?

1202
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,950
I'm laughing already,
because it's funny.

1203
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:36,750
Has anybody played it?

1204
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,090
I need somebody who's
not played it.

1205
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:38,690
OK, good.

1206
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:39,450

00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,316

1210
00:47:46,316 --> 00:47:46,788
OK.

1211
00:47:46,788 --> 00:47:50,080

1212
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,140

AUDIENCE: Don't do it.

1214
00:47:53,583 --> 00:47:55,270

AUDIENCE: You're done.

1216
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,120

AUDIENCE: --go away.

1218
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:01,325
It's kind of scary.

1219
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:02,560
I could already see
what they can do.

1220
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,820
You're gonna play a
game switch on me.

1221
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,580
Afghan Freedom Fighters.

1222
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,460

1224
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:12,870

1228
00:48:19,538 --> 00:48:20,810
Afghan Freedom Fighter.

1229
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,945
AUDIENCE: I bet if you grab
Iraqi Oil before Afghan

1230
00:48:23,945 --> 00:48:25,525
Freedom Fighter, it
becomes terrorist.

1231
00:48:25,525 --> 00:48:28,630

00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,620

1235
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,311

1236
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,340
Yes.

1237
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,948
Global Inequality.

1238
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,352
Yes.

1239
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:40,290
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

1240
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,230

Ruthless Banker.

1242
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,460

1243
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,250
Was Iraqi Oil here?

1244
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,500
No.

1245
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,680

1246
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,590

1249
00:48:57,442 --> 00:48:59,366
Ha!

1250
00:48:59,366 --> 00:49:01,780
Hey, not cool.

1251
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,290
Universal Health Care.

1252
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,150
Universal Health Care.

1253
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,491
Sweet.

1254
00:49:05,491 --> 00:49:06,385
Oh.

1255
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:07,280
One over.

1256
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,530
There.

1257
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,180

1258
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,430

1259
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:17,341

1260
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:18,460
There we go.

1261
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,570
Wait.

1262
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:21,650
Needy Banker.

1263
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:24,000
Ruthless Banker.

1264
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,860
Does it matter, the order
you click them in?

1265
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,720
Ruthless Banker.

1266
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,200
What?

1267
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,590
What did the other one
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

1268
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:32,382
There we go.

1269
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:33,278
Nice.

1270
00:49:33,278 --> 00:49:34,570
So that means now--

1271
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:38,394

1272
00:49:38,394 --> 00:49:41,740
He's never a satisfied banker.

1273
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,230
What the hell?

1274
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:44,850
Oh, dear.

1275
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,520
Did we?

1276
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,420
Shoot.

1277
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,730
Better move.

1278
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,160
GUEST SPEAKER: This--

1279
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,156

1282
00:50:02,116 --> 00:50:03,366
AUDIENCE: Oh, I get it.

1283
00:50:03,366 --> 00:50:19,580

1284
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:20,550
That's fun.

1285
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,940
Is that the entire game?

1286
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,805
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes, that
is the whole game.

1287
00:50:23,805 --> 00:50:26,180
Of course, you get different
outcomes.

1288
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,420
Yeah, that's the idea.

1289
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,870
I think you guys have seen some
of the Molleindustria's

1290
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:32,138
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1291
00:50:32,138 --> 00:50:33,954
You guys saw Every Day
the Same Dream?

1292
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:34,792
AUDIENCE: I like that one.

1293
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:36,470
GUEST SPEAKER: Which
is interesting.

1294
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,940
Yeah, that one's also one
of my favorite games.

1295
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:47,350
This is looking at another kind
of sector of art, the

1296
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:49,135
activist political statement
sector of art is doing that

1297
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:52,040
through games, and it's
something-- this music too

1298
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,280
[INAUDIBLE]--

1299
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,240
something that he does
particularly

1300
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:56,990
well with his games.

1301
00:50:56,990 --> 00:51:01,163
And I think this one's
particularly interesting and

1302
00:51:01,163 --> 00:51:01,840
kind of funny.

1303
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:10,050
I love the reworking of a really
classic game mechanic.

1304
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:12,460
The entire point of memory is
your expectation that they

1305
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:15,590
would be the same the second
time you turn it over.

1306
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,420
And when it changes on you, it
really worsens that kind of

1307
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,660
perspective, I suppose
imbalance, that can exist when

1308
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,190
you're not just turning over
Toadstools and Bowsers, but

1309
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:30,700
actual, interesting things.

1310
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:36,180
I love the crying, sweating
polar bear with a beach chair.

1311
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,720
It actually cracks me up.

1312
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,750
Humor is actually
something that

1313
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,510
shouldn't be ignored here.

1314
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:43,260
If we remember, that was one of
the central Fluxus things,

1315
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:44,750
this idea of satire.

1316
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,230
Humor is important.

1317
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:51,972
So I think Paolo Pedercini's
work is really awesome.

1318
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:56,350
Again, for me, it's certainly
arcing up.

1319
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,820
This game's really cool.

1320
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:59,020
Who's played Love?

1321
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,345
A few people who's
played Love?

1322
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:01,015
All right, cool.

1323
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:04,168
I'd love someone who has not
played Love to play for a

1324
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:04,794
little bit.

1325
00:52:04,794 --> 00:52:07,950
I don't know if we can
play the whole game.

1326
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:12,780
This is actually a game that I
really don't like, but I like

1327
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,170
the things that it does, if
that makes any sense.

1328
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,395
It bothers me for some reason.

1329
00:52:17,395 --> 00:52:19,200
And yet--

1330
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,350
it's such an articulate
statement, this

1331
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,860
game bothers me--

1332
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,674
but I think it's worth looking
at, because he's doing a

1333
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:31,530
particularly interesting
thing, Alexander Ocias.

1334
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,865
I suppose it's a
soft C, Ocias.

1335
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:43,773

1336
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:46,268
I have the sound turned off.

1337
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:47,765

00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:50,562
AUDIENCE: It's so funny.

1392
00:55:50,562 --> 00:55:52,550
Just that little--

1393
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,800
AUDIENCE: What are the
controls for this?

1394
00:55:53,800 --> 00:56:06,963

1395
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:07,957
AUDIENCE: You should disobey.

1396
00:56:07,957 --> 00:56:09,245
AUDIENCE: What?

1397
00:56:09,245 --> 00:56:11,504
Can you no longer jump?

1398
00:56:11,504 --> 00:56:12,496
AUDIENCE: I'm just
screwing around.

1399
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:13,746
AUDIENCE: He's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1400
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:25,888

1401
00:56:25,888 --> 00:56:27,872
AUDIENCE: Oh, I thought
that was bad.

1402
00:56:27,872 --> 00:56:39,320

1403
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,920
GUEST SPEAKER: This game is
well aggravatingly tuned,

1404
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,872
because it's difficult enough.

1405
00:56:43,872 --> 00:56:54,696

1406
00:56:54,696 --> 00:56:57,156
AUDIENCE: Are you doing
that intentionally?

1407
00:56:57,156 --> 00:56:58,406
AUDIENCE: I just like to.

1408
00:56:58,406 --> 00:57:03,590

1409
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,470
GUEST SPEAKER: It's actually
a pretty long game.

1410
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,920
I encourage you guys to--

1411
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,720
it's pretty- it's
all flash-based.

1412
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,549
AUDIENCE: What's the message?

1413
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:13,545
GUEST SPEAKER: It's a really
good question.

1414
00:57:13,545 --> 00:57:15,042
Let me just jump in and go back
to that place where--

1415
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:17,038
thank you for playing.

1416
00:57:17,038 --> 00:57:19,540
Thank you for playing.

1417
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,350
AUDIENCE: Disgusting.

1418
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,920
AUDIENCE: You are a changed
person because of it.

1419
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,150
So the question then becomes
what's the point, which

1420
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,060
already we're in a position
now where we're asking

1421
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,910
questions like that.

1422
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,330
Which is, if you were playing
Modern Warfare II, you might

1423
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,350
say what's the point, and
be like, to blow a lot

1424
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,210
of stuff up, right?

1425
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:38,850
This is the response he had in
one of his interviews he gave

1426
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:40,690
after his release and said, I
wanted to get people to wake

1427
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,830
up and think about the games
they are playing.

1428
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:44,680
Much of the industry appears to
be pushing in the opposite

1429
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,790
direction, as we'll have
tutorials, holding your hand

1430
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,650
from beginning to end in
subtext, screens for pointless

1431
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:50,540
exposition.

1432
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,320
It is treating players
like idiots.

1433
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,480
It is absolutely infuriating.

1434
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,960
When you think about it in terms
of the tutorial, if this

1435
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,066
is the tutorial for playing the

1436
00:57:57,066 --> 00:57:59,370
game, it's pretty obnoxious.

1437
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:01,240
But it's not that much different
than the kind of

1438
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:03,600
tutorials we encounter in
a lot of games that just

1439
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,440
basically hold your hand and
tell you how to do everything.

1440
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,290
I think he's really
confronting that.

1441
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:12,140
I guess if I were to say the
reasons that I don't like this

1442
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,790
game, I think the control
scheme is

1443
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,040
actually, it's a weakness.

1444
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:21,242
The game is so hard that, I
mean, you saw you couldn't

1445
00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:22,475
even get to the things that he
was trying to communicate.

1446
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:24,610
It gets weirder, the further
along you get,

1447
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,530
I can promise you.

1448
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:29,610
It's just you have to get really
skilled at doing it.

1449
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:34,480
There's kind of like a play
barrier for entry on it.

1450
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,856
It's also, for me, I think dare
I say, it almost gets too

1451
00:58:40,856 --> 00:58:43,818
abstract for me at
certain points.

1452
00:58:43,818 --> 00:58:46,220
Clearly he's trying to say
something, but there's nothing

1453
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,140
I can latch onto to understand
what it is.

1454
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,420
That's entirely his prerogative,
but for me, I'm

1455
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,290
just like, what?

1456
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,760
I have no clue what this
is about at all.

1457
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,045
So that's a little tricky,
not fully grasping.

1458
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:00,905
Clearly I'm not--

1459
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,950
I'm partially, so it's
like the perfect

1460
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:05,820
Fluxus piece of art.

1461
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,980
OK, so I've only got a couple
more to talk about.

1462
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:09,357
I've got about 15 minutes.

1463
00:59:09,357 --> 00:59:11,422
This, I think, is actually one
of the most important games we

1464
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:13,490
can talk about today, which
is Cow Clicker.

1465
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:14,320
Who's played Cow Clicker?

1466
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,310
Yay.

1467
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:20,260
This is by Ian Bogost-- that's
the guy we saw earlier.

1468
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,240
And he said, Cow Clicker
is a Facebook game

1469
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,900
about Facebook games.

1470
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,470
It's partly a satire and partly
a playable theory of

1471
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:29,000
today's social games, and partly
an earnest example of

1472
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,350
that genre.

1473
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:32,370
So this is kind of like
a classic sort of

1474
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,520
art thing to do.

1475
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,310
You take something that you're
going to satire, and you make

1476
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:40,770
a version of that, that maybe
does something differently,

1477
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:43,190
but it's fundamentally what
you are satiring.

1478
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,620
It's like the Andy Kaufman
comedic kind of style.

1479
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,460
You just assume that kind
of character or role.

1480
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:57,150
It's something that I think is
like joyfully subversive in

1481
00:59:57,150 --> 00:59:58,120
doing satire.

1482
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,110
So hopefully I'm logged into
Facebook so you can see.

1483
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:01,587
I haven't clicked recently,
so you guys can

1484
01:00:01,587 --> 01:00:03,610
witness one of my clicks.

1485
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,860
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1486
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,047

1487
01:00:07,047 --> 01:00:09,011
Facebook is down.

1488
01:00:09,011 --> 01:00:10,975
Facebook is canceled forever.

1489
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,225
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1490
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:14,920

1491
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,770
[LAUGHTER]

1492
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:20,400
It actually has no friends.

1493
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,720
It's also possible that
the wireless--

1494
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,560
the wireless in that corner
is kind of bad.

1495
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,810
GUEST SPEAKER: Should I switch
to Google Guest?

1496
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:34,000

1497
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,610
I can actually, before we can
see it, I can talk a little

1498
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,740
bit about the sort of
interesting controversy that

1499
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:41,410
Cow Clicker is creating.

1500
01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:43,040
It's making money.

1501
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,050

1502
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:51,585
Let me try Google Guest.

1503
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:53,070
I'm not connected.

1504
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,050
How about now?

1505
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:58,590
It seems to be working better.

1506
01:00:58,590 --> 01:00:59,840
AUDIENCE: You're still not--

1507
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,030

1508
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,130
GUEST SPEAKER: The last part of
his statement is about an

1509
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:06,580
earnest effort at a game.

1510
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,340
It is fundamentally
a Facebook game.

1511
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:14,170
You can see I've got 5 mooney
and my next click is in a

1512
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,920
minute and 40-- ah, man, I
missed one of my clicks.

1513
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,240
But maybe if we wait while I
talk about it you can witness

1514
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,170
one of my clicks.

1515
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,490
Oh, wait, I actually have
some clicks left.

1516
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:24,120
I've got one this week.

1517
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,010
AUDIENCE: That's in two hours?

1518
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,030
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, it
looks like that's when

1519
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,630
I get my next one.

1520
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:31,475
So basically you can
click your cow.

1521
01:01:31,475 --> 01:01:35,570

1522
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:40,220
Why can I not click
my cow here.

1523
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:42,260
But you can click your cow, and
then you can-- oh, it's

1524
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,510
because I'm on scroll?

1525
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,400

1526
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,380
Anyway, you can click your cow,
and then you can use your

1527
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,510
mooney to buy new cows that
are fundamentally the same

1528
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:56,945
thing as other cows, just with
aesthetic differences.

1529
01:01:56,945 --> 01:01:59,960
So plain cow.

1530
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:00,930
These are the cows I have.

1531
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,350
I have a plain cow
and a steel cow.

1532
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:04,640
I haven't been playing
a lot of Cow Clicker.

1533
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,630
If I go to buy a cow,
I can buy a new cow.

1534
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:09,270

1535
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,490
So you can see lots
of different cows.

1536
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:15,110
They cost you in
game currency.

1537
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:16,090
AUDIENCE: Paisley cow.

1538
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:19,190
GUEST SPEAKER: Holy cow.

1539
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,880
Oil cow [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1540
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:22,180
It's got a BP logo.

1541
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,626
Cute.

1542
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:25,554
Like the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
cows.

1543
01:02:25,554 --> 01:02:27,000
That's pretty good.

1544
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,350
So there's lots of
different cows.

1545
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,820
You can buy cows, you can give
cows, you can invite a cow,

1546
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,680
there's cow rankings.

1547
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,450
AUDIENCE: You can buy a cow.

1548
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,780
GUEST SPEAKER: So you can see,
mooney's actually pretty

1549
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:38,910
inflated at this point.

1550
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:40,680
You can get 10 mooney for 50
cents, which is pretty good,

1551
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,060
1,000 for $10, which
is awesome.

1552
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,840
And collect a lot of cows.

1553
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,970
You can trade cows.

1554
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,460
And you can go to your friends
barns and see how

1555
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,200
many cows they have.

1556
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,070
And you can click on your cows
when you make your appointment

1557
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:56,850
to actually visit a cow.

1558
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:01,360
So I think you can see how he's
poking fun at things like

1559
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,735
FarmVille things like Ravenwood
Fair, which I'm

1560
01:03:03,735 --> 01:03:07,750
obsessed with now, actually,
these kind of games where all

1561
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,565
you're fundamentally doing is
clicking and acquiring an

1562
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:12,020
in-game currency that's
you can then

1563
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:13,510
use for in-game goods.

1564
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,700
But then, of course, you reach
this barrier where you don't

1565
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,940
have enough in-game currency
and you use moo currency.

1566
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,820
Of course the interesting thing
is there are 500,000

1567
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:21,920
people playing this.

1568
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,430
I don't know if it's
that many.

1569
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:23,822
It's a lot.

1570
01:03:23,822 --> 01:03:26,650
If you go to the Cow Clicker
front page it'll tell us.

1571
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:27,900
It just [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1572
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,361

1573
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:31,822
Where does it say how many
players there are?

1574
01:03:31,822 --> 01:03:33,283
AUDIENCE: Ranking, probably
in ranking.

1575
01:03:33,283 --> 01:03:37,666

1576
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:41,080
He's milking the cow clicker.

1577
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,950
You can see this person's--

1578
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,830
Monica's--

1579
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,112
AUDIENCE: Is the cow--

1580
01:03:46,112 --> 01:03:48,620

1581
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,334
AUDIENCE: Is that their
all-time clicks

1582
01:03:49,334 --> 01:03:50,910
or this week's clicks?

1583
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,770
AUDIENCE: Is there a--

1584
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,630
GUEST SPEAKER: Here
we go, yeah, yeah.

1585
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:57,840
12,000 monthly active users.

1586
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:00,410
That's 500,000 in a business
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1587
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,490
But that's a lot of people.

1588
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:02,930
And he's making some interesting
money on it.

1589
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,680
And I think one of the things
that was important that he did

1590
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,290
is there's an active
forum where people

1591
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:07,495
can talk about it.

1592
01:04:07,495 --> 01:04:10,500
So it is a little bit weirdly
controversial, 'cause he made

1593
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,320
this game that is poking
fun at Facebook games.

1594
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:16,935
And yet it is a Facebook game
and presumably making some

1595
01:04:16,935 --> 01:04:18,960
money, too.

1596
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,115
But I think it's really good.

1597
01:04:21,115 --> 01:04:23,640
This is the kind of art that's
also important, where it's

1598
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,930
taking what we do and purposely
looking at how is it

1599
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:32,080
constructed and how it's set up
and forcing us to kind of

1600
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,619
be introspective about the
things that we do and the way

1601
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:35,910
that we engage.

1602
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:38,340
So this is a kind of subversive
game design that I

1603
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,430
think along the lines of Paolo
Pedercini's work and even

1604
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:45,820
Gonzalo Frasca if forcing us
to look at how we interact.

1605
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,070
And Cow Clicker--

1606
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:49,950

1607
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:50,620
So that's that one.

1608
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:51,880
And I've got like 15 minutes.

1609
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,340
Phillip asked me to talk a
little bit about some work

1610
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,450
that I'm doing in this space.

1611
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,210
So I'm gonna talk to you
about a game, it's

1612
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:02,670
still a work in progress.

1613
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,010
It's tentatively entitled
Before and

1614
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:07,950
Now, and it's by me.

1615
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:14,521
And the idea from it is it's
inspired by Fluxus boxes and

1616
01:05:14,521 --> 01:05:16,710
those Flux kits.

1617
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:19,470
I'm really interested in
physically tangible games.

1618
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,370
I don't know why I'm all
of a sudden obsessed

1619
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,370
with holding something.

1620
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,790
But I was at IndieCade and I
heard again-- and this is the

1621
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:31,385
question that drives me more
nuts than the are video games

1622
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,940
art question, although they're
interestingly related.

1623
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,160
But it's when will we have the
Citizen Kane in video games?

1624
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:38,390
It drives me absolutely nuts.

1625
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:41,000
I think 80% of the time people
who say that have never seen

1626
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,830
Citizen Kane.

1627
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,720
I don't really know that.

1628
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:47,220
But I heard it for the umpteenth
time at IndieCade.

1629
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,015
I wanted to throw the television
out of my hotel

1630
01:05:50,015 --> 01:05:51,120
room window.

1631
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,350
And I was going nuts.

1632
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:55,630
And I was like, all right, what
is Citizen Kane about?

1633
01:05:55,630 --> 01:05:56,780
I don't want to spoil it.

1634
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:59,160
Who's seen Citizen Kane
in this room actually?

1635
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,680
All right, good.

1636
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:08,060
So I see Citizen Kane and it's
about this very interesting

1637
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:14,595
idea about presents and mementos
and happiness in a

1638
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,590
very kind of real way.

1639
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,710
And the temporality
of happiness, like

1640
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,690
are you happy now?

1641
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:19,630
Were you happy then?

1642
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:20,640
Do you remember being happy?

1643
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,820
When is happiness?

1644
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:25,150
And so I was like, well, I'm
going to make a Citizen Kane

1645
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,810
in video games, but it's not
gonna be known for being

1646
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:32,690
epically innovative with
camera movement.

1647
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,240
It's going to be about
the things I think

1648
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,760
Citizen Kane are about.

1649
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:42,590
So it's basically in this form,
although I'm rethinking

1650
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,290
what kind of box it's
gonna be in.

1651
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,760
But in this form it's a box.

1652
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,760
And inside of it are various
objects that start out as--

1653
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,900
the starting objects of the box
are the things that have

1654
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,900
personal significance to me.

1655
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,980
One of the rules of the game,
in fact, I think the most

1656
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,305
important rule of the
game is this one.

1657
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,710
Rule number one, you may
permanently exchange an object

1658
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:03,580
of personal significance for
any object of equal value.

1659
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,240
So when you're playing this
game, you can take something

1660
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,770
that belongs to you, and you can
exchange it for anything

1661
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,370
in the box.

1662
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:13,560
And of course, the interesting
thing is these objects in the

1663
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,350
box are of varying degrees
of interactivity.

1664
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:18,590
You can [INAUDIBLE]

1665
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:23,050
so you can draw something
on the Etch A Sketch.

1666
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:25,050
The rules are kind of veiled
at this moment now, where's

1667
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:26,890
there's like a couple
other rules that

1668
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:27,900
are causing to reflect.

1669
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,050
This is actually an extension
of Yup on Word which is a

1670
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,430
project we worked on in the
summer, which was a game that

1671
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:35,680
as you're playing it's a
platform where you're typing,

1672
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,440
and the game stops and asks
you personal questions.

1673
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,480
What I really liked about that
is it was doing something that

1674
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,982
I was referring to as a mechanic
of reflection, where

1675
01:07:45,982 --> 01:07:50,440
the activity of playing is
reflecting, is thinking, is

1676
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,800
contemplating.

1677
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,120
It's not interactive in a very
active way as we think of it,

1678
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,470
it's more reflective.

1679
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,950
I liken it to the moments
in chess where you're

1680
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:00,640
planning your move.

1681
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,530
There's not a lot of
action in chess.

1682
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:04,740
But it's a lot of contemplation
in chess.

1683
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,290
So if it's personal--

1684
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,820
what if that were personal.

1685
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:11,590
And so what I didn't
particularly care about with

1686
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:16,420
Yup on Word it inspires you to
reflect, but it doesn't do it

1687
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,380
with tremendous grace.

1688
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,540
It just asks you a question.

1689
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:23,210
It just comes up out of the blue
and and says, hey, when

1690
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,830
was the last time you lied?

1691
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,250
Sometimes you're surprised by
that, and that's a good

1692
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:30,319
effect, but it's also
not subtle.

1693
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:33,279
So I'm trying to explore how
can we be subtle in causing

1694
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:34,109
reflection.

1695
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:35,180
So there are a few
things here.

1696
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,750
The value question
is interesting.

1697
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,890
How do you know what the value
of the object is in the box?

1698
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:42,210
Do you think of it as
monetary value?

1699
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:44,300
Do you think of it as value in
terms of significance to the

1700
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,950
person who put that in there?

1701
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,649
Why is it significant to the
person who put that in there?

1702
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:49,790
What is this thing?

1703
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:50,729
You can look at it
and reflect.

1704
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:54,090
And then when you leave a trace
of yourself in this box,

1705
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:57,100
the next person who comes and
plays is going to see that.

1706
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,979
And they're going to wonder
what was that.

1707
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:06,810
So I'm also kind of interested
the organicness, the kind of

1708
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,180
never-ending, interminable
nature of a game that carries

1709
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:14,240
the effect of the person who's
played it on and on and on.

1710
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,519
The next iteration of this that
I want to do-- actually

1711
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,819
this was an idea that Jason
Bean gave me was to use an

1712
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:20,200
apothecary chest.

1713
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,279
Because one of the things that
we play-tested it here with--

1714
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:24,523
I left it out for two weeks
and people-- you

1715
01:09:24,523 --> 01:09:25,430
probably saw it.

1716
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,939
It's right there.

1717
01:09:25,939 --> 01:09:27,074
People were engaging in--

1718
01:09:27,074 --> 01:09:31,020
this is a photo with objects
that people had left in.

1719
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:33,326
So it was really fun for me
after two weeks to go into

1720
01:09:33,326 --> 01:09:36,300
this box and be like, what
is all this stuff.

1721
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,210
What got left?

1722
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,109
I was actually surprised the
Etch A Sketch was left.

1723
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:40,920
And then I was like,
what is this stuff?

1724
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,963
And to give you one really good
example, one person at

1725
01:09:43,963 --> 01:09:49,970
the lab put in a Nintendo DS
flash card, which was really a

1726
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,660
wrapped DS flash card.

1727
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:54,130
So now there's this kind
of next level.

1728
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:55,810
The game has changed with
another level of

1729
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,340
interactivity, where it's like,
if I want to get at what

1730
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,630
was the significance of this
object to this person, I need

1731
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,110
to get a DS and play this.

1732
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:10,920
So I open up the-- it's got
folders, and it's got a copy

1733
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,130
of the game Lemming.

1734
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,870
It's got some music in it.

1735
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:15,610
So now it's kind of like you've

1736
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:16,940
uncovered this next layer.

1737
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:19,980
And it's like the interesting
traces of the people who

1738
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:24,990
played this game are now marked
onto this box forever.

1739
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:26,140
Marley even said to me--

1740
01:10:26,140 --> 01:10:29,020
I was talking to her about her
play after she had done it,

1741
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,940
and I was like--

1742
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,660
She told me she wanted to
take the instructions.

1743
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:34,680
She wanted to take the rules.

1744
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,800
That's one of the objects that
she could take out of that.

1745
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,610
And I told her I had thought
about that actually when I was

1746
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,474
designing it, that someone might
be like, ha, I'm going

1747
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:41,160
to take the rules.

1748
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,660
And I was going to put in
a rule that said you can

1749
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,120
permanently exchange for an
object that's not the rules,

1750
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,640
so that the game
could persist.

1751
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:51,010
But I didn't want to
artificially impose that.

1752
01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:53,050
If someone takes the rules
because that's what they want,

1753
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,780
and now the game has changed.

1754
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:58,060
And maybe someone comes along
later and modifies it.

1755
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,000
And maybe they put something in
that makes it a whole new,

1756
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,650
different game.

1757
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:03,410
And I really liked the idea that
you could encounter this

1758
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:07,110
game and that it's gonna be in
this state of flux, I guess

1759
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:09,430
you could say.

1760
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:10,810
That's what I'm working
on now.

1761
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:13,095
And like I said, I think one of
the things I didn't like is

1762
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:15,600
that all of the objects are
accessible all at once.

1763
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,150
So if it's an apothecary chest
with lots of drawers, this was

1764
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:20,590
Jason Bean's idea, then you have
to do a little exploring.

1765
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,860
And maybe the rules are in
one of those drawers.

1766
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,280
And maybe you see
the rules first.

1767
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,730
Maybe you see the rules
way after you've

1768
01:11:25,730 --> 01:11:26,350
looked at a lot of stuff.

1769
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,280
And now you've seen all this
stuff and played with it all

1770
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:29,435
and you really like something.

1771
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:32,520
And now it's like, ooh,
what do I trade?

1772
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:38,560
And yeah, I also am trying to
find a way to give the box a

1773
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,960
history as well.

1774
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:43,670
I've contemplated some ideas
of putting in some kind of

1775
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:47,230
clues that you could then, if
you felt, if you thought about

1776
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:49,040
it or looked it up, you might
be able to find a

1777
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,745
story to this box.

1778
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:52,710
Like if you did an Internet
search you might come up on a

1779
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:55,000
fake website-- well, it wouldn't
be fake, it'd just be

1780
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,800
a website-- but a website with
a fake story that tells you a

1781
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,893
little bit about this box, and
then it gives you a few more

1782
01:12:00,893 --> 01:12:03,200
hooks into what the meaning of
this game or the inspiration

1783
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,740
for this game was.

1784
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,850
And so this is one of my
projects that I'm working on

1785
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:10,430
right now, like I said, I'm
interested in essentially.

1786
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:13,460
But you can see where a lot of
the other things that I was

1787
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:17,700
talking about are inspiring
this work.

1788
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:22,415
And so we come back to that
question of, are games art?

1789
01:12:22,415 --> 01:12:23,410
Of course we only have
five minutes.

1790
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,380
I don't know if you guys have
administrative stuff

1791
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:24,840
afterwards.

1792
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,120
But this is, like I said,
this is my viewpoint.

1793
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:34,690
It's certainly shared with
a lot of people.

1794
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:39,093
But it's not guaranteed truth.

1795
01:12:39,093 --> 01:12:44,470
This is an opinion that
I have just shared.

1796
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:48,500
Any thoughts you guys have about
this subject or these

1797
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:51,222
ideas or these games?

1798
01:12:51,222 --> 01:12:54,680
Anything at all?

1799
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,200
Yesterday's football game?

1800
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,450
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1801
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:01,460

1802
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,110
GUEST SPEAKER: Well, cool.

1803
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,230
I hope this was useful.

1804
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:05,000
I hope it was helpful.

1805
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,280
I think if, at the very least,
it causes you to continue to

1806
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:10,920
think about your own games that
you're developing and how

1807
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:14,660
meaning can be embedded in the
play that you might not even

1808
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:16,080
realize is there.

1809
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:17,830
And also just to count the
possibility space.

1810
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:19,510
I really am excited by--

1811
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:23,710
I'm discouraged by the safe
choices that a lot of

1812
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:25,675
independent game developers
make and excited when some

1813
01:13:25,675 --> 01:13:29,160
game developers really
push on the edge.

1814
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,960
I don't think we have a clear
understanding of what the

1815
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,190
rules are or what even
constitutes a game.

1816
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:37,010
Or what degree of interactivity
is appropriate

1817
01:13:37,010 --> 01:13:38,800
for a quote/unquote game.

1818
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,260
And I think some of these
designers are really testing

1819
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:45,072
the waters of the medium,
you know, what can we

1820
01:13:45,072 --> 01:13:45,990
really do with this?

1821
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:47,760
Where can we go?

1822
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,975
How edgy and satirical and
avant-garde can we be?

1823
01:13:49,975 --> 01:13:53,090

1824
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,571
I think that's always good.

1825
01:13:55,571 --> 01:13:59,954
'Cause I'm a revolutionary,
crazy person.

1826
01:13:59,954 --> 01:14:01,204
AUDIENCE: Crazy person.

1827
01:14:01,204 --> 01:14:07,760

1828
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,280
AUDIENCE: Hope 7 played yet one
more this year, which were

1829
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,568
some of the games that Abe
worked with the team on over

1830
01:14:14,568 --> 01:14:15,570
the summer.

1831
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:19,492
Those are all on our GAMBIT
website, just until 2010 and

1832
01:14:19,492 --> 01:14:21,690
as yet [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
which we're

1833
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,220
booked about this summer.

1834
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:26,480
This sounds like tri-season
will be digital work.

1835
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,790
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, and please
play them and give us

1836
01:14:27,790 --> 01:14:28,620
feedback, too, right?

1837
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:29,784
Because that's the
other thing.

1838
01:14:29,784 --> 01:14:32,860
These are not perfect
articulations of game as the

1839
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,654
pure art form.

1840
01:14:34,654 --> 01:14:37,039
We're constantly evolving and
trying to improve, so any

1841
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:39,435
feedback you can give us on
this stuff is greatly

1842
01:14:39,435 --> 01:14:40,685
appreciated.

1843
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,420

1844
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,520
AUDIENCE: Do you still have
that box, like somewhere?

1845
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,100
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, yeah.

1846
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:45,805
It's in my office.

1847
01:14:45,805 --> 01:14:46,250
Yeah, totally.

1848
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:50,970
I have the box and the other
part of it is when I do the

1849
01:14:50,970 --> 01:14:54,760
second version of it in the
apothecary kind of chest--

1850
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,620
The one thing that's important
to me is that each of the--

1851
01:14:57,620 --> 01:15:00,470
For the prototype I just sort
of threw some reasonably

1852
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,210
meaningful objects in there.

1853
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:05,020
But I want it to be populated
with objects that are

1854
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:08,350
personally significant to myself
or symbolic to myself.

1855
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:13,270
And populating that box at the
outset with meaningful objects

1856
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:19,050
I think is important, because
once it's released into the

1857
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:22,100
world for play that it's
constantly changing.

1858
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:27,460
So that first instantiation of
the game is the one that's

1859
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,210
about me in some sense, and
about my experiences and then

1860
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:32,520
it becomes the world's
to just play.

1861
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,210
AUDIENCE: So the way that your
game kind of reminds me of is

1862
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:38,740
I'm pretty sure I heard
somewhere that some

1863
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,950
person had a pen.

1864
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:44,824
He started with a pen
and kept trading--

1865
01:15:44,824 --> 01:15:46,290
AUDIENCE: The red paper--

1866
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:46,980
AUDIENCE: No.

1867
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,210
This is a different one.

1868
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,500
Not the red paper
clip for a car.

1869
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,120
I think someone started with
a pen or something and kept

1870
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,450
trading it.

1871
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:57,140
And over the course of a
year or two, he'd got--

1872
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:00,314
From that initial pen,
he was able to trade

1873
01:16:00,314 --> 01:16:01,640
for a house or something.

1874
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,940
GUEST SPEAKER: It was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1875
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,980
And that was sort of
an interesting--

1876
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,860
I think it was on eBay, too,
or something like that.

1877
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,460
And that's even using a pretty
well-designed game system--

1878
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:14,560
'cause eBay is totally
a game--

1879
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,850
and using a game system and
subverting the system itself

1880
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,970
to do something really
interesting.

1881
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:21,170
Yeah, that's a really great--

1882
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,190
it's a game inside of a game.

1883
01:16:23,190 --> 01:16:23,820
I love that.

1884
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:26,320
It's kind of like the Cow
Clicker, like making a game

1885
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,612
inside of the game
that subverts--

1886
01:16:29,612 --> 01:16:31,430
AUDIENCE: Are you familiar
with the concept of

1887
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:33,500
geo-caching?

1888
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,596
When I first saw--

1889
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,488
the game you were talking about
using [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1890
01:16:37,488 --> 01:16:38,907
reminded me of it.

1891
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:40,700
So initially what it was, was
when GPS's first came out,

1892
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:42,310
people were like, oh, hey,
this is really cool

1893
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,460
technology.

1894
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:44,190
We should think of something
fun to do with it.

1895
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:49,255
So what they did was, these
people started hiding empty

1896
01:16:49,255 --> 01:16:53,770
tins of little trinkets and
stuff on various hiking trails

1897
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,080
or other locations.

1898
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:56,840
And you would look up the
coordinates on your GPS

1899
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,622
finder, and you would
find this box.

1900
01:16:59,622 --> 01:17:02,646
And then you'd trade trinkets,
and you get them.

1901
01:17:02,646 --> 01:17:05,020
And you keep traveling
to these other--

1902
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,330
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, and in
that sense this whole

1903
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,930
worldwide game becomes--

1904
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:12,690
There's some shared ideas with
some location-based games that

1905
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:17,110
do some really interesting
things with that, whether it's

1906
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:19,885
alternate reality, but not
even with the narrative.

1907
01:17:19,885 --> 01:17:23,867
There was one I was reading
about that was, come out and

1908
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:26,850
play, I think, in New York
City at one point.

1909
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,280
It was Cruel to be Kind,
it was called.

1910
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,526
It was a game where you don't
know who's playing, you don't

1911
01:17:33,526 --> 01:17:36,900
know who's on what team, but you
get missions and you get a

1912
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,630
weapon that's a complement, like
to kill someone who's on

1913
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:42,660
the other team, mistake them
for a celebrity, or

1914
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,110
something like that.

1915
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:46,740
So you're using these random
acts of kindness-- you know,

1916
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,140
helping somebody across
the street--

1917
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:51,672
and you don't know, it's in New
York City, so you don't

1918
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:52,580
know if someone's playing
the game.

1919
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:54,890
So now all of a sudden you're
wandering around doing really

1920
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:58,140
nice things for people on the
chance, on a hunch that you

1921
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,310
have that maybe they're
playing the game.

1922
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:01,830
And maybe they're not, so you've
just helped somebody

1923
01:18:01,830 --> 01:18:03,777
across the street, which
is totally nice.

1924
01:18:03,777 --> 01:18:07,156
And it comes to this massive
conclusion where you just have

1925
01:18:07,156 --> 01:18:10,300
these two giant teams who meet
up in a location to "nice"

1926
01:18:10,300 --> 01:18:13,520
each other to death,
basically.

1927
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,920
There's a lot of really, really
interesting stuff,

1928
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,370
especially in the
location-based, around.

1929
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,780
Big games are really cool.

1930
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,230
There's a lot of people
doing really neat

1931
01:18:23,230 --> 01:18:25,550
stuff with big games.

1932
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:28,000
AUDIENCE: I think in particular
with the box and

1933
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,877
the geo-caching idea, and
talking about the

1934
01:18:31,877 --> 01:18:35,740
paperclip-for-a-house thing,
it's really interesting how

1935
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,710
people value things.

1936
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:40,380
In particular, you have this
very vague rule, and it just

1937
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:42,690
says something of equal value.

1938
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:43,940
And what does it
actually mean?

1939
01:18:43,940 --> 01:18:46,910

1940
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:50,230
Like what someone is willing to
trade for something else.

1941
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:51,720
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, those are
the kind of implicit rules

1942
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,715
like you see in Sixteen Tons,
where it's like, what happens

1943
01:18:53,715 --> 01:18:56,210
with the money?

1944
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,800
Jason Bean really pointed it
out, 'cause he was thinking

1945
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,400
about value when he was
doing the trading.

1946
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,530
And it's such a good word,
because value is such a

1947
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:03,110
different thing to
different people.

1948
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:08,190
Someone might see the flash card
for the DS, which has a

1949
01:19:08,190 --> 01:19:12,330
very clear, higher monetary
value than an Etch A Sketch.

1950
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,500
And yet, maybe you played with
an Etch A Sketch when you were

1951
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,080
a kid, and all of a sudden it
floods back these memories

1952
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,110
that you have.

1953
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,670
There's also a component to it
that I didn't really talk

1954
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:23,815
about, which is the sacrificing
of an object.

1955
01:19:23,815 --> 01:19:30,080
And I think, too, that we tend
to be beholden to our material

1956
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:32,400
objects too much.

1957
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,225
In giving it up, in sacrificing
it to this game so

1958
01:19:36,225 --> 01:19:37,580
that you don't have it anymore,
if it's something of

1959
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:40,650
personal significance, you're
letting go and being able to

1960
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:42,040
say, OK, the memory
is one thing.

1961
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,170
I don't need to--

1962
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:46,355
And that's how it relates a
bit back to Citizen Kane,

1963
01:19:46,355 --> 01:19:49,265
which is a movie you should
see, because it is good.

1964
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:54,115
It's everything they said it is,
depending on who they are.

1965
01:19:54,115 --> 01:19:58,490

1966
01:19:58,490 --> 01:19:58,960
Cool.

1967
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,210
Thanks, guys.

1968
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,110
