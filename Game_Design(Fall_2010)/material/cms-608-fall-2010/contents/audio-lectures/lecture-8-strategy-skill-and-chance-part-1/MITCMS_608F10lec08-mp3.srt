14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,660
PROFESSOR: Grabbing a bunch of
index cards and scribbling

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,090
things down.

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,460
AUDIENCE: Yes.

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,812
PROFESSOR: Pretty much
how I get by.

18
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:39,800
Another group?

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,788
AUDIENCE: So our group
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE],

20
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and Jason.

21
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,396
We don't have a rep
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

22
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:47,860
But [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

23
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,812
[LAUGHTER]

24
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:51,920
We're doing like a real
time, supernatural

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,430
horror/cooperative game.

26
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,270
PROFESSOR: OK.

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,745
Oh, like real time
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] theme?

28
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:57,190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

29
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,080
PROFESSOR: I'm excited.

30
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,970
I'm excited.

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,390
PROFESSOR: One, two,
three, four.

32
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,006
All right, who else?

33
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:05,180
AUDIENCE: it's me, it's
Tanya, Patrick, and

34
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,916
Justin who are here.

35
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:09,396
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

36
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:09,892
OK.

37
00:01:09,892 --> 00:01:11,380
You guys have kind of
a [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

38
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,190

39
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,470
AUDIENCE: And how do you
describe this game?

40
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,790
AUDIENCE: It's building
a family tree game.

41
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,217
AUDIENCE: Geneology
path building.

42
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:23,380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

43
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,812
It's a path building game
involving family members.

44
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:26,650
AUDIENCE: Consider it geneology
path building.

45
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,100
AUDIENCE: It's kind of like
a Family Feud game.

46
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,940
Except, it's a little
bit stranger.

47
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,270

48
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,555
PROFESSOR: So I think
Jay and Mia.

49
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:39,030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

50
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,455
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

51
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,840
PROFESSOR: And Calvin and
Jason, you've been

52
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,613
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in that.

53
00:01:44,613 --> 00:01:45,016
AUDIENCE: Oh.

54
00:01:45,016 --> 00:01:45,580
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

55
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,412
and things.

56
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,806
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

57
00:01:49,806 --> 00:01:52,800
PROFESSOR: So right now we
have a-- we don't have a

58
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,195
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

59
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:57,090
The idea we have is pretty much
you want to get a certain

60
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,120
sets of cards.

61
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,838
And we get sets by drawing cards
or trading with other

62
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,220
people or--

63
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,950
but it's also you can take cards
if you want, but if you

64
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,342
get caught, then it's up to the
other players whether you

65
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:10,370
get punished or not.

66
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,750
PROFESSOR: OK, if you
get caught then--

67
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,734
OK.

68
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,984
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

69
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:18,935

70
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:19,724
That sounds good.

71
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:22,194
So it sounds like we
have four teams.

72
00:02:22,194 --> 00:02:23,444
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

73
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:27,220

74
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,800
So today I'm planning on, for
the most part, just going

75
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,860
through the lecture stuff that
I had planned for today and

76
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,260
for last Wednesday.

77
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,610
And if there's any time left,
we could finish up with

78
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,860
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

79
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,650

80
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,840
And that's what I'd
like to do.

81
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,830
But if there's only like an hour
left, then I think I'd

82
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,015
probably rather you play
one more game.

83
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:57,540
As this is a useful exercise,
but playing these games are

84
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,770
just as useful and frankly
a better design.

85
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,470
All right.

86
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,756
Let's see.

87
00:03:05,756 --> 00:03:08,510
So I think I'll start with
Wednesday's stuff first, which

88
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,220
is the last [COLERA]

89
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,920
reading for the entire
semester.

90
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,720
I did, in fact, actually look
a little bit into the weird

91
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,612
eskimo stuff from Monday, and
one thing, I don't actually

92
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:22,760
think he was speaking
figuratively.

93
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,800
I think he was actually
describing something that he

94
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,254
had done some anthropoligical
research on-- this is a ritual

95
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:36,615
that a very, very
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], just a fine

96
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:39,430
group of eskimos do.

97
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,656
It reminds me a lot of the sort
of recitations that you

98
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:45,260
get that sometimes has
a morbid quality,

99
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,880
sometimes they don't.

100
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,270
But this reminds you of either
historical events, or

101
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,220
important things to do.

102
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,770
Like the easiest one that
I keep in my brain is

103
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,970
righty-tighty, lefty-loosey.

104
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,590
That teaches you something
of how screws work.

105
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,894
But then they're a little bit
like ring around the rosy,

106
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:01,870
with a pocket full
of poseys, ashes,

107
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,425
ashes, we all fall down.

108
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,850
But it's actually a
commemorative little poem

109
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,138
about the black death.

110
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:14,010
That's what that
song is about.

111
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,029
So you have these
little things.

112
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,920
That particular example that
he was describing was more

113
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,070
about this recitation that you
sort of remember the procedure

114
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,465
in which things are supposed
to be done.

115
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:30,250
But they're [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
they're sort of

116
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,940
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

117
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,754
reenactment about what you
do in order to I guess

118
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,185
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

119
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:40,540
or something like that
to basically perform

120
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,682
taxodermy on an animal.

121
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,740

122
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,070
One of those ways where a
playful experience was pretty

123
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,646
much it's been used as
a learning tool.

124
00:04:54,646 --> 00:04:58,920
And that kind of gets back to
something I was mentioning

125
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,460
much earlier in this course.

126
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,600
In many ways, learning
how to play a game is

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,730
literally very exotic.

128
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,116
You can't figure out how to play
the game unless you have

129
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,880
figured out all the rules.

130
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,555
And if the rules happen to have
some sort of correlation

131
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,956
to something real world, you
might end up learning

132
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:16,100
something about that
real world.

133
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,860
Whether you transfer to back
to actually something real

134
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,690
world is kind of actually the
topic of what Wednesday's

135
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,855
reading about.

136
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:28,370
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

137
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,160
talks about mimicry and things
being kind of taken over by

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,180
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

139
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,360
Now he uses these grand,
sweeping statements which I

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,580
think sound a lot more modest
when they're in the original

141
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,360
language, and what to translate
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

142
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,210
sound like you're saying, and
this huge wave of competitive

143
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,418
games took over witch doctors.

144
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,250

145
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,980
But I think what he's referring
to, and if we notice

146
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,760
the readings for that chapter
three and chapter eight.

147
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,936
So there's a whole bunch of
stuff that's missing, and we

148
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:05,040
kind of wanted to spare you
from the bad translation.

149
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,010
But the idea is that there is a
lot of stuff that basically

150
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,820
mimicry, the old process of
putting on masks, putting on

151
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,680
costumes, and being someone else
has great societal power.

152
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,110
This had great societal power.

153
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,370
And this is more of an
anthropological thing.

154
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,420
But the idea being you have
these people-- who are

155
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,510
effectively leaders
of groups--

156
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,470
shamans, witch doctors, fortune

157
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,410
tellers, maybe just elders.

158
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,530
And they would have costumes,
they'd have masks that not

159
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:51,600
only gave them station, what
when I wear this robe I am now

160
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,450
in charge of this tribe,
but also turned them

161
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,760
into somebody else.

162
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,372
Now, if you look at ancient
accounts of the Egyptian

163
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,300
pharoahs, for instance, in
order to actually give up

164
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,270
their own name and then they
take on a new name.

165
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,596
And a lot of them actually just
become Pharaoh in the

166
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:15,530
same way that a lot of Roman
emperors just become Caesar.

167
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,000
You can think of Caesear
as just being king.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,952
So it becomes a title, but
you also become a person.

169
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:23,928
A lot of the--

170
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:24,916
I'm trying to remember--

171
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:31,820
Persian, I think, emperors
become Darius or Cyrus.

172
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,290
Kind of just one word.

173
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,230
This is one name that was
given to the king.

174
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,180
That's who you become.

175
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,990
And that kind of combined with
aesthetic solemn rituals.

176
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,683
A lot of these are not what
you would recognize

177
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,350
as games right now.

178
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,250
But in many ways they sort of
tap into the same sort of

179
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,150
pleasures of sort of critical
and losing control.

180
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,120
Once in a while, you don't
have to be sort of all

181
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
inhibited and obeying laws.

182
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,620
You can just cut loose.

183
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,429
And in superstitious tribes,

184
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:15,510
superstitition will be the excuse.

185
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,460
But you don't actually
necessarily need that reason.

186
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,750
And I think one thing that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

187
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,790
sort of describes in chapter
eight is how--

188
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,195
we kind of get that today too.

189
00:08:28,195 --> 00:08:33,260
He was describing stuff like
identification, for instance,

190
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,536
when somebody who could be
you wins something for no

191
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:42,917
particular good reason, against
incredible odds.

192
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:48,604
And is there some sort of
mechanism for you to feel I am

193
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:51,176
now happy partly for this
person's success, therefore,

194
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:53,740
I'm a winner.

195
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,412
Then you get to have that
experience of ecstasy.

196
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,460
You get to that news.

197
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,116
A couple of videos.

198
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:10,113
Some of them it's tongue and
cheek, but hopefully that

199
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,363
you-- it will kind of illustrate
my point as well.

200
00:09:11,363 --> 00:09:27,430

201
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:34,050
So was anyone here in
Boston in 2004?

202
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,500
You were in Boston in 2004?

203
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,438
What happened in
Boston in 2004?

204
00:09:39,438 --> 00:09:40,794
AUDIENCE: With the Red Sox?

205
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:41,246
PROFESSOR: Yes.

206
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:46,801
The Red Sox won after, what, 86
years of coming real close

207
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:50,575
and never actually winning
a World Series.

208
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:55,950
And I'm going to--

209
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,850
This is a neat little
video that I have.

210
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,310
I just kind of then just use
this as a back drop.

211
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,906
I think this is right
around Fenwick Hall.

212
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,394
I'm not so sure it's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

213
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:10,370

214
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,662
Sorry, the wireless in this
particular corner of the

215
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:16,840
office can be bad.

216
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,750
This is-- actually let
me skip a little bit.

217
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:34,450

218
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,566
So for those of you who don't
know the story, actually how

219
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,920
many of you don't know what
happened in 2004 around here?

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,790
AUDIENCE: Well I don't
know exactly what

221
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,040
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

222
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,020

223
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:54,140
PROFESSOR: So basically what
happened around here was the

224
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,910
Red Sox were down 3, 0
against the Yankees.

225
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,844
And managed to come
back from them.

226
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:05,778
And then they beat the Cardinals
and they won the

227
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,245
World Series.

228
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,890
Now, this is, of course,
after 86 years, again.

229
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,717
I mentioned really people
just not winning at all.

230
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:14,700
But coming really close.

231
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,500
Each time they get really,
really close and then they'd

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,364
magnificently flub it.

233
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,300
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

234
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,990
So this earlier video here is
what Boston looked like when

235
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,410
it was down 3, 0.

236
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:32,660
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

237
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:45,990

238
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,015
The funniest thing that every
time the Red Sox actually won

239
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:51,660
it was like an awakening.

240
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,160
So they weren't at Fenway.

241
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,048
When all of these celebrations
that-- can you see once the

242
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:02,298
buffering stops.

243
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:08,480

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,150
All the celebration that's going
on is occurring miles

245
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,346
and miles, probably 100 miles
away from where the game's

246
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:21,242
actually happening with
the Cardinals.

247
00:12:21,242 --> 00:12:23,780
And of course, everyone was
watching it on TV, everyone's

248
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,140
identifying with the Red Sox.

249
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,971
And right now you are sort of
seeing like, as far as I can

250
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,306
tell probably the Northeastern
students

251
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,650
who were around Fenway.

252
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,160
But in here, the vehicles
driving by and

253
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,120
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

254
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:47,000
Everybody was listening on the
radio, you can see the cars

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,560
driving by.

256
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,649
Everybody knows immediately.

257
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:51,144
Everyone in Boston immediately
knew it

258
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,142
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

259
00:12:52,142 --> 00:12:54,637
If they weren't watching
the game, they would

260
00:12:54,637 --> 00:12:56,134
have heard it anyway.

261
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:59,128
Because they have no
affirmative claims.

262
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:02,621
The only way that you would
cheer the Red Sox is to say

263
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:05,116
Mackie sucked, which is
kind of sad actually.

264
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:09,110

265
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,930
For those of you who weren't
around, it was a really,

266
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,680
really awesome night.

267
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
There was, of course, a little
bit of violence.

268
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,110
Things got a little bit
out-- a bunch of

269
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,360
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

270
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,335

271
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:27,480
But it wasn't like a huge
riot or anything.

272
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,513
For the most part it was
pretty much this.

273
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,340
A lot of people with a lot
of the hands in the air.

274
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,781
No cars being turned over
or anything like that.

275
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,260
But it was being--

276
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,170
But these are the kind of
aesthetic movements that

277
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,950
[? Colera ?]

278
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,898
talks about in his write-up.

279
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:46,390
Yup?

280
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,342
AUDIENCE: I have a video on my
phone in Barcelona right after

281
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:53,278
they won the semi-finals
over the summer.

282
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,214
And I had a video of the
streets at 11 PM.

283
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:00,166
I could show you
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

284
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,134
I have a video of the
streets at 12:30,

285
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:03,610
so half past midnight.

286
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,578
And it's the exact same scene.

287
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,530
And the exact same people are
still in the street with their

288
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,990
shirts off, still twirling
their shirts around.

289
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,942
PROFESSOR: It was probably more
rowdy I would imagine.

290
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,480
AUDIENCE: Oh, it was
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] rowdy

291
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,905
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

292
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:19,445
This is America, they don't
know how to be rowdy in

293
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:19,710
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

294
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:24,050
PROFESSOR: I think for every
three people there was a cop.

295
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,990
You don't see that
in the video.

296
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,368
But there were a lot of cops out
there that night just to

297
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,000
make sure that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,568
But I think Barcelona also
would have been partying.

299
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:36,050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

300
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,890
PROFESSOR: So the idea--

301
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,780
of course, the idea of a sports
team is something which

302
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,460
you identify with because
associated with the city that

303
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,890
you live in.

304
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,900
They win.

305
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,465
I didn't do anything, but
because I because I'm a

306
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:51,020
supporter of sports
team, I get to

307
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,240
identify myself with them.

308
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,320
And [? Colera ?]

309
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,180
makes the assertion that this
is important because if you

310
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,760
look at the forces of human
chance, of there, which I

311
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,620
think gives the various athletes
the opportunities, as

312
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,180
well as the physical ability,
to actually perform well.

313
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,830
The likelihood of any of the
people actually celebrating,

314
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,860
actually being able to perform
that same feat

315
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,266
is extremely low.

316
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,935
In fact, the likelihood of
even someone who has the

317
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:30,530
ability and the opportunities of
actually winning is pretty

318
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,610
much random and the odds
are against you.

319
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:40,162
But because you identify so
strongly with a group of

320
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:43,890
people who can win, you are
allowed to sort of enjoy that

321
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,900
victory, even though you weren't
the one who actually

322
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,830
got that victory.

323
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,240
And it gets stronger actually
for some games--

324
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,930
well for some kind of games
where you actually did have

325
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,686
something to do with
the victory, for

326
00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:01,060
instance, talent shows.

327
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,430
Especially the modern
talent shows.

328
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,700
Maybe you've already
seen this.

329
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:27,552
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

330
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:29,795
PROFESSOR: So [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
the Outward Bound are on about

331
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:30,940
next week's show.

332
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,240
They're going to--

333
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,160
remember that when you look at
things like Britain's Got

334
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,800
Talent, like American Idol,
all of these things are

335
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,210
popularity contests.

336
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,360
You have judges, but the
judges don't actually

337
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,470
determine very much who's
actually going to win.

338
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,720
The only people who actually
determine who's going to win

339
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,410
are popular vote.

340
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,590
And that vote is happening
through short messages

341
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,616
basically, which people
are being charged for.

342
00:16:56,616 --> 00:17:03,875
The basic idea is that because
you might have had voted for

343
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:07,020
someone, you now identify with
that person who might win.

344
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,450
Whether that person wins or not
is effectively random for

345
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,089
other purposes.

346
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:16,130
Now sure, that some of them have
talent, but later on--

347
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,176
but when you look at who
actually tends to progress in

348
00:17:19,176 --> 00:17:21,990
these competitions, I think
some of the results are

349
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,928
really, really random.

350
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:26,690
Like you have some people who
move onto the next stage

351
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:29,470
because they are just strange.

352
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,155
And you just want to see them
next week because they may be

353
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:36,150
entertaining, not necessarily
because they're talented.

00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:14,478

looked up what their

particular is, but they can
all do different things.

387
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,080
AUDIENCE: It looked like
a dance thing.

388
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,860
And if you look at the other
celebration's like the Susan

389
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,780
Boyle video, where I think
it got pretty viral.

390
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,050
So I'm assuming a lot
of you have seen it.

391
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:48,915
It's one of those things where
even if you don't necessarily

392
00:19:48,915 --> 00:19:50,576
that you're rooting
for a person.

393
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:53,160
It's so easy for you to be
convinced that you're actually

394
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,240
rooting for this person as soon
as you have a reason to.

395
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:58,770
So--

396
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,650
AUDIENCE: It's like oh wow,
that guy is from Texas.

397
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,590
PROFESSOR: Hey,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

398
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:02,580
It's good for you.

399
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,100
You don't really need that much
of a reason to identify

400
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,020
with somebody.

401
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,605
And that's where you get sort
of still see some of that

402
00:20:10,605 --> 00:20:15,310
power of the vertigo,
basically.

403
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,150
It's not the vertigo of actually
playing the game, the

404
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,356
vertigo of watching a game,
but it's still part of the

405
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:24,330
entire game experience.

406
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:27,080
Britain's Got Talent, American
Idol, everything like that

407
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,670
wouldn't have the power if it
didn't have the hundreds and

408
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:37,260
hundreds of screaming fans
voting in and having their

409
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,450
faces changing on camera,
and applauding and

410
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,922
screaming their heads off.

411
00:20:41,922 --> 00:20:45,480

412
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,340
And of course, that's the
identification part of it.

413
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,190
But even when you're talking
about sort of just basic

414
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:59,142
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

415
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:03,580
Here's a shrine festival
in Japan.

416
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,410
And basically what they're doing
is just getting started.

417
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,550
Everyone's gotten assembled.

418
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,880
All of the folks here who are
wearing basically the same

419
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,516
colored outfit are basically
from the same town.

420
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:17,766
Including that logo.

421
00:21:17,766 --> 00:21:20,190

422
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,430
And what you've got is basically
like a little house

423
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,959
for a deity.

424
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:30,310
They're both carried
on the shoulders.

425
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,536
And those three up there look
really precarious, but I think

426
00:21:34,536 --> 00:21:36,732
they're having a good time.

427
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:39,172
That's a completely different
talent [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

428
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:42,600

429
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,870
But you know, this is not unlike
what you'd see in a

430
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,126
sporting event.

431
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:49,620
It's kind of getting
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

432
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,612
AUDIENCE: Isn't the town versus
town like competition?

433
00:21:51,612 --> 00:21:53,604
PROFESSOR: It's not really
so much a competition.

434
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:54,766
But I think there's
a certain amount

435
00:21:54,766 --> 00:21:57,104
that you have to represent.

436
00:21:57,104 --> 00:21:59,574
AUDIENCE: That show existed
in France, it's called

437
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:02,372
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE], and
they literally get towns in

438
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,514
the countryside and have
them compete in various

439
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:05,008
competitions.

440
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:06,984
So like each town, for example,
designates the

441
00:22:06,984 --> 00:22:09,454
strongest person to have
an arm wrestling match.

442
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:10,936
PROFESSOR: Sort of
like champions.

443
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:11,924
You send your champions.

444
00:22:11,924 --> 00:22:12,912
AUDIENCE: You send
your champions.

445
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:14,888
Then you have like a
horseback thing.

446
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:19,334
And I think like other
weird events.

447
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,662
And it's pretty popular.

448
00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:23,606
1,000 people/person
town versus

449
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:24,578
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

450
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:27,008
PROFESSOR: I think you get that
in the Scottish Highland

451
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:28,810
games as well.

452
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,170
Basically it's sending people
to throw giant pieces of

453
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,386
lumber as far as they can.

454
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,700
But [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
competition.

455
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,382
This is not [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

456
00:22:37,382 --> 00:22:38,795
This is a lot closer
to kind of the

457
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:40,679
earlier kind of situation.

458
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,590
Because they're not vying
to win anything.

459
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,040
They are really just trying to
all get into it together.

460
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,870
So if you think of it as
what kind of thing.

461
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,690
The aim of the game is
don't drop the damn--

462
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,150
[LAUGHTER]

463
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,080
It's quite simple.

464
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,100
Get thrown--

465
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,010
in fact, it's actually a fair
amount of effort because I

466
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,190
think they walk a
couple of miles.

467
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,490
I'm not quite sure what the
traditions are on where it

468
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,816
starts and where it ends.

469
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:11,770
But it's like a huge
street parade.

470
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,290
And the whole idea is let's
get everybody involved.

471
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,190
The people are packed really
close with each other, so it's

472
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:21,275
not like you can actually move
one foot without colliding

473
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,130
into somebody else unless you're
all moving in unison.

474
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,430
And can you keep in sync.

475
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,720
And all the shouting, all the
whistles, and all the chance

476
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,240
actually just helped that entire
process move along.

477
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,096
It continues today, not just
in sports, not just in

478
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:43,570
televised shows, but
in street fairs and

479
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,542
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

480
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:45,028
that's great.

481
00:23:45,028 --> 00:23:48,430
And those folks really look
like they're having fun.

482
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:58,200
So that's kind of what we were
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

483
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:07,700
And the version of this, the
version of what [? Colera ?]

484
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:14,107
describes as since your ability
to succeed is so

485
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:16,860
random, especially if you think
of it outside of the

486
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,130
game context, but more
in the silo context--

487
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,920
your ability to be a great
athlete, your ability to be a

488
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,120
great politician, your ability
to make a lot of money, just

489
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,290
to succeed in life
is so random.

490
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,080
But people kind of don't
necessarily want to

491
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,360
acknowledge that it's random
because you have rules,

492
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,710
because you have sort of rules
set in to promote merit to

493
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,530
sort of equalize systems.

494
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,270
Is this the equilaterian
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], which I

495
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,750
think actually he meant.

496
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,990
I think the original word
was egalitarian.

497
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,430
While there are a lot of
processes trying to stabilize,

498
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,900
in the end you can't
really ignore the

499
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,376
forces of one's birth.

500
00:24:57,376 --> 00:24:59,356
At least that's the
way he sees it.

501
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:02,240

502
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,248
When you get competitions that
are effectively just

503
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:13,610
completely random, which means
anybody can win, people really

504
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:20,570
do understand and sort of
ascribe to that kind of power.

505
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,990
They accept.

506
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,710
The likelihood of me winning the
lottery is about as good

507
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,550
as the likelihood that I'm
going to succeed in life.

508
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,386
A lot of it is based on who was
I born to, and which year,

509
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:39,830
and which region
are we born in?

510
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,602
What's happening in the world as
I-- at least that's the way

511
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:44,750
of how he puts it.

512
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,210

525
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:12,088
we're thinking this
is my day, right?

526
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,260
OK, if that's the case, then
a 19-year-old Mills college

527
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,426
student is super
lucky tonight.

528
00:26:16,426 --> 00:26:19,624
-Louis Jay became an instant
millionaire with the scratch

529
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:24,310
of a ticket, and he told Rob
Robert all about it today.

530
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,755
-It was on his birthday when
Towson University student,

531
00:26:26,755 --> 00:26:30,450
Louis Jay, decided to buy a
scratch-off lottery ticket.

532
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,113
-I actually won $20 on the
scratch-off the prior week.

533
00:26:34,113 --> 00:26:35,917
-Louis Jay went to this
giant [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

534
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:39,620
Mills and used the $20 he won
on a scratch-off ticket and

535
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,090
bought another one.

536
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,115
As he began scratching off the
numbers, Louis couldn't

537
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:45,450
believe his eyes.

538
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,282
-I'm at the second to the
last line and it's

539
00:26:47,282 --> 00:26:47,950
not going too well.

540
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,760
And I was starting to see six.

541
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,130
I was like oh, it matched up.

542
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,440
All right, I won $30 or
something, why not.

543
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,366
I saw a million.

544
00:26:52,366 --> 00:26:54,681
I started double-checking,
triple-checking everything.

545
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:56,690
Make sure all the numbers
matches and everything.

546
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:57,355
I was like oh, my God.

547
00:26:57,355 --> 00:26:59,760
-And when it came time to
scratch off the last number,

548
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,095
his mother told him--

549
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:02,867
-He was scratching
on every one.

550
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:07,108
And when it was the next to
the last one I said, don't

551
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:10,352
scratch it from right to left,
do it from left to right.

552
00:27:10,352 --> 00:27:13,860
[LAUGHTER]

553
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,970
-And there it was.

554
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,950
Louis had won himself
one million dollars.

555
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,869
-This little dollar sign bag
right here that I won on, I'm

556
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:25,005
actually got number six for my
lucky number right here.

557
00:27:25,005 --> 00:27:27,800
And down here it matches the
six with the prize for a

558
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,550
million dollars.

559
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,040
-He's a hardworking young man,
and he has fun and he likes

560
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,410
the lottery.

561
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:35,436
He buys a ticket on his 19th
birthday, and lo and behold,

562
00:27:35,436 --> 00:27:36,870
he wins a million dollars.

563
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,790
I don't know if he told you the
other part of the story.

564
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,193
He bought a ticket on his 18th
birthday, his first one, and

00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,810
he won $100.

identify with that.

609

It's like yeah, things aren't
quite working my way, but you

That's the story that
they are telling.

00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:35,810
And of course, the idea being
what the lottery director was

613
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,095
saying, yeah, remember, he
didn't just buy one ticket.

614
00:29:39,095 --> 00:29:40,740
He bought one ticket
the year before, he

615
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,350
might buy another ticket.

616
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,700
They're trying to encourage
you to buy more tickets.

617
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,340
That's the story.

618
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,680
The story is buy more tickets,
which oddly enough is actually

619
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,320
the only way to increase
your chances

620
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,338

621
00:29:55,338 --> 00:29:57,773

[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

626
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:16,330
But the basic idea that they're
trying to because the

627
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:20,400
forces of life are so random,
these kinds of like totally

628
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:27,220
random, high stakes games
have incredible power.

629
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,148
And not just because of the
possibility of winning.

630
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:33,076
But because it resonates very,
very strongly with the idea

631
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:36,004
that you could win.

632
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:39,420
And if you identify with
somebody else, even better

633
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,396
because then you don't
even have to win.

634
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:41,860
That person could win.

635
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,165
And in fact, increases the range
of different winners

636
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:48,730

Help people sort of get that
thrill of winning without

00:30:51,712 --> 00:30:54,420
necessarily even having
competed.

639
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,640
So that's kind of the power
that we have in chance.

640
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,722
I haven't actually talked
about, well so how do we

641
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:03,525
actually use chance in games
yet, which is what

642
00:31:03,525 --> 00:31:04,775
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

643
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,350

644
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,624
But I think in their book,
they describe--

645
00:31:11,624 --> 00:31:14,486
the reason why I like challenges
for you to design

646
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,060
is that they're very concrete
about well if you're stuck and

647
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,810
you don't know what to do with
a game, have you considered

648
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,346
bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

649
00:31:22,346 --> 00:31:24,811
They're very, very systematic
about that.

650
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,783
You know, have you considered
doing options?

651
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,262
Have you thought--

652
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:30,234
That's not chance.

653
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,713
That's the second chapter.

654
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:36,643
The first chapter was have you
considered using dice, using

655
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:38,122
cards, using spinners.

656
00:31:38,122 --> 00:31:41,540
I don't remember what other
randomizing systems they had.

657
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:47,700
Computer or random number
generated [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

658
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:54,490
Are you using it to equalize
different skill levels, or are

659
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,620
you just trying to make it
so that there's sometimes

660
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,520
predictability, that sometimes
solveability in the system.

661
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,280
There are all these different
ways that you can use

662
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,330
randomness.

663
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,360
But don't forget how powerful
randomness is.

664
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,437
It's one of those things where
you normally assume that you

665
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:11,333
don't actually [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
in the game.

666
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,240
And you don't want him
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

667
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,117
First of all, as the designer,
randomness makes it hard for

668
00:32:15,117 --> 00:32:17,967
you to predict what's going to
happen, and as a result, it

669
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,110
becomes difficult to design.

670
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:26,463
But the power of the this I
could be a winner for reasons

671
00:32:26,463 --> 00:32:29,730
that are entirely out of my
control is actually more

672
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,610
powerful than a lot of folks
what will naturally assume

673
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,550
right off the bat.

674
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,316
So I'm not going to go too much
into the various options

675
00:32:42,316 --> 00:32:46,785
that Brenda and Ian described as
a challenge because you can

676
00:32:46,785 --> 00:32:47,210
look those up.

677
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,061
But do look those up, especially
if I'm having

678
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:51,055
difficulty in your game.

679
00:32:51,055 --> 00:32:52,770
If you're having difficulty,
oh this game is too

680
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,410
predictable, and you
can see that there

681
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,990
is the optimal strategy.

682
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,364
Well then you can think about
maybe writing those might be a

683
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:03,125
good [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

684
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:07,490
Or maybe I want to be able to
play this with people who have

685
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,724
never played this game before I
had met them, and still have

686
00:33:09,724 --> 00:33:10,964
a fighting chance.

687
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:15,428
That's another good
opportunity to win

688
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:15,924
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

689
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:18,280
But know what problem you're
trying to solve before you're

690
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,396
throwing something away.

691
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:23,020
Because sometimes you can have
a lot of fun with games that

692
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,616
are effectively just
like fun butteries.

693
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,035
You know, oh, I draw a card.

694
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,875
Munchkin is kind of like
this actually.

695
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:29,390
You draw a card.

696
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,190
Oh, look at, funny.

697
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,330
And you read the text.

698
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,520
That was silly.

699
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,030
And now they've added a Twitter
version of Munchkin

700
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,930
where every hour you introduce
a new rule.

701
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,876
And it's like the player whose
name starts with the letter M

702
00:33:42,876 --> 00:33:44,860
gets double the hit point
for something.

703
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,844
But totally random.

704
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:49,750
And that can be kind
of fun, but that's

705
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,840
really short-lived fun.

706
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,110
That's one of the things where
once you look through all of

707
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,450
the cards-- the game's pretty
much done for you.

708
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,202
Even if you haven't even
finished playing the game, the

709
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,815
game might end for yourself.

710
00:34:00,815 --> 00:34:03,980
So try not to go down
that track.

711
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,830
There was a group last year that
did a game where pretty

712
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:13,300
much you just drew silly things
to do out of a hat.

713
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,339
And, yeah, it was fun until
everyone got through the hat,

714
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,664
and then once everyone knew
pretty much the range of the

715
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,564
little silly things, that's
it, game was over.

716
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:23,949
There was no replay.

717
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:27,085
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

718
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:28,000
"The [? Side Note ?]

719
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,110
About Replayability," that's
actually a really excellent

720
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,910
essay on I think gamasutra about
how replayability isn't

721
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,476
actually a well-defined word.

722
00:34:35,476 --> 00:34:37,936
Nobody really knows what
that word means, but

723
00:34:37,936 --> 00:34:38,920
everyone uses it.

724
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,380
So if you're interested,
check it out.

725
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,594
I haven't actually had a
chance to form a real

726
00:34:43,594 --> 00:34:44,844
opinion on it yet.

727
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:49,900

728
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:56,210
So by the way, a lot of the
roots of the kinds of

729
00:34:56,210 --> 00:35:03,580
randomness things that we use,
like dice and cards, have some

730
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:06,070
sort of root in fortune telling,
which connects it

731
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,312
back to kind of the ritualistic

732
00:35:07,312 --> 00:35:10,480
aspects of games again.

733
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,200
The idea of you can tell whether
you're going to be a

734
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,000
success in life by your
success in this game.

735
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,430
And the game might be draw
a card from this deck

736
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,923
and hope it's good.

737
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:27,715
Which parallels what a lot
of people think like it.

738
00:35:27,715 --> 00:35:30,460
If I roll the dice, and if
I'm lucky, things are

739
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:33,170
going to work out.

740
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:40,350
But there's a couple of
interesting things about how

741
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:43,542
strategy and skills start
to work with things of

742
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,700
randomness.

743
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,920
For instance, there is one
argument that [? Colera ?]

744
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,900
makes that the reason why you
get things like chance and

745
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,986
skill games taking over
mimicry and vertigo

746
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:03,835
experiences is because we
started developing systems of

747
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:04,540
enumeration.

748
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,240
Started being able to count, we
started being able to rank

749
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,500
things to tell whether something
was actually better

750
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,740
than other, and some sort of
empirical numerical way.

751
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,620
So if you think about it from
that sense, then actually when

752
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,460
you look at skill and when you
look at chance, they're

753
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,790
actually kind of on both
on the same side.

754
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,065
They're sort of dealing
with number

755
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:33,358
systems one way or another.

756
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,250
If you had a system that has
a lot of chance, any number

757
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,250
could come up.

758
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,415
Any card could come up.

759
00:36:38,415 --> 00:36:42,810
Any dice roll having some
set of probability.

760
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,775
What skill is dealing with what
could happen, having a

761
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:49,760
plan, having a strategy.

762
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,380
Maybe that element of chance
isn't a random die roll.

763
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,410
Maybe a person that you've never
met before that you're

764
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,390
playing against, and you don't
know how good they are, they

765
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,821
don't know what the strategies
are, they don't

766
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:01,768
know how they play.

767
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:05,980
They're effectively a die roll,
and your skill is kind

768
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,450
of or the element of skill in
the game are all about how do

769
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:12,130
you deal with all the

770
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,530
probabilities that have happened.

771
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:20,450
So one of the things that
[? Colera ?] talked about is a

772
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:24,639
lot of the competitive games
kind things actually come up

773
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,020
from tests-- tests of physical
skill, tests of mental skill.

774
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,645
Tests the ability to be able
to take an administrative

775
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:32,416
position and in society.

776
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,350
That sort of thing.

777
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,115
But your ability to actually
do well on those tests also

778
00:37:37,115 --> 00:37:40,880
kind of depends on your luck of
having the ability in the

779
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,660
first place.

780
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,630
It's like did you get the
right of education?

781
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,430
Did you study the
right questions?

782
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,400
Do you happen to have really
good genes so that you can

783
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:50,720
jump really high?

784
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,700
That sort of thing.

785
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:03,205
So the idea of whether it is
actually just luck, if you

786
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:06,225
would talk about a modern game,
you can talk about skill

787
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:08,000
of someone being able
to play chess.

788
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,610
Or you can talk about the luck
of somebody having had the

789
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,220
chance to play chess many,
many, many times before

790
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,586
they're playing this one
particular game.

791
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:18,370
Because not everybody in the
world has that option.

792
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,686
And that's kind of the case
that [? Colera ?]

793
00:38:20,686 --> 00:38:22,120
is trying to make.

794
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,796
When you're bringing a new
person to a game, they haven't

795
00:38:27,796 --> 00:38:31,050
had the luck of playing
your particular game.

796
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,740
I'm going to say the good
fortune of playing your

797
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,910
particular game, whereas
you have had that.

798
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,140
So if you wanted to think of
it as that, as well they're

799
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,410
bad luck, now how do we use
rules, either rules of chance

800
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:51,020
or rules of skill to be able
to give them a fighting

801
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,280
chance, a fighting edge.

802
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,300
Probably more rules of chance.

803
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,610
So a there's a couple
of different things.

804
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:07,434
One thing that I do want
to bring up is you

805
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:08,426
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
information

806
00:39:08,426 --> 00:39:09,676
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

807
00:39:09,676 --> 00:39:13,882

808
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:15,370
Sorry.

809
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,858
I could probably just draw it.

810
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:19,834
But I just want to make
sure I get it right.

811
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:22,810

812
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,060
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

813
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:33,722

814
00:39:33,722 --> 00:39:35,828
AUDIENCE: Can we also
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] shift it over

815
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:36,270
to the big screen?

816
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,010
PROFESSOR: It's really very
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

817
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,384
So it's incredibly blurry--

818
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:44,348
OK, all right.

819
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:47,690
So this is the basic idea.

820
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:50,925
Claude Shannon, back in
the '60s, I believe--

821
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,700
I think [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE],

822
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,290
basically came up with a model
of how communication works.

823
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,930
How information gets from
a sender to a receiver.

824
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,030

825
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,716
How does this have anything
to do with games?

826
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,114
I will get to that quickly.

827
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:14,310
But let me just talk
about models first.

828
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:17,805
So the sender had some sort
of like message, right?

829
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:20,852

830
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:25,170
And they're going to
send it end of this

831
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,910
conversation I believe--

832
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,904
yeah.

833
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,395
This is transmission.

834
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,874
I'm going to shorten it
and say X-mission.

835
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:41,328

836
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:43,380
So a sender has a message.

837
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,085
They want to set up--

838
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:48,334
they want to translate it, and
then it needs to be received

839
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:50,270
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

840
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,690
by the receiver.

841
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,360
In between the two, there
is some sort of channel.

842
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,156
So if you think of this as I got
a computer and my message

843
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:01,970
is an email.

844
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,922
I'm going to transmit it
through the internet.

845
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:06,850
And then it's going to be
received by some sort of other

846
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:11,242
mail server and then it's
going to the other.

847
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:17,098
This is the important part of
this model is that this is

848
00:41:17,098 --> 00:41:20,782
where noise gets
in the channel.

849
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:23,490

850
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:27,744
The reason why this model is
useful for thinking about

851
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:30,670
games is you can actually
think of the

852
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,980
sender as the game.

853
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,680
This this game space.

854
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,630

855
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:44,530
And the message could be
something, it could be

856
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,665
valuable information about the
current state of the game in

857
00:41:49,665 --> 00:41:50,915
order for you to make
a good decision.

858
00:41:50,915 --> 00:41:53,622

859
00:41:53,622 --> 00:41:57,410
In poker, it will be, well
everybody's hands.

860
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,830
That's the message.

861
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,345
That's valuable information.

862
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:04,321
If you knew what everybody had
in your hand, and if you knew

863
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:08,070
everything in the deck in the
order in which the deck is

864
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,520
shuffled, you will be able to
make a great decision about

865
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,220
whether to raise your
bid on the floor.

866
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,130

867
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,000
And so you have rules that
sort of encode what that

868
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,225
message is going to be, and
you have rules that--

869
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:31,135
you have strategies to help you
figure out what to do with

870
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:35,300
that, with the receiver kind of
becomes and you think of it

871
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,260
as [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

872
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,730
as a player's position,
actually.

873
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,670

874
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,874
Or the player's strategy if you
would think about it over

875
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,124
a long-term strategy.

876
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:48,510

877
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,850
The trick is noise.

878
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,390
And noise is actually something
that you get to

879
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:54,590
control [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

880
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,410
What is hidden?

881
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,880
What is obfiscated?

882
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,934
What can be deliberately
introduced to confuse you

883
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:04,294
about what the game
state actually is?

884
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:07,630

885
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,042
Noise can be random, or noise
can be just plain old you

886
00:43:12,042 --> 00:43:13,540
don't know.

887
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,370
Just deleting information out
of the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

888
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:22,380
So for instance, you guys know
the rules of Texas Bulldog?

889
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,235
There is a set of cards in the
middle called the river.

890
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:28,640
I could be wrong, so if you
really know the rules

891
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,570
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

892
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,793
And these cards are dealt pretty
early in the game.

893
00:43:34,793 --> 00:43:38,174
They're not dealt right at
the beginning, but the--

894
00:43:38,174 --> 00:43:41,555
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
at the beginning?

895
00:43:41,555 --> 00:43:43,970
AUDIENCE: Not all at once
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

896
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,936
AUDIENCE: The first three.

897
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,868
AUDIENCE: The flop, yeah.

898
00:43:46,868 --> 00:43:47,860
And then [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

899
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,620
PROFESSOR: Oh, the flop
and the river, right.

900
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,090
Which is the one
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?

901
00:43:51,090 --> 00:43:51,875
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

902
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:52,925
PROFESSOR: The flop is data?

903
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,175
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

904
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,760

905
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,720
AUDIENCE: Everyone gets dealt
the two cards, and then you

906
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,950
turn the flop over, which
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

907
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,070
And then the river is the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

908
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,310
PROFESSOR: The river's
the big one.

909
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,625
AUDIENCE: And betting
zero, yeah.

910
00:44:07,625 --> 00:44:10,155
AUDIENCE: Well no, technically
when you deal you put one card

911
00:44:10,155 --> 00:44:12,576
face down then you put the
flop [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

912
00:44:12,576 --> 00:44:13,995
AUDIENCE: That part doesn't
have anything to do

913
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:14,468
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

914
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:15,890
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but I
don't know what--

915
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,961
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

916
00:44:17,961 --> 00:44:20,300
But the cards would
get dealt out.

917
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,162
It's pretty much an unknown.

918
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,540
It is random.

919
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,700
But on and above this, if you
just put five cards in

920
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,770
whatever side and then
just dealt them out.

921
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,430
It's a fixed quantity.

922
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:37,880
But you still don't know
what the heck it is.

923
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,135
Someone else could have picked
those cards and still don't

924
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,154
know what it is.

925
00:44:41,154 --> 00:44:44,450
So they're effectively
a random thing.

926
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,450
They're noise.

927
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,694
They're a bit of information
we don't know.

928
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:50,930
And in Texas Hold'em, a bit of
information that everybody

929
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,405
does know, so that's great.

930
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:56,622
The information is kind of
equally shared among everybody

931
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:57,860
except for the one card.

932
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,110
They'd be fine.

933
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,100

934
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,360
So--

935
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,800
--when you think about how you
can even things out for the

936
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,883
players, or how you can make
the challenge a little bit

937
00:45:12,883 --> 00:45:17,090
higher for decent players, you
can think about, well how much

938
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,422
information am I currently
giving them about what

939
00:45:19,422 --> 00:45:22,000
a game state is?

940
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,595
And maybe I can, I'll just
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] them.

941
00:45:25,595 --> 00:45:28,073
Not necessarily lie,
just hide.

942
00:45:28,073 --> 00:45:30,911
Just deny them information
that is necessarily

943
00:45:30,911 --> 00:45:32,330
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

944
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,250
It's also a good way to sort
of think of well maybe if

945
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,300
you're a little bit behind and
you need a little help, then

946
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,370
what are you going to do
to give them a fighting

947
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,348
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] channel.

948
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:44,771
Let them have the next card
that's coming up.

949
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,727
Because we're talking about
card games here.

950
00:45:46,727 --> 00:45:50,150
Let them re-roll the
next die roll.

951
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,400
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

952
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,690

953
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:00,130
This model, about like
thinking what sort of

954
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,465
information are you giving your
player can also sort of

955
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:06,030
be useful in thinking whether
they're giving too much

956
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,376
information strictly from a
decision-making point of view.

957
00:46:08,376 --> 00:46:11,170
It's like I'm throwing all this
game state information,

958
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,980
but really, all the player needs
to know is half of that

959
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,820
in order to make a
good decision.

960
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,943
You might actually
want to consider

961
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:24,841
reducing that somehow.

962
00:46:24,841 --> 00:46:27,739
Let me think of an example.

963
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:31,844
I think Settlers of Catan that
should be a pretty good

964
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:35,040
example of that.

965
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,940
You can see the entire board.

966
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,100
Everyone can see the entire
board at any given time.

967
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,520
And everyone's got cards
in their hands.

968
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,630
You don't know what other people
have in their cards.

969
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,570
But for the most part, when
you're trying to make a

970
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,170
decision about what to do with
your cards, you're really just

971
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,586
concerned about your cards.

972
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:58,514
As time goes on, you pretty much
know what other people

973
00:46:58,514 --> 00:47:00,880
have in their hand if you've
been paying attention, because

974
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,900
people are picking up resources
fairly openly.

975
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,620

976
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,940
But you don't really care.

977
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,665
And that's one nice thing about
Settlers is that they're

978
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:13,442
hiding this information from
you, even though it is

979
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,575
information that need
to be hidden.

980
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:17,970
Because in order to make a good
decision in that game,

981
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,920
you do not need to know
that information.

982
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,640
So they're introducting noise,
they're deliberately hiding

983
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,620
information from you so that you
can just focus on the two

984
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:29,837
or three decisions that
are actually worth

985
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:31,864
making on your turn.

986
00:47:31,864 --> 00:47:35,036
And that's one reason why
Settlers games actually go

987
00:47:35,036 --> 00:47:38,208
pretty fast because people
aren't paralyzed by too much

988
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:40,650
information.

989
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,970
If your game's getting
too long.

990
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,190
The game's supposed to be a half
an hour and it's taking

991
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,690
an hour long, think about the
information that you're giving

992
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:48,660
your player.

993
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,270
All of it might be relevant to
the game state, but not all of

994
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:54,001
it might be relevant to what the
players need to know right

995
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:58,098
now in order to make
their next move.

996
00:47:58,098 --> 00:48:02,110
And if you find a way to control
that, sometimes just a

997
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:04,690
clever color coding.

998
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,650
Making your card in such a way
that it's really, really

999
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:10,023
obvious that there's a certain
part of the card that you need

1000
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:13,290
to look at at certain times,
and you kind of ignore it

1001
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:16,965
outside on a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
call other times, and that

1002
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:18,680
might help.

1003
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:24,110
But often what I find is
in a lot of games like

1004
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,695
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] card games,
for instance, board games,

1005
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:32,580
they would use a lot of icons to
describe what the value of

1006
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,830
something is, or what kind
of effect it has.

1007
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,870
And the reason why they use
icons instead of using words

1008
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,270
is because you don't have
translate icons.

1009
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:42,487
And they want their games to
sell in Germany, in Spain, in

1010
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:48,500
England, and US, and Greece, and
Italy, and so if you made

1011
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,843
cards, you couldn't use those
same cards in every one of of

1012
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:52,660
those countries, so
you use icons.

1013
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:55,190
The only problem is that now you
have to learn what every

1014
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,854
one of those icons mean.

1015
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,480
If it's just a stack of coins,
oh 5 coins means 5?

1016
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,345
OK, all right, I can probably
figure that out.

1017
00:49:01,345 --> 00:49:02,250
That's fine.

1018
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,928
But this is a picture of a
hammer, what does a hammer do?

1019
00:49:05,928 --> 00:49:07,650
I'll have to check in the
reference manual, which

1020
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,900
happens to be in six different
languages.

1021
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,780

1022
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,448
And that's one of the barriers
that a lot of folks have to

1023
00:49:15,448 --> 00:49:16,412
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1024
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,178
in card games and board games.

1025
00:49:18,178 --> 00:49:20,260
It's not necessarily that
the games are all that

1026
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:20,758
complicated.

1027
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,999
It's just that you have to
actually have translation that

1028
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,021
has to be done because
they're not really

1029
00:49:24,021 --> 00:49:25,271
built for one language.

1030
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:30,220

1031
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:36,196
So I probably have more to say
about information, but I'm

1032
00:49:36,196 --> 00:49:38,686
going to save it till
next class.

1033
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:39,936
Any questions so far?

1034
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:43,666

1035
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,907
Everything that I'm sort of
directing at you right now are

1036
00:49:45,907 --> 00:49:48,646
pretty much just different
ways to look at the game

1037
00:49:48,646 --> 00:49:49,642
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1038
00:49:49,642 --> 00:49:53,840
It's a card game, but try to
see it from different ways.

1039
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,740
Not just how do I get this one
game mechanic to work.

1040
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,220
But what are people going to be
getting out of this game.

1041
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:01,950
When they're going to be drawing
this big card, how are

1042
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:03,450
they going to be feeling?

1043
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,290
Are they going to be
getting excited?

1044
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,600
Apprehensive?

1045
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,845
Are they going to be counting
on the next card to win them

1046
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:12,545
the game, or is this just
going to be giving them

1047
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:15,613
options, and do they know
what options they have?

1048
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:19,064

1049
00:50:19,064 --> 00:50:42,728
So I'm just going
to do a complete

1050
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:44,207
transition at this point.

1051
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,686
So new topic.

1052
00:50:45,686 --> 00:50:53,280

1053
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,110
One thing I want to talk about,
which is not actually

1054
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:57,400
covered in any of the
readings is the body

1055
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,720
motion think plate.

1056
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,760
I think it's probably
used as, sort of--

1057
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,732
Jason and I use this
story quite a bit.

1058
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:06,806
We haven't really designed
it all that well.

1059
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:13,480
But if you think of the
definition of what a good game

1060
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,750
could be, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1061
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,240
offers, a good game is a series
of interesting choices.

1062
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Our answer is all interesting
decisions.

1063
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:26,640
So what's an interesting
decision?

1064
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,560
One argument is that an
interesting decision is one

1065
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,325
where you're using mechanics
to affect the game state.

1066
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:40,050
And you're going to get some
information, you're going to

1067
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:44,240
use that mechanic and effect
the game state.

1068
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,900
The game state, the game's going
to respond in some way.

1069
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,260
And how that decision you make
corresponds to the result that

1070
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:54,120
you get back from the game state
as could be interesting.

1071
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,270
If there's no correspondence
at all, if it's completely

1072
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:02,236
random or, even worse,
completely predictable, than

1073
00:52:02,236 --> 00:52:05,475
these are not interesting
options that you've got.

1074
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:06,670
And [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1075
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,450
huh.

1076
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:12,759
That result logically made
sense, but I didn't expect

1077
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:14,737
that it was going to do
it, or that turned out

1078
00:52:14,737 --> 00:52:16,116
better than I expected.

1079
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:17,366
Now it becomes really
interesting.

1080
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,855

1081
00:52:19,855 --> 00:52:23,580
And if it's just a--

1082
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,165
it could be anything.

1083
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:24,950
It could be awesome.

1084
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,950
I could win this game
with this next--

1085
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,340
oh, look I won.

1086
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:30,590
That's not interesting either.

1087
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:33,280

1088
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,270
So if that's an interesting
decision, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1089
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:42,360
calls it a meaningful decision,
then the converse

1090
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,150
will be a meaningless
decision.

1091
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:48,785
So like a game like what
I just described.

1092
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:51,530
A decision where making a choice
doesn't actually affect

1093
00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:52,400
your outcome.

1094
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,350
Because [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1095
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,028
makes card flip, or you had to
do the card flip anyway.

1096
00:52:57,028 --> 00:52:58,240
You can't choose.

1097
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,250
Then that's not a meaningful
decision.

1098
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,000
Or you make a decision and have
no change in the game

1099
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,431
state at all.

1100
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,340
That's not interesting either.

1101
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:16,630
So what you want in your game is
something where you've got

1102
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:20,190
a system that's nonlinear,
that's one that's still

1103
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:22,350
deterministic.

1104
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:27,870
All of your rules will result
in some sort of outcome.

1105
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,140
But nonlinear enough that
you can't really sort of

1106
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,380
anticipate the entire
possibility space when you're

1107
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,350
making that decision.

1108
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:41,640
If you're thinking of games,
that's a huge possibility

1109
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,230
space, then you, as the
designer, your job is to try

1110
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:49,620
to make them most frazzled areas
of possibility space

1111
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,700
interesting and fun.

1112
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,816
So actually do folks know the
phrase possibility space.

1113
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:02,690
Yeah, and if you think of a game
as just a series of terms

1114
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,540
or series of decisions.

1115
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,340
Then possibility space is
basically every single result

1116
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,290
that would come out from
every single legal

1117
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,340
decision in your game.

1118
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,350
Some of them are going
to make sense.

1119
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,190
Like--

1120
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,960
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1121
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,520
PROFESSOR: In process, which
now I'm getting back to the

1122
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,782
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1123
00:54:24,782 --> 00:54:31,650
Someone's got zero and zero,
and it's my turn.

1124
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,030
Putting in actually
what makes sense.

1125
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:38,200
Putting it anywhere else
doesn't make any sense.

1126
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,720
So I would argue that putting
an X anywhere really isn't--

1127
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,939
well it is part of the
possibility space, because I

1128
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:48,660
could put it here, here,
here, here or here.

1129
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,400
You as a game designer, your job
is to make sure that the

1130
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,644
things that people won't
naturally do are interesting.

1131
00:54:57,644 --> 00:55:01,430
You do not have necessarily
any responsibility for

1132
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:07,340
somebody who's just trying to
play your game in a way that's

1133
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,770
entirely not what you planned.

1134
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:14,410
Say somebody plays one of these
card games and says,

1135
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,600
well I'm just going to play
all my card face up.

1136
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,036
Those specific rules that says
that I have to bite my hand,

1137
00:55:21,036 --> 00:55:22,370
but [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1138
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:25,142
You don't really need
to keep it for that.

1139
00:55:25,142 --> 00:55:31,118
Nice to have a rule that
explains, OK, this is what you

1140
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:35,820
should hide your cards is
crucial to your game.

1141
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:38,622
But for the most part, when
somebody plays your game in a

1142
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:44,406
way that doesn't logically make
sense, you're not really

1143
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:47,298
obliged to make sure
that they have fun.

1144
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:50,010
On the other hand when people
are making rational, if you

1145
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,445
are making rational
decisions--

1146
00:55:52,445 --> 00:55:55,990
somebody puts an x here, and
then the next move goes on and

1147
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:01,680
you design your game, then it's
your job to make sure

1148
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:05,768
that OK, within the realm of
the things that are legally

1149
00:56:05,768 --> 00:56:09,212
good, and strategically make
sense, we're going to try to

1150
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:10,476
make that game as interesting
as possible.

1151
00:56:10,476 --> 00:56:11,726
That's your job.

1152
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:19,840

1153
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:26,303
So in order to sort of like help
you figure out how to get

1154
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:31,031
that, the reading from
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] today,

1155
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:34,799
introduce a few terms, if you've
already taken game

1156
00:56:34,799 --> 00:56:37,750
theory and economic class or
a math course, you probably

1157
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,126
already know these in far more
detail than you necessarily

1158
00:56:41,126 --> 00:56:43,541
need it for the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
is useful.

1159
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:53,480
But utility it's a very
useful concept.

1160
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,520
It's difficult to quantify
sometimes, but you're talking

1161
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,270
about just like regular game
design as opposed to the pure

1162
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:02,084
mathematic thought experiment.

1163
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:13,150
But a basic idea is if utility
is like how winning a move is.

1164
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,482
Is the likelihood that something
is going to actually

1165
00:57:16,482 --> 00:57:17,440
call you a winner.

1166
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,715
And in some ways, it's a measure
of the games that

1167
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:20,380
you're [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1168
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:24,820
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1169
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,020
example has this like ridiculous
game where you

1170
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,125
guess whether somebody
has heads or tails.

1171
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:35,083
And the person's like literally
just choosing

1172
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,560
whether it's going to be
a heads or a tails,

1173
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,230
and you just guess.

1174
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:48,278
The idea being if
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1175
00:57:48,278 --> 00:57:53,158
So this is the guesser,
this is the flipper.

1176
00:57:53,158 --> 00:57:56,574

1177
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,262
So if the guesser guesses
right, the

1178
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:01,445
guesser gets a point.

1179
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:07,510
And that's a choice of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1180
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:13,673
If the flipper chooses tails,
the guesser chooses tails, the

1181
00:58:13,673 --> 00:58:15,541
guesser will get one.

1182
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:18,860
And if not, then it reverses.

1183
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:25,009
So the flipper again gets
the penny if the

1184
00:58:25,009 --> 00:58:27,390
guesser gets it wrong.

1185
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,365
So you can sort of tell that,
just by looking at this, this

1186
00:58:30,365 --> 00:58:31,490
is a ridiculous game.

1187
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:35,738
It's like at best, your average
over multiple games is

1188
00:58:35,738 --> 00:58:37,600
just going to be zero.

1189
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,560
On average it's just going to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1190
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,760

1191
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:50,365
And you use this as example to
describe how we can come up

1192
00:58:50,365 --> 00:58:52,779
with a strategy where you're not
basically doing the same

1193
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:53,690
thing all the time.

1194
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:56,840
In this particular case, he's
advocating that the best way

1195
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:01,484
to win this game is pretty much
to break even in this

1196
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:04,300
game, and that's to just
play it randomly.

1197
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:06,750
Every single time just really
caught up in it.

1198
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,055
As soon as you get consistence,
and either you'll

1199
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:11,750
get this for your flips,
then you are now

1200
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,000
in a different package.

1201
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,410

1202
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:19,971
But what you're trying
to do in--

1203
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:24,512
but in this particular case, the
likelihood of whether it

1204
00:59:24,512 --> 00:59:26,845
is a heads or a tail, and
you're actually doing it

1205
00:59:26,845 --> 00:59:32,480
randomly, but if you throw a
kink and say, well if it most

1206
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,750
comes up heads, instead of
winning one penny, you win one

1207
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:40,000
million dollars or something.

1208
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,410

1209
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:48,701
There's certainly the
probability that the flipper

1210
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:52,284
is going to choose heads,
drops it, drops

1211
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:53,228
like rubber, right?

1212
00:59:53,228 --> 00:59:56,060
Not a wise strategy.

1213
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:01,520
If a flipper chooses heads 50%
of the time, then the guesser

1214
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:04,100
is going to be winning several
million dollars pretty soon.

1215
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,058
They'll be losing a couple of
pennies once in a while, sure.

1216
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:10,509
fine, I'll lose a couple of
pennies, I'll just guess heads

1217
01:00:10,509 --> 01:00:11,010
all the time.

1218
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:15,805
And if I know that they are
flipping heads 50% of the

1219
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:19,340
time, I'm going to be getting
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1220
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,910
So in this particular case,
the way how the flipper

1221
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:30,560
balances it out is basically
to flip tails about one

1222
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,640
million to one.

1223
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,550
I think it's more accurately
it's like one million to two.

1224
01:00:34,550 --> 01:00:38,336
So it's like for every one
million tail flips, I'm just

1225
01:00:38,336 --> 01:00:40,530
going to throw in a head flip
every once in a while just

1226
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,350
don't force the guesser to
occasionally guess heads.

1227
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:48,633
Because if the guesser knows the
flipper will be crazy to

1228
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:51,856
guess heads all the time, and
does tails all the time, then

1229
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:54,165
the guesser just guesses tails
all the time, and after 50

1230
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:57,550
games the guesser is ahead.

1231
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,220
So the idea is every once in a
while you throw in a head.

1232
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:08,648
And it's roughly the opposite
probability of the ability.

1233
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:10,600
Approximately.

1234
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,034
The numbers don't quite
work out that easy.

1235
01:01:13,034 --> 01:01:16,589
But it's I guess in the scale
that I'm using right now, one

1236
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,196
million to one.

1237
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:23,164
And when you're talking about
balancing a game, if you can't

1238
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:26,910
actually break down a decision
in your game, say a particular

1239
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,210
decision that a player has got
to fake given a certain hand

1240
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,840
or having a certain card.

1241
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,670
And now they can make one or
two or three decisions.

1242
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,040
And knowing the card
distribution well enough

1243
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,444
saying well, 30% of the
time decision A

1244
01:01:43,444 --> 01:01:45,430
is going to be good.

1245
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:47,740
20% of the times decision
B is going to be good.

1246
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:51,660
And the other 50%, it's going
to be decision C.

1247
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:56,480
Then a balanced game, at least
one definition of it, is that

1248
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:59,950
the utility of all those
decisions, the benefit that

1249
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,320
you're going to get out
of that maybe is

1250
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,415
raw, winning points.

1251
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:07,740
Victory points that you need to
be able to get in the game.

1252
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,640
Maybe some sort of cash.

1253
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,380
The benefit of actually making
that decision should probably

1254
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:17,010
be in reverse proportion
of those numbers.

1255
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:23,432
So the thing that you will pick
50% of the time, that you

A, B, C. And--

AUDIENCE: What are
you trying to do?

1270
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:23,260
PROFESSOR: So the idea is
that A should give you

1271
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,930
disproportion will be
higher than it is.

1272
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:27,706
Not disproportionally,
but should give you

1273
01:03:27,706 --> 01:03:34,631
proportionately higher than it
did in decision C. So if C

1274
01:03:34,631 --> 01:03:36,074
gives you--

1275
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:38,960

1317
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:10,120
PROFESSOR: And this makes it a
situation where choosing A, B

1318
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:14,560
or C becomes fairly even.

1319
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:18,800
You could choose A, and you
could get and 20% of the time

1320

you've got a pretty
good payout.

1321
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:23,900
I'm really terrible at
math, so I'm going to

01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,400
see if this is right.

1323
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,865
But this makes it so that you
don't have an immediate

looking at your cards.

1325

It's like well, obviously,
I'm just going to do

01:05:34,086 --> 01:05:36,515
this all the time.

1327
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:39,305
This is very, very,
very basic.

1328
01:05:39,305 --> 01:05:43,315
And I crap at doing
this other thing.

1329
01:05:43,315 --> 01:05:47,000
But once in a while, it's a
good idea to actually just

write out the numbers.

cards in hand.

1333
01:05:57,824 --> 01:06:00,910

probability of A, B, C affects
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1336
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:15,780
So I have part A, I have part B,
I have part C. I could play

1337
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:19,470
any one of those, and making
that decision, you want to

1338
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:26,980
give them rewards that are in
inverse proportion to this.

01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:30,200
That's one way that you
can balance a game.

It is very much a first stab.

1341
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:39,728
This is how you mathematically
take that first stab, and then

1342
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:44,852
you actually need to test
it out, out of that.

1343
01:06:44,852 --> 01:06:48,268

If you're getting a situation

01:08:16,756 --> 01:08:19,370
AUDIENCE: The game where you can
either click on tokens or

1373
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:19,744
roll the dice.

1374
01:08:19,744 --> 01:08:21,238
PROFESSOR: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1375
01:08:21,238 --> 01:08:23,230
AUDIENCE: The one that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1376
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,724
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1377
01:08:24,724 --> 01:08:26,716
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

1378
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:27,214
Yeah.

1379
01:08:27,214 --> 01:08:28,708
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1380
01:08:28,708 --> 01:08:32,692
if you viewed the kind of
strategy developed and the

1381
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,684
game we built based on different
dice and things,

1382
01:08:34,684 --> 01:08:36,676
that was kind of the
utility model.

1383
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:38,170
That we're trying to maximize
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1384
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:40,660
And if you win you expect
your utility

1385
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,652
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1386
01:08:42,652 --> 01:08:45,640
And then like you can do a bunch
of path [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1387
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:49,126
to maximize these things
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], which is--

1388
01:08:49,126 --> 01:08:50,170
I don't know.

1389
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:50,770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1390
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:55,080
I mean the thing about it
though, of course, if the

1391
01:08:55,080 --> 01:09:00,561
method you do basically says
well the way to maximize our

1392
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:03,630
expected value is just to do the
same thing all the time,

1393
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:07,490
and then that particular game,
that's a very standard

1394
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,840
strategy that tends to work.

1395
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,859
Then you've got a game that's
not interesting.

1396
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:16,439
Then you've got a game where
those decisions that you're

1397
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,609
asking someone to make don't
actually matter because

1398
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:20,930
there's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1399
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:27,420
So yeah, that game is a fine
example of a game that you

1400
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,370
could use for work.

1401
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,319
I'm not going to say the broken
game because that was

1402
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:34,894
specifically designed for
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1403
01:09:34,894 --> 01:09:36,840
that class act.

1404
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,530
Here's this game, now I'm
going [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1405
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:43,259
But yeah, that's a good game
where the utility's pretty

1406
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:44,700
obvious, right?

1407
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,300
How far are we going to get?

1408
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:49,896
Well I could pick this token or
I could roll the die, wait

1409
01:09:49,896 --> 01:09:52,620
a minute, on average you all
come out to be about the same.

1410
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,800
So it doesn't matter anymore.

1411
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,032
Why this decision is no
longer interesting.

1412
01:09:57,032 --> 01:09:59,462
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1413
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:02,378
because the whole point was that
you, the meaningful weave

1414
01:10:02,378 --> 01:10:04,808
is that you're pulling at the
variance table, right?

1415
01:10:04,808 --> 01:10:07,238
Your expected values
are the same.

1416
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:09,668
Both of the cases when you're
doing just a kind of

1417
01:10:09,668 --> 01:10:10,640
computation, right?

1418
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,126
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1419
01:10:11,126 --> 01:10:12,897
AUDIENCE: Now I can
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1420
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:16,376
Sometimes it's incredibly
painful to not get the reward.

1421
01:10:16,376 --> 01:10:18,861
Sometimes you just
want consistency.

1422
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:21,843
So imagine in Settlers of Catan
where you can go for a

1423
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:24,493
strategy where you have a
diverse set of numbers that

1424
01:10:24,493 --> 01:10:25,819
you can possibly rob.

1425
01:10:25,819 --> 01:10:30,292
And before you can just get up
and [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1426
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,777
Usually it's better to go for
consistency, because you'll

1427
01:10:32,777 --> 01:10:34,268
get robbed.

1428
01:10:34,268 --> 01:10:36,256
AUDIENCE: You can use a large
range of numbers.

1429
01:10:36,256 --> 01:10:37,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1430
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:43,214
The chances you'll get a huge
payoff off turn, and then a

1431
01:10:43,214 --> 01:10:44,705
seven will be rolled
before you get

1432
01:10:44,705 --> 01:10:45,202
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1433
01:10:45,202 --> 01:10:46,693
They would have been better
off generating

1434
01:10:46,693 --> 01:10:47,687
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1435
01:10:47,687 --> 01:10:50,669
Even if the expectation you
generate [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1436
01:10:50,669 --> 01:10:52,466
PROFESSOR: But in the back of
your head you always know that

1437
01:10:52,466 --> 01:10:55,288
you could go to the
big payoff round.

1438
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:57,280
And usually in a game--

1439
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,276
AUDIENCE: What I'm saying
is there's a meaningful

1440
01:10:58,276 --> 01:10:59,272
difference between
these things.

1441
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:02,011
Even if your expected
value/computation shows you

1442
01:11:02,011 --> 01:11:03,256
that there
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1443
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:05,248
strategies [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
the variance

1444
01:11:05,248 --> 01:11:07,240
can really be different.

1445
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,734
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1446
01:11:08,734 --> 01:11:09,730
AUDIENCE: The decisions
are very different.

1447
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,888
If you're playing a three player
version of Settlers you

1448
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:13,714
want to be equally
very diverse.

1449
01:11:13,714 --> 01:11:17,010
Whereas you imagine if there
were a version of Settlers

1450
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,790
where there were 10 players, you
would want to like cluster

1451
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,025
all around a couple
different numbers.

1452
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:25,825
Because then it's unlikely that
if everyone's diverse,

1453
01:11:25,825 --> 01:11:26,775
everyone's not equal.

1454
01:11:26,775 --> 01:11:28,555
So you'd rather have a little
bit of a [UNINTELLIGIBLE],

1455
01:11:28,555 --> 01:11:30,126
you'd be like way ahead
of everybody.

1456
01:11:30,126 --> 01:11:34,300
Than having just the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1457
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,760
PROFESSOR: Well basically,
again,

1458
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,865
counting on the huge payout.

1459
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:38,640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1460
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,435
But that comes out
to like variance.

1461
01:11:40,435 --> 01:11:42,467
And where the expected value of
the resources you get, this

1462
01:11:42,467 --> 01:11:47,135
is the same as the expected
value of like winning the game

1463
01:11:47,135 --> 01:11:49,115
where you're really
trying to maximize

1464
01:11:49,115 --> 01:11:50,365
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1465
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:52,580

1466
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,787
PROFESSOR: There was a really,
really, really funny video

1467
01:11:56,787 --> 01:12:01,770
that I didn't show you guys
about how to win at a lottery.

1468
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:07,135
And they actually did trot out
various facts, basically

1469
01:12:07,135 --> 01:12:11,437
saying that oh, some percent
of the time two numbers--

1470
01:12:11,437 --> 01:12:13,882
this is one of those lotteries
where you pick six numbers,

1471
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:19,505
and the number of numbers that
correspond will get you a

1472
01:12:19,505 --> 01:12:20,239
certain payout.

1473
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:24,640
And it's like some percentage
of the time you will get two

1474
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,389
numbers adjacent to each other,
like 39 and 40 or

1475
01:12:28,389 --> 01:12:31,682
something like that. and there's
like that's all, you

1476
01:12:31,682 --> 01:12:32,920
should pick two numbers.

1477
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,890
That makes no sense at all.

1478
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,140
Because [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1479
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:41,335

1480
01:12:41,335 --> 01:12:45,320
In that particular case,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1481
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,410
I think it was a good point to
say, that you get to choose

1482
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:52,490
how much variance
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1483
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:55,320
How much risk are you willing
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1484
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,520
Because in a game like Settlers,
the nice thing about

1485
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:01,940
it is if they're going for the
big payout is it increases the

1486
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,735
risk and increases the payout
[UNINTELLIGIBLE],

1487
01:13:04,735 --> 01:13:07,717
or potential payout.

1488
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:09,705
So that's what's
nice about it.

1489
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:12,190
That's a nice balancing act.

1490
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:14,178
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
anyone's played-- it's not

1491
01:13:14,178 --> 01:13:15,669
really a game, it's more
of a math problem.

1492
01:13:15,669 --> 01:13:32,590

1493
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:33,982
PROFESSOR: I haven't
played that one.

1496
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,450
PROFESSOR: It's pretty cool.

1497
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:41,394
Can you put that up on
the board maybe?

1498
01:13:41,394 --> 01:13:41,890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1499
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,874
I can tell you right now.

1500
01:13:43,874 --> 01:13:47,205
It's first cube has three
5s, the three 2s.

1501
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:49,012
PROFESSOR: Oh,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1502
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,500
Three 5s and three 3s?

1503

01:13:53,238 --> 01:13:56,452

1506
01:13:56,452 --> 01:13:58,932
One of them is 5, 4 and a 1.

PROFESSOR: 5, 4--

1508

AUDIENCE: They all have expected
value of 3 and 1/2.

1509
01:14:03,952 --> 01:14:05,440
same as the regular value.

1510
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,912
Last one is one 6 and five 3s.

1511
01:14:08,912 --> 01:14:11,392
PROFESSOR: One 6 and five 3s.

1512

AUDIENCE: They all have the
expected value of 3 and 1/2.

1513
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,320
Now, the game is first player
chooses a die, and the second

1514
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,808
player chooses a die.

1515
01:14:21,808 --> 01:14:24,784
And then
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1516
01:14:24,784 --> 01:14:27,290

1517
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:28,442

AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1519
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:31,406
PROFESSOR: And then do you
re-roll with the game dice?

1520
01:14:31,406 --> 01:14:31,899
AUDIENCE: No.

1521
01:14:31,899 --> 01:14:35,843
The first player chooses the
die, and the second player

1522
01:14:35,843 --> 01:14:36,193
sees what the first person
chose and then the second

01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:10,830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1539
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:11,720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1540
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,660
It's three 6s so dominated
by the 4s, but it's like

1541
01:15:14,660 --> 01:15:15,370
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1542
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,250
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1543
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:19,238
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1544
01:15:19,238 --> 01:15:21,230
The second always wins.

1545
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:22,730
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1546
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:25,070
AUDIENCE: They can
probabilistically win.

1547
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:26,968
PROFESSOR: So what you're
describing is a strategy for

1548
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:28,254
the second player.

1549
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:32,700
Basically, if the first player
can [UNINTELLIGIBLE], you pick

1550
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,356
something, and on average
you will win

1551
01:15:35,356 --> 01:15:36,580
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1552
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:38,585
AUDIENCE: It would be more
interesting if you did it in

1553
01:15:38,585 --> 01:15:40,195
two rounds
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1554
01:15:40,195 --> 01:15:42,610
everyone takes a die
sequentially.

1555
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,025
And then they roll to
see who goes first.

1556
01:15:45,025 --> 01:15:47,980
Because then you're aiming to
try to like hit the middle.

1557
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,912
PROFESSOR: Will you do
that one more time?

1558
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:54,600
AUDIENCE: So you randomly
decide who goes first.

1559
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,785
So the first person chooses a
die, and then the next person

1560
01:15:57,785 --> 01:15:59,590
chooses a die, then next
person chooses die.

1561
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:03,680
And they roll to determine the
order of the actual game.

1562
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:07,102
So what you're trying to roll
for is to get in second place

1563
01:16:07,102 --> 01:16:10,281
rather than first because
the optimal strategy

1564
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:14,200
is the second choice.

1565
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,260
AUDIENCE: Oh that's bizzare.

1566
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,785
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but the problem
is if you take 6 and

1567
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:19,602
3, you also have a pretty
high chance of

1568
01:16:19,602 --> 01:16:20,568
getting the last one.

1569
01:16:20,568 --> 01:16:22,017
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1570
01:16:22,017 --> 01:16:24,915
AUDIENCE: Well yeah,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1571
01:16:24,915 --> 01:16:27,330
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1572
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:29,262
PROFESSOR: Evolution is
something which happens

1573
01:16:29,262 --> 01:16:30,730
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] is well.

1574
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:34,440
OK, you show that it's clearly
a dominant strategy, but how

1575
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,887
you get to deciding what
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] strategy to

1576
01:16:36,887 --> 01:16:39,505
use gave meaningful information
because

1577
01:16:39,505 --> 01:16:40,499
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1578
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:41,990
PROFESSOR: That's possible
as well.

1579
01:16:41,990 --> 01:16:44,940

1580
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:46,950
PROFESSOR: Once it gets to that
point, then you want to

1581
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:50,304
think about well maybe there's
something you can do to your

1582
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:52,378
original game to make it easier
for people to get to

1583
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:54,696
that second level of the game.

1584
01:16:54,696 --> 01:16:59,910
And you don't necessarily always
have to, because there

1585
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:02,280
are going to be people who are
just going to have fun at this

1586
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,470
point, to sort of like playing
this game as opposed to

1587
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:08,800
figuring out who goes first.

1588
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,600
But it'll be interesting if in
the process of designing this

1589
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,680
game, you've got rules to
actually let people decide who

1590
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,165
goes first.

1591
01:17:15,165 --> 01:17:18,560
And the people who haven't
figured out the dominant

1592
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,242
strategy, this is where
the game is at.

1593
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:26,130
Just like the first player has
an equal [UNINTELLIGIBLE] as

1594
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:27,600
the second player.

1595
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,860
And then later on when people
start to realize that there is

1596
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,540
actually a strategy, they got
playing the other game of who

1597
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:35,730
goes first.

1598
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:39,860
But if you design your game
right, then you can make it

1599
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,690
all the same game.

1600
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,385
It's just which set of rules
that they're most concerned

1601
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:45,110
about and you could
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1602
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:48,735
It would be nice if your
games could do that.

1603
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:51,669
Let's see how [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
they get.

1604
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:55,100

1605
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,650
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE] move
away from game period

1606
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,820
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

1607
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,920
Are you even going to mention
Prisoner's Dillema because I

1608
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,065
think that's a great tool to
try to look at dramatic

1609
01:18:05,065 --> 01:18:08,045
tension and interesting
discussions for players.

1610
01:18:08,045 --> 01:18:10,610
AUDIENCE: That does happen
often in strategy games.

1611
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:11,480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1612
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,436
Well--

1613
01:18:12,436 --> 01:18:14,826
AUDIENCE: Not in a game where
you're [INTERPOSING VOICES]

1614
01:18:14,826 --> 01:18:17,220
PROFESSOR: There are two
arguments about that one.

1615
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:19,270
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1616
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:22,470
I guess we actually have
human beings playing.

1617
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:25,106
PROFESSOR: So the Prisoner's
Dillema as

1618
01:18:25,106 --> 01:18:27,890
covered in the reading.

1619
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,840
I don't know the
exact numbers.

1620
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,942
But basically you've
got two people--

1621
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:35,412
AUDIENCE: Well they didn't
say exact numbers

1622
01:18:35,412 --> 01:18:36,894
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1623
01:18:36,894 --> 01:18:38,376
PROFESSOR: I think
we have a chart.

1624
01:18:38,376 --> 01:18:40,860
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
punishment [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1625
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,620
PROFESSOR: In fact, I may be
thinking of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1626
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:45,620
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1627
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,916
PROFESSOR: The one that
I know is that--

1628
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:58,608
let's see, I know defect
is one of the cases.

1629
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:01,398
Anybody remember what the term
we use for cooperating?

1630
01:19:01,398 --> 01:19:02,648
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1631
01:19:02,648 --> 01:19:06,278

1632
01:19:06,278 --> 01:19:06,766
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1633
01:19:06,766 --> 01:19:08,016
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1634
01:19:08,016 --> 01:19:12,134

1635
01:19:12,134 --> 01:19:17,080
So if both people cooperate,
they get something like what,

1636
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,760
five years in prison?

1637
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,685
So it's like the town.

1638
01:19:21,685 --> 01:19:23,870
OK, we get two people who
are involved in the same

1639
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,830
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1640
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:27,475
and they both get caught but
then there's not enough

1641
01:19:27,475 --> 01:19:30,060
evidence to throw both of them
away for a real long time.

1642
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:34,932
So the basic idea is each of
them is separated, and then

1643
01:19:34,932 --> 01:19:38,350
you give us information
on the other guy.

1644
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:42,072
Then we will reduce your
sentence, and that other guy

1645
01:19:42,072 --> 01:19:47,808
is going to get hammered with a
sentence but we'll give you

1646
01:19:47,808 --> 01:19:50,970
a get out of jail free card.

1647
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:54,990
But if you don't tell us
anything, if you cooperate

1648
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:59,322
with your partner, and don't
give us the evidence that we

1649
01:19:59,322 --> 01:20:01,656
need, we still have enough
evidence to put you away for

1650
01:20:01,656 --> 01:20:01,990
five years.

1651
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:03,490
So that's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1652
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:05,490
Both of you will go away
for five years.

1653
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:12,100
Now, if you do decide to give
us the information, then you

1654
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:16,250
really get away with just
one year in prison.

1655
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:21,850
But the the guy you
just ratted on

1656
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,290
goes away for 30 years.

1657
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:25,690
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1658
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:29,970
And of course, if both of you
decide to rat on each other,

1659
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:31,970
oh now we've got
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] charges.

1660
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:32,920
That's awesome.

1661
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,800
Both of you go away for
a very long time.

1662
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,050

1663
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,170

[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1666
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:44,323
a person cooperating and
another defecting.

1667
01:20:44,323 --> 01:20:45,285
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

1668
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:45,766
Right.

1669
01:20:45,766 --> 01:20:47,690
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1670
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,430
PROFESSOR: I seen versions
where it's not equal.

1671
01:20:50,430 --> 01:20:51,660
But yeah, it's--

1672
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:52,340
AUDIENCE: Separate game.

1673
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,538
PROFESSOR: RXY72?

1674
01:20:56,538 --> 01:20:58,150
AUDIENCE: No.

1675
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:00,132
Defect should be 66.

1676
01:21:00,132 --> 01:21:01,520
Defect should be--

1677
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:04,202
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] were you
cooperating, but better than

1678
01:21:04,202 --> 01:21:05,950
getting out.

1679
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:06,530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1680
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:07,330
Yeah.

1681
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:07,910
You're right.

1682
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:10,280
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1683
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,818
So this [UNINTELLIGIBLE] is
probably too high too, too.

1684
01:21:12,818 --> 01:21:14,270
But--

1685
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,174
AUDIENCE: I mean it
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1686
01:21:17,174 --> 01:21:19,836
AUDIENCE: All that matters is
that it doesn't matter what

1687
01:21:19,836 --> 01:21:23,960
your opponent does that he
will [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1688
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,230
PROFESSOR: Although--

1689
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:25,930
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
looking at.

1690
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:29,550
PROFESSOR: --they told me that,
which is true for a

1691
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:32,862
single instance of this game.

1692
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:36,306
The thing that gets really
complex is what happens is you

1693
01:21:36,306 --> 01:21:39,258
had to play this multiple times
because you're multiple,

1694
01:21:39,258 --> 01:21:43,686
repeat offender bank robber who
gets caught all the time.

1695
01:21:43,686 --> 01:21:44,945
AUDIENCE: Just give up.

1696
01:21:44,945 --> 01:21:47,570

1697
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,990
PROFESSOR: And that's where
you get into various

1698
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,070
strategies.

1699
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:55,880
The strategy in that particular
dilemma is you

1700
01:21:55,880 --> 01:22:00,720
should always betray your
partner because on average,

1701
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,572
you're going to come
out ahead.

1702
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:03,498
Is that right?

1703
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:05,232
AUDIENCE: The strategy is you do
whatever the partner did to

1704
01:22:05,232 --> 01:22:06,750
you last time.

1705
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:07,690
PROFESSOR: No.

1706
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,820
That's a single game
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1707
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:10,800
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah,
single game.

1708
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,780
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1709
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:14,720
AUDIENCE: You always send out
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1710
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:19,495
PROFESSOR: So let me see, if you
defect, then what happens

1711
01:22:19,495 --> 01:22:24,380
is that you could get away
with one or six years.

1712
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:29,048
Six, you don't know what your
opponent is going to do.

1713
01:22:29,048 --> 01:22:33,520
That's something like
three months time.

1714
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,580
If you cooperate then
it's going to be

1715
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:38,044
between three and seven.

1716
01:22:38,044 --> 01:22:40,972
So that's more like expected
value of five.

1717
01:22:40,972 --> 01:22:43,800

1718
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:46,702
AUDIENCE: You're not trying to
win this game, you're trying

1719
01:22:46,702 --> 01:22:47,678
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1720
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:48,654
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1721
01:22:48,654 --> 01:22:50,120
is actually right.

1722
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,579
Say your opponent couldn't
cooperate.

1723
01:22:52,579 --> 01:22:54,894
Then what if you didn't
cooperate?

1724
01:22:54,894 --> 01:22:56,746
If you were to cooperate
you get three years.

1725
01:22:56,746 --> 01:22:58,670
If you defect you
get one year.

1726
01:22:58,670 --> 01:23:00,240
So you should defect.

1727
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,940
What if they were to defect?

1728
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,558
Well if you were to cooperate,
then you'd get one year.

1729
01:23:05,558 --> 01:23:09,446
And if you would cooperate
then you'd seven years.

1730
01:23:09,446 --> 01:23:10,418
But if you were to defect,
you'd only get six years.

1731
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:11,876
So you defect then too.

1732
01:23:11,876 --> 01:23:14,306
So you should just go
ahead with that.

1733
01:23:14,306 --> 01:23:16,250
PROFESSOR: That's--

1734
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:19,155
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1735
01:23:19,155 --> 01:23:20,880
PROFESSOR: That's basically
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1736
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,470
what's the minimum--

1737
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:26,770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1738
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:30,430
higher numbers to represent that
thing happening to you.

1739
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:34,995
But the whole principle of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1740
01:23:34,995 --> 01:23:39,432
we are trying to maximize your
minimum benefits, and the

1741
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:41,650
minimum benefit in
this particular

1742
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:47,813
case, happens in defect.

1743
01:23:47,813 --> 01:23:50,815
Because the most you can
possibly get is six years if

1744
01:23:50,815 --> 01:23:52,555
you defect.

1745
01:23:52,555 --> 01:23:56,232
If you ever cooperate, there's
a chance that you're going to

1746
01:23:56,232 --> 01:23:57,525
get to the years.

1747
01:23:57,525 --> 01:23:58,775
So [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1748
01:23:58,775 --> 01:24:01,270

1749
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:06,200
The only problem is, again,
once you get into this

1750
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:09,090
repeated over many, many
times, then you're in a

1751
01:24:09,090 --> 01:24:13,180
situation where if you build
up a reputation, that all

1752
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:18,330
you're going to do is defect,
then you can almost assume

1753
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,350
that your--

1754
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:22,730
you can pretty much assume that
whoever you're playing

1755
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:25,039
against is also going
to defect.

1756
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:27,484
At which point you will always
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1757
01:24:27,484 --> 01:24:29,440
You will never be able
to get here.

1758
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,730

1759
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:38,820
There is a concept that helps
deal with situations like this

1760
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:41,000
that actually make cooperation,

1761
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,800
again, a viable strategy.

1762
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,710

1763
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:47,080
I'm hoping I'm getting
this right.

1764
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,280

1765
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:53,510
Well [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in the
reading suggested there are

1766
01:24:53,510 --> 01:24:54,398
saddle points.

1767
01:24:54,398 --> 01:25:00,180
There are saddle points that
basically mean this is where

1768
01:25:00,180 --> 01:25:03,920
all the strategies pretty much
end up because of the

1769
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,720
reasoning that we just
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1770
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:11,060
You are maximizing the
minimum chaos.

1771
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,040
The minimum benefit
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1772
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,800

1773
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,938
And they all
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1774
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:23,890
If everyone did the
same analysis,

1775
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:25,860
they all end up here.

1776
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:30,690
But John Nash comes along and
he suggests that there are

1777
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,760
other kinds of saddle points
that could be found.

1778
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,960
And these are points where,
assuming that everybody sticks

1779
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,110
with whatever strategies that
they've got, if I were to

1780
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,800
change my strategy I will end
up in a horrid situation.

1781
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,470

1782
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:48,720
So--

1783
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,392

1784
01:25:51,392 --> 01:25:53,807
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1785
01:25:53,807 --> 01:25:54,773
AUDIENCE: Defective for that.

1786
01:25:54,773 --> 01:25:57,200
Defective
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1787
01:25:57,200 --> 01:25:57,983
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1788
01:25:57,983 --> 01:25:58,950
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1789
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:04,880
remains one of the saddle points
Nash [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1790
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,316
But the other thing about it is
that what actually becomes

1791
01:26:08,316 --> 01:26:10,540
an unstable equilibrium.

1792
01:26:10,540 --> 01:26:15,650
It's one of those things,
especially in a multiple game,

1793
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:20,965
is like if you're going to
assume and you're going to be

1794
01:26:20,965 --> 01:26:23,997
playing this game over and over
and over and over again,

1795
01:26:23,997 --> 01:26:27,925
switching out of coop has a
long-term detrimental effect.

1796
01:26:27,925 --> 01:26:31,362
Because especially-- if you know
that other people have a

1797
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:33,430
strategy of basically
I'm going to do

1798
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,777
what you did to me.

1799
01:26:34,777 --> 01:26:38,190
It's called tit for tat.

1800
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:44,560
If you actually stick with coop,
and if everybody else is

1801
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:47,760
using the same reasoning as
you are, which is another

1802
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,570
interesting bit of a wrinkle
that Nash throws in.

1803
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:55,416
Whatever analysis you are
capable of solving, everybody

1804
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:57,896
else because everybody's
a natural player.

1805
01:26:57,896 --> 01:27:02,580
Therefore, what actually
becomes a unstable, but

1806
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,990
possible because
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] points.

1807
01:27:04,990 --> 01:27:10,544
Because switching out actually
leads to the net loss for

1808
01:27:10,544 --> 01:27:12,488
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1809
01:27:12,488 --> 01:27:15,900
And that was kind of the little
thing that he threw in

1810
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:19,100
that kind of made his name and
then [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1811
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,550

1812
01:27:23,550 --> 01:27:36,010
But the basic idea is what is
useful from a one table like

1813
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:39,094
this becomes really, really
interesting when you think

1814
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:41,330
about what you're going to
do in the long-term.

1815
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:45,190
I believe there's a couple of
other strategies that involve

1816
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:49,420
things like instead of just
doing what I did to you last,

1817
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:53,896
just sort of like well if you
defect and I were to defect

1818
01:27:53,896 --> 01:27:56,750
the next time, which I think
that's a pretty good

1819
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:56,860
perspective.

1820
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,675
But they didn't cooperate
and I wouldn't

1821
01:27:58,675 --> 01:28:02,080
cooperate next time.

1822
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,922
There's also strategies like
well as soon as you defect,

1823
01:28:04,922 --> 01:28:07,778
I'm going to nothing
but defect.

1824
01:28:07,778 --> 01:28:14,250
And that actually was an
interesting group, because

1825
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:20,400
that I think changes the utility
numbers in a way where

1826
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:24,850
a single defection has a huge
negative [UNINTELLIGIBLE] in a

1827
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,969
way that you might want
to [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1828
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:30,258

1829
01:28:30,258 --> 01:28:34,704
But for the most part, I think
tit for tat turned out to be

1830
01:28:34,704 --> 01:28:38,162
the best strategy over
the long term.

1831
01:28:38,162 --> 01:28:41,126
Depending on hos the numbers
are weighted, tit for tat

1832
01:28:41,126 --> 01:28:43,430
basically says whatever
you do, I'm going

1833
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,078
to do to you next.

1834
01:28:45,078 --> 01:28:49,524
And that actually turns out
pretty good because that

1835
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,994
actually is not [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
coop actually

1836
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,476
works [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1837
01:28:53,476 --> 01:28:56,480

1838
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:56,970
Yeah.

1839
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:58,220
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1840
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:04,682

1841
01:29:04,682 --> 01:29:09,120
AUDIENCE: This also only works
if there's an unknown number

1842
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,336
of future games.

1843
01:29:10,336 --> 01:29:13,294
Because if you know you're
going to play any finite

1844
01:29:13,294 --> 01:29:14,280
number of times--

1845
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:14,773
PROFESSOR: True.

1846
01:29:14,773 --> 01:29:15,759
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1847
01:29:15,759 --> 01:29:17,731
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1848
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:20,196
There is basically it's
just like induction.

1849
01:29:20,196 --> 01:29:21,446
It goes on forever.

1850
01:29:21,446 --> 01:29:25,140

1851
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,089
But you're going to hope that
your game's going to get

1852
01:29:28,089 --> 01:29:31,333
played infinite number
of times.

1853
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,583
We are planning for it.

1854
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,325

1855
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:38,319
Not an infinite number
of turns.

1856
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:40,744
AUDIENCE: The winner can
only resolve after

1857
01:29:40,744 --> 01:29:42,720
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

1858
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,684
PROFESSOR: First one who gives
up [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1859
01:29:45,684 --> 01:29:50,130

1860
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:52,106
I really need to
get some water.

1861
01:29:52,106 --> 01:29:55,070

1862
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:55,564
AUDIENCE: Game break.

1863
01:29:55,564 --> 01:29:56,080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1864
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,440
I'm going to give
a quick break.

1865
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:59,520
But does everyone have your
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

1866
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,480
sheets?

1867
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:00,960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1868
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:01,440
PROFESSOR: OK.

1869
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:06,140
I will lecture and pick up on
that in about 10 minutes.

1870
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:06,458
