I Can't Get No Satisfaction 

Introduction 
As a resident, you must deal with resource management between two patients. But to deal with this resource 
management, you must also deal with angry and loud patients. In this scenario, there are four players: the resident, two 
patients, and a timekeeper. The timekeeper keeps track of time. The patients are vying for the resident's attention in 
hopes of having their needs satisfied, but the resident must use her resources to decrease the tension in the room and 
keep the patients from getting too close to her. The resident must make sure to not only satisfy the needs of her patients, 
but also keep them at a safe distance from her. Angry patients tend to move closer to the resident and talk louder...

Components 
26 Yellow Needs cards (2 each of Hug, TV, Video games, Teddy bear, Meds, Pillow, Family, Restroom, Water, 
•	
Nurse, Sleep, Food, Board games) 
13 Blue Satisfier cards (1 each of Hug, TV, Video games, Teddy bear, Meds, Pillow, Family, Restroom, Water, 
Nurse, Sleep, Food, Board games) 
4 Players: 1 resident, 2 patients, 1 timekeeper 
•	
•	 Step Marker Rope (Rope with 8 step markers and a center marker. Alternatively, you may choose to use any 
object to mark step locations.) 
•	 Approx. 2 minutes of game time 

Setup 
•	 Each patient randomly takes 13 Needs cards. The resident takes the 13 Satisfier cards. The resident should look 
through her Satisfier cards to familiarize herself with the cards. 
•	 The timekeeper must be able to keep time in 10 second intervals. 
•	 Lay out the Step Marker Rope with equally-spaced markers along the floor in a straight line with the labels face 
up. The resident stands next to the center marker and a patient stands next to step marker #1 on each end.

Gameplay 
•	 The game happens in real time. It ends after 2 minutes or as soon as the resident gets “attacked”. 
•	 The patients and the resident hold their decks in one hand. 
•	 When the timekeeper says “Go,” each patient draws one Need card and the resident draws three Satisfier cards. 
•	 The patients, without saying the word on his card or any derivation thereof, communicates to the resident his 
Need. (For example, for “sleep” the patient can say “I am tired”) 
If the resident believes that she has a matching Satisfier card in her hand (a Satisfier with the same name as the 
Need), she can turn to face the patient and show them the card. If the Satisfier matches the Need, the patient 
says “Yes” and takes a step away from the resident and draws a new Need. (Note: A patient may not step behind 
step marker #1. Instead, the patient should stay on step marker #1.) If the Satisfier does not match the Need, the 
patient says “No” and takes a step closer to the resident. The resident puts the used Satisfier at the bottom of her 
deck and draws back up to 3 cards in her hand. 
•	 At any time, the resident may put her entire hand at the bottom of her deck and draw 3 new Satisfier cards. 
•	 Every 10 seconds, the timekeeper says “Step” and each patient takes a step closer to the resident. 
If at any point a patient is on step marker #4 (right next to the resident) and needs to take one more step, the 
•	
patient “attacks” the resident. 
End game: 
The goal of the resident is to not get “attacked” by the patient. The goal of the patients is to not “attack” the resident.
