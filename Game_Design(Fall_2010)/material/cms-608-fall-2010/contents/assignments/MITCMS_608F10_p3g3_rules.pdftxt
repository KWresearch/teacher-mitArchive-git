Keep Your Cool 

Requirements: 
•  22 Symbol Tiles (Eleven Pairs) 
•  Four Black Flags, Four Velcro Loops, Two Optional Velcro Belts 
•  Small Round Table (3-6 feet in diameter) 
•  Two Players 
•  One Moderator (Optional) 
Overview:

There are two roles in Keep Your Cool: the Flipping Player and the Speaking Player. 

Players switch roles as the game progresses. The Flipping Player is playing a game of 

memory and trying to match pairs of tiles. The Speaking Player is trying to become the 

Flipping Player by playing a word game. While all of this is going on, both players are

trying to steal each otherʼs ﬂags and protect their own.

Setup:

Remove all chairs and obstacles within 3 feet of the table. Of the 22 Symbol Tiles, 

select 6 pairs (12 tiles total) and place them face down on the table. Each player should

pass a Velcro loop through a belt loop on both hips and attach a ﬂag to each of the two 

Velcro loops. If players do not have belt loops, they may put on the Velcro belt and 

attach their two ﬂags to each side of the belt. Play a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors: the

winner starts as the Flipping Player, the loser the Speaking Player. The game starts 

when the Flipping Player says a word, which is the starting key word.

Rules:

The Flipping Player may ﬂip tiles face up or face down, one at a time. Only up to two

tiles may be face up at any time. If two face up tiles have the same symbol, they form a

pair. The player who ﬂipped over the second tile picks up both tiles and must hold them 

in his or her hand for the rest of the game. Tiles must be kept in the same location. At 

no point in the game may any player change the position of any tile on the table.

At any time, the Speaking Player may say a word that contains the ﬁrst and last letter of

the key word. This word becomes the new key word. The old Flipping Player becomes 

the Speaking Player and must immediately cease ﬂipping tiles. The old Speaking Player 

becomes the Flipping Player and can immediately start ﬂipping tiles.

For example, if the ﬁrst key word were “ludicrous”, a sequence of key words could be:

“casserole”, “clear”, “brace”, “embalm”, “creamy”, etc.

A word (or any form of it) may not be used as the key word twice. For example, if the 

key word were “play”, the speaking player may not use “play, “played”, “playable”, or 

“player”. Eligible key words are determined by Scrabble dictionary: English words, no 

proper nouns. 


While there are tiles remaining on the table, either player may attempt to grab the other

playerʼs ﬂag. To prevent this, the other player may say “stop”. “Stop” cannot be said 

preemptively, it can only be said in response to an attempt to grab the ﬂag. If “stop” is 

said before the ﬂag is successfully grabbed, the unsuccessful grabber cannot attempt to

grab a ﬂag again until he obtains another pair. If a player successfully grabs his 

opponentʼs ﬂag before his opponent says “stop”, that player wins the game.

Winning the Game:

If a player successfully grabs the opponentʼs ﬂag, the game ends and that player wins.

Otherwise, the game ends when all tiles have been made into pairs. The winner is the 

player who has the most tiles in his or her hand. 


Moderator Rules (Optional): 
We recommend that Keep Your Cool be played with a moderator. The moderator's role 
is to maintain the ﬂuidity of the gameplay by resolving ambiguity over ﬂag grabs and key
words. The moderator shall step in when: 
-”Stop” is said preemptively. If the moderator determines that a player says “stop” when 
the other player has not made an attempt to grab a ﬂag, the moderator shall inform the
other player that the “stop” was not valid. He or she may still grab the ﬂag of the player
who said “stop”. 
-A ﬂag is pulled. The moderator shall determine whether the ﬂag was pulled before or 
after “stop” was called. If the moderator determines that “stop” was called before the
ﬂag was pulled, the ﬂag is put back and the game continues. Note that in this case the
player who attempted the grab may not take another ﬂag until he obtains another pair. 
-The speaking player says an invalid key word. In this case the moderator shall stop
play and return the players to the roles they had before the invalid word was said. If the
player who said the invalid word has picked up a set after saying the word, he must
discard those tiles and place them on the ﬂoor. They are no longer used in the game. 
-There are more than two tiles face up. The moderator stops the game, turns all tiles 
face down, and the player who ﬂipped over the third tile becomes the Speaking Player. 
-The players have any other dispute. The moderator is free to resolve the situation as 
he or she sees ﬁt in the spirit of the rules. 
The moderator always has ﬁnal say. 

Advanced Rules and FAQ 

Advanced Rules: 
As players become familiar with the standard version of Keep Your Cool, we 

recommend they play with these modiﬁcations to the standard rules:

-Use all 22 tiles.

-The game ends when all 22 tiles have been made into pairs or when a player loses

both of his or her ﬂags.

- Each pair of tiles is worth 2 points, each ﬂag that a player has pulled is worth 5 points. 

The winner is the player with the most points when the game ends. Pulling both of the 

other player's ﬂags is not an automatic win.


FAQ: 
There are one or more face-up tiles and the speaking player says a key word. What

happens?

 
-The roles immediately switch. The new Flipping Player doesn't have to turn over 

the face-up tiles and can immediately begin ﬂipping tiles, as long as a maximum of two

remain face up at any time.

Two identical tiles are face-up and the speaking player says a key word. What 

happens?

 
-The old checking player takes the pair. The roles then switch.

I tried to pull the other player's ﬂag. He/she said “stop”. I have since said a key word.

Can I try to pull the other player's ﬂag again?

 
-No. You must obtain a pair of tiles before you may pull again.
