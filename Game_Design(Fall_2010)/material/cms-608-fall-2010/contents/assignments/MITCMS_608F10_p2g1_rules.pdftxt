Black Hat 
Rules  and  Information  v1.6 

1  Welcome! 

For years, you have been a king of the information superhighway.  Using your skill, ingenuity, and a bit of luck, 

no  computer  on  the  cloud  has  ever  been  out  of  your  reach.  But  now,  a  challenge  has  been  issued.  It’s  time 

to  don  your  black  hat  and  prepare  to  ﬁght.  The  goal  is  simple  –  whoever  hacks  the Gibson  supercomputer1 

will  win  eternal  glory.  To  achieve  this  goal,  you  will  be  researching  software  exploits,  blocking  computers 

from  use,  installing  ﬁrewalls,  and  taking  over  computers. 

2  Basic  Information 

2.1  Number  of  players 

This  game  supports  2  players  (hereafter  known  as  Hackers). 

2.2  Estimated  play  time 

Estimated  play  time  is  30-40 minutes. 

2.3  Materials 

• 

2  sets  of  Rules  and  Information  with  cheat  sheets 

•	 Playing Board with a computer network, 2 sets of 4 software research dials (red, green, blue, and yellow 
to  indicate  how  close  a  player  is  to  discovering  an  exploit  for  a  particular  color  of  software),  2  sets  of 

Total  CPU  and  Used  CPU  spaces,  1  DDOS  space,  and  1  Firewall  space. 

•	 The  computer  network  should  have  2  personal  computers,  approximately  19  cloud  computers,  and  1 
Gibson  Supercomputer.  Each  computer  has  a  color  or  several  colors  determining  which  software  have 

been  installed  on  it  (and  therefore,  which  software  exploits  will  be  eﬀective) 

•	 22  red  and  22  green  Rootkit  markers  to  signify  possession  of  computers  by  hackers

•	 10  yellow  DDOS Markers 

• 

• 

10  blue  Firewall Markers 

60  CPU  Beans 

•	 12 6-sided dice (Note:  True hackers use digital dice.  If you would like a faster and more convenient way 
to  roll  dice,  grab  a  laptop  and  use  the  program  at:  web.mit.edu/alect/www/blackhat/dice.html) 

2.4  How  to  Win 

There  are  two  ways  to  win.  A  hacker  can  either: 

•	 Successfully  take  over  the  Gibson  Supercomputer 

•	 Take  over  all  the  other  hacker’s  computers 

3  Let’s  play! 

3.1  Setup 

Each  hacker  gets  one  of  the  starting  computers  which  have  a  CPU  of  4.  Place  a  rootkit  marker  on  it  to 

indicate  ownership.  Each  hacker  then  takes  4  CPU  “beans”  and  places  it  into  the  respective  “Total  CPU” 

space  to  indicate  their  current  CPU  total.  Each  hacker  sets  all  of  their  research  dials  to  0. 

3.2  How  to  play 

3.2.1  Determine  who  goes  ﬁrst 

The  player  who  can  come  up  with  the  coolest  hacker  nickname  goes  ﬁrst. 

3.2.2  A  turn 

This  is  information  about  what  a  turn  looks  like: 

•	 A hacker  gets  a number  of CPU  to  spend based  on  the  computers  she  controls.  Unless  a  computer has 
a  number  written  on  it,  assume  its  CPU  is  1.  Hackers  should  use  CPU  beans  to  keep  track  of  how 

much  CPU  they  have.  Extra  CPU  does  not  carry  over  from  turn  to  turn.  At  the  start  of  her  turn,  a 

hacker  piles  all  her  CPU  beans  onto  the  Total  CPU  space. 

2 

•	 A  hacker  can  spend  as  much  CPU  during  her  turn  as  she  wants,  limited  only  by  the  total  CPU.  As  a 
hacker  spends  CPU,  she  should  move  spent  CPU  beans  from  the  Total  CPU  space  to  the  Used  CPU 

space  to  keep  track  of  how  much  CPU  she  has  left  to  spend. 

•	 A  hacker  can  spend  CPU  to  perform  the  following  actions: 

–	 Research  Exploit:  A  hacker  can  spend  any  number  of  CPU  to  research  an  exploit  for  a  certain 

piece of  software.  She  can  increase  the  corresponding  research dial a number of  steps  equal  to  the 

amount  of  CPU  she  spends  to  indicate  her  progress.  When  a  hacker  reaches  level  6  of  a  single 

color,  the  hacker  has  discovered  an  exploit  and  computers  with  the  corresponding  color  become 

easier  to  rootkit.  If  the  hacker  is  the  only  one  to  have  discovered  this  exploit,  it’s  a  “zero-day” 

exploit  and  it’s  even  easier  to  rootkit  computers  of  that  color  until  another  hacker  discovers  that 

exploit. 

–	 Research  Patch:  A  hacker  can  spend  any  number  of  CPU  to  research  a  patch  for  a  certain  piece 

of  software.  When  a  patch  is  researched,  any  hacker  with  research  for  that  piece  of  software  has 

to  decrease  the  research  counter  for  that  piece  of  software  a  number  of  steps  equal  to  the  amount 

of CPU spent on the patch.  If a player no  longer has enough research to exploit the software,  that 

player  no  longer  has  an  exploit  for  the  software.  A  common  strategy  to  prevent  another  player 

from  removing  your  exploits  is  to  research  a  piece  of  software  beyond  level  6  (the  research  dials 

go  up  to  10). 

–	 DDOS  Attack:  A  hacker  may  DDOS  a  computer  that  neighbors  one  of  their  computers.  A 

particular  computer  may  only  be  DDOSed  once  per  turn.  DDOSing  a  computer  takes  twice  the 

amount  of  CPU  on  the  computer  the  hacker  wishes  to  DDOS.  That  computer  is  shut  down  until 

the  hacker  decides  not  to  DDOS  anymore.  To  signify  that  it  has  been  shut  down,  place  a  DDOS 

token  on  it.  A  computer  that  is  shut down  cannot be  attacked  and  cannot  contribute  to  the  total 

CPU  usable  by  the  owner.  The  owner  of  the  DDOSed  computer  should  set  aside  a  number  of 

CPU  beans  equal  to  the  CPU  of  the  DDOSed  computer  to  indicate  that  these  cannot  be  used 

on  the  next  turn.  Essentially,  a  DDOSed  computer  acts  as  if  it  were  removed  from  the  board,  so 

rules  that  require  a  hacker  to  have  a  neighboring  computer  act  as  though  the DDOSed  computer 

does not  exist.  A  computer with a ﬁrewall on  it cannot  be DDOSed.  DDOSes are  removed at  the 

beginning  of  the  hacker’s  next  turn. 

–	 Install Firewall:  A  hacker  can  place  a  ﬁrewall  on  an  existing  computer  to  prevent  a  future DDOS 

or defend a computer against potential future attacks.  Installing a ﬁrewall costs twice the amount 

of  CPU  of  that  computer.  Note  that  a  player  may  instal l  multiple  ﬁrewal ls  on  a  computer. 

3 

Firewalling  must  be  performed  at  the  end  of  the  hacker’s  turn.  Firewalls  are  removed  at  the 

beginning  of  the  hacker’s  next  turn. 

–	 Install Rootkit:  A hacker can attempt to invade and install a rootkit on any computer neighboring 

a computer they own that was not invaded on the same turn.  A hacker may only attempt to invade 

a  particular  computer  once  per  turn.  To  rootkit  a  computer,  the  invading  hacker  must  pay  the 

amount  of  CPU  on  the  target  computer  to  get  a  single  die  roll.  The  invading  hacker  may  then 

pay  for  extra  die  rolls  at  a  cost  of  2  CPU  per  die  roll.  The  hacker  must  announce  the  number  of 

extra  dice  to  be  used  before  rol ling  the  dice.  The  player  then  rolls  a  number  of  6-sided  dice  based 

on  how  much  CPU  she  spent.  The  maximum  value  of  the  hacker’s  rolls  determines  a  successful 

rootkit  install  depending  on  conditions  outlined  below: 
∗	 For a completely protected computer (no exploits), the player must roll a max of 6 to succeed. 
∗	 For  a  computer with  a  color  of  software  for which  the  hacker  has  an  exploit,  the  hacker must 
roll a 5 or a 6 to succeed.  Note that a computer with multiple colors can be exploited through 

any  of  those  pieces  of  software. 
∗	 For  a  computer  with  a  color  of  software  for  which  the  hacker  has  a  ”zero-day”  exploit,  the 
hacker  must  roll  a  4,  5,  or  6  to  succeed. 

If  the  computer  is  owned  by  another  hacker,  the  attacker  must  ﬁrst  roll  using  the  above  rules. 

If  successful,  the  attacker  and  defender  then  have  a  roll-oﬀ  to  determine  who  gets  the  computer. 

The  roll-oﬀ  rules  are  as  follows: 
∗	 The  defending  hacker  can  spend  up  to  the  amount  of  CPU  on  the  defending  computer  to 
get  one  die  roll  per  CPU.  This  CPU  cannot  be  used  on  the  defending  hacker’s  next  turn.  If 

the  defending  computer  has  a  ﬁrewal l(s)  installed  on  it,  the  defending  player  can  choose  to 

discard  a  number  of  these  ﬁrewalls  to  gain  a  corresponding  number  of  extra  dice  rolls. 
∗	 The  attacking  hacker  can  spend  up  to  the  amount  of  CPU  on  any  computers  she  owns  that 
neighbor  the  defending  computer  to  get  a  single  die  roll  per  CPU.  Note  that  the  amount 

of  CPU  the  attacking  hacker  can  spend  cannot  exceed  the  amount  of  CPU  they  have  left 

for  their  turn.  Whoever  gets  the  higher  total  for  all  dice  rolls  wins  the  roll-oﬀ  and  gets  the 

computer.  If  the  defending  hacker  no  longer  has  any  computers,  she  is  out  of  the  game. 

If  a  hacker  has  gained  a  new  computer  on  this  turn,  she  can  take  a  number  of  CPU  beans  equal 

to  the  amount  of  CPU  on  the  computer  she  just  acquired.  These  CPU  beans  may  not  be  used 

until  the  next  turn.

4  Turn  cheat  sheet 

At  the  beginning  of  each  round,  remove  any  DDOS  or  Firewall  tokens  placed  last  turn. 

Here’s  what  you  can  do  during  a  turn  and  how much  CPU  it  costs: 

•	 Research  Exploit  –  Cost:  Same  as  the  amount  you  wish  to  research. 

•	 Research  Patch  –  Cost:  Same  as  the  amount  you  wish  to  research. 

•	 DDOS  Attack  –  Cost:  Twice  as  much  CPU  as  the  target  computer 

•	 Install Rootkit – Cost:  The amount of CPU on  target  computer + 2 CPU  for  every additional die  roll. 
Rolls  for  successful  install: 

–	 Completely  protected  computer:  6 

–	 Exploited  computer:  6,  5 

–  Zero-day  exploited  computer:  6,  5,  4


Combat  rules:


1.  Attacker chooses number of CPU used for die rolls (1 die roll/CPU, up to the number of computers 

ﬂanking  the  defending  computer). 

2.  Defender chooses the number of CPU used for die rolls (1 die roll/CPU, up to the amount of CPU 

on  the  defending  computer +  extra  die  rolls  if  ﬁrewalls  are  discarded  from  defending  computer.). 

3.  Both  hackers  roll  (if  neither  wants  to  roll  ﬁrst,  defender  rolls  ﬁrst) 

4.  Hacker  with  higher  total  wins  the  computer
