***** First Assignment: Card Game *****
Design a simple competitive or cooperative card game using only a deck of
identically-sized cards (no tokens, dice, variations in card sizes, etc.) that
can be set up and played between 5 minutes and 10 minutes. Design your cards to
emphasize legibility, clarity, and ease-of-use. Visual artistry may be
appreciated but will not be graded. We encourage using tools that speed up
iteration. You only need to design and test the game for a fixed number of
players: two, three, or four players. If your game accommodates different-sized
groups, state any rule changes necessary.
To complete the assignment, you must design and provide a hardcopy deck of
cards. Submissions will not be returned to students after grading but will be
made accessible in the GAMBIT Game Lab for future classes. You must also upload
PDF copies of your game rules and cards to the course website. Scans of your
cards are perfectly acceptable; provide color scans if your cards have color.
Rules should be properly typed and formatted.

***** Second Assignment: Board Game *****
Design a board game that adapts or abstracts some real-world system of your
choosing, e.g. a nuclear reactor, a black market, global climate, high school
popularity, MIT. Your game must be playable by two or four players. State any
rule changes necessary for different-sized groups. New players need to be able
to set up, learn, and complete your game under 45 minutes. Players already
familiar with your rules should be able to complete a full session in under 30
minutes. Design your game bits to emphasize legibility clarity, and ease-of-use
Visual artistry may be appreciated but will not be graded. Be prepared to
announce the system you have chosen by the first Internal Mechanic Playtest.
To complete the assignment, you must select, design, and provide all the
necessary game bits to play your game. Submissions will not be returned to
students after grading but will be made accessible in the GAMBIT Game Lab for
future classes. You must also upload PDF copies of your game rules, game board,
and any custom cards to the course Web site. Scans of your board and cards are
perfectly acceptable; provide color scans if your cards have color. Rules
should be properly typed and formatted. Include a list of all the game bits and
props used by your game.

***** Third Assignment: Game For A Client *****
Design a game that can be set up and played between 20 minutes and 40 minutes.
You will be given a client who needs a game designed to fulfill certain
requirements that will be provided at the beginning of the assignment. The game
could be a card game, board game, live-action game etc. (The game should not
require significant athletic activity; keep it safe for all participants
involved.) The game will be played in a single classroom. This session may be
recorded on video. You will have to host/GM a session of your game, live,
during the last day of classes. The intent is to provide a game that the client
could host/GM themselves.
To complete the assignment, you must select, design, and provide any necessary
game bits or props to play your game. You may use prototyping materials
available in the GAMBIT Game Lab. Submissions will not be returned to students
after grading but will be made accessible in the GAMBIT Game Lab for future
classes. You must also upload PDF copies of your game rules and printed
materials to the course website. Include a list of all the game bits and props
used by your game.
