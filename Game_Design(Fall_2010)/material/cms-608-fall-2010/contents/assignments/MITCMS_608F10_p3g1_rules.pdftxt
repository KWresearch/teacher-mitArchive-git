Patience with Patients 

Introduction: 
This game is about giving doctors experience in dealing with anger in mental 
illness patients. One player will be a doctor new to the hospital and another 
player will be a long-term patient; additionally, there will be a third player acting 
as the Game Master, whose role is to act as an arbitrator in the game. The 
doctor is visiting the patient because of a recent situation at the hospital; both 
players want the situation resolved with the patient happy, but they need to 
reach common ground before they can agree on a solution. Additionally, the 
patient has a personality based on his or her past which the doctor doesn’t 
know at the start of the game. The goal is to resolve the situation before security 
arrives and restrains the patient. 

Players: 
This game is for 3 players, a doctor, a patient, and one Game Master (GM). 

Materials: 

● 15 Patient Action cards. These can be played by the patient to affect the game. 
● 15 Doctor Action cards. These can be played by the doctor to affect the game. 
● 18 Word Constraint cards used for constraining responses. 
● 6 Patient character sheets. These describe the personality and background of 
a patient in the hospital. 
● 6 Patient situation cards, each with a description of the situation. 
● An Unguessable Words sheet containing words which cannot be guessed 
during the game 

You Will Also Need: 

● 3 blank sheets of paper (one “conversation sheet” and two “guess sheets”) 
and pens to write down your responses. 
● A 2 minute timer. 
● Some sort of counter (such as a 6 sided die) to keep track of the escalation 
level. 
● Some sort of counter (such as a 12 sided die) to keep track of the number of 
responses. 

Game Setup: 
Shuffle the Word Constraint deck and the two Action card decks separately, and 
place them within reach of each player. The patient randomly chooses a patient 
character sheet and shows it to the GM. The patient reads his or her character’s 
name aloud, but keeps his or her background secret from the doctor. The 
patient’s background constrains his or her answers for the rest of the game; his 
or her responses must align with his or her personality. The GM draws a 

situation card and reads out the description, which is written from the patient’s 
perspective, to both players. The escalation level of the encounter begins at 3; 
the GM should take note of the escalation level with some sort of counter. Each 
player draws two Action cards from their respective piles; these start in the 
players’ hands. The doctor starts play with the “conversation sheet” and each 
player takes a “guess sheet”. 

Action Cards: 
Each turn, one of the two players will draw an Action card, depending on the 
response given. Note that there are two decks of Action cards, one for the 
patient and one for the doctor. Each card has requirements describing when it 
can be used and an effect. A player may use up to one action card per 
response. If the player correctly incorporates the card’s requirements into his or 
her response (this is up to the discretion of the GM) and subsequently chooses 
to play the card after reading his or her response, the effect takes place and the 
card is put into the appropriate discard pile beside the corresponding action 
pile. Example: the patient has a “Getting Upset” card, and raises his or her voice 
in his or her response when talking about the anger that he feels. The GM 
decides this is sufficient to show that the patient is “Getting Upset” and allows 
the patient to play the card, which raises the escalation by 1. 

Escalation Level: 
The escalation level represents how emotionally charged the conversation is. It 
may be raised or lowered by playing action cards, or if the GM decides a turn of 
conversation is particularly emotive. The GM should keep track of the escalation 
level with some sort of counter which is visible to both players. Here is an 
example of what the conversation might be like at different escalation levels: 

0 and below: The doctor has forced the patient to be quiet, ending the 
conversation. The game enters the concluding phase as described in the 
“Ending the Game” section. 
1-2: This level of escalation means the patient is probably withdrawn because 
the doctor has calmed the patient or the doctor is in complete control of the 
conversation 
3-4: This level of escalation means the patient and the doctor are on even 
ground; neither is likely to give in to demands at this point, but are willing to 
agree on a joint solution. 
5-6: This level of escalation means the patient is very charged up and is 
displaying his or her emotions. He or she is much more likely to attack or 
threaten the doctor at this level. 
7 and up: The patient has made a move towards attacking the doctor, and the 
doctor has no hope but to call security; the game enters the concluding phase 
as described in the “Ending the Game” section. 

Playing the Game: 
On each turn, there is a responding Player and a listening Player. The players 

alternate turns as the responding player and the listening player (starting with 
the doctor as the responding player). The responding player has the 
conversation sheet and the listening player has their guess sheet. The 
responding player randomly selects 3 words from the word deck and chooses 1 
of them. The responding player then has 2 minutes to write a response to the 
current state of the game, which includes the situation, the conversation up to 
this point, the escalation, and the patient’s personality (in the case that the 
responding player is the patient). In addition, he or she must use the chosen 
word in his or her response. The responding player is encouraged to keep the 
conversation relevant and true to his or her character.  While the responding 
player is writing, the listening player secretly writes down 5 words on his or her 
guessing sheet that he or she believes the responding player will use in his or 
her response (note that these words cannot be from the included unguessable 
words sheet). 

After the 2 minutes are up, the responding player reads his or her response 
aloud. If the listening player matches any of the words in the response, he or 
she gets to draw an action card out of his or her action card pile. Different 
tenses of the same word count as one word; if the listening player guessed 
“talked” and the responding player used “talk”, the listening player gets to draw 
a card. Note that even if the listening player guessed more than one word, he or 
she gets to draw only one action card. 

The GM should keep track of the number of responses completed with some 
sort of counter which is visible to both players. 

If the GM decides that an end condition has been met, the game enters the 
concluding phase as described under “Ending the Game”. 

Game Master (GM) Rules: 
The GM’s job is to keep the game flowing smoothly (help shuffle word cards 
while the players are writing, etc), keep time during response writing, resolve 
any questions of whether an action card can be validly played, and to act as 
arbitrator in resolving the conclusion of the scenario. Additionally, the GM has 
the ability to change the escalation level as appropriate for any particularly 
emotional or calming responses. The GM’s arbitration is final and cannot be 
contested by the patient or the doctor. 

It is the GM’s responsibility to encourage the players to play within the spirit of 
the game, which means writing responses which respect the context of the 
scenario and the patient’s background, include all constraint words in 
responses, and take into account the effects of any action cards. If, in the GM’s 
opinion, a response fails to meet these criteria, the GM should point this out and 
award the other player an action card. The GM can and should use action cards 
as rewards and penalties depending on if players are roleplaying well. 

Ending the Game: 
The players stop writing responses when one of the following end conditions is 
met: 
● 12 responses have been written, regardless of how many each individual 
player made. This results in hospital security automatically arriving and 
restraining the patient, regardless of the responses up to this point. 
● The escalation level is at 0. This results in the patient no longer being 
agitated. 
● The escalation level is at 7. This results in the patient becoming too agitated 
for the situation to de-escalate and most likely becoming violent. 
● Doctor calls security through writing "I'm calling security" or the equivalent. 
This results in hospital security coming and restraining the patient. If the 
escalation level is high, the patient may become violent before security 
arrives. 
● Patient and doctor mutually decide that an acceptable compromise has been 
reached. 
● The GM decides that a players’ response has forced the conversation to a 
stopping point. 

After an end condition has been met, each player has one minute of concluding 
time to talk about what they feel outcomes for the patient and the doctor would 
be at this point, given the course of the responses. This discussion may be out 
of character; the players are simply talking about how the game went. The GM 
takes into account the summaries from the two players, along with their 
responses, and gives his or her final opinion on what they think the outcome of 
the situation would be. This concludes the game. 

Example of a Turn: 
Here is an example of a single turn within a game that is already in progress. 
The doctor and patient have responded to each other a few times and it is now 
the doctor’s turn to act as the responding player. The GM draws three words 
from the word deck. The doctor chooses the word “Room” from the three 
choices and shows it to the patient. The doctor then takes the response sheet, 
the GM sets the timer for two minutes, and the doctor begins writing his or her 
response. Here is the doctor’s response: 

Doctor: I’m going to have to ask you to stay in your room for the time being. We 
have to wait just so we can be sure this behavior is not going to repeat itself. 
What can I do to make sure this doesn’t happen again? I want to be a facilitator 
in this process. 

The patient, acting as the listening player, wrote these words on his or her 
guess sheet: father, childhood, home, stay, and house. Since the doctor 
included the word “stay” in his or her response, the patient gets to draw an 
action card this turn. However, the GM decides that the Doctor’s response was 
especially calming and rewards the doctor by lowering the escalation level by 

one. This turn is now over and on the next turn the patient will be the 
responding player.
