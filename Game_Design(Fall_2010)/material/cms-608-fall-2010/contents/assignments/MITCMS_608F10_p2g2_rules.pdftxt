Tough Luck, Dodo

Overview: 
  Each player controls many creatures of a similar species that are evolving
over time to ﬁll the same ecological niche in a variety of environments.
Creatures gain mutations that determine what resources they need to consume
to survive and reproduce. As creatures reproduce, their offspring gain
mutations. Each environment poses a different set of resources which your
creatures must compete for to become the dominant species. The goal of the
game is to have two creatures fully suited for their environment. 

Components: 
·  18 environment cards (large cards)
·  120 mutation blocks (40 red, 40 yellow, 40 green)
·  100 creature bases (25 white, 25 orange, 25 pink, 25 blue)
·  12 tokens (small cards)
·  4 colored dice 
·  1 Active Player Token 
Creatures:
 Creatures are comprised of a single creature base and one or more
mutation blocks. The color of the creature base indicates which player controls
the creature. The mutation blocks indicate which resources the creature needs 
to consume to survive. 
(E.g. A creature consisting of a brown base, two red blocks and a green block is
owned by the brown player and requires two red resources and one green
resource every turn to survive.) 
Setup: 
·For 2 players, randomly choose 6 environments and arrange them in a 2 x 3
grid. For 3-4 players, randomly choose 9 environments and arrange them
in a 3x3 grid. The colored squares on the environment cards represent
the number and type of resources that are available in that environment.
·Each player:
·  Chooses a creature base color (white, brown, pink, blue)
·  Starts with exactly three creatures, each of which has a single
mutation block of a different color attached to a creature base. 
·  Starts with three tokens (Competitive Advantage, Famine, and
Relocation), one of each, placed face up in front of him or her.
·By whatever method you like, choose a player to take the Active Player
token ﬁrst.

·Starting with the active player and progressing in a clockwise order, each
player places one of their three creatures onto an environment until all
creatures are in play. Any number of creatures may occupy the same
environment. 
Turn Order: 
A turn consists of four phases: the Token Phase, Migration Phase,
Consumption Phase, and Reproduction Phase. Before moving to the next phase,
all players must complete the current phase. Once all players complete the
Reproduction Phase, pass the active token clockwise to the next player. 
1. Token Phase: 
·  Each player, starting with the active player and moving clockwise, may
play up to one of their tokens. Once a token is used, it is ﬂipped over
and cannot be used again for the rest of the game.
·  Token types:
·  Competitive advantage: Place this token under a creature. That
creature consumes resources before any other creature this turn. If
two or more creatures have Competitive Advantage, ties are broken
by normal consumption phase order.
·  Famine: Choose any two resources from any single environment.
Cover their square with the black squares for the remainder of the
turn. These covered resources may not be consumed by any
creature this turn. 
·  Relocation: Choose any creature (not necessarily your own) and
move it to any environment. That creature may not be Relocated
again during this Token Phase. 
2. Migration Phase: 
·  Starting with the active player and going clockwise, each player may
move one of their creatures into an environment sharing an edge with
the one it is in. Repeat three times. A creature may only be moved
once in this way in a turn. 
3. Consumption Phase: 
·  A creature can only (and must) consume resources if there are
resources available in the environment it occupies equal to its
mutations. If a creature cannot consume all the resources it requires,
it consumes no resources, dies and is removed from the board.
(E.g.: a creature with two green mutations and a single yellow
mutation must consume two green resources and a yellow resource to
survive.)
·  Once a resource is consumed, it may not be consumed by any other

creature this turn. 
In each environment, creatures consume resources in the following
order: 
1.  Any creatures that have Competitive Advantage this turn consumes
resources ﬁrst. If there are two more, ties are broken by the normal
consumption phase order.
2.  The creature with the greatest number of mutations. Ties are won
by the active player, or the player sitting closest clockwise to the
active player. If the same player controls two creatures that are
tied, the player chooses which creature consumes resources ﬁrst.
3B. Capture Phase:

·	
If there is any environment in which a single creature consumes all of
the available resources, that environment is now captured by that
player. The environment is ﬂipped over with the capturing creature
still placed on it to denote that it has been captured. No creatures may
move through a captured environment, and the capturing creature no
longer migrates, consumes or reproduces.
·	 An environment can be captured even if it is under the inﬂuence of a
Famine token. 
4.  Reproduction Phase: 
·  All creatures who consumed now reproduce. Assemble a new child
creature identical to each creature that is reproducing. For each, roll a
die; based on the color of your roll, add an additional mutation to the
child creature. Place the child creature into its parent's square. 
Ending the game: If at the end of the Consumption Phase any player has
captured two environments, the game is over and the player with the most
captured environments wins. In the case of a tie, the winner is the player with
the most creatures on the board.
