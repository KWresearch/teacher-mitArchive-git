A Wizard Did It... 
! 
Once upon a time, there were two competing wizards. Both were freelancers, taking jobs from 
the highest bidder and sending Knights to do their dirty work. Because of their immense power, they 
were both invited to the Wizardʼs Guild. However, there wasnʼt enough room; thus they were put to a
challenge by the the White Mage. They were to send a knight to the Castle to rescue the Princess,
earning points along the way both for accomplishing impressive feats as well as having the most
valorous Knight. You are one of those wizards. 

Overview: As a Wizard, you will put down encounters for your Knight to defeat while also trying to
have your opponentʼs Knight lose to the monsters they encounter. Your knight will ﬁrst go into The 
Forest, travel into The Crypt, and cross a river on The Pirate Ship in a race to reach the Castle and 
rescue the Princess. Along the way, you will be attempting to achieve goals for more points, which will
help you get into the guild. There are two phases to the game. First, the Wizard phase, where you lay
down encounters for both Knights. Second, the Knight phase, where your Knight runs through the
encounters in a rush to reach the Princess ﬁrst. Thus you have a choice to make: will you focus on
making the other Knight lose or will you play helpful cards on your Knight? 

Objective: Your objective is to have the most goal points at the end of the Knightʼs Phase. Once both 
Knightʼs have reached the Castle, count up the goal points and see who won. Each Valor Point your 
Knight has at the end of the game is worth 1 goal point, the Princess is worth 4 goal points, and each 
goal is worth the number of goal points written on the back. The Wizard with the most goal points gets 
to join the Guild! 

If this is your ﬁrst time playing, we recommend you skip the setup, read the rules for the Knightʼs 
Phase, and play through the Knightʼs Training. After you have played through the Knightʼs Training, 
set up the game. 

Setup: Sitting opposite of your opponent, place the following cards in front of you, in order: The 
Forest, The Crypt, The Pirate Ship. Your opponent does the same. Place the Princess on top of The 
Castle between both of your Pirate Ships. You will be creating stacks of cards next to each of the six 
location cards (the Castle is not a location card). Shufﬂe each type of card (the goals worth 2, 4, and 
6 points are different types). Deal two 2 Point goals, one 4 Point goal and one 6 Point goal to each 
wizard. The Wizards place these next to the location cards and read them aloud. Each Wizard is dealt
5 Stack Cards, and the rest are set aside face down in the Stack Card deck. See the next page for an 
illustration of the setup. 

This is how the board should look at the beginning of the game, after setup:

This is how the game should look like after the Wizardʼs Phase (note that the stacks next to the
locations may not be the same): 

When playing A Wizard Did It... the players set up the Knightʼs Phase during the Wizardʼs Phase. To 
make the outcomes of decisions made during the Wizardʼs Phase clear, we will ﬁrst run through the 
rules governing the Knightʼs Phase. We recommend that you play through the Knightʼs Training after 
reading about the Knightʼs Phase 
The Knightʼs Phase 
The Knightʼs Phase is played in turns. Each turn, your knight ﬁghts one encounter (if there are
! 
some on top of the current stack), collects loot, and earns Valor Points if he killed any monsters. A
Knight begins the game with 1 Valor Point. The Player who played the last card in the Wizardʼs Phase 
plays second in the Knightʼs Phase. If a location has no cards on it, you do not need to spend a turn 
there. 
Encounters: an encounter is a set of purple cards (monsters and monster modiﬁers) drawn off the 
top of the current stack (there may be stacks next to each Location Card, i.e. The Forest, The 
Crypt, and The Pirate Ship), ending in a red card (an item) or the bottom of the stack (the end of the 
location). 
Thus on your turn, you:
1. Draw cards off the top of the current stack (the ﬁrst non-empty stack on your path to the Castle)
until you draw an item. If you draw any blue cards (stack modiﬁers), follow the directions on the card 
and discard it (see Stack Modiﬁer Section). The end of the encounter is the ﬁrst item card drawn or 
the end of the stack. If there are no cards in any of your stacks, you have reached the Castle! Take 
the Princess card if you are the ﬁrst one there, or end the game if you are second. 
2. Resolve the encounter 
I. Add all the strength of the monsters. Note that each location has an effect on encounters 
(Bears in The Forest are more powerful, etc), and that certain encounters pair together to 
make stronger monsters (a Bear-Shark is worth 4 instead of 2; note that cards must be paired, 
i.e. a Bear-Shark Bear is only worth 5, since the second Bear has nothing to pair with). Note 
that for the purposes of goals, monster modiﬁers apply to all monsters in the encounter (one 
With Laser Beams gives all monsters in the encounter laser beams but only adds one strength 
total).
II. Add all of your Knightʼs strength, which is a sum of your items bonuses and your Valor 
Points (only count items you currently have equipped that you have previously won in an 
encounter).
III. If the monsters have more combined strength than you do, you lose. Otherwise you win
(this means you win ties). 
3. If you won the encounter, take a Valor Point and any item the monsters were protecting (there may 
not be one if the encounter ended by the end of the stack). If you lost the encounter, discard one
Valor Point (never discard your last Valor Point). 
4.If there were no monsters (even if there were monster modiﬁers), you take the item but donʼt gain 
any Valor Points. 
5. You equip any item you earned (you can equip any number and combination of items)
6. After an encounter, discard all the cards in the encounter (other than items you have equipped) and
pass the turn. If you reached the end of a stack, your next turn begins in the next non-empty location 
stack (or youʼve reached the Princess and you can patiently await the arrival of the other Knight).
7. If you lost an encounter this turn, pass the play to the other Knight. Otherwise, take another turn. 
Note that after resolving an encounter or a stack modiﬁer, if either Wizard accomplished any goals,
he/she ﬂips them over. 
The game ends when both Knights have reached the Castle. 

Wizardʼs Phase 
! 
The Wizardʼs phase is also played in turns. Each turn, a Wizard plays a stack card face up on
a stack. There exists one stack next to each location card. A Wizard can play on any of the six 
stacks (his own or his opponentʼs). 
! 
The Wizard with the longest beard plays ﬁrst (ties are resolved with the infamous Wizard
! 
game, rock paper scissors). 
" 
Remember, the Wizardʼs phase is played ﬁrst, and sets up the encounters for the Knightʼs 
phase. 
! 
On your turn, you play one stack card face up on a stack. The only exception is the Swap card;
which is a spell that gets played once then discarded (it does not go on a stack). You cannot play an 
item directly on top of another item (although playing a swap card or using stack modiﬁers may
accomplish the same thing, which is allowed). After playing a card, draw another card from the Stack 
Card deck (if there are any left). The Wizardʼs phase ends when every stack card has been played. 
You may only look at the top card in each stack. 
! 
Goals are only resolved in the Knightʼs Phase. 
" 

Goals and Goal Points: 
At the beginning of the game, each player receives four goal cards. These cards remain face 
! 
up unless they are accomplished during the Knight's Phase. Some goals apply to your own Knight,
some to your opponent's Knight, and some to either. Goals are accomplished only by the resolution of 
a stack modiﬁer or by the conclusion of an encounter. You get goal points at the end of the game
(speciﬁed on the back of the card) for each goal you accomplish. You get 4 goal points if your Knight
reached the Princess ﬁrst. You gain 1 goal point for each Valor Point your Knight ended the game
with.  Remember, the player with the most goal points at the end of the game wins! 
Stack Modiﬁers: 
Stack modiﬁers are played on top of a stack and are resolved during the Knight's Phase. Whenever a
stack modiﬁer is drawn during the Knight's Phase, its effect happens immediately and it is discarded 
before another card is drawn. Remember, some goals depend on stack modiﬁers, so you should
check if any goals were accomplished after drawing a stack modiﬁer. 
Note that goals that depend on stack modiﬁers use the card as a verb: 
•  When an In Space is resolved, any discarded cards are now In Space for the purposes of any
goals. 
•  When a Lurking is resolved, any moved cards are now Lurking cards for the purposes of any goals. 
•  When a Surprise! is resolved, any moved cards are now Surprise! cards for the purposes of any
goals. 

Knight's Training, Encounter by Encounter 
" 
The goal of the Knight's Training is to help you understand the outcome of the cards
you will play during the Wizard's Phase. 
Setup: Place the Knight's Training stack next to the The Forest location card. Deal yourself the 
“Make a Lurking Pigeon” and “Encounter a Pigeon Wrapped in Bacon” goals. Give yourself 1 Valor 
Point. 
Follow the instructions for the Knight's Phase to play through the Knight's Training. This guide will 
detail what you should see and the outcome of what you will encounter. 
1.  You draw a Ninja and a Sword. You have 1 Valor Point and therefore 1 strength. The Ninja has 1 
strength. You win the battle. You gain a Valor Point and take the Sword. 
2.  You draw a Shark, a With Laser Beams (1), a Kung Fu, and a Shield. The Shark With Laser 
Beams does Kung Fu, so you can only use your Valor  to defeat it. You have 2 Valor  and therefore 
2 strength. The Kung Fu Shark With Laser Beams has 2 strength. You win the battle. You gain a 
Valor Point and take the Shield. 
3.  You draw a Lurking card. Take the next 2 cards (Wrapped in Bacon and Pigeon) and put them at 
the bottom of the stack (preserve their order). Flip over the “Make a Lurking Pigeon” goal, it is 
completed.
4.  You draw an In Space (1) card. Take the next card (a Force Field) and discard it. 
5.  You draw a Bear, a Wrapped in Bacon, and a Pigeon card. You have reached the end of the stack. 
The encounter has 2 strength because the Bear is in The Forest. You win the battle. You gain a 
Valor Point because the Wrapped in Bacon bonus cancels out the Pigeon penalty. Flip over the 
“Encounter a Pigeon Wrapped in Bacon” goal, it is completed. 
At the end of the training, you have 8 goal points: 2 from each goal you completed and 4 Valor Points. 
Notes: The ﬁrst card played in a stack during the Wizard's Phase will be the last drawn from that 
stack during the Knight's Phase. 

Wizard's Phase Summary
1.  Play a stack card face up on top of any stack or play a swap card. Announce out loud what you
are playing. You may not play an item on top of another item. 
“Suprise!”, “Lurking” or “Swap” cards may later result in an item being on top of another item. This is 
allowed. 
2.  Draw a card. 
Do not mark any goal as completed until the Knight's Phase. 

Knight's Phase Summary 
1.  Draw from the ﬁrst non-empty stack closest to you until you draw an item or reach the end of the 
stack. Follow the instructions on any stack modiﬁer you draw when you draw it. 
! 
If you did not draw a monster before drawing an item or reaching the end of the stack, discard 
the cards you drew, take the item (if any), and repeat step 1. 
2.  Fight! See “Resolving an Encounter”. 
3.  Did you win? 
No? Shame! Lose 1 Valor Point and end your turn. Discard all cards you drew including the item. 
Never go below 1 Valor Point. Check to see if any goals were completed. Pass the turn to the 
next Knight. 
! 
Yes? Equip the item. Gain 1 Valor Point, plus one extra Valor Point for every Wrapped in Bacon,
and minus one Valor Point for every Pigeon. You can never lose Valor Points for winning an 
encounter. Check to see if any goals were completed. Take another turn – go back to step 1.

Resolving an Encounter – A Summary 

Encounters: 
The Encounter consists of all the monster and monster modiﬁer cards you drew before drawing an 
item or hitting the end of the stack. 
Calculating your Strength: 
If the monster does Kung Fu, your strength is equal to the number of Valor Points you have. 
Otherwise your strength is equal to the number of Valor Points you have plus the bonuses awarded 
by items you have won in previous encounters. Do not take into account the item you are ﬁghting for. 
Calculating the encounter's Strength: 
1.  Pair up all the combo encounters. These are worth 4 strength each.
2.  Every lone monster except Pigeons is worth 1 strength each. 
3.  For every monster on their home turf, add 1 strength.
4.  Add 1 or 2 strength (speciﬁed on the card) for every With Laser Beams card present with the 
monsters. 
Combo Encounters:!! 
Pirate-Ninja! ! 
! 
Bear-Shark!
