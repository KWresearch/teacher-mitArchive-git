WRITING AND READING PROFILE 
 
Due Tuesday, September 13 
 
 
As a starting point for the semester, I’d like you to spend some time thinking and writing about 
yourself as a writer and reader.  In other words, I’d like you to compose a profile or portrait of yourself as 
a reader and writer, including your reading and writing history and habits.  This is the time to tell me, 
please, if you have, or think you have, any particular problems or difficulties with reading or writing.  I 
would also like to know if English is not your first language. 
 
 
Here are some questions to get you started; feel free to include any other information you think 
important.   
 
 
What do you remember about being taught to write or being asked to write in school?  What were 
your writing successes, pleasures, problems, or confusions?  What memorable things, positive or 
negative, have people said to you about your writing?  What feelings are associated for you with your 
memories of learning to write or with the activity of writing?  What role does writing play now in your 
life, and what are your present attitudes about writing?  What has your experience with writing at MIT 
been like so far (if you are not a first-year student)?  What goals do you have for yourself as a writer, for 
this course and for the future?   
 
 
Now think about the process you go through whenever you face a writing task.  What kinds of pre-
writing activities do you engage in—reading, jotting, note-taking, daydreaming, procrastinating, 
munching, meditating, jogging, napping, preparing a place to write, gathering writing materials, talking 
with friends or colleagues about the writing you are about to do and your ideas for it?  What sort of 
materials or surroundings do you prefer when you write?  Do you draft in longhand or at a keyboard?  Do 
you write successive drafts and revise heavily, or do you produce a more nearly finished version as you 
go along?  Do you re-read your writing, silently or aloud, during the process of composing?  What 
reference guides do you usually use—handbook, dictionary, thesaurus, spell checker?  Where do you go 
for advice or response to your writing? 
 
 
Are you a reader?  Do you read for pleasure?  What kinds of reading do you most enjoy?  What do 
you remember as the best book you ever read?  Do you have a favorite writer whose work you have read a 
lot?  Have essays been part of your reading repertoire? 
 
 
Finally, I’d like to know what led you to take this course.  What are your expectations of the 
course, of me, of yourself, of other students?  What do you hope to learn in your semester of Writing and 
Reading the Essay? 
 
 
Your (typed, please) profile of yourself as a reader and writer is due in class on Tuesday.  We’ll 
talk about some excerpts (anonymous) in class next Thursday.  I look forward to reading what you write.
