THE READER'S NOTEBOOK 

 
 
 
 
To become an accomplished writer of essays you must read essays, not only for the pleasures 
which this particular form holds for readers, but also to learn about the range and texture and scope of 
this kind of writing, to see what writers have done with it, and, I hope, to be inspired with possibilities 
for your own writing.  Part of your work for the semester, then, will be to read a great many essays and 
to respond to what you read in writing.  
 
I will expect roughly a page or so (a little less, a little more) of typewritten response to each 
 
piece you read.  If you want to combine responses to two or three selections because of subject matter or 
style or whatever, your combined response should be correspondingly longer.  Keep your notebook in a 
folder of some sort (no loose pages, please!), separate from class notes, handouts, the other writing 
you’ll be doing.  Keeping your responses on a disk also is a good way to make sure a lost notebook 
doesn't present serious problems at the end of the semester (but print out a hard copy regularly—I won’t 
accept a disk submission).  I expect your responses to be informal, speculative, reflective of careful 
reading, and written in a spirit of critical questioning and exploration.   
 
Your responses should begin with a full bibliographic citation at the top of the page.  Then 
 
you should begin with a concise summary of what you’ve read (just a few sentences), then note or quote 
any passages that you found particularly striking or memorable (with parenthetical page citations), state 
what you understand to be the writer's point--the idea or motive which gives the piece shape and force—
and speculate on how the piece might be useful to you in your own writing.  Of course I'm interested to 
know whether you enjoyed the reading or not, and why.  You are also welcome and encouraged to refer  
to other things you've read by way of comparing or contrasting the piece you are writing about with 
others. 
 

I will collect notebooks for a quick review regularly but randomly; please bring your notebook 
with you to each class meeting.  
 
 
My hope is that keeping the notebook will deepen and enrich both the reading and writing you'll 
do in the weeks ahead, and that it will help you in your efforts to become a better writer.
