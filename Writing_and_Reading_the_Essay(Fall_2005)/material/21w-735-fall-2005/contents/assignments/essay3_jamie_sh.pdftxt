Return of the Traditionalists?: Elite University Women’s Choice 
 

 
Smart, ambitious and driven.  Those three words probably best describe today’s 

young women.  Raised by the first generation of Supermoms (women who not only had 

families but also careers), gender inequality is not something familiar to them.  From a 

very young age, they are encouraged to participate and excel in traditionally non-female 

fields across academics and athletics. 

I remember there was a popular Nike advertisement featuring Mia Hamm and 

Michael Jordan a few years ago.  The slogan was “anything you [Michael Jordan] can do, 

I [Mia Hamm] can do better.”  The advertisement showed snapshots of Mia Hamm and 

Michael Jordan playing different sports and in every snapshot, she was portrayed to be a 

step ahead of him.  That’s exactly the kind of attitude today’s young women have grown 

up with: anything guys can do, we can do just as well, maybe even better.  Giving up just 

isn’t part of our vocabulary. 

Numbers speak for themselves.  At Harvard University, the number of female 

students in the freshman class exceeded that of male students in 2001.  At the  

Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a traditionally male-dominated research institute, 

about 50 percent of its freshman class are female students.  It’s a national trend—more 

female students are seeking higher education.  It does not stop there.  The number of 

female students in professional and graduate degree programs are on the rise as well.  It’s 

not an unusual thing anymore to meet a female professor in engineering or a female

executive. 

I was also raised with this “anything they [guys] can do, I can do better” slogan.  I 

have been a great follower of the trend.  I went to a math and science magnet school and I 

am due to graduate with a degree in Economics from MIT.  With a degree from an “elite” 

institution, I plan on going into something more competitive, fast-paced and male-

dominated: the corporate world.  Like many other students with background in 

Economics or Finance, my choice of industry is investment banking: prestigious, 

notorious for the workload, and predominantly male—historically and concurrently 

across all levels.   

Until I started interviewing, I did not fully realize how male the industry is.  In the 

recruiting process, I met more than a handful of interviewers—mostly junior to mid-level 

professionals in the industry.  And only two of them were female; both first-year analysts, 

only one year senior to me.  As I sat in the waiting area of the Career Services Center 

waiting for my interviews, I looked around the room.  The gender ratio seemed pretty 

even, at least on the recruit level.  If it starts out pretty even, close to 50:50, what 

happened to those “missing” women in mid-level management?  If they grew up as 

ambitious and driven, where are they now, 10 years after graduation?  Has “giving up” 

become part of their vocabulary once they left school? I wondered. 

In late September this year, I ran across an interesting article from the New York 

Times that answered my initial question but also raised more questions.  After reading 

“Many Women at Elite Colleges Set Career Path to Motherhood” by Louise Story, the 

mystery was solved: the missing women are at home with children.   

“My mother’s always told me you can’t be the best career woman and the best 
mother at the same time,” Ms. Liu said matter-of-factly.  “You always have to 

 

2

choose one over the other.” 
 
There was the answer to my previous question.  Because a choice had to be made, 

women choose to stay home.  I did not like the answer.  What about most fathers?  Are 

they passing up on opportunities to be the best dads in order to be the best professionals?  

Why is it a choice for women when it is not for men?  Is it really impossible to be the 

best parent and best professional at the same time?  It seemed to be against everything 

modern feminists had fought for.   

What’s more disturbing is that many young, smart women make the decision to 

significantly (and negatively) alter their career path even before starting their career.  

Story did a survey of Ivy League college women, and about 30 percent of women 

surveyed said they planned to leave the workforce while their children were young, while 

another 30 percent planned to work part-time.  Many students featured in Story’s article 

said that despite their high ambitions of earning advanced degrees and having high-

powered careers, they are planning on sacrificing their career to have a family.  Some 

may argue that there is no reason to be alarmed by what the survey is suggesting.  What 

one thinks when she is in her late teens and early twenties isn’t necessarily the best 

indicator for what she will do later in life.  However, it should be noted that expectations 

both reflect and influence the prevailing social and cultural norms related to gender roles. 

What’s causing these young smart women to make such important career decision 

without much hesitation?  Historically, women had to fight for the right to higher 

education and access to fulfilling careers.  When those are available, why are today’s 

young women walking away?  Were the efforts of modern feminists futile?  Altering 

one’s career is not a decision to be taken lightly.  A study done by Pamela Stone and Meg 

 

3

Lovejoy suggests that the cost of career interruption accounts for as much as one-third of 

the gender gap in earnings.  Despite the steep cost, women with higher education are out 

of the labor force at a rate roughly 3 times that of their male counterparts.  Many women 

are leaving the work force in their 30s, the prime time for their career development, 

despite their ambition and achievement.  It’s a loss not only for those women but also for 

the younger generation, whose expectations are heavily influenced by the cultural norm 

set by those ahead of them. 

In 1980, there was a similar article on the New York Times titled “Many Young 

Women Now Say They’d Pick Family Over Career.”  Over three-fourths of women then 

said mothers should either not work or only work part-time until their children were 5 

years old.  The majority of men agreed.  In Story’s survey, 25 years later, roughly 60 

percent of women answered that they are planning on altering their career for family.  

Only two participants in 2005 answered that they “expected their husbands to stay home 

with the children while they pursued their careers.”  Only two more answered that the 

decision would depend on whose career was furthest along.  Despite women’s 

achievement and the social changes that took place over the past 25 years, the landscape 

has not changed much. 

In Lovejoy and Stone’s study that took place in 2004, 60 percent of women that 

quit their flourishing careers said their husbands were one of the key influences on their 

decisions to quit.  Women in high-profile careers are likely to be with men in professional 

jobs much like their own, with long hours and extensive travel.  For this reason, many 

women feel a lack of support from their husbands.  “He always said to me, ‘You can do 

whatever you want to do.’ But he’s not there to pick up any load,” said Kristen Quinn in 

 

4

an interview with Lovejoy and Stone.  Despite the high-powered nature of their own 

careers, the majority of women do not explore the idea of their husbands cutting back.  

Instead, they implicitly accept that their own career was secondary.  Despite their 

previous proactiveness in academics and professions, women seem to be turning 

surprisingly passive.  They are more educated and living in a more progressive era, but 

those women are new traditionalists in a sense that they accept child rearing as women’s 

primary responsibility. 

Regardless of her success, a woman’s career is not taken as seriously in the 

society.  While it is unacceptable for a man to interrupt his career even for a brief time 

period, it is almost expected for a woman.  For example, as Mary Blair-Loy and Amy S. 

Wharton point out in their study of working parents, men are extremely unlikely to take 

parental leaves, though it is officially available.  For women, a career is still seen as 

“something to play with” until she can replace it with children, while it is seen as source 

of lifetime satisfaction for men.  There’s a dissonance between what’s taught in school 

and what’s practiced outside of school.  In school (atheletics and academics), women are 

encouraged to explore and develop their abilities to full potential.  The support is 

disconnected once women march out the school gate with their diplomas.  As daughters, 

they were expected to live life to the fullest.  Once they become wives and mothers, their 

self-fulfillment becomes less important: they are expected to function as support roles 

only. 

Corporate culture is another factor shaping women’s decision to quit.  Women 

with elite educations pursue high-powered careers, which are often seen as “all or 

nothing.”  By nature, the work schedule is highly unpredictable, with last-minute 

 

5

business trips and unexpected late nights.  As an anonymous participant in Stone and 

Lovejoy’s study describes it, “high-tech work week is really sixty hours, not forty.”  

Many women are employed in settings where the pace and expectations were set by men 

with stay-at-home wives who handle everything outside of work.  Corporate culture has 

evolved to be less family-friendly.  The face time in the office is much longer than it used 

to be.  With thanks to improvement in transportation, business travel is much more 

frequent.  Even when parents are at home with children, they are never away from 

work—there are e-mails, cell phones, and blackberrys.  There’s no life outside of work.  

Work is life.  Due to the “all or nothing” nature of the work, many women view their 

options as either working forty-plus hours a week or quitting.   

There is an alternative. Between a forty-plus week job and a full-time motherhood, 

there is a part-time job.  By definition, it is an excellent idea.  Women can have both—a 

fulfilling career and a rewarding motherhood—at a certain price.  Unfortunately, it is not 

even an option for many professional women.  According to Stone and Lovejoy, 40 

percent of women who tried to reduce work hours were denied.  Even when one is lucky 

enough to work part-time, there is a dilemma.  Working part-time in jobs that were 

effectively full-time make many women feel inadequate.  The nature of having a part-

time career limits their career progression.  Working part-time is often seen as a sign of 

“lack of commitment” and they are excluded from more interesting and engaging work.  

Working part-time often does not meet their high standards and they end up putting in 

more hours.   

Is it really elite women’s “choice” to stay home?  Not if it is a forced decision.  

They are not making a free choice because they don’t have the kind of institutional 

 

6

arrangement and social understanding that would make a truly free choice possible.  

Structural support exists in name only.  A high-profile career has become more and more 

demanding, to a point if one wants to be successful, work must take up every single 

minute of one’s life.  Cutting back time or working flexible hours to spend time with 

children is seen as lack of commitment to one’s career.  There are parental leaves and 

dependent care programs supported by employers, but using those policies are often 

negatively correlated with one’s career progression.  Under such circumstances, having it 

all is actually halving it all: a stressful career that is going nowhere and “industrial-size 

helpings of maternal guilt,” as Katha Pollitt puts it in a column in The Nation.  Lack of 

institutional support is not the only obstacle women have to tackle.  There is also lack of 

emotional support from their partners and the society as a whole.  The society supports 

young girls to be ambitious and adventurous.  However, as they get older, the support is 

suddenly gone.  Instead, they are told by the society that their professional satisfaction 

and fulfillment are not that important.  Given the current lack of structural and emotional 

support, it is not surprising that professional women are exiting the labor force 3 times as 

fast as men.   

What about young women’s pre-planned career interruption?  Is that also a choice?  

Is that a well-thought-through decision?  It’s a well-informed, forced choice.  Women 

who make the decision are aware of the price they will have to pay under the current 

system if they want to have it all.  They are not neo-traditionalists.  They are just picking 

up mixed signals.  School and parents teach them that they can do anything they want to 

do but at the same time, they see the struggles of their alumnae, once ambitious and smart 

like themselves.  Their opinions are nothing new or surprising.  They are just reflecting 

 

7

the current cultural norm.  They are not to be blamed for giving up too early.  What’s to 

be blamed really is the inflexibility of the corporate culture and of the current gender 

roles in the family.
