ORAL PRESENTATION GUIDELINES 
 
 
 
On November 3 and 8, members of our class community will make oral 
presentations to the group. The presentations are to be based on your investigative essays, 
so you should be easily able to speak authoritatively on your subject.  Here are some 
guidelines for your presentation: 
 

(cid:131)  You should be prepared to speak for between 6 and 7 minutes.  I will time 
the presentations and stop you at 7 minutes. 
(cid:131)  You are welcome to use audio-visual tools, handouts, overheads, 
PowerPoint, or the blackboard as part of your presentation.  If you choose 
to show a video, the time the video takes must be part of your 6 to 7 
minutes.  And (need I say this?) the video should not take up a lot of your 
presentation time! 
(cid:131)  After you have addressed the group, we will have 3-4 minutes for 
questions and comments from the audience.  Be prepared to handle 
questions in a professional, authoritative manner. 

 

 
 
 

In preparing, you should PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!  At least 3 
times: once alone, once before a mirror, and once for a friend or two.   
 

TIME YOUR PRESENTATION WITH EACH PRACTICE so you know that 
you won’t exceed your time limit.  This is essential! 
 

Introduce yourself to your audience at the beginning of your presentation.  Look 
sharp.  Remember to make eye contact with the audience, to avoid “fillers” (um, uh, like, 
and so on), to speak naturally but to project your voice so you are sure to be heard, and 
to do whatever you can to present yourself as authoritative, interested and thoroughly 
prepared.  Be lively; be interesting; be informative. 
 

At the end of each presentation, you will get written feedback on your 
performance from everyone in the class.   
 

Steve Strang, Director of the Writing Center, is available to give you pointers and 
response on your presentation if you sign up in advance.  
 

Good luck, and let me know if you have questions.
