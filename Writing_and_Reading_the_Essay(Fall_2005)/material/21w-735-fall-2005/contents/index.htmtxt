***** Course Description *****
This is a course focused on the literary genre of the essay, that wide-ranging,
elastic, and currently very popular form that attracts not only nonfiction
writers but also fiction writers, poets, scientists, physicians, and others to
write in the form, and readers of every stripe to read it. Some say we are
living in era in which the essay is enjoying a renaissance; certainly essays,
both short and long, are at present easier to get published than are short
stories or novels, and essays are featured regularly and prominently in the
mainstream press (both magazines and newspapers) and on the New York Times
bestseller books list. But the essay has a history, too, a long one, which goes
back at least to the sixteenth-century French writer Montaigne, generally
considered the progenitor of the form. It will be our task, and I hope our
pleasure, to investigate the possibilities of the essay together this semester,
both by reading and by writing.
