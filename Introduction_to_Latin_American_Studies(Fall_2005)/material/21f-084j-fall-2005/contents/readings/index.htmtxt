Readings are also listed by session.
Weekly readings range from 75 to 130 pages, or about 100 pages on average.
Readings include articles from the popular press, literary works, and scholarly
research from the social sciences. Principal texts for the course include:
[Buy_at_Amazon] Winn, Peter. Americas: The Changing Face of Latin America and
the Caribbean. 2nd ed. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1995.
ISBN: 9780520201811.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Spooner, Mary Helen. Soldiers in a Narrow Land: The Pinochet
Regime in Chile. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1994. ISBN:
9780520080836.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Allende, Isabel. The House of the Spirits. New York, NY:
Everyman's Library, 2005. ISBN: 9781400043187.
[Buy_at_Amazon] Colburn, Forrest D. Latin America at the End of Politics.
Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002. ISBN: 9780691091815.
I strongly recommend that you purchase all of the above books, the third of
which was originally written in Spanish. (Feel free to buy and read it in the
original, if you prefer.)
If your first language is not English, you should still try to read the non-
literary works in English. For literary works (such as GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez and
Allende), however, please feel free to read them in the original.
Readings are normally due on the first day of class of the week in which they
are assigned. Where the first day is entirely occupied by a lecture, however,
you may wait until later in the week.
Many weekly readings are accompanied by videos or films, which are an integral
part of the course. Videos from the Americas series, produced in part by WGBH-
Boston, are one hour each. Please note that the film The Battle of Chile is
very long, so you should plan in advance appropriately.
