Hints for writing papers 

Stylistic hints 
1.  Avoid contractions in formal writing.  In informal writing, they’re OK. 

2.  Avoid the passive voice (e.g., “it was done to him”) where possible. 

3.	

In formal writing, never use the second person as a substitute for impersonal or general 
references.  Thus you should not write:  “living in a democracy makes you less likely to be 
arrested for political reasons”.  You might write instead: “Citizens in democratic societies are 
less likely to be arrested for political reasons.” 

4.	 Consider avoiding the first person singular.  If using that format, however, stick with it 
throughout.  Do not switch back and forth between impersonal presentation of your argument 
and the first person singular.  Thus, you could write:  “In the first section of this paper, I discuss 
the reasons for the collapse of Chilean democracy in 1973.  In the second section, I discuss 
how General Augusto Pinochet was able to consolidate a personalistic dictatorship.”  You could 
also write:  “The first section of this paper discusses the reasons for the collapse of Chilean 
democracy in 1973.  The second section describes how General Augusto Pinochet was able to 
consolidate a personalistic dictatorship.”  But you would not write:  “In the first section of this 
paper, I discuss the reasons for the collapse of Chilean democracy in 1973.  The second 
section describes how General Augusto Pinochet was able to consolidate a personalistic 
dictatorship.” 

The same point holds for the first person plural (“we”). 

5.	 “It’s” is a contraction of “it is”.  “Its” is the possessive of “it”.  As you will not be using 
contractions in formal writing, you won’t be using “it’s” ever. 

6.	 Do not use impersonal pronouns (e.g., it) when the referent is unclear or nowhere in sight.  The 
“it” should refer clearly to a specific noun used in the preceding clause, not to a general concept 
contained in the previous clause, nor to a specific noun two or more clauses away. 

Similarly, avoid using “this” and “that” as subjects or direct objects.  Thus, you would not write: 
“Dahl and other scholars have advanced the argument that democratization depends little on 
international influence. But this ignores important exceptions, such as Greece, Argentina, 
Taiwan, and the Eastern Europe.”  Instead, write:  “Dahl and other scholars have advanced the 
argument that democratization depends little on international influence. But this argument ignores 
important exceptions, such as Greece, Argentina, Taiwan, and the Eastern Europe.” 

7.	 Do not use “and/or”, as in “they fought for God and/or country”.  Instead, you might try “they 
fought for God, country, or both”. 

8.	 Be careful not to use “which” when you mean to use “that”.  Use “which” when the phrase or 
clause set off is parenthetical to noun it qualifies.  Thus, you would write: “U.S. pressure pushed 
the Salvadoran government toward democracy, which it probably would have favored in any 
case.”  By contrast, use “that” when the phrase or clause it introduces is integral to the noun 
described.  Thus you would write: “U.S. pressure pushed the Salvadoran government toward 
the kind of democracy that Salvadoran civilian leaders were already promoting.” 

9.	 Avoid using “while” in the place of “even though” or “although”, and an a mushy substitute for 
“but” and “and”. 

10. If your first language is not English, check for common mistranslations.  For instance, if you are 
a native speaker of Portuguese or Spanish change you should make sure to write “make 
decisions” instead of “take decision” and “soccer” instead of “futbol” or football”. 

11. Do not worry about split infinitives.  If Captain Kirk can do it (“to boldly go where no one has 
gone before”), so can you. 

12. If in doubt about style and grammar, consult Strunk and White or some similar volume. 

13. Always include page numbers on your papers. 

14. Spell check and proofread your paper before handing it in. 

15. If your footnotes are abridged or you are using the academic journal style of including citations 
in parentheses, be sure to include a list of references cited. 

Make sure the fo rmatting of you bibliography and references corresponds to one of the 
appropriate styles.  Stick with ONE style and use it throughout.  If in doubt about formatting 
issues, consult the Chicago Manual of Style. 

16. For your first paper, allow at least two hours after that paper is completely written to your 
satisfaction to go back through it and check to make sure that you have covered all these points. 
For subsequent papers, check through your paper both for these points and for any hints you 
have received on previous papers.
