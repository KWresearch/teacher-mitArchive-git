If you expect exactly the same problem on a later test:

then get answer and memorize.


If you have to transfer the knowledge to a related problem:

learn the schema - the model and the overview

e.g. 1-d kinematics for two bodies
Find applicable models 
e.g. uniform acceleration after t0

Does the solution seem reasonable? 

Units, special cases, scaling, reasonable? 
If it seems wrong, review whole process 
If it seems right, review the schema/pattern

GoalGoalGoal

 Learn how to use DataStudio and the 750 interface to measure  

position and velocity, with auto start & stop.


 Learn how to plot your measurements on a graph and to edit the data 
to make a subset of the original. 

 Fit a function to your data and learn about regression analysis and 
how to interpret the result. 

 Generally, this is to familiarize yourself with the tools we will use to 
make more sophisticated measurements and carry out a richer 
analysis of them than would be possible without the computer.

 Follow the instructions in the notes to set up the motion sensor to 
measure the position and velocity of your hand as you move it back 
and forth between two marks 30 cm (1 foot) apart. 

 Everyone in the group tries to move their hand so its position vs. time 
is a square, triangle and sine wave. 

 Look at the graphs of position and velocity and examine them to  

decide how well you did.

 Choose the best 5 sec (100 points) of sine wave data and use 
DataStudio’s Sine Fit function to get a quantitative measure of how 
close it is to a sine wave. 

 Report the properly normalized (see notes) Root MSE:  

(Root MSE / 10A) 


	 If you have time, experiment and have fun. Left hand vs. right hand, 
other motions, and so on. Use your imagination.
