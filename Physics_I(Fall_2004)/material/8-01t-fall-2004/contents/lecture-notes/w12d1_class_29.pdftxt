Statistical Mechanics and  

Thermodynamics

•  Thermodynamics Old & Fundamental 
–  Understanding of Heat (I.e. Steam) Engines 
–  Part of Physics Einstein held inviolate 
–  Relevant to Energy Crisis of Today 

•	 Statistical Mechanics is Modern Justification 
–Based on mechanics: Energy, Work, Momentum 
–Ideal Gas model gives observed thermodynamics 

•	 Bridging Ideas 
Temperature (at Equilibrium) is Average Energy 
Equipartition - as simple/democratic as possible 

Temperature and Equilibrium

•  Temperature is Energy per Degree of Freedom

–  More on this later (Equipartition) 

•	 Heat flows from hotter to colder object 
Until temperatures are equal 
Faster if better thermal contact 
Even flows at negligible ∆t (for reversible process) 

•	 The Unit of Temperature is the Kelvin 
Absolute zero (no energy) is at 0.0 K 
Ice melts at 273.15 Kelvin (0.0 C) 
Fahrenheit scale is arbitrary 

State Variables of System

•	 State Variables - Definition 
Measurable Static Properties 
Fully Characterize System (if constituents known) 
e.g. Determine Internal Energy, compressibility
Related by Equation of State 

•  State Variables: Measurable Static Properties

–  Temperature - measure with thermometer 
–  Volume (size of container or of liquid in it) 
–  Pressure (use pressure gauge) 
–  Quantity: Mass or Moles or Number of Molecules

•  Of each constituent or phase (e.g. water and ice) 

Equation of State

•  A condition that the system must obey

– Relationship among state variables 
•  Example: Perfect Gas Law 
– Found in 18th Century Experimentally

– pV  = NkT  = nRT

– K is Boltzmann’s Constant 1.38x10-23  J/K 
– R is gas constant  8.315 J/mole/K 
•  Another Eq. Of State is van der Waals Eq.

– You don’t have to know this. 

PV = n R T = N k T

•  P is the Absolute pressure 
–  Measured from Vacuum = 0 
–  Gauge Pressure = Vacuum - Atmospheric 
–  Atmospheric = 14.7 lbs/sq in = 105  N/m 

•  V is the volume of the system in m3

–  often the system is in cylinder with piston

–  Force on the piston does work on world


T,P,V,n 

Does work on   world 
P=0 outside

PV = n R T = N k T

chemists vs physicists


•  Mole View (more Chemical) = nRT 

– R is gas constant  8.315 J/mole/K 

•  Molecular View (physicists) = NkT 

– N is number of molecules in system 
– K is Boltzmann’s Constant 1.38x10-23  J/K 

Using PV=nRT 


•  Recognize: it relates state variables of a gas


•  Typical Problems 
–  Lift of hot air balloon 
–  Pressure change in heated can of tomato soup 
–  Often part of work integral 

Heat and Work are Processes


•	 Processes accompany/cause state changes 
– Work  along particular path to  state B from A 
–  Heat added along path to B from A 

•  Processes are not state variables

–  Processes change the state! 
–  But Eq. Of State generally obeyed 

Ideal Gas Law Derivation: 

Assumptions

•	 Gas molecules are hard spheres without 
internal structure 
•	 Molecules move randomly

•	 All collisions are elastic 
•	 Collisions with the wall are elastic and 
instantaneous 

Gas Properties

• nm  moles in volume 

•  m is atomic mass (12C = 12)

Motion of Molecules  

•	 Assume all molecules have 
the same velocity (we will 
drop this latter) 

•	 The velocity distribution is 
isotropic

Degrees of Freedom in Motion 


•	

Three types of degrees of freedom for 
molecule 

1.	 Translational

2.	 Rotational 
3.	 Vibrational 

•	

Ideal gas Assumption: only 3 translational 
degrees of freedom are present for molecule
with no internal structure
