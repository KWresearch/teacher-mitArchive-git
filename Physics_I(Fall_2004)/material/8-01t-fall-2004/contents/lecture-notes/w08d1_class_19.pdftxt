system. As the stone falls, the momentum
of the system 

1. increases in the downward direction. 
2. decreases in the downward direction.
3. stays the same.
4. not enough information to decide.

Modeling: External Forces and  

Conservation of Momentum

1.  Identify the objects that compose the system


2.  Identify your initial and final states of the 
system 

3.  Identify any external forces acting on the 
system 

4.  Decide whether momentum is conserved or not 
in each direction.

Draw a momentum diagram for the initial and final
states. 

a)  Choose symbols to identify each mass and 
velocity in the system. 

a)  Identify a set of positive directions and unit 
vectors for each state. 

c) 	 Decide whether you are using components or
magnitudes for your velocity symbols.

Class Problem 1: Acrobat and  

Clown

An acrobat  of mass 
m1  jumps upwards off
a trampoline with an
initial velocity v0  . At 
a height h0, the 
acrobat grabs a
clown of mass m2. 
Assume that the time 
the acrobat takes to 
grab the clown is
negligibly small. 

Problem 1: Acrobat and Clown  

(con’t) 

a)  What is the velocity of the acrobat immediately 
before grabbing the clown? 

b) What is the velocity of the acrobat immediately
after grabbing the clown? 

c) What high do the acrobat and clown rise?


d) If the acrobat had missed the clown, how high
would have the acrobat risen? 

PRS Question  


Suppose a golf ball is hurled at a heavy bowling ball
initially at rest and bounces elastically from the bowling
ball. After the collision, 

1.	 The golf ball has the greater momentum and  the 
greater kinetic energy. 
2. 	 The bowling ball has the greater momentum and  the 
greater kinetic energy. 
3.	 The golf ball has the greater momentum but has the
smaller kinetic energy. 
4.	 The bowling ball has the greater momentum  but has 
the smaller kinetic energy. 

Class Problem 2: Exploding  

Projectile

An instrument-carrying projectile of mass m1 
accidentally explodes at the top of its trajectory. The 
horizontal distance between launch point and the
explosion is x0. The projectile breaks into two pieces
which fly apart horizontally. The larger piece, m3, has
three times the mass of the smaller piece, m2. To the 
surprise of the scientist in charge, the smaller piece
returns to earth at the launching station. Neglect air
resistance and effects due to the earth’s curvature. 

Problem 2: Exploding Projectile  

(con’t)

a) What is the velocity of the projectile at the 

top of its flight just before the collision?

b) What is the velocity of the smaller piece 
just after the collision? 
c) What is the velocity of the larger piece 
just after the collision? 
d) How far away does the larger piece land 
from the station? 

PRS Question  

Consider the exothermic reaction (final kinetic energy is greater than 
the initial kinetic energy). 
H  + H  → H 2  + 5ev
Two hydrogen atoms collide and produce a diatomic hydrogen 
molecule. Using only the principles of classical mechanics, this 
reaction 

1. Is possible.
2. either violates conservation of energy or conservation of momentum 
but not both 
3. satisfies conservation of energy and momentum but is not possible 
for other reasons. 

 
Class Problem 3: Bouncing  

Superballs

•	 Two superballs are dropped from a height  
above the ground. The ball on top has a 
mass m1  . The ball on the bottom has a 
mass m2. Assume that the lower ball 
collides elastically with the ground. Then
as the lower ball starts to move upward, it
collides elastically with the upper ball that
is still moving downwards. How high will
the upper ball rebound in the air? Assume
that m2  >> m1. 

Hint: Problem 3: Bouncing  

Superballs

Consider this collision from an inertial 
reference frame that moves upward with 
the same speed as the lower ball has after 
it collides with ground. What speed does 
the upper ball have in this reference frame 
after it collides with the lower ball?
