We just measured the speed of light and 
found a value  c . Since the earth is orbiting 
around the sun, experimental apparatus is 
traveling around the sun with a speed 
approximately equal to 10  4 c . Consider an 
−
observer at rest with respect to the sun. 
Would that observer predict that the speed 
of light in the apparatus 

a) is greater than  c , 


b) the same as  c  , 


c) less than  c , 

d) depends on the orientation of the 
apparatus with respect to the earth’s motion 
around the sun.
