Newton’s Laws of Motion

Sept 20, 2004

Newton’s First Law

Every body continues in its state of rest, or 
of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is 
compelled to change that state by forces 
impressed upon it.

Newton’s Second Law

The change of motion is proportional to 
the motive force impresses, and is made 
in the direction of the right line in which 
that force is impressed.

Newton’s Third Law

To every action there is always opposed 
an equal reaction: or, the mutual action of 
two bodies upon each other are always 
equal, and directed to contrary parts.

Inertial Mass

•

inertial mass is a ‘quantity of matter’ 

• standard body with mass  ms and SI 
units [kg]

•

the mass of all other bodies will be 
determined relative to the mass of our 
standard body. 

• apply the same action (force)  to the 
standard body and an unknown body

• Define the unknown mass in terms of 
ratio of accelerations

Definition:  Momentum (Quantity 
of Motion)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
v
m=p
• Momentum is a vector quantity 

• Magnitude: product of the mass with the magnitude of 
the velocity 

• Direction:  the direction of the velocity

•

In the SI system of units, momentum has units

[kg-m-s-1]

Definition: Force
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
a
m≡F

• Force is a vector quantity. 

• Magnitude of the total force  acting on the object is 
the product of the mass and the magnitude of the 
acceleration .

• Direction of the total force on a body is the direction 
of the acceleration of the body. 

• SI units for force are    [kg-m-s-2]

• Unit  has been named the Newton   1 N = 1 kg-m-s-2

Force Law:  Newtonian Induction

• Definition of force has no predictive content 

• Need to measure the acceleration and the mass in order 
to define the force

• Force Law: Discover experimental relation between 
force exerted on object and change in properties of 
object

•

Induction: Extend force law from finite measurements to 
all cases within some range creating a model

• Second Law can now be used to predict motion!

•

If prediction disagrees with measurement adjust model.

Hooke’s Law

• Spring attached to a body 

• Stretch or compress spring by different amounts 
produces different accelerations 
(cid:71)
F

• Magnitude:

k l
= ∆

• Direction: restoring spring to equilibrium

• Model holds within some reasonable range of extension 
or compression

m1 and m2

• Direction: force points along the line connecting the 
bodies and is attractive 

• Magnitude: proportional to the product of the masses; 
and inversely proportional to square of the distance, r1,2 ,

Methodology for Newton’s 
Second Law
Understand  – get  a  conceptual  grasp  of 
the problem

Think about the problem.

Sketch the system at some time when the system is 
in motion. 

Choose a coordinate system and identify the position 
function of all objects.

Quantify the constraint conditions.

Draw free body diagrams for each body in the 
problem.

Draw  free  body  diagrams  for  each  body  in  the 
problem.

•

Include the set of unit vectors 

Each force represented by an arrow indicating the 
direction of the force 

Choose an appropriate symbol for the force 

Choosing directions for the forces

•

If you solve for a force and find that the force is 
negative then the force points in the opposite direction 
as your choice of direction for the force.

II. Devise a Plan (con’t)
Analyze whether you can solve the system of equations

•

•

•

•

Common problems and missing conditions. 

Constraint conditions between the components of the acceleration.

Action-reaction pairs. 

Different bodies are not distinguished

Design a strategy for solving the system of equations.

III. Carry Out your Plan

Hints: 

Use all your equations. Avoid thinking that one equation 
alone will contain your answer!

After you solve your equations of motion for the 
components of acceleration, you now may consider 
whether your kinematic models will help you solve the 
problem.

IV. Look Back

• Check your algebra

• Substitute in numbers

• Check your result

• Think about the result: solved problems become 
models for thinking about new problems.
