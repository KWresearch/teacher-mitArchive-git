1. Which of the following 
functions x(t) of the variable t 
have a second derivative which is 
proportional to the negative of 
the function 

d2x/dt2 ~  - x 
1.  x(t) = (1/2)at2 
2.  x(t) = Aet/T 
3.  x(t) = Ae-t/T 
4.  x(t) = Acos((2π/T)t) 


2.  The first derivative v = dx/dt of the 

sinusoidal function 
x(t) = Acos((2π/T)t) 

is: 

1.  v(t) = Acos((2π/T)t) 
2.  v(t) = -Asin((2π/T)t) 
3.  v(t) = - (2π/T) Asin((2π/T)t) 

4.  v(t) = (2π/T) Acos((2π/T)t) 


3.  A block of mass m  is attached to a 
spring and is free to slide along a horizontal 
frictionless surface. At t = 0 the block-spring 
system is stretched an amount x0 from the 
equilibrium position and is released from 
rest. What is the velocity of the block when 
it first comes back to the equilibrium? 

1.Veq = -x0T/4 

2.Veq = x0T/4 

3.Veq = - (k/m)1/2 x0

4.Veq = (k/m)1/2 x0


4. When the car maximally 
compresses the spring at the bottom 
of the track, the cart’s 

1. velocity and acceleration are zero 
2. velocity is nonzero but its 
acceleration is zero 
3. acceleration is nonzero, but its 
velocity is zero 
4. velocity and acceleration are both 
nonzero. 

5. Is the acceleration of the cart as it 
moves up the inclined plane, 

1. greater than 
2. equal to 
3. less than 

the acceleration of the cart as it moves 
down the inclined plane?
