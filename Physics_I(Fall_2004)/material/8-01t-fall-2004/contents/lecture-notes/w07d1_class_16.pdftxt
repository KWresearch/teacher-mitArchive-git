Conservative Forces


Definition: Conservative Work


Whenever the work done by a force in 
moving an object from an initial point to a 
final point is independent of the path, then 
the force is called a conservative force

Change in Potential Energy

Definition: Change in Potential Energy 


The change in potential energy of a body
associated with a conservative force is the 
negative of the work done by the
conservative force in moving the body 
along any path connecting the initial
position to the final position.

Definition: Non-conservative Work


Whenever the work done by a force in 
moving an object from an initial point to a 
final point depends on the path, then the 
force is called a non-conservative force.
