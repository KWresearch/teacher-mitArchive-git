Rigid Bodies

• external forces make the center of the 
mass translate 

• external `torques’ make the body rotate 
about the center of mass 

Center of Mass 

A rigid body can be 
balanced by pivoting 
the body about a 
special point known 
as the center of mass

Class Problem 1

Suppose a beam of length s = 1.0 m and mass 
m = 2.0 kg is balanced on a pivot point that is 
placed directly beneath the center of the beam. 
Suppose a mass m1 = 0.3 kg is placed a 
distance d1 = 0.4 m to the right of the pivot 
point. A second mass m2 = 0.6 kg is placed a 
distance d2 to the left of the pivot point to keep 
the beam static.

1. What is the force  that the pivot exerts on the 
beam?
2. What is the distance d2 that maintains static 
equilibrium?

equilibrium
equilibrium

Goal
When a weight is suspended by two strings in the center as shown in 
the photograph below, the tension is given as follows:

H

θθ

x

T

θθ

Mg

T
GoalGoal: Measure T for several 
values of θ using 
measurements of x, H
(fixed), to verify the 
equation above!

Setup
(cid:137) Align the right edge of the ruler with the 
center of a column of holes.
(cid:137) Maintain the same horizontal distance for 
all measurements.
(cid:137) A second string along the top marks the 
horizontal line between the two string 
support lines.
(cid:137) The vertical drop (x) from this line is what 
you have to measure to determine the 
angle θ.

(cid:137) Ensure string passes over pulley before all 
measurements.
(cid:137) Keep line of sight perpendicular to board to 
minimize parallax.

Setting DataStudio
(cid:137) Create a new experiment. Drag the force sensor to the interface in 
the Experiment Setup
Experiment Setup window.

(cid:137) Double-click the force sensor icon to open a window to set the 
Sensor Properties.

the Data window.

Ready to go…!

Data taking
(cid:137) Click Start
Start! Button turns to KeepKeep.

(cid:137) Measure vertical drop, click KeepKeep.

(cid:137) Enter vertical drop into window.

(cid:137) Shorten string, repeat for 10 to 12 measurements.

(cid:137) Ensure string passes over pulley.

(cid:137) Make 2-3 measurements with vertical drop 1.25” or less.          
(String will be tight even without the weight!)

(cid:137) Click red stop button when finished.

Analyzing data
(cid:137) Calculate sinθ from your vertical drop measurements (see write 
up).
(cid:137) Plot force on y axis, sinθ on x axis.
(cid:137) Fit  y = A/x (User-defined fit) to your data.

Report
(cid:137) Hand-in experiment report.

(cid:137) There is a follow-up question as part of your PS!
