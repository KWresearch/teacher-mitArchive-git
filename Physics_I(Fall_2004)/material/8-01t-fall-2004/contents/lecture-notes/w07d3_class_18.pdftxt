The Gravitational Field of a  

Spherical Shell of Matter  

•	 The gravitational force on a mass  placed 
outside a spherical shell of matter of 
uniform surface mass density  is the same 
force that would arise if all the mass of the 
shell were placed at the center of the 
sphere. 
•  The gravitational force on a mass  placed  

inside a spherical shell of matter is zero.
