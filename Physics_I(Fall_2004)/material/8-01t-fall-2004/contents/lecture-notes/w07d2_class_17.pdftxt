Class Problem: Block-Spring  

System

Example 1:  A block of mass m  is attached to a 

spring and is free to slide along a horizontal 
frictionless surface. At t = 0 the block-spring 
system is stretched an amount x0  > 0 from the 
equilibrium position and is released from rest.


1.  Is the mechanical energy of the block-spring 
constant? 
2.  What is the velocity of the block when it first comes 
back to the equilibrium? 
3.  What is the period of oscillation of the block?

A block of mass m  is attached to a spring and is free
to slide along a horizontal frictionless surface. At t = 0
the block-spring system is stretched an amount x0  from 
the equilibrium position and is released from rest.
What is the velocity of the block when it first comes
back to the equilibrium? 

1.  Veq  = -x0T/4 
2.  Veq  = x0T/4 
3.  Veq  = - (k/m)1/2  x0 
4.  Veq  = (k/m)1/2  x0

Class Problem: Block-Spring  

System with Friction 

Example 2:  A block of mass m  slides 
along a horizontal surface with speed v0. 
At t = 0 it hits a spring with spring constant 
k  and begins to experience a friction 
force. The coefficient of friction is variable 
and is given by µk=bx  where  b is a 
constant. Find the loss in mechanical 
energy when the block has first come 
momentarily to rest.
