ball is:

2.zero 
3.negative 


2.  A  comet  is  speeding  along  a  hyperbolic 
orbit toward the Sun.

Sun,  the work done by  the Sun on  the comet 
is: 
1.positive 

2.zero 
3.negative 


3. Consider two carts, of masses m and 2m, 
at rest on an air track. If you push first one 
cart for 3 s and then the other for the same 
length of time, exerting equal force on each, 
the kinetic energy of the light cart is 
1.larger than 

2.equal to 

3.smaller than 

the kinetic energy of the heavy car. 


4. Suppose a ping-pong ball and a bowling 
ball are rolling toward you. Both have the 
same momentum, and you exert the same 
force to stop each. How do the distances 
needed to stop them compare? 
1.It takes a shorter distance to stop the 

ping-pong ball. 

2.Both take the same distance. 

3.It takes a longer distance to stop the 

ping-pong ball. 


5. A puck moving across a horizontal 
surface experiences constant negative 
acceleration due to friction, and comes to 
rest after 12 seconds. How does the change 
in energy in the first 6 seconds compare to 
the change in energy in the last 6 seconds? 
1.first half > second half 

2.first half = second half 

3.first half < second half 

4.too little information  


6. Compared to the amount of energy 
required to accelerate a car from rest to 10 
miles per hour, the amount of energy 
required to accelerate the same car from 10 
mph to 20 mph is 
1.the same 

2.twice as much 

3.three times as much 

4.four times as much 


7. A particle starts from rest at x = 0 and 
moves to x = L under the action of a 
variable force F(x), which is shown in the 
figure. What is the particle's kinetic energy 
at x=L/2 and at x=L? 

1.Fmax L/2, FmaxL 
2.Fmax L/4, 0 
3.Fmax L, 0 
4.Fmax L/4, Fmax L/2 
5.Fmax L/2, Fmax L/4 

8. Consider two blocks stacked on a table. 
Someone pulls the bottom block to the right 
with a rope in such a way that both bocks 
accelerate to the right but no slipping occurs 
at the interface between the top and bottom 
blocks. Friction at the interface between the 
two blocks does 
1.Positive work on the top block. 

2.No work on the top block. 

3.Negative work on the top block. 


9. Consider a weightlifter holding a 500 
pound-barbell above his head. The 
weightlifter does 
1.Positive work on the barbell. 

2.Negative work on the barbell. 

3.No work on the barbell. 


10. When a person walks, the force of 
friction between the floor and the person's 
feet accelerates the person forward. The 
floor does 
1.Positive work on the person. 

2.Negative work on the person. 

3.No work on the person. 


11. A ball is rolling in a spiral path down the 
inside of a hollow cone. 

The  work  done  by  the  inner  surface  of  the 
cone on the ball is 
1.positive 

2.zero 
3.negative 


12. A streetcar is freely coasting (no 
friction) around a large circular track. It is 
then switched to a small circular track. 
When coasting on the smaller circle its 
linear speed is 
1. greater 
2. less. 
3. unchanged.
