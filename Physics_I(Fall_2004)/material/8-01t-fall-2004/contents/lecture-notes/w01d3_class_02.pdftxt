Instantaneous velocity

•	 For time interval  ∆t , we calculate the average 
velocity. As ∆t → 0 , we generate a sequence of 
average velocities. The limiting value of this 
sequence is defined to be the x-component of 
the instantaneous velocity at the time t .

constant, the velocity 
is a linear function of
