Einstein: Postulate of Relativity

Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to 
discover any motion of the earth relatively to the “light medium,” 
suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of 
mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of 
absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown 
to first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics 
and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the 
equations of mechanics hold good. We will raise this conjecture (the 
purport of which will hereafter be called the Principle of Relativity”) to 
the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate,
which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that 
light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c
which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.[1]

[1] A. Einstein, translated from “Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter 
Körper,“ Annalen der Physik, 17, 1905.

Postulates of Relativity

Postulate 1: All inertial frames are 
equivalent with respect to all the laws of 
physics.

Postulate 2: The speed of light in empty 
space always has the same value c.

Relatively Inertial Reference 
Frames
• Place an ‘observer’ at the 
origin of coordinate system. 
The coordinate system with the 
observer acts as a ‘reference 
frame’ .

Relatively inertial reference 
frames

• A space-time event : spatial 
and temporal coordinates. for 
describing the position, 
velocity, and acceleration of 
bodies.

Simultaneous events:
• Definition of 
Simultaneous events: 
If the detector at the point 
B midway between the 
points 1 and 2 emits a 
blue light indicating the 
two flashes reach it at the 
same instant then we 
define the two events at 
points 1 and 2 to have 
occurred simultaneously 
in time.

Time Ordering of Events:

• If the detector emits a red light, then Flash 
1 reaches it first, so Flash 1 occurred 
before Flash 2.  If the detector emits a 
yellow light then Flash 2 reaches it first, so 
Flash 2 occurred before Flash 1.

Concept Question:

Suppose two flashes of light occur at the points 1 and 2. 
A flash detector is placed at A closer to event 1 as 
shown in Figure 1. The flash detector emits a blue 
light. 

1) Flash 1 occurred before Flash 2
2) Flash 1 occurred at the same time as Flash 2
3) Flash 1 occurred after Flash 2

The Relativity of Simultaneity

• Now suppose the flash lamps, and the 
observer with the flash detector (midway 
between the flashes), are placed on a train 
moving to the right with speed v. 

Concept Question:

Suppose the observer on the ground determines that Flash 1 and 
Flash 2 on the moving train occurred simultaneously. The 
detector midway between the flash lamps on the train emits 

1. A red light indicating that Flash 1 occurred before Flash 2
2. A yellow light indicating that Flash 2 occurred before Flash 1
3. A blue light indicating Flash 1 occurred at the same time as 
Flash 2.

Synchronization of clocks:

•

•

•

•

two identical clocks that are at rest in a 
reference frame at different spatial 
points will run at identical rates. 

a lamp at the origin emits a pulse of 
light at time . 

Every point in space has a clock that 
will begin running when the light pulse 
reaches it. 

Each clock has been pre-set to the 
time  t = d/c where d is the distance 
from the clock to the origin and  is the 
speed of light. 

• When the light pulse reaches the 
clock, it begins to run at the same 
identical rate as all the other clocks. 

Concept Question:

Flash 1 and Flash 2 reach the detector at a point closer to observer B 
than observer A. The two observers use their local synchronized 
clocks to determine the time of the events. When they compare 
times later on,

1.
2.
3.

Flash 1 occurred before Flash 2
Flash 2 occurred after Flash 1
Flash 1 and Flash 2 occurred at the same time

Causality:

• Events that are simultaneous in one reference 
frame are not simultaneous in a reference frame 
moving with a constant relative speed.

• Any two causally related events in one reference 
frame must preserve the same causal relation in 
any other reference frame. The time ordering 
cannot be reversed! If event 1 is causally related 
to event  2 and event 1 occurred first in one 
reference frame then it occurs first in all other 
relatively inertial reference frames. 

Time Dilation: Light Clock at 
Rest

• The clock consists of pulse 
emitter, and two mirrors. One 
mirror is located a distance  
from the emitter and the other 
mirror is located at the emitter. 
The pulse is emitted and then 
bounces back and forth 
between the mirrors. Every 
time the pulse completes one 
path, the clock makes a tick.
