Class Problem: Moment of  

Inertia of a Rod

Consider a thin uniform rod of length L and 
mass m. In this problem, you will calculate 
the moment of inertia about two different 
axes that pass perpendicular to the rod. 
One passes through the center of mass of 
the rod and the second passes through an 
endpoint of the rod. 

Strategy: Moment of Inertia

Step 1:  Identify the axis of rotation 

Step 2: Choose a coordinate system 

Step 3: Identify the infinitesimal mass element dm. 
Step 4:  Identify the radius,  r⊥ ,  of the circular orbit of the 
infinitesimal mass element dm. 

Step 5: Set up the limits for the integral over the body in terms of 
the physical dimensions of the rigid body. 

Step 6: Explicitly calculate the integrals. 

Class Problem

A turntable is a uniform disc of mass 1.2 
kg and a radius 1.3 ×10  −1 m. The moment of 
inertia of the disc is  1.0  ×10  kg − m  . The 
−1
2

turntable is spinning at an initial constant
. The motor 
frequency of 
f 0  = 33  cycles/min 
is turned off and the turntable slows to a 
stop in 8.0 s due to frictional torque.
Assume that the angular acceleration is
constant. What is the magnitude of the
frictional torque acting on the disc?
