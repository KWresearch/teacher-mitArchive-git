Class Problem 1


Work done by Gravity Near the Surface of the 
Earth 
Consider an object of mass m near the surface 
of the earth falling directly towards the center of 
the earth. The gravitational force between the 
object and the earth is nearly constant. Suppose 
the object starts from an initial point y0  and 
moves to a final point yf  closer to the earth. How 
much work does the gravitational force do on the 
object as it falls? 

Class Problem 2


Work Done by the Spring Force

Connect one end of a spring with spring 
constant k to an object resting on a smooth table 
and fix the other end of the spring to a wall. 
Stretch the spring a distance x0  and release the 
spring-object system.  How much work does the 
spring do on the object as a function of the 
stretched or compressed length of the object? 

Class Problem 3

Work done by the Inverse Square

Gravitational Force 


Consider an object of mass m moving directly

towards the sun (mass ms). Initially the object is
at a distance r0  from the center of the sun. The 

object moves to a distance rf  from the center of 
the sun. How much work does the gravitational

force between the sun and the object do on the 

object during this motion?
