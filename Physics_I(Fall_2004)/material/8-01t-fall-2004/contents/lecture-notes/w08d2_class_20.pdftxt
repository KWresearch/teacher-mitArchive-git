circular orbit of radius R

• The

position vector i.e. 
tangent to the circular 
orbit! 

Tangential Velocity 

Gives Radial Acceleration 
•  Direction of velocity is 

constantly changing


•  An object traveling with 

uniform circular motion

(ω(t)=ω) is always 
accelerating towards the  

center! 

Uniform Circular Motion: ω(t)=ω 
Object is constrained to move in a 
circle at uniform angular velocity. 

• 

• 

Magnitude of the velocity (speed) 
remains constant. 

aθ  = 
0
•	 The tangential acceleration is 
zero so by Newton’s Second 
Law, total tangential force 

acting on the object is zero.


•	 Object is always 
accelerated towards 
center! 

Note: ω(t)=ω

Non-uniform Circular Motion:

Acceleration 
When an object moves non-uniformly in a 
circular orbit, the acceleration has two 
components, the tangential component, and 
radial component

motion


•	 Always has a component of 
acceleration pointing radially inward. 

•	 May or may not have tangential 
component of acceleration. 

•	 Draw a free body diagram for all 
forces. 

•	 Note: mv2/R is not a force but mass 
times acceleration and does not 
appear on force diagram. 

•	 Choose one unit vectors to point in 
the radial direction.

shown above. It is held by a string which 
holds a suspended bob, also of inertia M, at 
rest below the table. Half of the length of 
the string is above the tabletop and half 
below. What is the centripetal acceleration

Work, Kinetic Energy, and

Work-energy Definitions 


Now we give each term a descriptive name:

Kinetic Energy 
Work 
Restating the Work-Kinetic Energy relationship conventionally:


Kinetic energy is a physical quantity that changes due to work 
The work Wf,i  depends on the path to f from i and the force, Fx 
and   the relative direction of the force and the path 
The expression for work is only valid for constant force 

Work Done Along an Arbitrary Path

Key Idea: Add work along incremental path, proportional to

scalar product of force and increment.  Result = line integral

PRS Question on Work

Consider the work associated with three actions that  

a person might take:

A.  Lift a 4 kg mass from the floor to h=1m 
B.  Hold a 5 kg mass 1 m above the floor 
C.  Lower a 3 kg mass from h=2m to the floor 

Order these actions from greatest to least by the work done:

1.  A,B,C 
2.  C,B,A 
3.  C,A,B 
4.  A,C,B 
5.  None of above 

PRS: Work Due to Friction 

A force Fxa  is applied to a block and causes it to

slide from x = 0m to x = 5m and back to x = 3m. 

The block experiences a friction force, Ff  = 7N. 

At the start and finish the block is not moving.

The total work done by the friction force on the block is:


1. 21j 
2. 49j 
3. 56j 
4. -21j 
5. -49j

Class Problem: Block-Spring 

Oscillator


Example 1:  A block of mass m  is attached to 
a spring and is free to slide along a horizontal 
frictionless surface. At t = 0 the block-spring 
system is stretched an amount A from the 
equilibrium position (x=0) and is released from 
rest. 

What is the speed of the block when it is at the 
position x (|x|<A)?

Problem 2: Position of Oscillator


You must solve the central problem of mechanics: 

given the force as a function of position,

find the position as a function of time.


REMEMBER that x(t) = A  cos[ωt+φ] 

Is a valid solution for the position of the oscillator.

Adjust A and φ to match initial conditions


PRS: Derivative of oscillator position

Motivation: The kinematics of harmonic oscillators 
involves the derivatives of trigonometric functions and 
pervades physics. 

Find the velocity associated with x(t) = A  cos[2π(t/T)] 


1. v(t) = A  sin[2π(t/T)] 
2. v(t) = -A  sin[2π(t/T)] 
3. v(t) = -(2π A/T) sin[2π(t/T)] 

4. v(t) = -(A/T)  sin[2π(t/T)] 
5. v(t) = -(2π A/T)  cos[2π(t/T)] 
6. v(t) = -(A/T)  cos[2π(t/T)]
