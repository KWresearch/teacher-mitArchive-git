Reference Frame


Coordinate system with an observer placed at origin is 
a ‘reference frame’  in which the position, velocity, 
and acceleration of objects are mathematically 
defined 

Relative Reference Frames


•	 Two reference frames 

•	 Origins need not coincide 


•	 Moving object 

•	 Position vectors in 
different frames

r  =

+ r2

Relative velocity between the two reference frames is 
constant

observers in different relatively

reference frames will measure the 

same acceleration

Newton’s First Law: Law of 

Inertia

Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform

motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that

state by forces impressed upon it 


Application:  Newton’s Second Law in either frame is

Relatively inertial reference frames have same accelerations.

So use the same forces

So it does not matter which frame you choose to describe

the problem.

Principle of Relativity


For observers moving in two different reference frames,
no mechanical force can distinguish which observer is at
rest and which observer is moving 

Einstein extended this to all physical phenomena.


The laws of physics are the same in all relatively inertial
reference frames, 

In particular, Einstein extended the Galilean principle of
relativity to electromagnetism and optics which describe
the theory of light 

In-Class Problem 7: Law of  

Addition of Velocities


Suppose two cars, Car A, and Car B, are 
traveled along roads that are perpendicular to 
each other.  An observer is at rest with respect 
to the ground. A second observer is in Car A. 
According to the observer on the ground, Car
G

ˆj  , and Car 
A is moving with a velocity    v A  = vA 
B is moving with a magnitude of velocity 
v. G 
ˆi 
. 
B  = vB

What is the velocity of Car B according to the 
observer in Car A?  Express your answer both 
as components of the velocity vector, and 
direction and magnitude of the velocity vector. 

Tension


Consider a rope pulling a 
mass. 

How do we define `tension’ 
in a rope?

Tension: Massless Rope


•  Assumption: Assume that the mass of the rope is 

small so that we can ignore all y-components of the 

applied force and the force of the object on the rope.

1. Pulling the object at a constant velocity: 

a  = 0 

2. Rope is essentially massless: mr ≅ 0 
Fapplied   − Fmass   rope   = 0 
, 

Pulling force is transmitted through the rope


Tension in a Rope


The tension  in a rope at a distance x from one end of the 
rope is the magnitude of the action -reaction pair of 
forces acting at that point ,

Constraint Condition in Pulley  

Systems

Consider the arrangement of
pulleys and objects shown in
the figure. Draw force
diagrams on each object. 

How are the accelerations of 
the objects related? 

Solve for the accelerations pf
the objects and the tensions in
the ropes. 

Force Law:  Newtonian Induction


•	 Definition of force has no predictive content  


•	 Need to measure the acceleration and the mass in order 
to define the force 

•	 Force Law: Discover experimental relation between
force exerted on object and change in properties of
object 

•	

Induction: Extend force law from finite measurements to 
all cases within some range creating a model 

•	 Second Law can now be used to predict motion! 

•	

If prediction disagrees with measurement adjust model.

Goal

 Use DataStudio to plot and analyze the force that two magnets 
exert on one another as a function of the distance between 
them. 

 Use linear, semi-log, and log-log graphs to gain some insight into 
how the force varies with separation. 

 Find a mathematical function that describes this force, a “force 
law”. 

Experimental setup

 Measuring the magnet gap h2(cid:173)
 Measure heights h1  and h2 
h
with your ruler, and subtract 
1 
them. (h1  will be constant.) 

 The two magnets stuck 
together weigh 6.0 pennies. 
The plastic coin holder 
weighs 4.0 pennies. 

 Enter the gap (in mm) and 
the total weight (in pennies) 
into a table in DataStudio. 

 The gap goes in the X (left) 
column of the table. 

Starting DataStudio


 Choose the “Enter Data” 
option. 

Making a table I


 A table and a graph will 
appear. Close the graph 
window (removes it). 
Drag the table borders 
to make it smaller. 

 Click the “Summary” 
button to open the 
“Data” and “Displays” 
windows. 

 Double-click “Editable 
Data” in the Data 
window. This opens a 
“Data Properties” 
window… 

Making a table II


 Choose a title for the 
data set. 

 Pick names and units 
of the X and Y 
variables. 

Making a table III


 Type in your measurements, gap in the left (X) column and 
force in the right (Y) column. 
 To plot them, drag the “Force vs.Gap” entry in the Data 
window onto “Graph” in the Displays window. 

Exponential fit


 Carry out a user-defined fit of: 

 Record A and C for part (a) and answer question about the 
characteristic length l over which the force drops by a factor 
1/e 

Semi-log plot and linear fit I

 Click the “Calculate” button. 

 In the calculator definition window type lnF = ln(y) and click 
Accept. 

 Under the “Variables” pull-down menu choose “Data Measurement” 
and then your data in the yellow window that opens. 

 After you click the Yes button, there should be a new Data entry 
“lnF = ln(y)” in the Data window. 

 Make a graph of lnF vs. gap by dragging this entry onto the Graph 
entry in the Displays window. 

 Use the Linear Fit function to see if it is a straight line. 

Semi-log plot and linear fit II 


Log-log plot and slope tool I

 Make a new empty data table by clicking the “New Data” button. 

 Using a calculator, manually enter the natural log of your gap 
measurements in the left (X) column. 

  You may enter the corresponding force (in pennies) in the right 
(Y) column, then let DataStudio calculate the log as you did for the 
semi-log graph, or you may calculate the natural log of the force 
yourself and enter it directly in the table. 

 Make a graph of ln(force) vs. ln(gap). 

 Use the graph’s Slope Tool to fill in the table in your report, part 
(b).

 Turn in one report page per group. 

 There is a follow-up homework problem about this 
experiment.
