How is it possible for the system to return 
to state 4 and yet do net work?

1. Not all the state variables return to their 
original state
2. Net heat is added even though the system 
returns to its original state 
3. The process is not reversible
4. This loop would in practice take forever to 
occur

Thermodynamic cycles
A thermodynamic cycle is any 
process that brings a system back 
to its original state.

A

The cycle involves a path in state 
space over which various 
processes may act.  

Addition/Removal of heat and work 
are typical processes.

Often the objective is to get work 
from heat or vice versa, as in a 
heat engine.

Isothermal Cycle

Consider the closed cycle 
shown here consisting of 
two isothermal processes, 
at temperatures T2 and T1 .

The work on the AB path is 
more than that on the DC path, 
so if we go around clockwise 
(e.g. ABCDA) this will be a heat 
engine that does positive work 
on the outside world

The change in internal energy is 
determined from State A&B
Internal Energy depends only on 
the temperature, which is T2
Hence ∆U = 0.

If you are patient, this process is reversible - it can run 
either way with the opposite heat transfer and work, 
all at the temperature T2

The Isothermal Cycle had a volume ratio change of 
only a factor of two, leading to the ln(2) term.
(T2 − T1 ) ln(2)

We can increase the efficiency by making the 
volume ratio [I.e. ln(2)] arbitrarily large.

Due to the failure of the switch that senses the 
closed door, the 25 watt interior light bulb in a 
refrigerator remains on constantly.   The 
refrigerator maintains a temperature of -23C in 
the freezer and its outside coils are at 77C.  What 
is the minimum extra power that the refrigerator 
will consume?

Second law of Thermodynamics

No process shall have the only result that Heat is 
turned into Work

or
No process shall have the only result that Heat is 
transferred from cooler to hotter.

The second law is the formal statement of the 
irreversibility of Nature on a classical scale: friction can 
irreversibly convert mechanical energy into heat; 
nothing can do the reverse.
