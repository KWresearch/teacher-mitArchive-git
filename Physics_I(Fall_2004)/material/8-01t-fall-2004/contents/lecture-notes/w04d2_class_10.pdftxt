Stretching a Spring

Suppose we have a spring whose 
relaxed length is x0, and stretch it 
to a length xF. 
According to Hooke’s law, the 
restoring force will be proportional 
to the amount of stretch, 
Fspring  = −k xF  − x0 ) = −  ∆ x 
k
( 
where k is the spring force constant.

This is an example of elastic behavior; it is an experimental  

“law” that is valid only for a limited range of ∆x.

We shall meet Hooke’s law again and again in many different  

contexts. Hooke was a contemporary of Newton.

Goal

 Study a conical pendulum and measure the force required to 
produce a centripetal acceleration 

 Extract from measurement of angular frequency and rm  the 
spring constant k and pre-tension F0 

 Understand how an instability in this system occurs at a critical 
frequency ω0  and how to extract ω0  from your measurements 

Analysis of conical pendulum


F 
s 

From my measurements of rm, ω: θ≈88° 

Therefore: Ignore effect of gravitation! 

Attaching the mass


Turn the box on its side and 
measure the radius of the 
mass when ω = 0: 

Connecting the motor

For safety, place the side panel after measuring r0! 

Connect the voltage sensor to the left side banana jacks!


Measurement of rm


Wait for the rotation speed to stabilize. 
Use the “viewer” to measure rm  and the scope display to measure 
the period T. 

(This may work better with the room lights off!) 
Enter rm  and ω  = 2π/T in a DataStudio table, with ω  as the 
independent (left) variable. 

Measurement of ω

Example of scope trace to determine T: Here: T=0.0626s 

Fitting 

Perform a User-Defined fit to:  A/(1-x*x/(B*B)) 

Fitting results  


Defining r0  = rm(ω=0), compare model and fit: 

Determine ωc  and k using 
m=8.5g! 

How does A compare with your measured r0?. 

Determine k and pre-tension of  

spring 

Enter ∆r=rm-r0  and Fs=rmω2  in a DataStudio table, with ∆r as  
the independent (left) variable. 

Do a Linear Fit to find Fs = F0  + k∆r 

Determine k and pre-tension of  

spring 


If you don’t have access to a fitting program, you will make a 
very small mistake (because F0  is small) if you assume F0  = 0. 
Then finding k becomes trivial. If you do take this approach, 
explain to the grader that you lacked a means to fit the data 
outside of class and thus made this assumption. We will 
encourage the problem set graders not to penalize you for this.
