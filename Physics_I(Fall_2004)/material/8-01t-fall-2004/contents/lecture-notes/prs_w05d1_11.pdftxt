1. You are a passenger in a racecar 
approaching a turn after a straight-away. As 
the car turns left on the circular arc at 
constant speed, you are pressed against the 
car door. Which of the following is true 
during the turn (assume the car doesn't slip 
on the roadway)? 
1.A centripetal force pushes you against 
the door. 
2.There is no force that pushes you against 
the door. 
3.The frictional force of the ground pushes 
you against the door. 
4.There is no centripetal force acting on 
you. 
5.You cannot analyze this situation in 
terms of the forces on you since you are 
accelerating. 
6.Two of the above. 

7.None of the above. 


2. Which of the following types of forces 

can produce a centripetal acceleration ? 

1.Normal force 

2.Frictional force 

3.Tension force 

4.Gravitational force 

5.All of the above 


3.  The ""barrel of fun"" must spin at a 
certain minimum angular speed in order for 
a rider of mass m1 to stick to the wall. Does 
this minimum angular speed change for a 
rider of mass m2>m1? 

1.yes 
2.no 
3.Not enough information to determine. 

4. A ball is suspended from a vertical rod by 
two strings of equal strength and equal 
length. The strings are very light and do not 
stretch. The rod is spun with a constant 
angular acceleration. Which string breaks 
first? 

1.the upper string 
2.the lower string 
3.they break simultaneously 
4.cannot tell without more information 

5. A stone attached to a string is whirled in a 
vertical plane. Let T1, T2, T3, and T4 be the 
tensions at locations 1, 2, 3, and 4 required 
for the stone to have a given speed v0 at 
these four locations. 

1.T3 > T2 >T1 = T4 
2.T1 = T2 = T3 = T4 
3.T1 > T2 = T4 > T3 
4.none of the above 

6. A puck of inertia M is moving in a circle 
at uniform speed on a frictionless table as 
shown above. It is held by a string which 
holds a suspended bob, also of inertia M, at 
rest below the table. Half of the length of the 
string is above the tabletop and half below. 
What is the centripetal acceleration of the 
moving puck? 

1.less than g 

2.g 
3.greater than g 
4.zero 
5.insufficient information
