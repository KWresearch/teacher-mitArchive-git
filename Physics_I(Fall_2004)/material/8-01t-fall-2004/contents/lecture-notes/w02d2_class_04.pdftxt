Experiment 2: Projectile Motion

Reminder on projectile motion
(cid:137) Horizontal motion (x) has no acceleration.

(cid:137) Vertical motion (y) has acceleration –g.

(cid:137) Horizontal and vertical motion may be treated separately 
and the results combined to find, for example, the 
trajectory or path.

(cid:137) Use the kinematic equations for x and y motion: 

Experimental setup
(cid:137) Coordinate system

(cid:137) Impact point:
(cid:190) Height: h
(cid:190) Horizontal displacement: 
r

(cid:137) With chosen coordinate 
system:
(cid:190) Height: y=-h
(cid:190) Horizontal displacement: 
x=r

(cid:137) Solve above equation for g:

Theta θ>0: upward

Theta θ<0: downward

Experimental setup

Set up for upward launch

The output end with photogate

Connect voltage probe from 750 interface to red & black terminals.

Connect 12VAC supply to the apparatus; the LED should light up.

Velocity measurement
The photogate produces a pulse when the ball interrupts a beam of 
light to a phototransistor; the more light is blocked, the greater the 
pulse amplitude. If you look carefully at the output pulse, it looks 
approximately like this:

∆T

Rise & fall time:  δt
Flat top lasting:   ∆t

tA    t1   tB                                                          tC t2  tD

To analyze the experiment 
we need to understand why 
the pulse has this shape!

δt is time the ball partly blocks the 
beam ∆t is time it completely blocks 
the beam 

Velocity measurement

Rise & fall time:  δt=d/v
Flat top lasting:   ∆t=(D-d/v)

Therefore: v=D/(δt+∆t)

Determine (δt+∆t) from Full 
Width at Half Maximum 
(FWHM)! 

∆T=D/v

tA    t1   tB                                                          tC t2  tD
