Energy Transformations

•	 Falling water releases stored ‘gravitational 
potential energy’ turning into a ‘kinetic energy’
of motion. 

•	 Human beings transform the stored chemical 
energy of food into ‘catabolic energy 

•	 Burning gasoline in car engines converts 
‘chemical energy’ stored in the atomic bonds of
the constituent atoms of gasoline into heat 

Energy Transformations


•	 Stretching or compressing a spring stores 
‘elastic potential energy’ that can be released 
as kinetic energy 

•	 kinetic energy, gravitational energy, heat 
energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, 
chemical energy, electromagnetic energy, 
nuclear energy, or mass energy. 

Energy Transformations

•  Energy is always conserved 

•  converted from one form into another 

•  ‘initial state’ that transforms into a ‘final state’.

PRS Question 1


Compared to the amount of energy required to 
accelerate a car from rest to 10 miles per hour, 
the amount of energy required to accelerate the 
same car from 10 mph to 20 mph is 

1) the same 
2) twice as much 
3) three times as much 
4) four times as much 

PRS Question 2

Consider two carts, of masses m and 2m, at rest
on an air track. If you push first one cart for 3 s
and then the other for the same length of time,
exerting equal force on each, the kinetic energy
of the light cart is 

1) larger than 
2) equal to 
3) smaller than 

the kinetic energy of the heavy car.


Work Done by Constant Force


Definition: Work done by a Constant 
Force 

The work  done by the constant force 
acting on the body is the product of the 
component of the force in the direction 
displacement with the displacement, 
Wapplied   = F  ∆xx 

PRS Question 3

horizontal velocity and 
allowed to fall under the 
influence of gravity, as 
shown below. The work 
done by the force of 
gravity on the ball is: 
1) positive  

2) zero 
3) negative 

PRS Question 4

hyperbolic orbit toward 
the Sun. While the comet 
is moving away from the 
Sun, the work done by 
the Sun on the comet is: 
1) positive

Consider two blocks stacked on a table. 

Someone pulls the bottom block to the right

with a rope in such a way that both bocks
accelerate to the right but no slipping occurs at

the interface between the top and bottom
blocks. Friction at the interface between the 

two blocks does 

1.  Positive work on the top block. 

2.  No work on the top block. 
3.  Negative work on the top block. 


PRS Question 6

friction between the floor and the

2.  Negative work on the person.  

3.  No work on the person.

time t along a horizontal table with a force 
of magnitude F at an angle θ with respect 
to the horizontal for a distance d . The 
coefficient of friction between the table and 
the cup is µk. The cup was initially at rest. 

Class Problem 1 (con’t)


a)  Calculate the work done by the pushing 
force. 
b)  Calculate the work done by the friction 
force.

pushing force?

friction force?

Experiment 5B: Friction 


Goal 


To investigate the friction 
of a string wrapped around 
a cylinder, observe that it 
increases exponentially, 
and to measure the friction 
coefficient µ. 

(A theoretical expression is derived in the appendix to 
the write up for the experiment.) 

Starting DataStudio:

Create a new experiment. Plug a force sensor into the 
drag it to the input in the Setup window. 

Double-click the Force Sensor icon.


Force Sensor:


Set it for 10 samples/s and low sensitivity. 

Click 

Sampling Options:


No boxes checked. 

No delayed start. 

Stop after 10 s.


Set Up :


Choose large or  

small cylinder.


Both kinds at  

each table. 


100 gm brass 
weight + 5 gm 
holder = 1.03 N. 

Small Cylinder 

Large Cylinder


Measuring technique: 

Tare the force sensor.

Ensure string passes over pulley before all  

measurements.

Do not wrap the string over itself.

Wrap string 2 ¼ turns around cylinder.


Increase ccw torque on cylinder smoothly to the slipping 
point, then turn slowly for 1 or 2 seconds. 
Practice this, so you get 1 or 2 peaks of the force in 10 s, 
then record the force with DataStudio. 

Measuring the Friction: 


Choose the largest magnitude of Force as the friction. 
Use the Smart Tool or the Statistics (Σ) Tool. 

Recording the Friction:

Measure the friction for the string wrapped ¼, 1¼, 2¼, 
3¼ and 4¼ turns. Express these in radians and type them 
as the independent variable, along with the friction force 
as the dependent variable, into a table in DataStudio. 

Include the force of 1.03 N when the wrap angle is 0 as 
an entry in your table. 

Plot the table on a graph and carry out a User-Defined 
Fit with the function 1.03*exp(-C*x).

cylinder):
