1: Understand – a get conceptual grasp 
of the problem 
•	 How many objects are involved in the 
problem? 

•	 How many different stages of motion 
occur? 

•	 For each object, how many independent 
directions are needed to describe the 
motion of that object? 

1: Understand – a get conceptual grasp 

of the problem 


•	 What choice of coordinate system best 
suits the problem? 

•	 What information can you infer from the 
problem? 

2. Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to 
obtain the desired solution 
•	 Sketch the problem 


•	 For each object in the problem, choose a 
coordinate system 

•	 Write down the complete set of equations 
for the position and velocity functions;
identify any specified quantities; clean up
the equations. 

Equations of Motion: y-direction

Equations of Motion: x-direction


•  Acceleration x-component: 

•  Velocity x-component: 

a = 0

Identify given information 

Identify ‘initial state’ with initial conditions


Initial position depends on choice of origin

2. Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to  

obtain the desired solution 

•	 Design a strategy for solving 
the system of equations. 

•	 You can solve a system of  n 
independent equations if you
have exactly n unknowns. 

•	 These quantities are specified 
as numbers

3. Carry our your plan

solve the problem!


4. Look Back – check your solution and 
method of solution 
•	 Check your algebra and units. 

•	 Substitute in numbers. 

•	 Check any possible limiting behavior


•	 Think about the result 

•	 Solved problems act as models for thinking about new 
problems. 

In-Class Problem 2:Throwing a Stone 

Down a Hill


•  A person is standing on top of a hill which 
slopes downwards uniformly at an angle Φ 
0  with respect to the horizontal. The 
θ
person throws a stone at an initial angle θ0 
from the horizontal with an initial speed of 
0  . You may neglect air resistance. How 
v
far below the top of the hill does the stone 
strike the ground? 

Class Problem 3


•	 A person is standing on a ladder holding a pail. 
The person releases the pail from rest at a
height,  h1 ,above the ground. As second person
standing some distance away aims and throws a
small  ball in order to hit the first ball with an 
initial velocity that has magnitude,  v0 , and 
thrown at an angle, θ  ,with respect to the
0
horizontal. The second person releases the ball
at a height,  h2 ,  above the ground and a
horizontal distance,  s2 , from the line of flight of
the first ball. You may ignore air resistance. 

Class Problem 3: Continued

a) Find an expression for the angle  that the 
person aims the ball in order to hit the
pail as a function of  the other variables 
given in the problem 

b) If the person aims correctly, find an
expression for the range of speeds that
the ball must be thrown at in order to hit 
the pail?
