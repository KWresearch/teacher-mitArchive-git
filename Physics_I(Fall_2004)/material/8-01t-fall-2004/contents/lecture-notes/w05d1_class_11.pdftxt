Modeling Problems: 

Circular Motion 

•	 Always has a component of acceleration 
pointing radially inward 
•	 May or may not have tangential component of 
acceleration 
•	 Free Body Diagram for all forces 

• mv2/r is not a force but mass times acceleration 
and does not appear on force diagram 
•	 Choose one unit vectors to point in the radial 
direction 

Equations of Motion


PRS Question 1

You are a passenger in a racecar approaching a turn after a straight(cid:173)
away. As the car turns left on the circular arc at constant speed, you 
are pressed against the car door. Which of the following is true 
during the turn (assume the car doesn't slip on the roadway)? 

1. 	 A centripetal force pushes you against the door. 
2.	 There is no force that pushes you against the door. 
3. 	 The frictional force of the ground pushes you against the door. 
4.	 There is no centripetal force acting on you. 
5.	 You cannot analyze this situation in terms of the forces on you since 
you are accelerating. 
6.	 Two of the above. 
7.	 None of the above. 

PRS Question 2


Which of the following types of forces 
can produce a centripetal acceleration ? 
1.  Normal force 
2.  Frictional force 
3.  Tension force 
4.  Gravitational force  

5.  All of the above 

PRS Question 3

The ""barrel of fun"" must  

spin at a certain

minimum angular

speed in order for a

rider of mass m1 to  

stick to the wall. Does 

this minimum angular

speed change for a

rider of mass m2>m1?  


1.	
yes 

2.	
no

3. 	 Not enough information
to determine. 

PRS Question 4


A ball is suspended from a

vertical rod by two strings of  

equal strength and equal

length. The strings are very

light and do not stretch. The

rod is spun with a constant

angular acceleration. Which  

string breaks first? 


1.	
2. 	
3. 	
4. 	

the upper string 
the lower string 
they break simultaneously 
cannot tell without more 
information 

Analysis of Acceleration

•  Circular motion always has radial inward 

component


mv2/r


•	 Uniform Circular Motion means 

•	 Vertical direction 

d2θ/dt2 = 0 

d2z/dt2 = 0 

PRS Question 5


A stone attached to a string is
whirled in a vertical plane. Let 
T1, T2, T3, and T4 be the 
tensions at locations 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 required for the stone to
have a given speed v0  at these 
four locations. 

1.  T3 > T2 >T1 = T4  

2.  T1 = T2 = T3 = T4  

3.  T1 > T2 = T4 > T3  

4.  none of the above 

PRS Question 6

A puck of inertia M is moving in a  

circle at uniform speed on a  

frictionless table as shown above. It 

is held by a string which holds a  

suspended bob, also of inertia M, at

rest below the table. Half of the  

length of the string is above the 

tabletop and half below. What is the

centripetal acceleration of the

moving puck?  


1. 
less than g 
2.  g 
3.  greater than g 
4.  zero 
insufficient information 
5. 

Universal Law of Gravitation

•	 The force on body 1 due to the gravitational 
interaction between two bodies of masses m1 
and m2  is

F1,2  = −G m m

r1,2

G  = 6.67   ×10   N  − m

−11 
and  rˆ1,2 
is the unit vector located at the 
position of body 1 and pointing from body 2
towards body 1. 

where 

Double Star System

•	 Example 1: Double Star System 
Consider a double star system under the
influence of gravitational force between
the stars. Star 1 has mass . Star 2 has 
mass . Assume that each star undergoes
uniform circular motion about the center of 
mass of the system. If the stars are always
a fixed distance  apart, what is the period
of the orbit? 

Class Problem 1 (con’t)


The Gravitational Field of a  

Spherical Shell of Matter  

•	 The gravitational force on a mass  placed 
outside a spherical shell of matter of 
uniform surface mass density  is the same 
force that would arise if all the mass of the 
shell were placed at the center of the 
sphere. 
•  The gravitational force on a mass  placed  

inside a spherical shell of matter is zero.
