Problem Solving Strategy


Force: 

1. 

Identify System and Draw Free Body Diagram 

2.  Write  down  equations for static equilibrium of the forces 

Torque: 

1.  Choose point to analyze the torque. 
2. 
3.  Choose sign convention for torque 

4.  Calculate total torque about that point. (Note sign of torque.) 

5.  Write down equation for static equilibrium of the total torque. 

Line of Action of the Force

 
• Moment Arm:

•  Torque:  τ = rF⊥ = rF   sinθ= r   F

S 
⊥ 

Sign Convention


•  Clockwise positive


•  Counterclockwise

•  positive 

In-Class-Problem 17 Static 

Equilibrium: Forearm


In this problem you will 
solve for the upward 
force that the tendon 
exerts to keep the 
forearm horizontal; 
and the downward 
force that the upper 
arm exerts on the 
forearm at the elbow 
joint.

In-Class-Problem 18 Static 

Equilibrium: Suspended Beam

In this problem you 
will solve for the 
magnitude of the 
tension in the cable 
and the direction and 
magnitude of the pivot 
force. 

In-Class-Problem 19 Static 

Equilibrium: The Ankle


Three unknowns, T, F, and β. 
The angle α  is determined 
from anatomical data. 
The force and torque static 
equilibrium equations provide 
the three conditions to solve 
the problem. 
By wisely choosing the point 
about which to compute the 
torque, the problem can be 
greatly simplified.
