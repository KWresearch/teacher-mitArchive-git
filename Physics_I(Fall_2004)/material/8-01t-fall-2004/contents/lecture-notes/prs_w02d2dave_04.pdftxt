Problem 1 

A person simultaneously throws two objects in the air. The 
objects leave the person’s hands at different angles and 
travel along the parabolic trajectories indicated by A and B 
in the figure below. Which of the following statements best 
describes the motion of the two objects? 

a) The object moving along trajectory A hits 
the ground before the object moving along the 
trajectory B. 

b) The object moving along trajectory A hits 
the ground after the object moving along 
trajectory B. 

c) Both objects hit the ground at the same time. 

d) There is not enough information specified in order 
to determine which object hits the ground first. 

Problem 2 

For a parabolic orbit under the influence of gravitation, 

1) the magnitude of the velocity can be determined from 
the slope of the tangent line to the graph of  y  vs.  x  but 
not the direction 

2) the magnitude and direction of the velocity can be 
determined from the slope of the tangent line to the 
graph of  y  vs.  x 

3) the magnitude and direction of the velocity cannot be 
determined from the slope of the tangent line to the 
graph of  y  vs.  x 

4) the direction of the velocity can be determined from 
the slope of the tangent line to the graph of  y  vs.  x  but 
not the magnitude. 

Problem 3 


Consider the situation depicted here. A stone is accurately 
aimed at a person hanging from the gutter of a building. 
The target is well within the stone’s range, but the instant 
the stone is thrown, the person lets go and drops to the 
ground. The stone moves with a speed v0, just as it is 
released. What happens? The stone 

1) hits the person, regardless of the value of v0; 

2) hits the person only if v0 is large enough; 

3) misses the person. 

Problem 4 

Consider a heavy projectile moving on an arc due to gravity. 
As it reaches the highest point in its arc, what can we say 
about the speed and acceleration of the object? 

1) The  speed and magnitude of the acceleration are zero. 


2) The  speed is at a minimum.  


3) The magnitude of the acceleration is at a minimum.  


4) Neither the magnitude of the acceleration nor the speed

 is minimized.
