Overview

• Lecture/presentations

•

In-class experiments

• Expert problem solving

• Schedule

• Grading

• WWW page 

Lecture/Presentations: Mon./Wed. first hour

• Like lectures, but less formal (discussion, PRS questions, 
interruption encouraged).

• Notes usually available on server.

• Personal response system (PRS) questions: to stimulate 
discussion & indicate how concepts are going over.

•

In-class problem solving for class/group discussion. There 
will usually be five people in the room to help out 
(instructor, grad & two undergrad TAs, and demo-group 
member).

Experiments: Wed. second hour

• Pre-experiment question part of problem set.

• Carried out by groups of three, in class.

• Laptops with DataStudio and other software; most 
experiments will interface to laptops.

• Conceptual Report due at end of experiment.

• Post-experiment data analysis part of problem set.

Expert Problem Solving
• Mon: In class problem solving session, basics.

• Tues: Problem Set due at 4 pm.

• Thurs: Mastering Physics assignment (due at 10pm) 
advanced problem solving.

• Fri: In class problem solving session, advanced.

• Sun 1-5 pm : Tutoring.

• Sun: Mastering Physics assignment (due at 10pm) 
introduction to weekly material.

PRS question

A cannonball is shot straight up (not recommended).  At the 
top of its trajectory:

It’s acceleration is zero, but not its velocity
1.
It’s velocity is zero as well as its acceleration
2.
3. Neither its velocity nor its acceleration is zero
4.
It’s velocity is zero, but not its acceleration
5. Both its acceleration and its speed are zero

Pre-Class Diagnostic Test

• 50 minutes for diagnostic test, interrupted by lab tours of 
25 min (so 75 min total)

Tours of BEC Experiments

• Students from 3 tables (at a time)  will go upstairs 
to look at Bose-Einstein Condensate experiments 
at the Center for Ultra Cold Atoms 

http://www.rle.mit.edu/cua/default.htm

• Video of Prof. Wolfgang Ketterle Lecture on BEC

What is % difference
in temperature between
summer and winter?
15 % (Kelvin!)
i.e. - not much!
Ratio of hottest to coldest?
