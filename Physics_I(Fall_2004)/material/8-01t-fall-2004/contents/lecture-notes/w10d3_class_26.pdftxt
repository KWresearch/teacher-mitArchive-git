Constants of the Motion
When are the conserved quantities, momentum, 
energy, and angular momentum about a point S, 
constant for a system? 

• No external torques about point S: angular 
momentum about S is constant

PRS Question
A tetherball of mass m is attached to a post of 
radius  by a string. Initially it is a distance r0
from the center of the post and it is moving 
tangentially with a speed v0 . The string passes 
through a hole in the center of the post at the 
top. The string is gradually shortened by 
drawing it through the hole. Ignore gravity. Until 
the ball hits the post, 

1. The energy and angular momentum about the 
center of the post are constant.

2. The energy of the ball is constant but the 
angular momentum about the center of the post 
changes.

3. Both the energy and the angular momentum 
about the center of the post, change.

4. The energy of the ball changes but the angular 
momentum about the center of the post is 
constant.

PRS Question: Solution

• The tension force points 
radially in; so torque 
about central point is 
zero: angular momentum 
about central point is 
constant.

• All radial forces, for 
example  gravitation, 
have angular momentum 
about central point 
constant

PRS Question
A tetherball of mass m is attached to a post of 
radius R by a string. Initially it is a distance r0
from the center of the post and it is moving 
tangentially with a speed v0.  The string wraps 
around the outside of the post. Ignore gravity. 
Until the ball hits the post, 

1. The energy and angular momentum about the 
center of the post are constant.

2. The energy of the ball is constant but the 
angular momentum about the center of the 
post changes.

3. Both the energy of the ball and the angular 
momentum about the center of the post, 
change.

4. The energy of the ball changes but the 
angular momentum about the center of the 
post is constant.

PRS Question: Solution

• The tension force 
points towards 
contact point; so 
torque about central 
point is not zero: 
angular momentum 
about central point is 
not constant.

PRS Question

A streetcar is freely coasting (no friction) around a 
large circular track. It is then switched to a small 
circular track. When coasting on the smaller circle 
the streetcar's 

1. mechanical energy is conserved and angular 
momentum about the center is conserved
2. mechanical energy is not conserved and angular 
momentum about the center is conserved
3. mechanical energy is not conserved and angular 
momentum about the center is not conserved
4. mechanical energy is conserved and angular 
momentum about the center is not conserved.
