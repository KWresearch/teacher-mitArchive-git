Problem 1

An object goes from one point in space 
to another. After it arrives at its 
destination, its displacement is: 

1)  either greater than or equal to   


2)  always greater than  


3)  always equal to   


4)  either smaller than or equal to  


5)  always smaller than  


6)  either smaller or larger than   


the distance it traveled. 


Problem 2


You are throwing a ball straight up in  

the air. At the highest point, the ballâ€™s  


1) 

velocity and acceleration are zero  


2) 
velocity is nonzero but its  

acceleration is zero 


3) 
acceleration is nonzero, but its 
velocity is zero 

4) 
velocity and acceleration are both 
nonzero. 

Problem 3 

The graph shows position as a function of time 
for two trains running on parallel tracks. Which 
is true: 

1)  At time  t  , both trains have the same
B 
velocity. 

2)  Both trains speed up all the time. 

3)  Both trains have the same velocity at some 
time before  t  .B 

4)  Somewhere on the graph, both trains have 
the same acceleration. 

Problem 4


Two stones are released from rest at a 
certain height, one after the other. 
Will the difference in their speeds 

1)  Increase 


2)  decrease,  


3)  or stay the same?  


Problem 5


Two stones are released from rest, at the 
same height above the ground, one after 
the other. Will their vertical separation 
distance 

1)  increase 

2)  decrease,  

3)  or stay the same?  


Problem 6


Two stones are released from rest, at the 
same height above the ground, one after 
the other. Will the time interval between 
the instants at which they hit the ground 
be 

1)  smaller than,  


2)  equal to,  

3)  or larger than  


the time interval between the instants of 
their release? 

Problem 7


A person standing at the edge of a cliff 
throws one ball straight up and another 
ball straight down, each at the same 
initial speed. Neglecting air resistance, 
the ball to hit the ground below the cliff 
with the greater speed is the one 
initially thrown 

1)  upward; 

2)  downward; 


neither; they both hit at the same 
3) 
speed. 

Problem 8 

A cart on a roller-coaster rolls down the track 
shown below. As the cart rolls beyond the point 
shown, what happens to its speed and 
acceleration in the direction of motion? 

1)  Both decrease;  


2)  The speed decreases, but the acceleration 

increases; 

3)  Both remain constant; 

4)  The speed increases, but acceleration 
decreases; 

5)  Both increase; 

6)  Some other combination.
