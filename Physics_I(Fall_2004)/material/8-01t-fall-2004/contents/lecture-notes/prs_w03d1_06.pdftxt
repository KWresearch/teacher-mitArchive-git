Problem 1: 


A constant force is exerted on a cart that is 
initially  at  rest  on  an  air  track.  Friction 
between the cart and the track is negligible. 
The force acts for a short time interval and 
gives  the  cart  a  certain  final  speed. To  reach 
the same final speed with a force that is only 
half  as  big,  the  force must  be  exerted  on  the 
cart for a time interval 

1. four times as long as 
2. twice as long as 
3. equal to 
4. half as long as 
5. a quarter of 

that for the stronger force. 


Problem 2: 


A constant force is exerted for a short time 
interval on a cart that is initially at rest on an 
air track. This force gives the cart a certain 
final speed. The same force is exerted for 
the same length of time on another cart, also 
initially at rest, that has twice the mass of 
the first one. The final speed of the heavier 
cart is 

1. one-fourth 
2. four times 
3. half 
4. double 
5. the same as 

that of the lighter cart. 


Problem 3: 


You are a passenger in a car and not wearing 
your seat belt. Without increasing or 
decreasing its speed, the car makes a sharp 
left turn, and you find yourself colliding 
with the right-hand door. Which is the 
correct analysis of the situation? 

1. Before and after the collision, there is a 
rightward force pushing you into the 
door. 

2. Starting at the time of collision, the door 
exerts a leftward force on you. 

3. both of the above. 

4. neither of the above. 

Problem 4: 


Consider a car at rest. We can conclude that 
the downward gravitational pull of Earth on 
the car and the upward contact force of 
Earth on it are equal and opposite because 

1. the two forces form an interaction pair. 

2. the net force on the car is zero. 

3. neither of the above. 

Problem 5: 


A person is initially standing inside a closed 
box that is resting on a scale. The person 
jumps in the air. Assume the scale can adjust 
instantaneously to any change in applied 
force. While the person is in the air inside 
the box, does the scale 

a)

 increase its reading from when the 
person is standing on the floor? , 

b) 
decrease its reading from when the 
person is standing on the floor? , 

c)

 give the same reading from when the 
person is standing on the floor? . 

d)  Cannot decide. 


Problem 6: 


Consider a person standing in an elevator 
that is accelerating upward. The upward 
normal force N exerted by the elevator floor 
on the person is 

1. larger than 
2. identical to 
3. smaller than 

the downward force of gravity on the 
person. 

Problem 7: 


You are pushing a wooden crate across the 
floor at constant speed. You decide to turn 
the crate on end, reducing by half the 
surface area in contact with the floor. In the 
new orientation, to push the same crate 
across the same floor with the same speed, 
the force that you apply must be about 

1. four times as great 
2. twice as great 
3. equally great 
4. half as great 
5. one-fourth as great 

as the force required  before you changed 
the crateâ€™s orientation. 

Problem 8: 


An object is held in place by friction on an 
inclined surface. The angle of inclination is 
increased until the object starts moving. If 
the surface is kept at this angle, the object 

1. slows down. 
2. moves at uniform speed. 
3. speeds up. 
4. none of the above 

Problem 9: 


A massive rope pulls a block with friction 
between the block and the table. Is the tension in 
the rope 

1) 

2) 

3) 

greater than the pulling force? 

equal to the pulling force? 

less than the pulling force? 

Problem 10: 


A force sensor on a cart is attached via a string to a hanging 
weight. The cart is initially held. When the cart is allowed 
to move does the tension in the string 

1. increase? 

2. stay the same? 

3. decrease? 

4. cannot determine. Need more information about  

friction acting on the system.
