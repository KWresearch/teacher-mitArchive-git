Acceleration


When an object moves in a circular orbit, 
the acceleration has two components, 
tangential and radial. 

Tangential Acceleration


the tangential acceleration is just the rate of change of

Uniform Circular Motion 


•	 object is constrained to move in a circle 
and total tangential force acting on the 
object is zero,  then by Newton’s Second 
Law, the tangential acceleration is zero 
atan   = 0 
•	 magnitude of the velocity (speed) remains 
constant 

Period and Frequency

•	 The amount of time to complete one circular orbit of radius R is 
called the period. 

•	

In one period the object travels a distance  equal to the
circumference, 

•	 Period: 

s = 2πR vT 

= 
= 2πR R
T = 2πR v
 ω= 2π ω

•	 Frequency is the inverse of the period 
f = 1 / T =ω/ 2π 

•	 Units [sec-1] ≡ [Hz] 

 
Radial Acceleration


•	 Any object traveling in 
a circular orbit with a 
constant speed is 
always accelerating 
towards the center 

•  Direction of velocity is 

constantly changing

Class Problem


Two objects of mass m are whirling around a shaft with a constant  

angular velocity ω. First object is a distance d  from central axis,  

and second object is a distance 2d from the axis. You may ignore

the effect of gravity.


a)  Draw separate force diagrams 
for each object. 

b) What is the tension in the string 
between the shaft and the first object? 

c) What is the tension in the string 
between the first object and the second object?
