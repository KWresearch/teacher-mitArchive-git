system and its surroundings between the 
final state and the initial state is zero,

Conservation of Momentum: 
 
Isolated System
 
When the total external force on a system 
is zero, then the total initial momentum of 
the system equals the total final

Identify the objects that compose the system 

Identify your initial and final states of the system 

Choose symbols to identify each mass and velocity in the system. 

Identify a set of positive directions and unit vectors for each state. 

Decide whether you are using components or magnitudes for your 
velocity symbols.

Planar Collision Theory: Energy
 

Types of Collisions in Two Dimensions: 

•  Elastic: Kf = Ki 

•  Inelastic: Kf < Ki 

•  Completely Inelastic: Only one body emerges
 

•  Superelastic: Kf > Ki

PRS Question  
 
Suppose a golf ball is hurled at a heavy bowling ball initially at
rest and bounces elastically from the bowling ball. After the 
collision, 

The golf ball has the greater momentum and  the greater kinetic 
energy. 

The bowling ball has the greater momentum and  the greater
kinetic energy. 

The golf ball has the greater momentum but has the smaller 
kinetic energy. 

The bowling ball has the greater momentum  but has the smaller 
kinetic energy.

PRS Question  
 
Consider the exothermic reaction (final kinetic energy is greater than 
the initial kinetic energy). 
H  + H  → H 2  + 5ev
Two hydrogen atoms collide and produce a diatomic hydrogen 
molecule. Using only the principles of classical mechanics, this 
reaction 

1. Is possible.
2. either violates conservation of energy or conservation of momentum 
but not both 
3. satisfies conservation of energy and momentum but is not possible 
for other reasons. 

 
Worked Example: Two 
 
Dimensional Elastic Collision
 
Consider an elastic collision between two 
 
particles. In the laboratory reference frame, the
 
first particle with mass m1, the incident particle,
 
is moving with an initial given velocity v10. The 
 
second ‘target’ particle is of mass m2 = m1  and at  
 
rest. After the collision, the first particle moves
off at a measured angle θ1f  = 45o  with respect to
the initial direction of motion of the incident 
particle with an unknown final velocity v1f. 
Particle two moves off at unknown angle θ2f with 
an unknown final velocity v2f. Find v1f , v2f , and 
θ2f.

Strategy
 

Three unknowns: θ2f  , v1f, and v2f 

1.	  Eliminate θ2f  by squaring momentum equations and
adding equations and solve for v2f  in terms of v1f 

2.	  Substitute expression for v2f  kinetic energy equation
and solve possible quadratic equation for  v1f 
3.	  Use result to find expression for v2f 

4.	  Divide momentum equations to obtain expression for  
 
θ2f
