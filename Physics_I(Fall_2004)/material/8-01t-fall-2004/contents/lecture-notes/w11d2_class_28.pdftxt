Review #3:  

Collisions, Rotational Motion


Momentum - Model

From Principia: Momentum is defined as “the quantity of 
motion, conjointly proportional to the mass and the velocity”. 
momentum is for a system of particles

Strategies: Momentum and  

External Forces 


Identify all forces acting on the masses

1. 	
2. 	 Select your system (make troublesome forces 
into internal forces; make ΣFext  = 0) 
3.	 ΣFext  = 0 implies momentum is conserved

Strategy - Impulse

Impulse most useful when time is short, simplifying the 
momentum change during the short time ∆t. 

A.  One large external force dominates ∆p: 
•Ball bouncing on floor - ignore gravity 
B.  Finite Fext  for very short ∆t -->  ∆psystem  = 0 
•Colliding cars - ignore horizontal friction 
•Gun and Bullet - ignore external forces 

Collisions: Momentum Conserved  

When the total external force on the colliding 
particles is much smaller than the internal 
forces, the collision duration is so short that 
the impulse on the system is approximately 
zero. 
Then the total initial momentum of the colliding 
particles equals their final momentum:

-class problem

A planet of mass m1  is in a circular orbit of radius R 
around a sun of mass m2. 

a. Find the period, T 
b. Find the ratio of kinetic to potential energy

c. As R increases, all of the physical properties of the 

orbit (e.g. velocity) decrease except one; find it.
