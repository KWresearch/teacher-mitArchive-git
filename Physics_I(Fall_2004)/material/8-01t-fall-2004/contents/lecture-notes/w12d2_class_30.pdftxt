Pascal’s Law


•	 Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is 
transmitted undiminished to every portion 
of the fluid and the walls of the containing 
vessel 

Archimedes’ Principle


•	 The buoyant force in a liquid is equal in 
magnitude to the gravitational force on 
the displaced volume of liquid

PRS Question 1

Imagine holding two bricks under water. Brick A 
is just beneath the surface of the water, while
brick B  is at a greater depth. The force needed
to hold brick B  in place is 

1.  larger 
2.  the same as 
3.  smaller 

than the force required to hold brick A  in place.


PRS Question 2

A 200-ton ship enters the lock of a canal. The
fit between the sides of the lock and the ship is
tight so that the weight of the water left in the
lock after it closes is much less than 200 tons. 
Can the ship still float if the quantity of water
left in the lock is much less than the ship's
weight? 

1.  Yes, as long as the water gets up to the ship's
waterline. 
2.  No, the ship touches bottom because it weighs
more than the water in the lock. 

PRS Question 3


When a hole is made in the side of a container 
holding water, water flows out and follows a 
parabolic trajectory. If the container is dropped 
in free fall, the water flow 

1.  diminishes. 
2.  stops altogether. 
3.  goes out in a straight line. 

4.  curves upward. 

PRS Question 4

A container is filled with oil and fitted on both ends with 
pistons. The area of the left piston is 10 mm2; that
of the right piston 10,000 mm2. What force must be
exerted on the left piston to keep the 10,000-N car
on the right at the same height? 

1.  10 N 
2.  100 N 
3.  10,000 N 
4.  106 N 
5.  108 N 
6.  insufficient information 


PRS Question 5


Two cups are filled to the same level with 
water. One of the two cups has ice cubes 
floating in it. Which weighs more? 

1.  The cup without ice cubes.  

2.  The cup with ice cubes. 
3.  The two weigh the same. 

PRS Question 6

Two cups are filled to the same level with
water. One of the two cups has ice cubes
floating in it. When the ice cubes melt, in
which cup is the level of the water
higher? 

1.  The cup without ice cubes.  

2.  The cup with ice cubes. 
3.  It is the same in both. 

PRS Question 7

Two cups are filled to the same level with
water. One of the two cups has plastic
balls floating in it. If the density of the
plastic balls is less than that of ice, which
of the two cups weighs more? 

1.  The cup without plastic balls.  

2.  The cup with plastic balls. 
3.  The two weigh the same. 

PRS Question 8


A piece of lead is fastened on top of a large solid piece
of Styrofoam that floats in a container of water.
Because of the weight of the lead, the water line is
flush with the top surface of the Styrofoam. If the piece 
of Styrofoam is turned upside down so that the piece of
lead is now suspended underneath it, 

1.	
2.	
3.	

the arrangement sinks. 
the water line is below the top surface of the Styrofoam. 

the water line is still flush with the top surface of the 
Styrofoam. 

PRS Question 9


A piece of lead is fastened on top of a large solid piece
of Styrofoam that floats in a container of water.
Because of the weight of the lead, the water line is
flush with the top surface of the Styrofoam. If the piece 
of Styrofoam is turned upside down, so that the piece
of lead is now suspended underneath it, the water level
in the container 

1.  rises. 
2.  drops. 
3.  remains the same. 


PRS Question 10

A piece of lead is fastened on top of a large
solid piece of Styrofoam, and the combination
floats in a container of water. Suppose the lead
becomes unfastened and sinks to the bottom of 
the container. After the lead has sunk, the
height of the water in the container will be 

1.  higher. 
2.  the same. 
3.  lower. 
4.  than it was before the combination separated. 


PRS Question 11


A boat carrying a large boulder is floating 
on a lake. The boulder is thrown 
overboard and sinks. The water level in 
the lake (with respect to the shore) 

1.  rises. 
2.  drops. 
3.  remains the same.  


PRS Question 12

Consider an object that floats in water
but sinks in oil. When the object floats in
water, half of it is submerged. If we
slowly pour oil on top of the water so it
completely covers the object, the object 

1.  moves up. 
2.  stays in the same place.  

3.  moves down. 

PRS Question 13


Consider an object floating in a container 
of water. If the container is placed in an 
elevator that accelerates upward, 

1.  more of the object is below water.  

2.  less of the object is below water.  

3.  there is no difference. 

PRS Question 14


Which weighs more? 

1.  a bathtub filled to the brim with water  

2.  the same bathtub brim full with water 
with a battleship floating in it 
3.  both weigh the same  


Class Problem


A rock of mass m, suspended by a rope, is 
completely immersed in a beaker of water 
that sits on a scale. The beaker of water 
has mass mb. What weight does the scale 
measure? Is this weight equal to, less 
than, or greater than the weight of the rock 
and beaker? 

Class Problem

•	 One of the moons of Jupiter, Europa, is reported 
to have its surface covered by an ocean of water
which is 100 km deep. The outermost 8 km are
frozen as ice. The radius of Europa is 
approximately 1/4 the radius of the earth.
Estimate the pressure at the bottom of Europa’s
ocean. (Note: there is some speculation that the
combination of  internal heat and water makes 
the ocean of Europa the best candidate in the 
solar system outside the earth for organized life
to evolve.
