Temperature


•	 The ‘hotness’ or ‘coldness’ of an object is a macroscopic 
property of that object. 

•	 When a cold object is placed in contact with a hot object, the 
cold object warms up and the hot object cools down until the
two objects reach a state of thermal equilibrium. 

•	 Temperature is a quantitative description of the hotness or 
coldness of a system. 

What is temperature? 


-A measure of energy 


-Random Motion of Molecules (kinetic energy)

-Air at Mountaintop (potential energy)

-Only some of energy can become mechanical


Equipartition Assumption


•	 A system that has a temperature is in thermal 
equilibrium 

•  <energy in a degree of freedom> = 1/2 kBT 
What is a Degree of Freedom? 
Each coordinate of each particle 

2> = 1/2 m <vy
1/2 m <vx

2>= 1/2 m <vz

2>= 1/2 kBT 

m g <z> = 1/2 kBT 

Heat 


•	

If two bodies are in contact but initially have 
different temperatures, heat will transfer or flow
between them if they are brought into contact. 

•	 heat is the energy transferred, given the symbol

Q. 

Thermal Equilibrium 

Definition: Adiabatic boundary means no heat flow

(a 
dia  

If both A and B are in thermal contact with a third system C
until thermal equilibrium is reached, the average energy
per mode is equal to 1/2kT for all parts of the system. 

Then remove adiabatic boundary, no heat will flow between
A and B 

Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics


•	 Two systems in thermal equilibrium with a third 
system are in thermal equilibrium with each other. 

•	 Temperature is that property of a system that 
determines whether or not a system is in thermal
equilibrium with other systems. 

Temperature and Equilibrium

•  Temperature is Energy per Degree of Freedom

–  More on this later (Equipartition) 
•	 Heat flows form hotter to colder object 
Until temperatures are equal 
Faster if better thermal contact 
Even flows at negligible ∆t (for reversible process) 

•	 The Unit of Temperature is the Kelvin 
Absolute zero (no energy) is at 0.0 K 
Ice melts at 273.15 Kelvin (0.0 C) 
Fahrenheit scale is arbitrary 

Heat and Work are Processes


•	 Processes accompany/cause state changes 
– Work  along particular path to  state B from A 
–  Heat added along path to B from A 

•  Processes are not state variables

–  Processes change the state! 
–  But Eq. Of State generally obeyed 

State Variables of System

•	 State Variables - Definition 
Measurable Static Properties 
Fully Characterize System (if constituents known) 
e.g. Determine Internal Energy, compressibility
Related by Equation of State


•  State Variables: Measurable Static Properties

–  Temperature - measure with thermometer 
–  Volume (size of container or of liquid in it) 
–  Pressure (use pressure gauge) 
–  Quantity: Mass or Moles or Number of Molecules

•  Of each constituent or phase (e.g. water and ice)

Variables in First Law

• Q is the Heat Added 
– Could find from Temperature Gradient 
•  But need Heat Conductivity and Area 
– Generally determine from First Law 
• W is the Work done by system 
– Equal to p∆V 
• U is the Internal Energy of system

– It is determined by state variables 
– From equipartition, proportional to T

Internal Energy 
Based on Equipartition: 
-each coordinate of each particle 

2> = 1/2 m <vy
2>= 1/2 kBT 
1/2 m <vx
2> = 1/2 kBT ..molecule

1/2 µ <vrel
For an ideal monatomic gas:

U(T)=3/2 N k T 

For an ideal diatomic molecular gas: 
U(T)=5/2 N k T  (no vibration) 

Specific Heat - Constant Volume

Consider a monatomic ideal gas in a container of 
fixed volume. A small amount of heat, dQ is 
added with  dV = 0 so W = 0. The First Law then 
gives: 

dQ = dW + dU=dU 

But 

dU(T)=3/2 N k dT, 

so 
dQ/dT = 3/2 N k = 3/2 n R

cV  =3/2 R is defined as the specific heat 
- heats one mole one degree Kelvin 

Class Problem: Heat the room

A room is 3x5x6 meters and initially at T = 0C. 
How long will it take a 1 kW electric heater to 
raise the air temperature to 20C? 

1. 1/2 min 
2. 3/4 min 
3. 1 1/4 min 
4. None of above 

5.  11 min

6. 17 min

7.  28 min


Note: In reality it will take several times this long 
because the walls and furnishings in the room 
have to be warmed up also. 

Specific Heat of Aluminum

Aluminum has an atomic weight of 27 (grams per 
mole), and has 3 translational and 3 vibrational 
degrees of freedom per atom.  What is its 
specific heat in j/kg/K? 

1. 1806 
2. 903 
3. 452 
4. None of above

Young and Freedman gives 910 as the correct answer 
this shows how close the simple ideas come to 
reality. 

Class Problem: Heat the walls

How much longer will it take a 1 kW electric 
heater to raise the wall temperature to 20C? 
Assume the walls and ceiling are Aluminum 1 
cm thick that is initially at T = 0C.
