Experiment 5B: Friction 

Goal 


To investigate the friction 
of a string wrapped around 
a cylinder, observe that it 
increases exponentially, 
and to measure the friction 
coefficient µ. 

(A theoretical expression is derived in the appendix to 
the write up for the experiment.) 

Starting DataStudio:

Create a new experiment. Plug a force sensor into the 
750 and drag it to the input in the Setup window. 

Double-click the Force Sensor icon.


Force Sensor:


Set it for 10 samples/s and low sensitivity. 

Click 

Sampling Options:


No boxes checked. 

No delayed start. 

Stop after 10 s.


Set Up :


Choose large or  

small cylinder.


Both kinds at  

each table. 


100 gm brass 
weight + 5 gm 
holder = 1.03 N. 

Small Cylinder 

Large Cylinder


Measuring technique: 

Tare the force sensor.

Ensure string passes over pulley before all  

measurements.

Do not wrap the string over itself.

Wrap string 2 ¼ turns around cylinder.


Increase ccw torque on cylinder smoothly to the slipping 
point, then turn slowly for 1 or 2 seconds. 
Practice this, so you get 1 or 2 peaks of the force in 10 s, 
then record the force with DataStudio. 

Measuring the Friction: 


Choose the largest magnitude of Force as the friction. 
Use the Smart Tool or the Statistics (Σ) Tool. 

Recording the Friction: 

Measure the friction for the string wrapped ¼, 1¼, 2¼, 
3¼ and 4¼ turns. Express these in radians and type them 
as the independent variable, along with the friction force 
as the dependent variable, into a table in DataStudio. 

Include the force of 1.03 N when the wrap angle is 0 as 
an entry in your table. 

Plot the table on a graph and carry out a User-Defined 
Fit with the function 1.03*exp(-C*x).
