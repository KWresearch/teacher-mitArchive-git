Experiment  09:  Angular  Momentum 

Section: 

Table  and  Group: 

Participants: 

Each group need turn in only one report.  Make sure that you each have a copy of your data, 
as  you  will  need  it  for  a  problem  on  Problem  Set  11.  (You  can  ﬁnd  a  copy  of  the  problem 
at  the  end  of  the  notes  for  the  experiment.) 

Part  One:  Rotor  Moment  of  Inertia 
For  your  apparatus,  what  ω  (in  radians/sec)  corresponded  to  1 V  generator  output ? 

Enter  your  measurements  for  αup  and  αdown  into  the  table  below.  Following  the  discussion 
on  page  4,  calculate  a,  T  and  τup  and  enter  them  into  the  table. 

αdown 

αup 

a 

T 

τup 

1.  In  your  problem  set  assignment  you  will  derive  this  formula  for  IR . 
mr(g − rαup )
αup  + |αdown | 
Use  it  here  to  ﬁnd  a  numerical  value  for  the  rotor moment  of  inertia. 

IR  = 

2.  What  value  do  you  calculate  for  the  bearing  friction  τf  ?

Part  Two:  Fast  Collision 
Fill  in  the  table  below  with  the  values  you  found  in  your  experiment. 

ω1 

ω2 

δ t 

The moment  of  inertia  of  the  washer  you  dropped  to  create  the  collision  is  given  by 

IW  =

1 
MW (r 2
2 ) 
o  + ri 
2 

where  ro  = 0.032 m  and  ri  = 0.0135 m.  The  mass  of  the  washer,  MW ,  is  written  on  the 
washer. 

1.  What  was  the mass MW  of  your  washer ? 

2.  What  was  its moment  of  inertia  IW  ? 

Part  Three:  Slow  Collision 
Fill  in  the  table  below  with  the  values  you  found  in  your  experiment.
