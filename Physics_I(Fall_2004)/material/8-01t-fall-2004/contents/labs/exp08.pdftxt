Experiment  08:  Physical  Pendulum 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  investigate  rigid  body  rotational 
dynamics  by  studying  a  pendulum  made  of  a  rigid  body. 
This  is  called  a  “physical  pendulum”  to  distinguish  it  from 
the  “ideal  pendulum”  which  consists  of  a  point  mass  on  a 
string.  You  will  use  the  DataStudio  motion  sensor  to  mea­
sure the period of the pendulum.  This will give you practice in 
•	 calculating moments  of  inertia, 
•	 calculating  the  period  of  a  physical  pendulum,  and 
•	 possibly  determining  how  good  the  approximation 
sin θ  =  θ  (made  in  deriving  the  equation  of  motion  for 
the  pendulum)  is. 

Setting  Up  the  Experiment: 
The  pendulum  is  made  by  hanging  a  metal  ruler  over  a 
in.  dia.  rod  clamped  to  the  vertical  rod  of  a  support  stand.

As  the  ruler  is  1.0 m  long  (longer  than  the  support  rod  for 
the  stand),  place  the  rod  in  the  hole  near  the  apex  of  the  tri­
angular  base  and  locate  the  stand  so  the  ruler  can  hang  over 
the  edge  of  the  table—as  shown  in  the  photo  to  the  left.  The 
motion  sensor  should  be  placed  over  the  rod  so  that  the  ruler 
is  four  to  six  inches  front  of  it  when  hanging  at  rest.  Set  the 
motion  sensor  on  its  narrow  beam.  When  the  ruler  is  in  front 
of  the  motion  sensor,  it  will  report  a  distance  0.10  to  0.15 m; 
when  it  is  not,  a  larger  distance will  be  reported.  The motion 
sensor  should  be  set  to  a  sample  rate  of  120;  that  should  let 
you  measure  the  pendulum  period  to  an  accuracy  of  ±0.01 s. 
Note:  when  the  motion  sensor  tries  to  detect  a  distant  tar­
get  (e.g.,  with  the  ruler  out  of  the  way)  it  will  sample  at  a 
much  lower  rate.  To  time  the  pendulum  period  accurately, 
you  should  place  a  target  (such  as  the  back  of  a  chair)  about 
0.3  to  0.4 m  away—for  the  motion  sensor  to  detect  when  the 
ruler  has moved  aside. 

You  should  set  up  DataStudio  with  Automatic  Start  “None”  and  Delayed  Stop  after  10 s.

(The period of the pendulum is about 1.6 s.)  Set the motion sensor to measure only position

and make  a  graph  to  plot  position  vs.  time.

For  each  measurement  pull  the  bottom  end  of  ruler  aside  by  the  desired  distance  (between

10  and  50 cm),  then  release  the  ruler  and  click  the  DataStudio  start  button  at  about  the 
same  time.  When  the  ruler  is  in  the  ultrasound  beam  from  the  motion  sensor,  it  will 
measure  the  distance  to  the  ruler,  about  10  to  15 cm.  When  it  is  to  the  side  of  the  beam, 
the  motion  sensor  will  measure  the  distance  to  the  chair  you  placed  in  the  beam,  about 
40 cm.  You  do  not  care  about  the  distance  to  the  ruler  and  only  want  to  detect  the  times 
when  the  ruler  passes  in  front  of  the  sensor.  You  should  be  aware  that  the  motion  sensor 
can  give  weird  results  for  the  distance  to  ob jects  closer  than  15 cm.  If  you  seem  to  be 
getting  strange  behavior,  try  sliding  the  ruler  out  on  the  rod  to  get  it  farther  away  from 
the motion  sensor. 

The  graph  above  has  my  results  with  the  graph  scaled  to  show  only  the  ﬁrst  four  seconds. 
As adjacent pulses  correspond  to  the  ruler  swinging  in opposite directions,  to determine  the 
period  of  the  pendulum,  you  must  ﬁnd  the  time  between  two  pulses  that  have  one  pulse 
in  between  them.  Choose  a  point  that  is  easy  to  identify  (on  my  graph  the  point  when 
the  motion  sensor  ﬁrst  detects  the  ruler  seems  to  be  sharply  deﬁned)  and  use  the  Smart 
Tool  on  the  graph—make  sure  it  “locks  on”  to  the  data  points—to  ﬁnd  the  time  when  this 
If  you  position  the  cursor  close  to  the  point  the  Smart  Tool  is  locked  on  to,  the 
occurs. 
cursor  becomes  a  hand  with  a  small  triangle  near  the  index  ﬁnger 
. 

Drag  this  cursor  to  the  corresponding  point  on  the  graph  one  period  later  and  release  it. 
DataStudio  will  calculate  and  display  the  time  diﬀerence  between  the  two  points,  which  is 
the  period  of  the  pendulum.  As  you  can  see  on my  graph,  it  is  1.62 s. 
You  should  measure  the  period  with  the  ruler  started  10,  25,  and  50 cm  to  the  side  of  its 
vertical  equilibrium  position;  these  displacements  do  not  need  to  be  very  accurate,  so  you 
may  guess  them.  They  correspond  to  angular  amplitudes  θ0  of  about  0.10,  0.25,  and  0.52 
radians.  Complete  a  table  like  this  one:

Next,  try  modifying  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  pendulum  and  observing  how  its  period

changes.  Do  that  by  using  a  1
 1 
4 in.  binder  clip  to  attach  a  50 gm  brass  weight  to  the  ruler.

The  mass  of  the  clip  is  8.6 gm.  The  small  hole  in  the  center  of  the  weight  can  be  used  to 
identify  fairly  accurately  where  the  center  of mass  of  the  weight  is  located. 
You  should  measure  the  period  and  report  the  results  for  the  three  positions  in  the  table 
below.  For  convenience,  you  may  carry  out  these  measurements  with  an  initial  ruler 
displacement  of  20 cm;  it  does  not  matter  much  what  you  choose.  The  “position”  in  the 
table  is  the  distance  from  the  top  end  of  the  ruler  where  the  center  of  mass  of  the  extra 
weight  and  clip  is  located.  The  position  0.50 m  is  where  the  center  of  mass  of  the  ruler  is; 
the mass  of  the  ruler  is  0.159 kg.

Appendix:  Theoretical  Discussions 

1.  The  Ideal  Pendulum 

For  the  ideal  pendulum  the  tangential  restoring  force  is 
mg sin θ  and  the  displacement  is  lθ,  giving  rise  to  the 
equation  of motion  (F  = ma) 

d2θ

with  the  approximation  sin θ ≈ θ  this  becomes

This  is  the  equation  of  motion  for  a  harmonic  oscillator 
� 
whose  angular  frequency  ω0  is 
g/l.  Thus  the  period  of 
oscillation  is 
2π 
= 2π 
l/g  . 
ω0 
Note:  ω0  is  the  angular  frequency  of  oscillation  of  the 
pendulum;  it  is  not  dθ/dt.  It  can  be  confusing  that  the 
same  greek  letter  is  commonly  used  for  both  quantities.

2.  The  Physical  Pendulum 

The  physical  pendulum  is  a  rigid  body  that 
rotates  about  an  axis,  shown  as  P  in  the  ﬁg­
ure  to  the  left. 
Its  equation  of  motion  will  be  τ  =  I α,  where 
I  is the moment of  inerta about the axis of ro­
tation.  Let  us  suppose  that  the  distance  from 
the axis P  to the center of mass CM  is l.  Then 
the  restoring  torque  will  be  mg l sin θ ,  which 
leads  to  the  equation  of motion 

d2θ

with the approximation sin θ ≈ θ this becomes

3.  The  Ruler  Pendulum 
You  need  to  know  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  ruler  about  an  axis  through  the  hole  near 
one  end.  Suppose  the  ruler  has  a  length  b  and  a  width  a.  The  textbook  (Table  9.2)  gives 
an  expression  for  its  moment  of  inertia  about  an  axis  that  passes  through  the  CM  and  is 
perpendicular  to  the  ﬂat  of  the  ruler  as 

m 
ICM  = (a 2  + b2 )  . 
12 

If  the  distance  from  the CM  to  the  pivot  point  P  is  l,  we  can  use  the  parallel  axis  theorem 
(section  9.5  in  the  text)  to  ﬁnd  the moment  of  inertia  about  P  as 

m

using  the  dimensions  of  the  ruler:  a = 0.028 m,  b = 1.000 m,  and  l = 0.479 m.  (The mass  of 
the  ruler  is  0.159 kg.) 

4.  Changing  the  Moment  of  Inertia 
To  calculate  the  period  of  the  pendulum when  a weight  is  clipped  to  it,  you must  know  the 
moment  of  inertia  of  the  ruler  with  the  weight  attached  to  it.  Suppose  the  weight  and  the 
clip  are  point  masses  and  their  centers  of  mass  are  both  located  at  position  p  on  the  ruler. 
As  the  hole  is  2.1 cm  from  the  top  end  of  the  ruler,  the  distance  from  the  pivot  to  the  CM 
of  the  weight  will  be  d  =  p − 0.021 m.  The  moment  of  inertia  (about  P )  of  the  ruler  with 
the  weight  attached  will  then  be 
mr (a 2  + b2 ) + mr l2  + mcd2  + mw d2 
12 

IP  = 

where mr , mc  and mw  are the masses of the ruler,  the clip and the weight,  respectively.  The 
restoring  torque  that  tries  to  return  the  pendulum  to  a  vertical  position  will  be 
τ  = (mr l + mcd + mw d)g sin θ ≈ (mr l + mcd + mw d)gθ  . 

You can use these expressions to calculate the period of oscillation.  As part of the homework 
assignment due November 16, you should derive an expression for the period of the pendulum 
with  the  weight  attached,  evaluate  it,  and  compare  with  the measured  results  you  reported 
in  the  table  at  the  top  of  page 3.  (The mass  of  the  ruler  is  0.159 kg.)

A  Note  on  the  sin θ = θ  Approximation.


The  ﬁgure  above  plots  the  numerical  solutions  to  the  exact  pendulum  equation  of  motion 
for  initial  amplitudes  of  θ0  = 0.10  and  θ0  = 0.45  radians.  The  sin θ  =  θ  approximation  is 
very good when θ0  = 0.10, but the numerical solution shows the actual period  is about 0.8% 
longer  than  the approximation would predict when θ0  = 0.45.  This diﬀerence  (about 0.013 s 
for  your  experiment)  is  about  the  same  as  the  experimental  error,  but  you  may  detect  a 
slightly  longer  period  for  your  largest  amplitude  oscillations. 

The  ﬁrst  order  analytic  correction  to  the  sin θ = θ  approximation  gives  a  period 

T (θ0 ) = T (0)[1 + θ2 
0 /16] 

where  θ0  is  the  angular  amplitude  (in  radians)  of  the  pendulum  motion  and  T (0)  is  the 
period  assuming  the  approximation  is  exact.  (This  is  discussed  in  the  Course  Notes  on 
Rotational  Dynamics.)

Part  Two:  Added  Mass 
Consider  the  eﬀect  of  a  brass  weight  clipped  to  the  ruler.  The  weight  is  shaped  like  a 
washer  with  an  outer  radius  ro  = 0.016 m  and  an  inner  radius  ri  = 0.002 m;  it  has  a  mass 
mw  = 0.050 kg.  It  is  clipped  to  the  ruler  so  that  the  center  of  the  inner  hole  is  over  the 
0.500 m  mark  on  the  ruler,  or  l  = 0.479 m  from  the  pivot  point.  The  clip  has  a  mass  of 
mc  = 0.0086 kg  and  you may  assume  its  center  of mass  is  also  over  the  0.500 m mark  on  the 
ruler.  If  you  treat  the  washer  and  the  clip  as  point  masses,  then,  as  was  discussed  in  the 
notes  for  Experiment  08,  the  combined  unit  has  a moment  of  inertia  about  the  pivot  point 
mr (a 2  + b2 ) + mr l2  + (mc  + mw )d2 
12 

IP  = 

where  d =  l  for  this  situation.  The  restoring  torque  that  tries  to  return  the  pendulum  to  a 
vertical  position  will  be 
τ  = (mr l + mcd + mw d)g sin θ ≈ (mr l + mcd + mw d)gθ  .
