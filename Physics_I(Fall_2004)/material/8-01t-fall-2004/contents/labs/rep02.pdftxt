Indicate which experiment your group performed: 
 
Falling Ball Experiment  
 
Projected Ball Experiment        _________________ 
 
 
Data:  
 
1)  For  either  experiment,  record  the  angle  of  the  tube.  Make  three  measurements  of  the 
height of the exit point of the tube above the ground.  
 
Angle = ________.  Estimated Uncertainty in Angle = ________. 
 
Height: =_________. Estimated Uncertainty in Height = _________. 
 
 
Horizontal distance between impact point on paper and exit point:  
 
Trial 1 ________, Trial 2 ________, Trial 3 ________,  
 
Mean distance = _________.  Estimated Error = _________. 
 
 
What  are  the  errors  in  these  measurements?  You  may  use  as  a  measure  of  your  error  in 
the  distance  the  average  deviation  of  your  measurements.    Or,  if  you  have  a  calculator 
with  statistics  capabilities,  you  may  use  a  standard  deviation.    See  Class  Notes:  Error 
Analysis.

2)  Record  the  results  for  your  three  measurements  for  the  time  interval  for  the  pulse 
width. 
 
Trial 1 ________, Trial 2 ________, Trial 3 ________,  
 
Mean Time for Pulse Width 
 
You  may  use  as  a  measure  of  your  error  in  T∆   the  average  deviation  of  your 
measurements.    Or,  if  you  have  a  calculator  with  statistics  capabilities,  you  may  use  a 
standard deviation.  See Class Notes: Error Analysis. 
 
3)  Let 
D =
T∆   is  the  time  interval  that  the  ball 
12 mm
  is  the  diameter  of  the  ball  and 
travels its diameter when it exits the tube. Based on your result of part 2), calculate the 
average exit velocity,

Question 2: What role does friction play in your measurements?  How would your 
results be changed if the tube were completely frictionless? 
 
 
 
Question  3: What  error  does  your  method  for  measuring  the  pulse  width  introduce  into 
your measurement  for  the average velocity of  the ball? What contribution does  the width 
of the beam make? Can you estimate this effect? How does this error compare with other 
errors in the experiment?
