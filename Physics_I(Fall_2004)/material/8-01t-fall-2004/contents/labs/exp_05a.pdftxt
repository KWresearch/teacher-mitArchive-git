Experiment 5A: Static Equilibrium 

Goal 


When a weight is suspended by two strings as in the 
diagram T = Mg/(2sinθ). The goal is to measure T for 
several values of θ, to verify the equation and the 
diverging tension required for a taught string. 

Starting DataStudio:

Create a new experiment. Plug a force sensor into the 
drag it to the input in the Setup window. 

Double-click the Force Sensor icon.


Force Sensor:


Set it for 10 samples/s and low sensitivity. 

Click 

Set Up T-Square:


Align right edge of ruler on center of 
column of holes so it avoids weight 
hanging in center of string. 
Maintain same horizontal offset 
from ruler to center of pulley. 
You will measure force and vertical 
drop of string along ruler edge. 

Ensure string passes over pulley before all 
measurements. 
Keep line of sight perpendicular to board 
to minimize parallax. 

Sampling Options:


Check all 3 top boxes.

Taking Data:

•Click “Start”; button turns to “Keep”.
•Measure vertical drop, click “Keep”.
•Enter vertical drop into window.

•Shorten string, repeat for 10 to 12 measurements.
•Ensure string passes over pulley.
•Make 2 or 3 measurements with vertical drop 1.25 in or less. 
(String will be tight even without the weight.) 
•Click red stop button when finished.

Analyzing Your Data:

•Calculate sinθ from your vertical drop measurements (see write up).

•Plot force on Y axis, sinθ on X axis. 
•Fit  y = A/x to your data. 

The Report:


Turn in one report page per group.


There is a follow-up homework problem about this 
experiment.
