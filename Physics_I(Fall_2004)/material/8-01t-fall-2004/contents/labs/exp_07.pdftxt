Experiment 7: Momentum 

Set Up :


Use the lighter spring on the force sensor. 
Clip the motion sensor to end of the track. 
Level the track. 
Target cart (B) at rest about 10cm from the spring. 
Incident cart (A) about 16-20cm from motion sensor. 
Velcro facing = inelastic, magnets facing = elastic. 
Roll incident cart just hard enough to come back to its 
starting point. 

Goal 


To investigate the conservation of momentum in elastic 
and inelastic collisions. 
To investigate the amount of kinetic energy available for 
non-conservative work in an inelastic collision. 

The next three slides are graphs typical of those you will 
make during your experiment. Your instructor will 
discuss some of their features. 

Graph 1: 


Two equal mass carts 
A and B collide. 
This is XA  vs. time. 

What is happening: 
1.  Along line AB? 
2.  At point B? 
3.  Along line BC? 
4.  At point C? 
5.  Along line CD? 

Approximately what

time does cart B hit 
the spring?

Graph 2: 


Two equal mass carts 
A and B collide. 
This is VA  vs. time. 

What is happening:

1.  Along line AB?

2.  Along line BC?

3.  Along line CD?

4.  Along line DE?

5.  Along line EF?


What is VB  when cart A is 

half way along line BC? 


Graph 3: 

A cart of mass 0.25kg 
collides with a spring 
on the force sensor. 
Here is the force 
during the collision. 
The fit is to: 
A*sin(2π(x-C)/T) 

What does the area under the curve tell you?

What can you learn from the parameter T? 

Starting DataStudio:

Create a new experiment. Plug force and motion sensors 
into the 750 and drag their icons to inputs in the Setup 
window. 

Double-click the Force Sensor icon.


Sensors:

Set force sensor for 500 
samples/s & low sensitivity. 

Calibrate motion sensor, set 
trigger rate to 80.

Sampling Options:


Position falls below 0.3m. 
Position rises above 0.3m. 
Measure and plot position, velocity and force. 

Inelastic Collisions:


Use Statistics Tool (Σ) to measure velocities vA,1  and v2, 
before and after the collisions. Complete the table.

Elastic Collisions:

Measure vA,1  vA,2  as 
before. 
Determine the spring 
impulse J. (Σ tool)
