Experiment 8: Physical Pendulum 

Set Up :


Suspend 1m ruler so it can swing over 
edge of table. 
Measure the period of oscillation with 
the DataStudio  motion sensor. 
Set motion sensor on narrow beam, aim 
it to just miss support rod and hit ruler 
about 25 cm away. 
Place a chair about 40-50 cm from 
motion sensor to intercept ultrasound 
beam when ruler swings out of beam. 

Goal 


To investigate oscillation of a real (physical) pendulum 
and compare with an ideal (point mass) pendulum. 

Practice calculating moments of inertia, using them, and 
solving τ = I α equation of motion. 

The next graph is typical of those you will make during 
your experiment. Your instructor will discuss some of its 
features. 

Graph: 

Position vs. time data 
from the motion 
sensor. 

What is happening:

1.  Along the top plateaus 
marked by A? 
2.  At the downward 
peaks marked by B? 

How do you use this  

graph to find the 

period of oscillation 

of the pendulum?


Starting DataStudio:

Create a new experiment. Plug a motion sensor into the 

750 and drag its icon to an input in the Setup window.


Double-click the Motion Sensor icon, set trigger rate to 120. 
Plot position vs. time. 

Ruler Pendulum: 

Click 
Delayed Start = None. 

Automatic Stop = 10 sec.


Pull ruler aside (from 10 to 50 cm) and release it to swing  

at the same time you start DataStudio.

Measure periods for table below.

Period 

Clip a 50 gm brass weight to the ruler at positions in table 
in order to change the moment of inertia. (Clip is 8.6 gm.) 
Measure the period of oscillation.
