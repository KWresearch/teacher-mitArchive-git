Experiment  07:  Momentum 

Section: 

Table  and  Group: 

Participants: 

Each group need turn in only one report.  Make sure that you each have a copy of your data, 
as  you will  need  it  for  a  problem  on  Problem  Set  9.  (You  can  ﬁnd  a  copy  of  the  problem  at 
the  end  of  the  notes  for  the  experiment.) 

Part  One:  Inelastic  Collisions 
Enter  your  data  for  the  three  inelastic  collisions  into  the  table  below.

Question  1:  Is  the  kinetic  energy  constant  in  these  collisions?  If  not,  where  did  this  energy 
go?  Is  it  a  reversible  process?

Part  Two:  Elastic  Collisions 
Enter  the  results measured  by  your  group  for  elastic  collisions  into  the  table  below. 
If  you  assume  that  cart B  collides  elastically with  the  force  sensor,  then  during  the  collision 
the  momentum  of  cart  B  changes  by  Δ�pB  = −2mB �vB ,2 .  This  change  in  momentum  is  the 
impulse  that  the  force  sensor  exerts  on  the  target  cart  B.  Cart  B  therefore  exerts  an  equal 
and  opposite  impulse  on  the  force  sensor;  both  have  magnitude  J  = 2mB vB ,2 .  Measuring 
this  impulse  allows  you  to  calculate  the  velocity  of  the  target  cart  after  the  collision,  vB ,2  = 
J/2mB .

Question  2:  What  is  the  average  impulse  of  cart  A  on  cart  B  during  each  of  the  three 
collisions?  While  the  carts  were  colliding,  did  the  total  kinetic  energy  change?  If  so,  where 
did  this  energy  go?
