Experiment  05B:  Friction 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  will  study  the  friction  between  a  string  and  a  plastic  cylinder.  You 
should  observe: 
•	 The  ideal  case  where  there  is  a  coeﬃcient  of  static  friction  that  is  obviously  greater 
than  the  coeﬃcient  of  sliding  friction may  not  apply  in  all  situations. 
•	 The  friction  force  between  the  string  and  cylinder  increases  exponentially  with  the 
distance  the  string  is  wrapped  around  the  cylinder. 
•	 You  will  measure  an  eﬀective  coeﬃcient  of  friction  by  ﬁtting  an  exponential  function 
to  your  data. 

Setting  Up  the  Apparatus: 

Use  the  same  apparatus  as  for  the  static  equilibrium  experiment,  but  remove  the  sliding 
T­square  and  attach  the  plastic  cylinder  near  the  top  center  of  the  board.  The  cylinder  has 
a  handle  so  you  can  turn  it  and  two  regions  for wrapping  the  string.  One  has  a  diameter  of 
0.5 in  and  the  other  of  1.0 in.  You may  use  either  one,  but  discuss  with  the  other  groups  at 
your  table  to make  sure  that  both  diameters  are  being  used  at  your  table. 
The  diameter  you  are  using  should  be  placed  closest  to  the  mounting  board;  note  that  the 
two  diameters  use  diﬀerent  mounting  holes.  Choose  the  mounting  hole  so  that  a  string 
passing over the pulley to the force sensor and around the plastic cylinder will be horizontal.

Here  are  photos  showing  more  details  of  how  the 
cylinder may  be  used. 
One end of the string passes over or wraps around 
the  cylinder  and  is  attached  to  a  brass  weight  by 
a  plastic  holder.  The  other  passes  over  a  bearing 
as  a  low­friction  pulley  to  transmit  the  tension 
force  to  the  force  sensor.  It  is  very  important 
for  the  string  to  pass  over  this  pulley  for  all 
your  measurements  so  that  the  force  will 
be  measured  correctly.  Try  to  avoid wrapping 
the  string  over  itself. 
Choose  a  brass  weight  of  mass  100 gm;  then  the 
weight  of  the  brass  plus  holder  (105 gm  mass) 
will  be  1.03 N.

Setting  Up  DataStudio: 
To  begin,  plug  the  force  sensor  into  the  750  interface  and  start  up  DataStudio. 

Drag  the  force  sensor  icon  to  the  interface  in  the  Experiment  Setup  window.  Double­click 
the  force  sensor  icon  to  open  a  window  to  set  the  Sensor  Properties.  Under  the  “General” 
tab,  choose  a  sample  rate  of  10 Hz,  and  “Slow  Force  Changes  (Spring  Tests)”.  Under  the 
“Calibration”  tab,  choose  Sensitivity:  “Low  (1x)”.  (The  force  sensor  records  force  as  a 
negative  number  when  you  pull  on  it.) 

Next,  click  the  Options 

button.

On  the Manual Sampling  tab  of 
the  Sampling  Options  window 
that opens, make sure that none 
of  the  boxes  are  checked.  Set 
the  delayed  start  to  none,  and 
automatic  stop  to  10 s. 

Measuring  the  Friction:

4 turns  around  the  cylinder  and  hang  the  weight  from  it,  as  in  the

Wind  the  string  2 +  1 
photos on  the  second page.  Hold  the weight  so  there  is no  tension  in  the  string and  tare  the 
force  sensor.  Make  sure  the  string  passes  over  the  pulley,  the  string  does  not  overlap 
itself as  it wraps around the cylinder, and  let the weight hang.  Grasp the cylinder and twist 
it counter­clockwise.  As you  increase your twisting  force you should reach a point where the 
string starts to slip.  Practice this a few times so you get the feel of it and are able to smoothly 
increase  the  torque  to  the  point  where  slipping  starts  and  are  able  to  keep  it  slipping  for  a 
second  or  two.  When  you  are  ready,  open  a  graph  by  dragging  the  Force  entry  from  the 
Data  window  onto  the Graph  entry  in  the  Displays  window.  Have  a  partner  click  the  Start 
button.  For  10 s,  the  force will  be  plotted  on  the  graph.  This  should  be  a  long  enough  time 
to  ramp  the  torque  to  the  slipping  point,  maintain  slow  rotation  for  a  second  or  so,  then 
back oﬀ and repeat the process once or twice.  You should get a graph something like this one.

As  you  can  see  from  the  graph,  and  may  have  noticed  while  watching  the  string  as  you 
rotated  the  cylinder,  the  ideal  behavior  of  a  clean  threshold  (determined  by  the  coeﬃcient 
of  static  friction  µs )  at  which  slipping  occurs  which  is  then  followed  by  a  lower  frictional 
force  (determined  by  the  coeﬃcient  of  sliding  friction  µk )  is  not  really  observed.  With  a 
waxed  string  and  a  plastic  cylinder  that  is  not  carefully  prepared,  that  is  perhaps  to  be 
expected.  My  observation  of  the  string was  that  it did not  slide  smoothly  over  the  cylinder, 
that  it  was  rather  jerky  as  the  string  stretched,  slipped,  and  relaxed.  This  suggests  that 
the  string­plastic  interface may  not  be  well  described  by  the  simple  idea  of  a  µs  and  a  µk . 
So,  assume  that  some  eﬀective  coeﬃcient  µ characterizes  the  interaction  between  the  string 
and  the  plastic  and  determines  the  maximum  friction  force  you  observe.  The  Smart  Tool 
can  help  to  ﬁnd  the  maximum  tension  T (the  minimum  F ,  as 
or  the  Statistics  Tool 
F < 0).  In  this  way,  you  may  proceed  to  see  how  the  friction  changes  with  the  amount  of 
string wrapped around the cylinder.  The geometry of the experiment restricts the wrapping 
to  be  n +
 1 
4 turns,  where  n is  an  integer.  The  wrappings  you  should  try  are  in  the  table 
below  and,  to  save  you  some  calculation,  I  have  put  in  the  corresponding wrapping  angle  θ .

Of  course,  T  would  be  1.03 N  if  you  could  measure  it  with  θ =  0,  so  I  put  that  in  the 
table.  In  your  experiment  you  should  complete  this  table  and  then  type  the  results  into  a 
table  in  DataStudio.  Put  θ as  the  independent  (X or  left  column)  variable,  and  T as  the 
dependent  variable.  Drag  the  resulting  table  from  the Data window  onto  the Graph  icon  in 
the  Displays  window  to make  a  graph.

The  graph  has my  data  for  the  large  (1 in.  dia.)  cylinder.  From  the  theory  in  the  appendix, 
I  expect  T  = 1.03 eµθ N.  First  I  tried  the  Natural  Exponent  Fit  built  into  DataStudio.  This 
function  includes  a  background  term,  which  should  be  zero  according  to  the  model  (and 
to  common  sense!)  if  the  force  sensor  was  properly  tared.  It  ﬁt  the  data,  but  with  large 
uncertainties  in  the  parameters.  Thus  I  turned  to  a  User­Deﬁned  Fit  with  the  deﬁnition  of 
the  ﬁt  function  as  1.03*exp(­C*x).  This  ﬁt  the  data  and  gave  the  value  µ  = 0.12.  The 
Natural  Exponent  Fit  is  not  plotted  on  the  graph,  but  it  would  be  diﬃcult  to  distinguish 
from  the  User­Deﬁned  Fit  that  is  plotted. 
I  also  did  the  experiment  for  the  small  cylinder  (0.5 in.  dia.)  and  here  are my  results  for  it. 

The  ﬁt  gave  µ = 0.11,  in  good  agreement with  the  result  for  the  large  cylinder.  (Again,  the 
Natural  Exponent  Fit  worked,  but  the  parameter  values  were  unreasonable,  a  case  of  too 
many  ﬁt  parameters  for  somewhat  noisy  data  being  a  bad  thing.) 
My  conclusion  is  that  friction  between  the  string  and  plastic  can  be  be  described  by  an 
eﬀective  coeﬃcient  µ  with  a  value  about  0.11,  that  the  friction  of  a  string  wrapped  around 
a  cylinder  (or  a  rope  around  a  tree)  increases  exponentially  with  the  wrapping  angle,  and 
that  this  result  does  not  depend  on  the  diameter  of  the  cylinder. 
Note:  I used PASCO’s “physics string”, which appears to be waxed.  You may have diﬀerent 
string  (e.g.,  black  nylon  ﬁshing  line)  and  get  somewhat  diﬀerent  results  than  I  did.

Appendix:  Derivation  of  Friction  Formula 
This  is  a  derivation  of  the  equation  that  describes  the  friction  of  a  string  wrapped 
around  a  cylinder.  You  will  not  be  responsible  to  repeat  this  derivation  on  an  exam,  but 
reading it will give you some insight into how calculus can be used to solve physics problems. 

The  ﬁgure  above  shows  a  free  body  diagram  for  a  piece  of  the  string,  which  is  wrapped 
around a cylinder of  radius R.  The piece of  string we consider  subtends an angle dθ , and we 
will be  interested  in  the  situation when dθ  is  inﬁnitesimally  small.  (In  the ﬁgure dθ  is about 
60◦ ,  but  that  is  so  we  can  see  what  is  going  on.)  Some  external  force  is  trying  to  rotate 
the  cylinder  in  the  direction  (ccw)  shown  by  the  arrow  labeled  τ .  Then  the  friction  force 
F  acting  on  the  piece  of  string  will  be  to  the  left,  as  shown.  The  other  forces  acting  on  the 
small  piece  of  string  are  a  normal  force  N  from  the  cylinder  and  the  tension  forces  exerted 
by  the  rest  of  the  string.  The  problem  is  easiest  to  solve  if  we  choose  the  angle  around  the 
cylinder,  θ ,  as  a  coordinate.  In  the  free  body  diagram,  consider  the  force  components  that 
are  normal  to  and  along  the  piece  of  string  at  its  center. 
Equating  the  normal  components  one  ﬁnds 

N  = T (θ) sin(dθ/2) + T (θ + dθ) sin(dθ/2) , 

and  setting  the  components  along  the  string  to  be  equal  gives 

F  + T (θ) cos(dθ/2) = T (θ + dθ) cos(dθ/2) .

and  cos(dθ/2)  =  1.  We  may  also  ignore  all  terms  having  (dθ)2  and  higher  powers.  And 
ﬁnally,  we may  write 

dT 
T (θ + dθ) = T (θ) + 
dθ

All  of  these  approximations  become  exact  in  the  limit  dθ  →  0.  The  two  equations  on  the 
previous  page  then  become  enormously  simpler.

When we  use  the  relationship F  = µN , where  µ  is  the  coeﬃcient  of  friction, we  get  a  single 
equation 

Divide  both  sides  by  dθ  to  get 

µT (θ)dθ = 

dT

µT  =

or

= µ dθ . 

This  equation  is  the  result  of  the  free  body  analysis  of  an  inﬁnitesimal  piece  of  string.  To 
see  how  a  larger  piece  behaves,  we  must  use  the  rules  of  calculus  to  put  all  of  the  tiny 
pieces  together.  (In  18.01,  that  is  called  integrating  the  diﬀerential  equation.)  To  ﬁnd  the 
solution, we  need  to  recognize  that  dT /T  is  the  derivative  of  ln T ;  then we  simply  integrate 
the  derivatives  on  both  sides  of  the  equation 

dT 
T 

= d(ln T ) = µ dθ . 

Suppose  the  string  starts  to  wrap  around  the  cylinder  at  θ  =  0  and  we  know  the  tension 
T (θ = 0) = T0  at  that  point.  We  would  like  to  ﬁnd  the  tension  at  some  value  θ > 0.  What 
we  have  to  do  is  integrate  the  diﬀerential  equation  from  the  starting  point  θ = 0  (where  we 
�  θ 
�  θ 
know  the  tension)  to  the  point  θ  (where  we  want  to  calculate  the  tension).  That  is: 
0 
0

d(ln T ) = µ 

dθ .

T0 

� 

= µθ

or,  after  taking  e  to  the  power  of  each  side, 

T (θ) = T0 eµθ  . 

This  expression  relates  the  tension  in  the  string  when  it  ﬁrst  contacts  the  cylinder,  T0 ,  to 
the  tension  at  any  point  in  the  string  up  to  the  angle  at  which  it  leaves  the  cylinder.  It 
is  interesting  that  the  answer  does  not  depend  on  the  radius  R  of  the  cylinder.  Can  you 
explain  in  words  why  that  is ?  (Naively,  one  might  think  that  a  larger  diameter  cylinder 
would  have more  string  in  contact  with  it,  hence  greater  friction.)
