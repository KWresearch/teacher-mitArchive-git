Experiment  04:  Uniform  Circular  Motion 

Section  and  Group:


Participants:


Each  group  need  turn  in  only  one  report,  but  you might  want  to make  extra  copies  to  take 
your  data  away  for  later  analysis. 
Fill in the table below with the numbers from your experiment.  Enter at least three non­zero 
values  of  ω ,  four  if  you made  that many measurements. 

0 

ω 

rm 

When  you  ﬁt  these  data  by  an  expression  of  the  form 

A 
:2
1 − (ω/ωC )
1.  What  value  did  your  ﬁt  give  for  A,  and  how  does  it  compare  to  your measured  r0 ? 

rm (ω) = 

2.  What  did  your  ﬁt  give  for  the  critical  frequency  ωC  ? 
� 
k/ms  to  ﬁnd  k  for  the  spring  in  your  experiment  and  report  the  answer 

3.  Solve  ωc  = 
here. 

4.  What  root  mean  squared  error  did  the  ﬁt  give  you?	 How  does  it  compare  with  the 
accuracy  you  estimate  for  your  measurements  of  rm (ω) ?  (Remember,  if  you  used  a 
User­Deﬁned  Fit  in  DataStudio,  divide  the  program’s  Root  MSE  by  the  square  root 
of  the  number  of  data  points  you  used  in  your  ﬁt.)
