Experiment  06:  Work,  Energy  and  the  Harmonic  Oscillator 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In this experiment you allow a cart to roll down an  inclined ramp and run  into a spring that 
is  attached  to  a  force  sensor.  You will measure  the position  and  velocity  of  the  cart  and  the 
force exerted by the spring while  it  is compressed.  Then you will attach the cart to the force 
sensor  by  a  spring  and  make  a  harmonic  oscillator.  Finally,  you  will  replace  the  spring  by 
a  rubber  band  and  see  the  eﬀect  of  a  non­ideal  spring.  You  will  do  the  following  things  in 
this  experiment: 
•	 You  will  investigate  experimentally  the  work–kinetic  energy  theorem,  how  potential 
energy  in  a  gravity  ﬁeld  converts  to  kinetic  energy  which  is  then  converted  into  the 
potential  energy  of  a  compressed  spring. 
•	 You  will  observe  and  quantify  the  eﬀect  of  non­conservative  forces  and  estimate  the 
work done by these forces at various stages of the cart’s motion up and down the ramp. 
� 
•	 You  will  measure  how  well  a  harmonic  oscillator  spring  obeys  Hooke’s  Law,  test  the 
k/m,  and 
formula  for  the  resonant  frequency  of  a  simple  harmonic  oscillator,  ω  = 
explore  the  idea  of  lissa jous  patterns  to  study  the  relationship  between  variables. 
•	 You  will  observe  that  a  rubber  band  does  not  obey  Hooke’s  Law,  and  the  signiﬁcant 
energy  loss  when  a  rubber  band  is  stretched  and  released. 

Setting  Up  the  Experiment: 
Refer  to  the  photo  to  the  right  and  the  ﬁgure  at  the  top  of 
the next page.  A  force  sensor  should be mounted  at  the  end 
of  the  track  that  has  an  adjustable  support  screw—which 
should  be  screwed  in  enough  that  the  end  of  the  track  can 
lie  ﬂat  on  the  table. 
Clip the motion sensor to the other end of the track and raise 
it  by  placing  a  short  piece  of  2 × 4  under  the  motion  sensor 
where  it  clips  onto  the  track,  as  you  can  see  in  the  photo 
to  the  right.  This  should  raise  the  end  of  the  track  4.2 cm 
above  the  table  (measure  it);  you  can ﬁnd  the  slope  θ  as  the 
track  is  122 cm  long. 
The  heavier  of  the  two  springs  available  should  be  screwed  into  the  force  sensor.

Place  a  cart  on  the  track  with  the  end  having  the  VelcroTM  patches  facing  the  motion 
sensor.  Put  two  250 gm weights  in  the  cart, which will  bring  its  total mass  to  750 gm.  (The 
extra mass reduces vibrations and gives  less noisy measurements.)  Place the cart about half 
way  up  the  track  from  the  force  sensor  and  release  it.  It  will  roll  down  the  track,  bounce 
most  of  the  way  back  up,  and  repeat  that  several  times.  You  may  notice  the  track  slides 
when  the  cart  runs  into  the  spring.  This  is  an  example  of  conservation  of  momentum.  To 
prevent  the  track  from  sliding,  place  your  thumb  on  the  end  of  the  track  resting  on  the 
table  and  press  it  ﬁrmly  against  the  table. 

Setting  Up  DataStudio : 

Connect the motion sensor (yellow plug into jack 1) and the force sensor to the 750 interface. 
The  slide  switch  on  top  of  the motion  sensor  should  be  set  to  the  narrow  beam  position. 
Drag  the  appropriate  icons  to  the  750  in  the  experiment  Setup  window.  Double­click  the 
force  sensor  icon  to  open  the  Sensor  Properties  window.

Calibration  tab  and  be  sure  to  tare  it  before making measurements.  Under  the General  tab 
set  the  force  sensor  Sample  Rate  to  500 Hz  and  click  OK.  Return  to  the  Experiment  Setup 
window  and  double­click  the  motion  sensor  icon.  Under  the  Measurement  tab,  check  the 
boxes  so  that  position,  velocity  and  acceleration  will  be  measured.  You  should  calibrate 
the  motion  sensor  because  the  speed  of  sound  varies  slightly  from  day  to  day.  Rest  the 
cart  against  the  spring  on  the  force  sensor  and  measure  the  distance  between  the  motion 
sensor  and  the  end  of  the  cart  closest  to  it.  The motion  sensor  works  best  if  it  is  angled  up 
slightly  rather  than  pointing  directly  at  the  cart.  (That  reduces  the  eﬀect  of  sound  waves 
that  bounce  oﬀ  the  track  before  hitting  the  cart.)  Select  the  Motion  Sensor  tab  and  type 
the  distance  you  measured  into  the  Calibration  Distance  window  and  click  the  Calibrate 
button.  This  will  be  the  point  x0  where  the  cart  and  relaxed  spring  make  contact.  Set  the 
Trigger  Rate  to  60 Hz  and  click OK. 

Next,  set  the  start  and  stop  conditions.  Click  the  Options 
of  the  boxes  under  the Manual  Sampling  tab  should  be  checked. 

button.  None 

In  the experiment you will  let the cart roll  into the spring starting  from rest about 30 cm up 
the  track  from  the  point  x0  where  it  ﬁrst  touches  the  spring.  A  convenient way  to  start  the 
experiment  is  to  hold  the  car  on  the  track  about  30 cm  above  the  spring  and  measure  the 
position  with  the  motion  sensor.  (In  my  experiment  that  was  0.52 m.)  Set  the  Automatic 
Start  condition  to  begin measurements when  the  distance  from  the motion  sensor  ﬁrst  rises 
above  this  distance  (see  next  page).  To  make  a  measurement,  you  can  hold  the  cart  1  or  2 
cm  up  the  track  from  this  position,  click  the  Start  button,  and  release  the  cart.

Under the Delayed Start tab click the radio button for Data Measurement, choose “Position, 
Ch  1&2  (m)”  from  the  pull­down  list,  set  the  start  condition  to  Rise  Above  0.52 m  (or  the 
appropriate number for your experiment), and keep data from 0.5 s before the start condition. 
Then  under  the  Automatic  Stop  tab  click  the  Time  radio  button  and  type  in  10 s. 
Prepare  to  plot  your  measurements  by  dragging  the  Force  and  Position  entries  from  the 
Data  window  onto  the  Graph  icon  in  the  Displays  window.  That  will make  two  graphs. 
Tare  the  force  sensor,  hold  the  cart  at  a  position  1  to  2  cm  above  the  point  you  chose  for 
the  Delayed  Start  condition,  click  the  Start  button,  and  when  you  see  yellow  numbers  in 
the  counter  window  release  the  cart.  You  should  see  the  position  and  force  plotted  on  your 
graphs  as  the  cart  bounces  up  and  down  the  track. 

These  graphs  contain  a wealth  of  information.  The  position  graph  shows  the  sharp  reversal 
of  direction  that  occurs  when  the  cart  collides  with  the  spring  (and  the  force  graph  shows 
a  corresponding  spike  in  the  force).  You  can  see  the  slower  reversal  of  direction  as  the  cart 
coasts  to  high  turning  points  on  the  track  (the  ﬁrst  two  are  marked  by  arrows)  and  then 
starts  back  down.  You  can  see  that  the  high  turning  point  becomes  lower  each  time  as

The  curve  above  left  is  the  velocity  as  a  function  of  time  and  the  one  to  the  right  is  the 
force  peak  on  the  second  bounce  from  the  spring,  expanded  using  the  point  selection  and 
scale­to­ﬁt  operations  on  the  force  graph.  A  way  to  test  the  work­energy  theorem  might 
be  to  measure  the  velocity  when  the  cart  ﬁrst  hits  the  spring,  or  when  it  just  leaves  it,  to 
calculate  the  kinetic  energy,  and  to  compare  it  with  the  potential  energy  it  had  at  the  high 
turning  point  on  the  track.  Unfortunately  the  velocity measurements  are  too  noisy  at  these 
points for this to work.  The ﬂuctuations in velocity measurements are about ±0.02 m/s and, 
as  we  shall  see  presently,  the  friction  reduces  the  velocity  by  only  about  0.02 m/s  from  the 
ideal  frictionless  situation. 
Here  is a method  that works.  Use  the Smart Tool on  the position graph  to ﬁnd  the position 
at  the  high  turning  points  either  side  of  the  second  bounce;  these  are marked  by  arrows  on 
my  graph  and  I  call  them  h1  and  h2 .  Calcuate  the  potential  energy  at  h1  and  h2  relative 
to  x0 ,  the  position where  the  cart  just  touches  the  spring,  that  you measured  earlier.  Enter 
your  results  in  the  table  below  and  in  your  report.  The  table  has my  values  as  an  example, 
but  yours  will  likely  be  diﬀerent  as  they  depend  on  how  you  set  up  the  apparatus  and  the 
point  you  chose  to  release  the  cart.

Your  value: 
Knowing  the  cart’s  mass  M  = 0.750 kg  and  the  angle  θ  =  tan−1 (4.2/122)  =  1.97◦  you  can 
calculate  the  potential  energy  lost  from  turning  point  h1  to  h2 .  You  also  know  the  total 
distance  the  cart  traveled  is  d = 2x0  − h1  − h2 .  If  you  assume  the  friction  force  is  constant, 
you  can  now  calculate  it.  Do  so,  and  put  the  result  in  your  report  and  the  table  above. 
You can  get useful information from the velocity graph.  The two ﬁgures below are free body 
diagrams  (in  the coordinate  system  from  the  top of page 2)  for  the cart  rolling up and down 
the  track.

data  points  between  the  1st  and  2nd  bounce  where  the  velocity  is  negative,  and  do  a  linear 
ﬁt  to  them,  as  in  my  graph  on  the  left  below.  The  slope  will  give  the  upward  acceleration

Force  Analysis: 
As  the  ﬁnal  analysis  of  your  data  for  this  part  of  the  experiment,  you  should  make  a  new 
graph  (not  a  new  measurement)  of  the  force  as  a  function  of  time,  then  use  a  combination
of  point  selection  and  the  scale­to­ﬁt
tool  so  that  the  force  data  for  the  second  bounce 
ﬁll  the  graph  window.  You  should make  an  expanded  time  scale  graph  like  this  one. 

Select  the  data  points  where  the  force  is  not  zero,  and  choose  a  User­Deﬁned  Fit.  Double­
click  the  text  window  in  the  graph  to  open  up  a  Curve  Fit  window  and  deﬁne  the  function 
as  A*sin(2*pi*(x­C)/T). 
DataStudio will still not be able to ﬁnd a ﬁt 
after you click Accept, but this time places

time when the force ﬁrst becomes non­zero 
for  C ,  and  twice  the  width  of  the  peak  for

The  Harmonic  Oscillator: 
In  this  part  of  the  experiment  you  will  make  a  harmonic  oscillator  and  explore  some  of  its 
properties.  Remove  the  cart  from  the  track  and  unclip  the  motion  sensor  from  the  end. 
The  end  of  the  track  where  the  motion  sensor  was  will  now  become  the  low  end  and  rest 
on  the  table.  Raise  the  other  end  by  placing  two  pieces  of  2 × 4  on  top  of  each  other  and 
resting  the  adjustable  support  screw  of  the  track  on  top  of  them,  as  in  the  ﬁgure  below. 

This  is a somewhat precarious set up,  so be careful not to knock  it over.  Adjust the support 
screw  so  the  end  of  the  track  is  13 cm  above  the  table.  Place  the motion  sensor  on  the  table 
and  slide  it  up  to  touch  the  low  end  of  the  track.  (It  is  less  likely  to  be  destroyed  by  a 
runaway  cart  if  it  can  slide  on  the  table.)  You may  have  to  aim  the motion  sensor  again;  it 
should point up a an angle  somewhat greater  than θ .  Replace  the  spring on  the  force  sensor 
with  the  hook,  and  hook  one  end  of  the  harmonic  oscillator  spring  over  it. 
At  the  end  of  the  cart  with  the 
VelcroTM  patches there is a square clear 
plastic  plunger  that  will  slide  out  if 
you  press  the  release  button.  Clip  a 
small  (
 3 
4 in)  binder  clip  to  the  plunger 

as shown in the photo and push it back 
in. 
Place  the  cart  back  on  the  track  and 
hook  the  other  end  of  the  harmonic 
oscillator  spring  over  a  handle  of  the 
binder  clip.  Carefully  roll  the  cart 
down  the  track  to  its  equilibrium  po­
sition  and  add  the  two  250 gm weights. 
With  the  cart at  rest at  its  equilibrium 
position,  re­calibrate  the  motion  sen­
sor. 
Change  the  Delayed  Start  to  begin  at 
a  position  20 cm  above  the  equilibrium 
position  and  also  change  the  condition 
from  “Rise  Above”  to  “Fall  Below”. 

Change the Automatic Stop time from 10 s to 16 s.  Unhook the spring, tare the force sensor, 
and  hook  it  up  again.  To  make  a  measurement  hold  the  cart  1  or  2 cm  above  the  start 
condition  point,  click  the  Start  button,  and  release  the  cart  after  the  clock  ﬁgures  start 
counting  in  yellow.

13 cmqRelease ButtonYou should see position and force graphs like these.  You can see from the position graph that 
the  motion  appears  to  be  sinusoidal,  but  damped  by  friction.  The  force  is  also  sinusoidal, 
as  you  would  expect.  You  should  measure  the  period  T  of  the  oscillation  on  the  position 
graph  (Smart  Tool ?)  because  you  will  need  it  for  your  report. 
It  is  interesting  to  plot  force  on  the  y ­axis  against  position  on  the  x­axis.  To  do  that,  drag 
the  force  data  into  the Displays window  to make  a  new  graph,  then  drag  the  corresponding 
position  data  onto  the  x­axis  of  the  new  graph.  (Make  sure  that  the  dotted  lines  surround 
just  the  x­axis,  not  the  whole  graph,  before  you  release  the  drag.)  If  you  adjust  the  scale 
and  graph  window  borders,  you  can  get  a  plot  like mine  on  the  left  below. 

The  fact  that  the  force­position  graph  is  linear  conﬁrms  Hooke’s  law,  and  you  can  obtain 
the  harmonic  oscillator  spring  constant  by  a Linear Fit.  You will  need  it  for  your  report.  (I 
found  3.79 ± 0.01 N/m.)  Another  interesting  graph  has  velocity  on  the  y ­axis  and  position 
on  the  x­axis.  You  should make  one  of  these,  too.  Mine  is  at  the  right,  above. 
These  are  both  examples  of  what  are  called  lissa jous  ﬁgures,  after  the  French  physicist 
Jules  Antoine  Lissa jous.  Long  before  the  development  of  electronics,  Lissa jous  used  the 
method to compare the frequencies of sounds.  He used the sounds to vibrate a mirror in two 
orthogonal  directions  and  observed  the motion  of  a  beam  of  light  reﬂected  from  the mirror. 
Interestingly,  his  technology  has  returned, modernized,  in  the  form  of  laser  light  shows. 

Experiment  06

The two ﬁgures above are simple lissa jous ﬁgures because the waves compared have the same 
frequency.  The  force  and  position  form  a  straight  line  because  the  two  are  in  phase.  There 
is  a  90◦  phase  diﬀerence  between  the  velocity  and  position,  which  is  why  the  open  circular 
pattern  is  formed.  The  inward  spiral  reﬂects  the  loss  of  mechanical  energy  to  friction.  A 
similar thing happens to the force­position graph, but is hidden because the phase diﬀerence 
is  zero. 

Appendix:  Rubber  Band 
Unhook  the  harmonic  oscillator  spring  and  replace  it  with  two  rubber  bands  joined  end­to­
end.  Repeat  the  harmonic  oscillator  measurement.  You  will  observe  that  the  damping  of 
the  oscillation  is  signiﬁcantly  greater.  Here  is my  position  graph. 

This extra damping must come from internal 
friction  in  the  rubber  band,  as  everything 
else  is  the  same  as  it  was  with  the  spring 
harmonic  oscillator. 
The  most  interesting  plot  is  the  force­position  lissa jous  pattern  at  the  right  above.  I  can 
make  three  comments  about  this. 
•	 The  rubber  band  does  not  follow  Hooke’s  Law  closely  (paths  are  curved). 
•	 The  force  from  the  rubber  band  is  not  in  phase  with  the  position  (the  pattern  is 
� 
somewhat  open). 
•	 The  integral 

dxF · 

over  a  cycle  is  the  non­conservative  work  done  during  that  cycle.  (As  you  will  learn 
when  you  study  circuits  in  8.02,  this  is  related  to  the  previous  comment.) 
You  can  demonstrate  internal  friction  in  rubber  to  yourself.  Take  a  (clean)  rubber  band, 
stretch  it  quickly,  and  touch  it  as  rapidly  as  you  can  to  your  lips;  you  should  be  able  to  feel 
its  warmth.  (This  is  easier  to  detect  with  a  fat  rubber  band  than  the  skinny  ones  we  are 
using.) 
Rubber has a number of interesting properties.  The force required to stretch it increases with 
temperature, and a stretched rubber band will cool if you allow it to relax!  (You might want 
to  see  if  you  can  detect  that  with  your  lips,  too.)  This  can  be  explained  using  elementary 
statistical mechanics,  except  the  energy  lost  to  internal  friction  over  a  stretch–relax  cycle  is 
diﬃcult  to  predict  quantitatively.
