Experiment  10:  Energy  Transformation 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In this experiment you will add some heat to water in a plastic jar and measure the resulting 
increase  in  temperature.  In  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  experiment  the  work  added  will  be  from 
non­conservative  mechanical  work  (friction),  which  is  why  this  experiment  is  informally 
known  as  the  “pot  scrubber”  experiment.  In  the  second  part,  you  will  add  heat  from  the 
non­conservative  dissipation  of  electrical  energy;  thus  you  will measure  the mechanical  and 
electrical equivalents of heat.  This experiment—more than those we have done previously— 
will  show  that  it  is  not  a  trivial  matter  to  measure  some  important  quantities  accurately. 

The  Apparatus: 

The  photo  shows  the  apparatus.  A  motor 
rotates  a  plastic  pot  scrubber  against  a  thin 
metal disk that  forms the bottom of the plasic 
reservoir  that  contains  the  water,  and  the 
work done by  the  friction warms  the water.  A 
thermistor  immersed  in  the water  enables  you 
to measure  its  temperature. 
You  can  attach  the  leads  of  a  pocket  DVM  to 
the  left pair of binding posts on the apparatus 
in  order  to measure  the  thermistor  resistance, 
to  an  accuracy  of  ±0.1 Ω  when  you  use  the 
200 Ω  scale. 
The  right  pair  of  binding  posts  connects  to 
a  2.5 Ω  resistor  you  will  later  use  to  heat  the 
water  electrically. 
The  reservoir  is  supported  by  a  plastic  arm 
and  a  spring­loaded  screw  part  way  along  the 
arm  allows  you  to  adjust  the  normal  force 
between  the  jar  and  the  pot  scrubber.  The 
reservoir  can  rotate  about  a  vertical  axis,  and 
the  frictional  torque  is determined by hanging 
a  known  weight  and  attaching  it  to  the  black 
pulley  on  this  axis.

Preparing  to  Do  the  Experiment: 
You do not have to use DataStudio  to acquire data in this experiment but it is recommended, 
and  it makes  it  easier  to  use  the  program  to  plot  and  analyze  your  results. 
In  a  thermistor,  thermal  ﬂuctuations  excite  charge  carriers  across  a  semiconducting  band 
gap;  as  the  temperature  rises  more  carriers  are  excited  across  the  gap  and  the  electrical 
resistance  of  the  thermistor  drops.  The  probability  of  this  excitation  varies  as  e−Egap /kB T 
and  so  the  resistance  of  the  thermistor  has  a  theoretical  dependence  on  temperature  of  the 
mathematical  form  eT0 /T  when  T  is measured  in  kelvins. 
Over  the  limited  temperature  range  of  this  experiment,  the  thermistor  resistance  is  well 
described  by  a  simpler  function 
R = R0e−αT 
(1) 
where T  is the temperature in degrees Celsius and R0  is the resistance at 0 ◦C. We can invert 
this  expression  to  ﬁnd  the  temperature  from  the  thermistor  resistance: 

1  R0
T  = ln 
R 
α

= B − A ln(R) 

(2) 

The  resistance  of  your  thermistor  at  three  temperatures  is  given  on  the  plastic  jar  that 
contains  the  water  in  your  experiment.  For my  apparatus,  the  values  were

You may  use DataStudio  to  determine  the  parameters B  and A  of  Eq. (2)  that  characterize 
the thermistor  in your apparatus.  First, connect a ScienceWorkshop  750  interface and start 
the program.  Drag a Voltage Sensor  icon to the  interface  in the Setup window.  You will not 
actually  measure  any  voltage  this  way,  but  it  is  required  so  that  DataStudio  will  time  your 
measurements,  record  the  thermistor  resistance,  and  calculate  the  temperature  for  you. 

Calibrating  the  Thermistor: 

1.  Go  to  the  top  menu  bar  and  choose  “Experiment”  and  “New  Empty  Data  Table...” 
from  the  sub­menu.  That  will  put  an  entry  called  “Editable  Data”  in  the  Data  area 
of  the  Summary  column  at  the  upper  left  of  the  screen. 

2.  Double­click Editable Data and a Data Properties win­

dow  will  open  up  that  allows  you  to  give  the  table  a

name.  Choose  “Thermistor  Calibration”  or  something

equally descriptive.  You should also use this window to

give  names  to  the  variables  you  will  enter  and  specify

their  units;  these  will  be  used  when  you  plot  them  on

a  graph.  The  X  variable  (left  column)  should  be  R  in 

units  “ohm”  and  the  Y  variable  should  be  T  in  units 

“Deg  C”.  Both  variable  types  should  be  Other.

Go  to  the  table window  and  type  the  three  temperatures  in  the Y  (right)  column  and 
the  three  resistance  values  in  the  X  column.  Then  you  can  minimize  the  table,  or 
reduce  its  size  to  something  convenient. 

3.  Plot  your  thermistor  data  by  dragging  it  from  the  Data  window  onto  the  Graph  icon 
in  the  Displays  window.

Your  three  data  points  should  now  be  plotted  on  a  graph  with 
R

along  the  Y  axis.  Your  graph  will  look  neater  if  you  click  the  Settings  button 
T 
and 
remove the thin line connecting the data points.  The next step is to select a User­Deﬁned Fit 
from  the  graph’s  Fit  menu.  When  you  ﬁrst  do  that,  the  text  box  where  you  expect  to  see 
the  ﬁt  results  appear  on  the  graph  will  probably  have  a  message  that  a  best  ﬁt  could  not 
be  found.  Double­click  the  text  box  with  the  message  and  a  new  window  with  the  title 
Curve  Fit  should  open  up.  Type  B­A*ln(x)  in  the  function  deﬁnition  window,  make  sure 
the  Automatic  button  is  chosen  (depressed)  and  click  the  Accept  button. 

DataStudio  should be able  to ﬁnd a best ﬁt and display  the  results  in  the Curve Fit window 
and  on  the  graph,  like  the  one  above.  (If  the  program  cannot ﬁnd  a ﬁt,  give  it B  = 150  and 
A = 30  for  initial  guesses.) 
You  will  use  these  parameters  in  Eq. (2)  to  ﬁnd  the  temperature  from  your  measurements 
of  the  thermistor  resistance.  Before  you  do  anything  else,  use  the  DVM  (200 Ω  scale)  to 
measure  the  resistance  of  your  thermistor.  If  the  apparatus  has  been  sitting  for  several 
hours,  that  should  let  you determine  the  room  temperature—which  you will need when  you 
analyze your  results.  If  the apparatus has been used  in a previous  class your  thermistor will 
not  be  at  room  temperature.  In  that  case  ask  your  instructor  what  value  to  use  for  Troom . 
Fill in the table below and in your report.  You will also need them for a homework problem.

Preparing  to  Make  Measurements: 
You  can  use DataStudio ’s Manual  Sampling mode  to 
time your measurements, enter the results into a data 
table,  calculate  the  temperature  and  analyze  the  re­
sults.  To  set  this  up,  click  the  Options 
button.  A  Sampling  Options  window  will  open.  All 
of  the  boxes  under  the  Manual  Sampling  tab  should 
be  checked.  Click  the  Edit  All  Properties  tab  and  a 
Data  Properties  window  will  open.  Name  the  mea­
surement  “Resistance”,  set  the  variable  name  to  R 
and  the  units  to  “ohm”.  Click OK  on  both windows. 

A  new  entry  for  the  Resistance  will 
appear  in  the  Data  window. 

With  this  setup, when you  click  the Start button  it will  change  to a Keep button 
with  a  stop  button  (small  red  square)  beside  it.  Whenever  you  click  the  Keep  button, 
DataStudio  will measure  the  voltage  at  the  input  to  the  750  interface  (which will  be  0)  and 
open  a  window  for  you  to  type  in  the  resistance  of  your  thermistor. 

When  you  click  OK  (or  type  a  carriage  return)  the  resistance  value  will  be  entered  as  a 
dependent  variable  into  the  Resistance  (ohm)  data  set  along  with  the  time  you  clicked  the 
Keep  button  as  the  independent  variable.  When  you  want  to  stop  making  measurements, 
click  the  small  red  stop  button  and  the  data  will  be  saved  as  Run  #1  under  the  Resis­
tance  (ohm)  heading  in  the  Data  window. 
Note:  To save its battery the DVM may shut itself oﬀ.  You can turn it back on by switching 
to  a  diﬀerent  scale  and  back  to  the  one  you  were  using.

Adding  Heat  from  Friction: 
Refer  back  to  the  photo  on  the  ﬁrst  page.

Pass  the  chain  over  the  white  pulley,  as  shown  in  the  photo.  The  chain  should  wrap  at 

least
 1 
4 turn  around  the  black  reservoir  axis  pulley  (to  make  sure  the  torque  moment  arm 
is  equal  to  the  radius  of  the  pulley)  and  the  hook  should  not  contact  the  white  pulley,  in 
order  that  the  weights  can move  up  and  down  freely. 
Place  three  100 gm  weights  on  the  5 gm  plastic 
holder  (total  mass  305 gm)  and  attach  them  to 
the  hook  at  the  end  of  the  chain.  A  paper  clip 
can  be  used  to  secure  the  hook  to  the  slot  in  the 
holder. 

Until  the  motor  has  been  turned  on  and  you  have  balanced  the  torques,  you  will  ﬁnd  it 
necessary  to hold  the  reservoir  so  it does not  twist  too  far  and pull  on  the wires  attached  to 
it.  You want  to make  sure  there  is no  stress on  the electrical  leads attached  to  the  reservoir, 
as  that  would  apply  an  unknown  torque  to  the  reservoir.  The  axis  connects  to  a  white 
plastic  socket  on  top  of  the  reservoir;  if  necessary  you may  lift  the  axis  out  of  the  socket  to 
rotate  the  reservoir  with  respect  to  the  black  pulley  that  is  ﬁxed  to  the  axis. 

Turn  on  the  motor  and  adjust  the  pressure  adjustment  screw  so  that  the  system  balances

with  the  torque  from  the  hanging  weight,  and  the  reservoir  does  not  rotate.  The  chain

should  wrap  around  the  black  pulley  from
 1 
4 to
 3 
4 of  a  turn.  You  may  need  to  re­adjust  the 
screw  from  time  to  time  to maintain  this  balance  throughout  your measurement. 
As  the  motor  turns,  the  weight  will  move  up  and  down  several  mm  and  the  reservoir  will 
oscillate  back  and  forth.  That  is  useful  because  it  keeps  the  water  stirred  and  hence  at  a 
uniform temperature.  If that does not happen with your apparatus, you will have to agitate 
it  (as  described  in  the  Electric  Heating  section)  to  keep  the  water  stirred. 
When  things  are  stable  and  you  are  ready  to  take  data  click  the  Start  button.

December  1,  2004


To  make  a  measurement,  click  the  Keep  button.  That  will  record  the  time  in  DataStudio 
and  open  a  window  for  you  to  type  in  the  thermistor  resistance.  I  found  it  satisfactory  to 
record  thermistor  resistance  about  every  three  minutes  for  a  total  time  of  21  minutes.  At 
the  end  of  that  time,  click  the  stop  button  and  turn  oﬀ  the motor. 
You  will  now  have  a  set  of  data  labeled  “Run  #1”  under  the  Resistance  entry  in  the  Data 
window.  Drag  it  onto  the  Graph  icon  in  order  to  make  a  plot  of  the  data;  it  will  have 
thermistor  R  on  the  Y  axis  and  time  on  the  X  axis.  Click  the  calculator  button  on  the 
graph’s  toolbar.  That  will  open  a  window  like  this  one. 

In the Deﬁnition window type T=159­29.3*ln(x) (use the appropriate A and B  parameters 
for your thermistor) and click Accept.  That will produce a new data set in the Data window 
called  (surprise!)  T=159­29.3*ln(x).  You  can  double­click  it  to  open  a  Data  Properties 
window so you can choose variable names and units.  Drag this data set onto the Graph  icon 
to make a graph.  You will then have a plot of the water temperature on the 
axis and time 
Y
on  the
X  axis.  Your  graph  will  look  neater  if  you  click  the  Settings  button 
and  remove 
the  thin  line  connecting  the  data  points.  The  next  step  is  to  make  a  User­Deﬁned  Fit  to 
these  data.  In  the  Curve  Fit  window,  deﬁne  the  ﬁtting  function  as  C+B*x*(1­x/A)  (the 
reason  for  this  choice  of  function  is  explained  in  the  Data  Analysis  section  of  these  notes). 
When you ﬁrst click Accept DataStudio  will probably not be able to ﬁnd a ﬁt, so you should 
provide  some  help  by  supplying  the  initial  guesses  C  = 20,  B  = 0.004  and  A = 5000.

Electric  Heating: 
In this measurement you will add heat electrically.  First,  remove the hanging weight,  loosen 
the  pressure  adjustment  screw  and  remove  the  reservoir  from  its  position  on  the  vertical 
axis.  Place  it  on  the  platform  above  the  four  binding  posts. 
During this measurement you will have to agitate the water to keep the temperature uniform. 
If you rock the apparatus front to back, the water in the jar will slosh back and forth.  During 
the  experiment,  do  this  for  about  10 s  once  a minute  and  do  it  continuously  during  the  30 s 
just  before  you  measure  the  thermistor  resistance.  Do  it  vigorously  enough  that  you  think 
the  water  is  well  mixed.  You  may  also  agitate  the  water  by  picking  the  jar  up  and  rocking 
it.  If  you  do  that  try  to  pick  it  up  by  the  jar  lid  at  its  base,  to  reduce  heat  transfer  to  your 
hand. 
Temporarily  connect  your  DVM  to  the  right  hand  pair  of  binding  posts  and  measure  the 
resistance  of  the  heating  resistor  in  the  reservoir;  it  should  be  2.5±0.1 Ω. 
Make  sure  the  electric  power  supply  is  turned  oﬀ.  Set  the  current  knob  to  the  midpoint  of 
its  range  and  turn  the  voltage  controls  all  the  way  down  (CCW).

Connect  the  power  supply  to  the  right  hand  pair  of  binding  posts.  Set  the  DVM  scale  to

DVM  to  set  the  voltage  as  close  to  2.5 V  as  you  can. 
Record  the  heating  resistance  and  the  power  supply  voltage  in  the  table  below  and  in  your 
report.  You  will  also  need  them  for  a  homework  problem. 

R  (Ω)

Connect the DVM (on the 200 Ω scale) back to the thermistor binding posts and agitate the 
water.  You  are  ready  to measure  the  electric  heating  curve. 
Click  the  Start  button  and  agitate  the  water  as  described  above.  Measure  the  thermistor 
resistance  about  every  three minutes  for  a  total  time  of  24 minutes. 
When you have completed that, make graphs and carry out the same User­Deﬁned Fit as you 
did  for  your  friction  heating  measurements.  Enter  your  results  in  the  table  below  (include 
the  ±  standard  deviations)  and  in  your  report.  You  will  also  need  them  for  a  homework 
problem.

Data  Analysis: 
The  data  analysis  for  this  experiment  is  based  on  the  following model.  The  speciﬁc  heat  of 
water  is  cw  = 1.00 cal/(gm ◦C),  so  a  mass mw  of  water  has  a  heat  capacity mw  cw  cal/◦C.  If 
heat  energy  is  added  to  the  water  at  a  rate  Pnet cal/s,  the  water  temperature  will  increase 
according  to 

dT 
Pnet 
= 
dt  mw  cw 

. 

The  energy  Pnet  added  to  the  water  has  two  parts.  First,  there  is  energy  added  by  the 
non­conservative  frictional or electrical work.  Second,  if the water  in the reservoir  is warmer 
or  colder  than  the  surrounding  air  in  the  room,  energy  will  ﬂow  from  the  the  water  to  the 
room,  or  vice  versa.  Because  the  water  and  room  temperatures  are  not  very  diﬀerent,  the 
heat  energy  exchanged  with  the  room  will  be  proportional  to  the  temperature  diﬀerence. 
Proom  = −λ(T  − Troom ) 
where  Proom  is  the  heat  energy  added  by  the  room  to  the  water  and  λ  is  some  unknown 
constant.  We  will  see  how  to  determine  it  presently.  Let  us  consider  the  case  of  friction 
heating  of  the  water,  where  the  heat  is  added  by  friction  at  the  rate  Pf .  Then  the  water 
temperature  is  described  by  the  diﬀerential  equation

Experiment  10

December  1,  2004


Now,  we  can  calculate  Pf  because  it  is  just  the  friction  torque  multiplied  by  the  angular 
velocity  the motor  rotates.  Thus 

Pf  = W  rpulley ωmotor 
where  W  = 0.305  ×  9.805  =  2.99 N  is  the  weight  suspended  from  the  chain,  rpulley  = 
0.019 ± 0.001 m  is  the  radius  of  the pulley  on  the  vertical  axis,  and ω  is  the  angular  velocity 
of  the  motor.  It  is  speciﬁed  by  the  manufacturer  to  be  200 rpm.  I  measured  it  with  a 
strobe  light  and  found  ω = 200 ± 4 rpm = 20.9 ± 0.5 rad/s.  Using  these  values,  I  calculated 
Pf  = 1.19 ± 0.06 J/s.  Most  of  the  uncertainty  comes  from  the  uncertainty  in  rpulley . 

To  make  further  progress,  we  have  to  solve  the  diﬀerential  equation  for  T .  First,  consider 
the  simpler  equation  when  Pf  = 0.

where  τ0  = mw  cw /λ  is  a  characteristic  time  or  time  constant,  and Δ0  is  a  constant  equal  to 
T (t = 0) − Troom  ≡ T0 − Troom .  The  equation we  really want  to  solve  is  the  same  one with  a

An  Historical  Note: 
(From http://www.rit.edu/~flwstv/heat.html, also the “Special” link on the web page.) 
For  a  long  time  it was  thought  that  heat was  a  ﬂuid  called  phlogiston  or  caloric  that  ﬂowed 
into bodies when  they became hotter and ﬂowed out of  them when  they cooled.  One calorie 
was  the  amount  of  this  ﬂuid  that  ﬂowed  into  1 gm  of  water  to  increase  its  temperature 
by  1 ◦C.  One  of  the  ﬁrst  to  recognize  this  was  incorrect  was  Benjamin  Thompson,  a  New 
Englander  from  Concord,  N.H.  (Thompson  chose  the  losing  side  during  the  American 
Revolution  and  ﬁnished  his  career  in  Europe,  where  he  became  Count  Rumford—an  old 
name  for  Concord.)  While  observing  the  boring  of  canon  barrels,  Rumford  concluded  that 
mechanical  energy  must  be  converted  into  heat.  This  was  an  important  step  in  developing 
the  concept  of  the  conservation  of  energy.  Rumford  measured  the  mechanical  equivalent 
of  heat—the  amount  of  non­conservative  mechanical  work  that  equalled  one  calorie,  but 
obtained a  result  that was  too  large.  It was James Prescott Joule who measured  it precisely 
and  who  also  worked  out  the  formula  I 2R  for  the  non­conservative  work  done  by  an  elec­
tric current.  The currently accepted mechanical equivalent of heat is 4.186 joules per calorie.

How  good  were  my  results ? 
I  have  kept  track  of  the  experimental  uncertainties  in  the  quantities  I  measured,  and  now 
is  the  time  to  see  if  the mechanical  equivalent  of  heat  I  obtain  is  a  good  as  Joule’s,  or more 
like  Rumford’s. 
From  my  rubbing  experiment  I  calculated  Pf  was  1.19 ± 0.06 J/s,  and  if  mw  =  60 gm  (the 
amount  of  water  in  the  reservoir  I  used)  the  ﬁtting  parameters  for  the  heating  curve  give 
Pf  = 0.227 ± 0.004 cal/s.  This gives  the mechanical equivalent of heat as 5.2 ± 0.3 J/cal,  too 
large! 
Similarly, for my electric heating Joule’s formula gives Pe  = 1.54 ± 0.08 J/s (my heating volt­
age was 1.96 V; with 2.5 V your Pe  will be diﬀerent).  The uncertainty comes from the ±0.1 Ω 
uncertainty  in  the  heater  resistance.  From  the  ﬁtting  parameters Pe  = 0.315 ± 0.008 cal/s  if 
mw  = 60 gm.  This  gives  4.9 ± 0.3 J/cal,  again  too  large. 
How  can  this  discrepancy,  clearly  greater  than  the  estimated  measurement  errors,  be  ex­
plained ?  The most  likely  explanation  is  that more mass  than  just  the  60 gm  of water  in  the 
reservoir  is  being  heated.  The  heat  lost  to  the  room  has  been  allowed  for  in  the model,  but 
the  plastic  jar,  its metal  lid,  and  few  other  small  items  are  also  being  heated.  If  the  jar  and 
the other  items had the same heat capacity as 10 gm of water—which seems very reasonable 
to me—the measured  equivalent  for  electric  heating  would  be  4.2 J/cal. 
In  the  case of  friction heating,  the pot  scrubber and  its mount provide  some additional heat 
capacity;  if  that  were  the  same  as  4 gm  of  water,  the  friction  result  would  also  be  4.2 J/cal. 
It  is  diﬃcult,  but  very  important,  in  measuring  the  mechanical  equivalent  of  heat  to  know 
the  heat  capacity  of  the mass  you  are  heating  by  non­conservative  work.  Perhaps  Rumford 
had  a  similar  problem.
