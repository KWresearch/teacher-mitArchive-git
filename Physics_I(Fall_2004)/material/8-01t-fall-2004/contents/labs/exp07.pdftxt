Experiment  07:  Momentum  and  Collisions 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  allow  two  carts  to  collide  on  a  level  track  and  run  into  a  spring  that 
is  attached  to  a  force  sensor.  You  will  measure  the  position  and  velocity  of  the  ﬁrst  cart 
and  the  force  exerted  by  the  spring  while  it  is  compressed.  You  can  analyze  your  data  to 
determine  the  following  things  from  this  experiment: 
•	 An  experimental  test  of  the  conservation  of  momentum  in  elastic  and  inelastic 
collisions. 
•	 Determination of the maximum kinetic energy that  is available to do non­conservative 
work  in  a  completely  inelastic  collision. 
•	 You will make use of most of the ideas and computational tools that we need to analyze 
collisions  in  one  dimension. 

Because the track  is  level, we do not need to consider changes  in the gravitational PE  of the 
carts  and may  take  it  to  be  zero.  If we  consider  the  two  carts  to  be  an  isolated  system  (this 
is a good approximation so  long as the  friction  forces are small),  the only mechanical energy 
is  kinetic,  K .  A  collision  is  inelastic  if  some  of  the  initial  K  is  used  to  do  non­conservative 
work.  It  is  elastic  if  no  K  is  “lost.”  The  collision  is  completely  inelastic  if  the  maximum 
amount  of K  (consistent with  conservation  of momentum)  is  converted  to  non­conservative 
work;  usually  that  is what  people mean when  they  refer  simply  to  inelastic  collisions  and  it 
happens  when  the  two  colliding  ob jects  stick  together. 

Setting  Up  the  Experiment: 

•	 At  the  the  end  of  the  track with  the  level adjustment  screw attach  a  force  sensor with 
the  hook  replaced  by  the  lighter  of  the  two  springs. 
•	 Clip  the  the motion  sensor  to  the  other  end  of  the  track. 
•	 Level  your  track  as well  as  you  can  using  the  level  adjustment  screw.  Test  by making 
sure  an  empty  cart  does  not  have  a  tendency  to  roll  in  either  direction;  the  test  is 
more  sensitive  if  you  put  two  250 gm  weights  in  the  cart.

AByxSetting  up  DataStudio:


• 

• 

Connect  the  force  sensor  and  set  it  to  a 
500 Hz  sample  rate  with  low  sensitivity. 
Tare  the  sensor  when  nothing  is  in 
contact  with  the  spring. 
Connect the motion sensor and calibrate 
it.  Choose  the  trigger  rate  to be 80,  and 
set  it  to  measure  position  and  velocity 
(acceleration  is  optional). 
•	 Set  the  sampling  options  for  Delayed 
Start to “position rises above 0.3m” and 
do  not  keep  any  data  prior  to  the  start. 
Set  Automatic  Stop  to  “position  falls 
below  0.3m.” 

Create  graphs  to  plot  force,  position  and  velocity  as  a  function  of  time  by  dragging  entries 
from  the  Data  window  onto  the  Graph  icon  in  the  Displays  window. 

Inelastic  Collisions: 
You  should  study  inelastic  collisions  ﬁrst  in  this  experiment.  Place  two  empty  carts  on  the 
track with the the Velcro pads facing each other.  One cart (which I call the target cart, with 
mass mB ) should be placed on the track with the end with the Velcro pads about 70 cm from 
the motion sensor;  then the other end of the cart will be about 10 cm  from the spring on the 
force  sensor.  The  second  cart  (which  I  will  call  the  incident  cart,  with mass mA )  should  be 
placed  on  the  track  between  16 cm  and  20 cm  from  the motion  sensor.  You  should  push  the 
incident  cart  just  hard  enough  that  it  comes  back  to  the  starting  point  after  colliding  with 
the  other  cart  and  bouncing  oﬀ  the  spring.  If  you  push  it  too  hard  it may  jump  during  the 
collision with  the  target  cart,  and  if  you  push  it  too  softly  it will  not  come  back  far  enough 
to  stop  DataStudio  from  taking  data.

You  should  experiment  to  get  this  right  before  you  start  to make measurements.  How  hard 
you  need  push  it  changes  with  the masses  of  the  two  carts  and  whether  or  not  the  collision 
is  inelastic,  so you will have  to ﬁnd  this out  for each of  the  six measurements  that you make 
To  make  a  measurement,  click  the  DataStudio  start  button  and  start  the  incident  cart 
rolling  towards  the  target.  The  cart  will  roll  at  least  10 cm  before  data  are  recorded;  that 
gives  it  time  to  stabilize  and  roll  smoothly  after  you  push  it.  Make  measurements  with 
mA  =  mB  =  250 gm  (both  carts  empty),  mA  =  250 gm,  mB  =  500 gm,  and  mA  =  500 gm, 
mB  =  250 gm.  Measure  vA,1  before  the  carts  collide  and  v2  =  vA,2  =  vB ,2  after  the  collision 
when  the  two  carts  are  stuck  together  but  have  not  yet  hit  the  spring.  (Notation:  the 
subscripts  A  and  B  refer  to  the  carts,  and  subscripts  1  and  2  are  before  and  after  the  carts 
collide,  respectively.)  My  results  are  in  the  two  graphs  below. 

Position  vs.  Time 

Velocity  vs.  Time 

The  best  way  to  measure  vA,1  is  to  select  the  velocity  data  before  the  collision  and  use  the 
statistics  tool  (Σ)  on  the  graph  to  ﬁnd  the  average—as  shown  on  the  graph  below.  Then 
select  the  data  after  the  collision  (but  before  the  cart  hits  the  spring)  to  measure  v2 .  You 
will  not  need  the  force  sensor  data  for  the  inelastic  collisions. 

Record the values of vA,1  and v2  for each col­
lision  in  the  table  below.

Elastic  Collisions: 
These measurements will be done exactly  like the preceding ones except the carts are placed 
on  the  track with  the  opposite  ends  (the  ones  containing magnets)  facing  each  other.  Then 
the  collision  between  the  carts  will  be  elastic. 
You  should  measure  collisions  with  mA  = mB  = 250 gm  (both  carts  empty),  mA  = 250 gm, 
mB  =  750 gm,  and  mA  =  750 gm,  mB  =  250 gm.  Measure  vA,1  (before)  and  vA,2  (after  the 
carts  collide,  but  before  the  target  cart  bounces  back  to  hit  the  incident  cart).  The motion 
sensor  can  only  measure  the  velocity  of  the  incident  cart.  You  know  the  initial  velocity  of 
the  target  cart,  vB ,1 ,  is  zero,  and you  can ﬁnd  vB ,2  after  the  collision  from  the  impulse given 
to  the  target  cart  by  the  spring.  Here  is  how  to  do  it. 

at  the  left 
1.  Use  a  combination  of  selecting  points  and  the  “Scale  to  Fit”  button 
of  the  graph’s  toolbar  to  expand  the  force  graph  to  show  only  the  time  around  the 
collision  of  the  target  cart  with  the  spring,  like  this 

2.  Open  the  pull­down  menu  next  to  the  Σ  on  the  graph’s  tool  bar. 	 Check  the  “Area” 
item  at  the  bottom  of  the menu.  Uncheck  the  other  items. 

3.  Select  the data points  that correspond  to  the collision  (F  > 0) and click  the Σ  symbol 
(statistics  tool).  Then  DataStudio  will  calculate  the  time  integral  of  the  force  (the 
impulse,  J )  and  display  the  result  in  a  box  similar  to  that  on  the  graph  above. 

4.  The  post­collision  velocity  vB ,2  is  given  by  the  impulse  J/(2mB ).

suggest  that  you  embark  on  this  analysis  now.  You will  need  the  data  from  the  table  above

Appendix:  Magnetic  Force 
This is not part of the experiment you are asked to do (you may try it if you want a challenge) 
and is presented for your information.  When the carts collide elastically, they exert forces on 
each  other  by  the  repulsion  between  two  pairs  of  magnets.  In  Experiment  03  we  measured 
the  force  law  between  two  rectangular  ceramic  magnets.  I  was  able  measure  the  force  law 
between  the  two  carts. 
Here  is  how.  I  replaced  the  spring  on  the  force  sensor  with  a  more  solid  support  (a  gadget 
that  looks  like  the  force  sensor  springs, but without  the  spring attached).  Next,  I  raised  the 
motion  sensor  end  of  the  track  by  about  4 cm,  as  we  did  in  Experiment  06,  rested  cart  B 
against  the  force  sensor,  and  allowed  cart  A  to  roll  down  and  run  into  it.  I  selected  force 
and  position  data  only  from  the  time  when  the  carts  were  ﬁrst  40 mm  apart  to  the  point  of 
closest  approach.  The  graph  below  shows  my  results  and  the  result  of  ﬁtting  them  to  the 
expression  A*exp((D­x)/C)+B. 

The ﬁt  is very good (RMS error ±0.05 N). It shows that the repulsion between the two carts 
can  be  described  as  a  decaying  exponential  with  a  1/e  length  of  5.2 mm. 
Knowing  the  force  law  of  the  magnetic  “spring”  between  the  two  carts,  we  can  calculate 
their distance of closest approach during the collision.  You are asked to do this  in a problem 
in  Problem  Set  9,  due  November  9.  See  the  last  three  pages  of  these  notes.

Section  and  Group: 

Your  Name: 

Part  One:  Inelastic  Collisions 
Analysis:  Complete  the  analysis  of  your  data  table  by  following  the  two  steps 
below,  and  answer  Question  1  below. 
You  will  analyze  this  collision  as  seen  by  two  diﬀerent  observers.  One  observer  is  at  rest 
with  respect  to  the  classroom;  this  reference  frame  is  called  the  lab  reference  frame.  The 
other  observer  is  moving  at  a  velocity  equal  to  the  center  of  mass  velocity  of  the  two­cart 
system.  This  frame  is  called  the  center  of mass  reference  frame. 
Step  1:  Draw two momentum diagrams for both carts immediately before and immediately 
after  the collision, one describing  the collision  in  the  lab  reference  frame, and one describing 
the  collision  in  the  center  of mass  reference  frame. 
Step 2:  You made three diﬀerent trial collisions; the ﬁrst with equal masses, and the second 
and  third  with  unequal masses.  Use  your measured  values  to  complete  the  foillowing  table. 
Entries  to  the  left  of  the  double  vertical  bar  are  before  the  two  carts  collide;  those  to  the 
right  are  after  the  carts  collide  but  before  the  collision  with  the  force  sensor.  Hand  in  the 
table  with  your  homework  solutions.

a) 	 First  calculate  the  initial  kinetic  energy  K1  and  the  ﬁnal  kinetic  energy  K2  in  the 
‘lab  reference  frame’.  The  diﬀerence  between  the  two,  K2  − K1  =  WNC ,  is  the  non­
conservative internal work, WNC  = Kf − K0 , due to the totally inelastic collision.  This 
work  is  due  to  forces  that  irreversibly  deform  the  bodies  during  the  collision.

b)  Then  calculate  the  velocity  of  the  center  of mass,  which  is  given  by


�vCM  = 

mA�vA,1

. 

Because  momentum  is  conserved,  you  should  expect  �vCM  =  �v2 .  Calculate  the  total 
kinetic  energy  of  the  two  carts  in  the  center  of mass  reference  frame,  given  by

KCMCS  =  mA (vA,1  − vCM )2  +  mB vCM

Question  1:  In  the  center  of mass  reference  frame  the  incident  cart A moves  forward with 
a  slower  velocity,  �vA,1  − �vCM ,  than  in  the  lab  frame;  the  cart  B  moves  backward  with  a 
velocity  −�vCM .  After  the  collision  the  two  carts  are  stuck  together  and  are  at  rest  in  the 
center  of  mass  frame,  so  the  ﬁnal  kinetic  energy  in  this  frame  is  K � =  0.  Therefore  the 
f 
non­conservative  work  in  the  center  of mass  reference  frame  is  given  by 
� − KCMCS  = −KCMCS  . 
WNC  = Kf
Show  that Kf  − K0  = −KCMCS .  This will  require  a  calculation.  Do  your  experimental  data 
verify  this  theoretical  result ? 

Part  Two:  Elastic  Collisions 
Analysis:  Complete  the  analysis  of  your  data  table  by  following  the  two  steps 
below,  and  answer  Question  2  below. 
Once  again  you made  three  trials.  Since  the motion  sensor  can  only measure  the  initial  and 
ﬁnal  velocities  of  the  incident  cart A,  you  need  to  calculate  the  impulse  of  the  target  cart B 
on  the  force  sensor  to  determine  the  ﬁnal  velocity  of  cart  B. 
Step  1:  Draw  a  momentum  diagram  for  the  collision  immediately  before  the  cart  B  hits 
the  force  sensor  and  just  after  cart  B  rebounds  from  the  force  sensor. 
Step  2:  If  we  assume  that  cart  B  collides  elastically  with  the  force  sensor,  the  momentum 
of  cart  B  changes  by  Δ�pB  =  −2mB �vB ,2 .  This  change  in  momentum  is  the  impulse  that 
the  force  sensor  exerts  on  the  target  cart  B.  Cart  B  therefore  exerts  an  equal  and  opposite 
impulse  on  the  force  sensor with magnitude  J  = 2mB vB ,2 .  So measuring  the  impulse  allows 
you  to  calculate  the  velocity  of  the  target  cart  after  the  collision,  vB ,2  =  J/2mB .  Use  your 
measured  values  to  complete  the  following  table.  Entries  to  the  left  of  the  double  vertical 
bar  are  before  the  two  carts  collide;  those  to  the  right  are  after  the  carts  collide  but  before 
the  collision  with  the  force  sensor.  Hand  in  the  table  with  your  homework  solutions.

Question  2:  Assume  that  the  collision  between  the  carts  is  elastic.  Use  the  principles

of  conservation  of  momentum  and  of  mechanical  energy  to  calculate  the  theoretical

post­collision  velocites  for  cart  A  and  cart  B  for  each  of  the  three  trials.  Show  your  work.

(These  calculations  are  more  complicated  for  the  cases  where  the  carts  have  diﬀerent

masses.)  Brieﬂy  describe  whether  or  not  your  measured  values  agree  with  your  theoretical

values.  Do  you  results  conﬁrm  that  the  collisions  are  elastic ?


Modeling  the  Elastic  Collision: 

Question  3:  The  repulsive  force  between  two  carts  is modeled  by  the  force  law

F  = Ae−x/� 

where  x  is  the  separation  between  the  carts  and  �  is  a  characteristic  length  associated  with 
the  magnets  in  the  carts.  If  the  carts  start  very  far  apart  (an  inﬁnite  distance),  the  work 
�  d 
�  d 
required  to  bring  them  to  a  separation  distance  d  is: 
∞ 
∞

F(s) · ds = −A

W  = 

e−s/�ds 

Calculate this integral.  The result is the equivalent of the potential energy stored in a spring 
2 kx2 )  that  satisﬁes  a  linear  restoring  force  law.

( 1 
Question  4:  Suppose  there  are  two  of  these  carts  on  a  track.  One  cart  with  mass  m  and 
initial  speed  vA,1  runs  into  the  other,  which  has  equal  mass  and  is  initially  at  rest  on  the 
track.  Find  the  minimum  separation  d  between  the  carts  during  the  collision.  You  may 
assume  that  A  is  suﬃciently  large  so  that  d  >  �.  Evaluate  your  result  numerically  using 
A = 2.0 × 101 N,  � = 5 × 10−3 m,  m = 2.5 × 10−1 kg,  and  vA,1  = 5.0 × 10−1 m/s.  Hint:  this 
problem  is most  easily  done  in  the  center  of mass  reference  frame.
