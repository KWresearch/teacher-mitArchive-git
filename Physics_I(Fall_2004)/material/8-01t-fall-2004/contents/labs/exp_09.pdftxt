Experiment 9: Angular Momentum 

Goal 


To investigate conservation of angular momentum and 
kinetic energy in rotational collisions. 

Measure and calculate moments of inertia.


Measure and calculate non-conservative work in an 

inelastic collision.


Apparatus :

Phototransistor 
connects to 
channel A of 750. 
Tach-generator to 
channel B. 
Connect power 
supply. 
Red button applies 
power to motor. 

Put black sticker or tape on white plastic rotor for 
tachometer-generator calibration. 

Calibrate Tachometer-generator: 

Spin motor up to full speed, let it coast. 
Sample Rate: 5000 Hz, and Sensitivity: Low. 
Measure and plot voltages for 0.25 s period. 

Time for 10 periods to measure ω.  Average the output voltage 
over the same 10 periods. 
Then calculate ω for 1 V output.


Measure Rotor IR  :


Plot only the generator 
voltage for rest of expt. 
Use a 55 gm weight to 
accelerate the rotor. 
Sensitivity: Low 
Sample rate 500 Hz. 
Delayed start: None 
Auto Stop: 4 seconds 

Start DataStudio and let the weight drop. 


Graph: 


Generator voltage while measuring IR. What is happening:

1.  Along line A-B ? 
2.  At point B ? 
3.  Along line B-C ? 
How do you use this graph to find IR  ? 

Measure IR  Results: 


Measure and record αup  and αdown. 
For your report, calculate IR. 
(mr  g − rαup )
I R  α  − αdown
τf  = I Rαdown 
=

Fast Collision:

Sensitivity  Sample Rate  Delayed Start 
1 sec 
200 Hz 
Low 

Auto Stop 
Falls below 0.5V 

Find ω1  (before) and ω2  (after), estimate δt for collision. 

IW  =  1 m r
2ω(
o
2 

Calculate 

 − ri 
2 )

Slow Collision:


Find ω1  and ω2  , measure δt , fit or measure to find αc.

Keep a copy of your results for the homework problem.
