Experiment  01:  Introduction  to  DataStudio 

Fall  Term  2004 

Physics  8.01T 

Group: 

Participants: 

Note:  each  member  of  the  group  should  hand  in  a  completed  copy  of  this  page  with  the 
homework  assignment  due  September  14. 

Look  at  your  graphs  where  you  tried  to  move  your  hand  so  the  position  as  a  function  of 
time  was  a  triangle  wave.  What  do  the  graphs  tell  you  was  the  most  diﬃcult  thing  to  do 
properly? 

For  your  group’s  best  ﬁve  seconds  of  sine  wave  motion,  what  did  you  obtain  for  Root MSE  ,
10 |A|
the RMS error between the hand position and a perfect sine wave, expressed as a percentage 
of  the  amplitude  of  the motion ?
