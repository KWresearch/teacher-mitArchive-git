Introductory  Error  Analysis 

These  guidelines  will  be  augmented  as  the  term  progresses.  For  each  topic, 
two sets  of  guidelines  will  be  given: 
•  A  brief  description  of  the  terminology  and  method  of  calculuation. 

•  An  outline  of  the  theory  behind  the  formulas.  An  attempt  has  been  made 
to have  these  presentations  be  algebra-based, while  the  calculus-based  formulas  are 
presented  for  those  so  inclined. 

Sampling   a   Population:

Averages   and   Standard   Deviation


Deﬁnitions   and   Notation  

(This  presentation  will  use  the  notation  (cid:2)x(cid:3)  for  the  “average  value  of  x,”  as 
opposed  to  other  notation,  such  as  ¯x.) 
The average , more precisely the arithmetic   mean   of n samples of a measurement 
of  the  quantity  x,  denoted  x1 ,  x2 ,  . . . xn ,  or  more  compactly,  {x1 , x2 ,  . . .  ,  xn}, or 
n 
even  {xi}i=1 ,  is  denoted

distinction  should  be  made,  and  users  should  be  aware  of  which  measurement  is 
being used.  For  instance,  the  nearest  handheld  calculator  I  can  ﬁnd  has  both s and 
σ ;  once  one  is  calculated,  the  other  is  very  simple,  and  so  it’s  easy  to  include  both 
features.

Numerical   Methods  

For a  small number  of data measurements,  it might well be more convenient  to 
use a handheld calculator with statistics capabilities.  It should not be too much of a 
generalization  to  say  that  any  scientiﬁc  calculator  sold  today  has  such  capabilities. 
The  operators  of  these  handhelds  will  be  left  to  interpret  the  uses  thereof  on  their 
own  - the  notation  varies  too  much  from  make  to  make  and  model  to  model. 
What  follows  are  instructions  on  how  to  use  Xess,  the  default  spreadsheet 
on  server  at  MIT.  Other  spreadsheet  programs  (such  as  Excel)  will  use  similar 
notation  or  commands,  but  not  all  can  be  given  here. 
Let’s assusme we have ten  data  points, 

{xi} = {3.23,  3.15,  3.25,  3.21,  3.00,  3.05,  3.17,  3.18,  3.15,  3.13} . 

These  were  generated  by  the  “Random  Number”  feature  on  a  handheld,  and  are 
not  meant  to  correspond  to  anything  physical.  The  overall  closeness  to  π  is,  we 
hope,  a  ﬂuke.  Maybe  we’ll  see  how  “random”  they  are. 

2 

To start Xess, use the Dash/Menubar, whichever is convenient. 

When  the  Xess  window  appears,  merely  enter  the  data  in  Column  A  (of  course, 
it  doesn’t  matter  which  column  you  choose).  Data  are  typed  in  the  line  at  the 
top  of  the  sheet  (the  “Edit  line”)  and  entered  with  a  return,  checking  the  green 
checkmark  or  hitting  the  down-arrow  key.  Note  the  the  3.00  data  point  is  recorded 
as 3.  This  can be ﬁxed  by highlighting  the  column,  going  to “Format” on  the menu 
bar,  selecting  “Cell  Format”,  choosing  “Fixed”  and  setting  the  number  of  decimal 
places  at  2. 
The needed statistical functions are evaluated as follows: Click on the cell where 
you  want  the  result  to  appear,  and  type  the  given  command  into  the  Edit  line. 
=@AVG(A1..A10) 
Average: 
Standard  Deviation: 
Sample  Standard  Deviation: 
In  each  of  the  above,  the  “=” merely  indicates  that  a  numerical  result  is  given; 
the  “@”  is  used  to  call  a  speciﬁc  function;  and  a  range  must  be  given,  in  each  of 
the  above  cases  the  cells  A1  through  A10.  Entries  for  the  function  and  the  range 
are  not  case-sensitive.  The  precision  with  with  the  results  are  displayed  may  be 
changed  as  described  above  using  the  “Cell  Format”  feature. 
I get  σ  ∼  0.0776;  If  I  took  many  more  samples,  and  the  sampling  were  truly 
√ 
random,  I  would  expect  1/(8  3) ∼ 0.0722. 
In  one  of  the  earlier  experiments,  you  are  told  that  it’s  okay  to  use  an  “av-
erage  deviation,”  the  average  of  the  sum  of  the  absolute  values  of  the  deviations,

n  i=1 

Average  Deviation = 

=@STD(A1..A10) 

=@STDS(A1..A10) 

It  turns  out  that  if  there  are more  than a  few  points,  this  is diﬃcult  to  calculate by 
hand, as the absolute value does not reduce algebraically as the square of a binomial 
does.  However,  the  machines  don’t  care.  You  do,  however,  have  to  use  an  extra 
step,  in  that  the  average  has  to  be  calculated  ﬁrst. 
So,  if  you  have  found  the  average  in,  for  instance,  cell  B1,  and  enter  into  an 
empty  cell  (is  C1  still  empty?)  =@ABS(A1-$B$1).  The  dollar  signs  mean  that  the 
cell reference  is “absolute” (nothing to do with ABS, the absolute value function),  as 
opposed to A1, which is a “relative” cell reference.  This means that if you now enter 
the  function,  click on cell C1 and either “Control+f ” or select  from the Edit  feature 

3


on  the  menu  bar  to  copy  the  formula  into  cells  C2..C10,  the  respective  absolute 
values  of  the  diﬀerences  will  be  entered.  Then,  in  any  other  available  cell,  entering 
the  function  =@AVG(C1..C10  will  give  the  average  deviation. 
There’s  much  that  can  be  done,  but  little  that’s  useful  for  our  immediate  pur-
poses.  The  data  can  be  graphed  by  selecting  the  desired  column  and  using  the 
“Graph”  feature  from  the Menu  bar  and  selecting  “New  Graph.”  Either  “Scatter” 
or  “Bar Graph”  might  tell  you  something. 
The  real  advantage  to  using  the  spreadsheet  is  being  able  to  display  all  of  the 
data  and  calculations  simultaneously, making  editing  easier. 

Where   the   Formulas   Come   From  

Of  course,  everyone  knows  what  the  “average”  is,  but  it  turns  out  that  there’s 
a  slightly  subtle  reason  why  we  use  the  arithmetic  mean,  a  reason  that  will  serve 
us  well  in  other  applications. 
Suppose  we  call  the  “best  guess”  of  our  sample  c,  and  consider  the  variance

with  respect  to  c, in  the  form

Vc  =

Then,  Vc  clearly  is  positive  (Vc  =  0  will  not  be  considered)  and  depends  on  c. We 
want  to  adjust  c  so  that  Vc  is minimized.

This  convenient  algebraic  expression  allows  us  to  calculate  only  two  averages 
instead  of  having  to  calculate  (cid:2)x(cid:3),  then  recalculate  (xi  − (cid:2)x(cid:3))  a  total  of  n  times,

then  squaring  and  averaging.  So,  as  a  result,

σ = 

σ  is  known  as  the  “root mean  square”  of  the  sample,  that  is,  the  square  root  of  the 
average  square  of  the  distance  from  the  mean. 
There’s  one  slight  catch.  How  do  we  know  the  (cid:2)x(cid:3)  measured  from  our  n  trials 
is  the  true  mean?  Actually,  sometimes  we  know  it  can’t  be.  For  example,  if  we 
toss  a  fair  coin  n  times,  assigning  xi  = 0  if  toss  i  is  heads  and  xi  = 1  if  toss  i  is 
tails,  we  know  that  the  true  mean  is  1/2.  If  n  is  odd,  however,  we  can’t  possibly 
get  (cid:2)x(cid:3) = 1/2. 
� 
To  account  for  this,  we  revise  our  determination  of  the  standard  deviation;

The  factor  of  n − 1  instead  of  n  is  often  taken  to  mean  that  “one  measurement  is 
needed  to  ﬁnd  the mean,  so  n − 1  are  left  to  ﬁnd  the  standard  deviation.” Another 
way  to  see  the  necessity  of  this  factor  is  to  realize  that  one  measurement  tells  us 
nothing  about  the  standard  deviation. 
If  n  (cid:11)  1,  s  is  essentially  the  same  as  σ .  If,  however,  we  know  the  mean  in 
advance,  all we  are measuring  is  the  standard  deviation,  so  we  use  σ .  For  example, 
with  two  honest  dice,  we  know  that  the  average  of  the  sum  of  the  numbers  is  seven 
(2  is  as  probable  as  12,  3  as  likely  as  11,  etc).

Propagation  of  Error  - Experiment  2 

A  more  detailed  explanation  of  the  source  of  the  formulas  cited  here  will  be 
provided  later  in the term.  For now, we will state without proof an extension of the 
Pythagorean  Theorem  for  several  variables. 
Speciﬁally, if  f (x,  y ,  z , . . .), we  can  use  calculus  and  geometry  to  ﬁnd ∆f . We 
consider how a  small change  in one variable aﬀects f , square these  changes and add 
to  obtain ∆f .  Symbolically,  �
�2  �
�2 
∂ f 
∂ f 
2 
∆y  + · · · . 
(∆f ) = 
∆x  +
∂ y 
∂ x 

The  relation  to  the  Pythagorean  Theorem  is  that  the  terms  in  parentheses  on  the 
right side of the above expression represent “how far away from f ” the uncertainties 
∆x, ∆y ,  . . . would  allow  the  measurement  to  vary. 
For  Experiment  2, the  expression  for  the  gravitational  constant  g  in  terms  of 
the  ball  diamter  D, the  time  T  measured  for  the  ball  to  pass  the  photogate, the 
height  y  measured  above  the  ground, the  horizontal  range  x  of  the  ball’s  path  and 
the  initial  angle  θ0  is

= 2 

For  the purposes  of  estimating  the uncertainty ∆g , we will assume  that  impre-
cision  in  the  diameter  of  the  ball  (given  as D = 12 mm)  and  the  uncertainty  in  the 
initial  angle, (ﬁxed  at  a multiple  of ±15◦ )  contribute much  less  to ∆g  than  the  un-
certainties  in  T ,  x  and  y .  Be sure to realize that while the experiment  writeup  and 
your  table  of  results  use  “∆T ”  for  the  time  it  takes  the  ball  to  pass  the  photogate, 
that  usage  would  be  inappropriate  here, so  that  time  is  denoted  T  ± ∆T . 
The  needed  calculus  is  not  hard, but  not  worth  having  everyone  redo  the  cal-

culations.  To  simplify  things  somehwhat, denote  the  term  in  square  brackets  in  the

It would be nice  if the second  term on the  right above simpliﬁes, but  in general 
that won’t be the case.  It certainly might be expected that the more complicated the 
expression  for  f , the  more  complicated  the  expression  for  ∆f .  Consider, however,  
that  the  expression  for  g  was  not  that  complicated.  If  we  introduced  uncertainties 
in D  and  θ0  as  well, we’d  have  quite  a  bit  of  number-crunching  to  do.
