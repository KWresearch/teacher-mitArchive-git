  Investigate the transformation of non-conservative mechanical

(friction) and electrical work into heat energy:  

⇒ Add heat to water in plastic jar and measure the resulting  

increase in temperature as a function of time!


  Determine the mechanical and electrical equivalents of heat. 

  Observe that it is not easy to measure some important quantities 

accurately.

  Mechanical equivalent to heat: A 
motor applies a known friction torque 
c = 
τf  at a known ω  to a plastic jar with a 
known mass of H2O. 
  Electrical equivalent to heat: Apply 
voltage (2.5V) across a resistor 
(2.5Ohms)  and use resulting 
electrical heat: Resistor is connected 
to right pair of posts.

  Temperature measurement: Use a thermistor to 
measure the water temperature: Thermistor is a 
semi-conductor device with a temperature 
dependent internal resistance of 
R T(  )=  R0e−αT 
  First task: Calibrate thermistor and measure room 
temperature!

  Enter values R, T from jar into a DataStudio  

table. R is independent (X) value. T is 

dependent (Y) value. 


  Fit to  B – A*ln(x),  find A, B 
and then measure Troom  with 
these parameters!

  First plot R vs. t, then Calculate T=A-B*ln(x), where A, B are your  

thermistor calibration parameters. Plot result to get T vs. t.


  Fit to C+B*T*(1-t/A)
to find A, B, and C. 
  Initial guesses: C=20, 
B=0.004, A=5000.

  Agitate water by rocking apparatus: (i) about 10 s each minute, (ii) for 
30 s prior to measuring thermistor. 
  Measure thermistor about every 3 min. for 24 min. 

	 Make a graph of T vs. t as for friction heating.
