Experiment 3: Modeling Forces 

Goal 

Use DataStudio  to plot and analyze the force that two 
magnets exert on one another as a function of the 
distance between them. 
Use linear, semi-log, and log-log graphs to gain some 
insight into how the force varies with separation. 

Find a mathematical function that describes this force, 
a “force law”. 

Measuring the Gap:


Measure heights h1  and h2 
with your ruler, and subtract 
them. (h1  will be constant.) 
The two magnets stuck 
together weigh 6.0 pennies. 
The plastic coin holder 
weighs 4.0 pennies. 
Enter the gap (in mm) and  

the total weight (in pennies)  

into a table in DataStudio.

The gap goes in the X (left) 
column of the table. 

Starting DataStudio:


Choose the “Enter Data” option.


Making a Table I: 


•A table and a graph will 
appear. Close the graph 

window (removes it). Drag 

the table borders to make it 

smaller. 

•Click the “Summary” 
button to open the “Data” 
and “Displays” windows. 
•Double-click “Editable 
Data” in the Data window. 

This opens a “Data 
Properties” window… 

Making a Table II:


•Choose a title for the 
data set. 
•Pick names and units of 
the X and Y variables. 

Making a Table III:


•Type in your measurements, gap in the left (X) column and force 
in the right (Y) column. 
•To plot them, drag the “Force vs.Gap” entry in the Data window 
onto “Graph” in the Displays window. 

Semi-log Graph: 

•Click the “Calculate” button.
•In the definition window type LogF=ln(y).

•Under the “Variables” pull-down menu choose “Data 
Measurement” and then your data in the yellow 
window that opens. 
•After you click the Accept button, there should be a 
new entry “LogF=ln(y)” in the Data window; it will 
have ln(force) as Y and gap  as X. 
•Make a graph of ln(force) vs. gap  by dragging this  

entry onto the Graph entry in the Displays window.

•Use the Linear Fit function to see if it is a straight line 
and find the exponent from the slope. 

Semi-log Graph: 


Log-log Graph: 

•Make a new empty data table by clicking the “New 
Data” button. 
•Type your measured values of the gap into both 
columns (X and Y) of the table.

•Use the calculate button with LogG=ln(y)to get a 
new data set with ln(gap) as a function of gap in the 
Data window. 
•Make a graph of ln(force) vs. ln(gap) by plotting 
ln(force) vs. gap  and dragging the LogG  data set onto 
the X axis of the graph,. 
•Use the graph’s Slope Tool to fill in the table in your 
report, part (b). 

Log-log Graph: 


Clearly not linear; use the Smart Tool to see how slope changes.


Alternate Fit:

Return to your original linear force  vs. gap  graph.

Carry out a User-Defined fit to the function:  


A*9070*(x+B)/(5000+(500+(x+B)^2)*(x+B)^2)


Note the Root MSE value and compare with the 
exponential. (Two fits are not considered significantly 
different unless the smaller Root MSE is 70% or less 
of the larger one.) 

The origin of this function is discussed it the appendix 
to the write up for the experiment.
