Experiment  09:  Angular  Momentum 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  investigate  rotational  collisions  and  the  conservation  of  angular 
momentum  in  rigid  body  rotational  dynamics.  It  is  the  rotary  counterpart  of  Experiment 
07  in  which  you  investigated  linear  collisions.  It  is  also more  diﬃcult. 
The heart of the experiment is a high quality DC motor to spin a rotor up to several hundred 
radians per second.  When power to the motor is shut oﬀ, it serves as a tachometer­generator 
whose  output  voltage  is  proportional  to  the  angular  velocity  of  the  rotor;  thus  the  angular 
velocity  of  the  rotor  can  be  determined  by  measuring  the  output  voltage.  When  you  hold 
down  the  red pushbutton  switch on  the apparatus, power  is applied  to  the motor; when you 
release  it,  the  rotor  coasts  and  the  output  voltage  can  be  read  by  the  DataStudio  program. 
This  experiment  will  give  you  practice  in 
•  measuring  and  calculating moments  of  inertia, 
•  calculating  rotational  kinetic  energy  and  non­conservative  rotational  work,  and 
•  using  several  other  concepts  from  our  study  of  rotational  dynamics. 

Setting  Up  the  Experiment: 
Plug  the  rotary  motion  apparatus  into  its  power  supply;  you  should  see  the  LED  in  the 
plastic  pipe  elbow  come  on.  Connect  the  phototransistor  and  generator  output  voltages 
to  inputs  A  and  B  on  the  ScienceWorkshop  750  interface  box  using  the  leads  from  two 
voltage  sensor  plugs. 
(The  generator  output  terminals  are  the  two  farthest  from  the 
power  input  connector.)  The  best  DataStudio  sampling  options  depend  on  what  you  are 
going  to  measure  and  will  be  given  in  a  table  for  each  section  of  the  experiment.  Before 
you  can  carry  out  any  rotational  collision  measurements,  you  must  ﬁrst  calibrate  the 
tachometer­generator  and measure  the moment  of  inertia  of  the  rotor. 

Calibrating  the  Generator: 
Stick  a  black  sticker  or  a  small  piece  of  black  tape  on  the  white  plastic  centerpiece  of  the 
rotor  so  that  it  will  be  illuminated  by  the  LED  and  the  reﬂected  light  detected  by  the 
phototransistor.  The  voltage  output  will  be  about  5 V  when  the  LED  is  reﬂected  from 
the  black  tape  and  1 V  when  it  is  reﬂected  from  the  white  plastic.  Set  up  the  DataStudio 
sampling  options  as  follows.

Set up graphs to plot both the phototransistor output and the generator output as a function 
of  time.  Spin  the  motor  up  for  several  seconds,  release  the  button  and  allow  it  to  coast  for 
about  a  second,  then  click  the  DataStudio  start  button.

You  should  get  plots  something  like  these.


The  voltage  peaks  on  the  left  graph  correspond  to  the  black  tape  passing  in  front  of  the 
LED.  The  number  of  peaks  you  see  depends  upon  how  fast  the  rotor  was  spinning  when 
you  did  your measurement;  anywhere  from  ﬁve  to  ten  peaks  in  the  0.250 s  plot  time  should 
be  OK.  Use  the  graph  Smart  Tool  (locked  on  to  the  points)  to  ﬁnd  the  time  for,  say,  six 
revolutions  of  the  rotor.  The  generator  output  in  the  right  graph  is  noisy,  but  you  can 
select  the  data  corresponding  to  the  time  period  between  the  peaks  you  counted  in  the  left 
graph  and  use  the Σ  tool  for  the  generator  graph  to  ﬁnd  the  average  output  voltage  for  the 
period.  Use  these  results  to  ﬁnd  the  angular  velocity  and  voltage  generator  output.  (You 
should  ﬁnd  that  1 V  corresponds  to  about  70  radians/sec;  I  obtained  71.8 (rad/s) V−1 .) 
Record  your  value  in  your  report. 
If  you  were  fussy,  you  could  repeat  the  measurement  for  several  diﬀerent  rotation  speeds, 
but  I  checked  it  and  found  it  to  be  quite  linear—so  there  is  no  real  need. 
Remove  the  black  sticker  or  tape.  In  the  remaining  measurements  you  will  only  use  the 
generator  output  voltage  and  can  remove  the  graph  of  phototransistor  output. 

Finding  the  Rotor  Moment  of  Inertia: 
Next,  you  must  measure  the  moment  of  inertia  IR  of  the  rotor.  To  do  this  you  will  use  a 
55 gm  weight  (50 gm  brass  weight  plus  5 gm  plastic  holder)  to  accelerate  the  rotor.  Tie  a 
loop  in  one  end  of  the  string  and  use  it  to  suspend  the  weight  over  the  pulley,  as  shown 
in  the  photo  at  the  top  of  the  next  page.  Use  a  string  just  long  enough  to  reach  from  the 
weight  (when  it  is  on  the  ﬂoor)  over  the  pulley  to  the  axis  of  the  rotor.  Tie  a  knot  at  the 
other  end  of  the  string  and  insert  the  string  into  the  kerf  cut  into  the  brass  washer  on  the 
rotor  and  wind  the  string  around  the  constant  diameter  portion  of  the  white  plastic.  (This 
part  has  a  diameter  of  1.00  inch  or  a  radius  of  12.7 mm,  which  you  will  need  to  calculate 
the  torque.)  Keep  the  string  away  from  the  Velcro  on  the  washer  that  is  part  of  the  rotor 
as  you  wind  it.  Set  up  the  DataStudio  sampling  options  as  follows.

Click  the  DataStudio  start  button  and  release  the  weight.  You  should  get  a  graph  that 
resembles  the  one  below. 

The  graph  has  two  feaures.  First  the  voltage  (ω  of  the  rotor)  increases  linearly,  showing 
constant  angular  acceleration  α.  Then  it  shows  a  constant  (but  smaller  in  magnitude) 
angular  deceleration.  The  change  from  one  to  the  other  comes  when  the  string  pulls  out  of 
the  kerf. 

Experiment  09

November  15,  2003


The  constant deceleration  is produced by a  constant  friction  torque  τf ,  and  the acceleration 
is  produced  by  the  torque  from  the  55 gm  weight.  Of  course  friction  also  acts  when  the 
falling  weight  is  accelerating  the  rotor,  so  you  will  have  to  know  τf  in  order  to  ﬁnd  the 
moment  of  inertia  of  the  rotor.  A Linear Fit  separately  to  the  rising and  falling parts  of  the 
graph  will  give  the  answers. 

You may  be  unlucky  and  the  string  will  not  pull  cleanly  out  of  the  kerf  and  allow  the  rotor 
to  coast.  In  that  case  you  can  still  obtain  the  angular  acceleration  αup  for  the  rising  curve 
on  the  left  in  your  graph  but  you  should  make  a  second  measurement  to  get  the  angular 
acceleration  αdown  when  the  rotor  is  slowing  down  under  the  torque  of  the  bearing  friction. 
To do  that,  remove  the  string  from  the  rotor,  spin up  the motor with  the  red power button, 
release  the  button  so  it  begins  to  coast,  and  start  DataStudio  again.  You  will  get  a  nice 
graph  whose  downward  slope  αdown  you  can measure. 
For my  graph  the  slope  for  αup  was  1.21 V/s  corresponding  to  71.8 (rad/s) V−1  × 1.21 V/s= 
86.9 rad/s2 .  For  αdown  I  obtained  −0.512 V/s  or  −36.8 rad/s2 .  Friction  causes  the  only 
torque  that  produces  αdown ,  so 

IR |αdown =  τf | .

(1) 

The  linear  acceleration  of  the  falling  weight  is  given  by  a = rαup  where  r = 0.0127 m  is  the 
radius  of  the  rotor  the  string  was  wound  around.  The  tension  in  the  string  must  then  be 
T  =  m(g − a)  where  m  = 0.055 kg  is  the  mass  of  the  falling  weight.  The  string  therefore 
produces  a  torque  τup  = rT  on  the  rotor.  The  net  torque  produces  αup ,  thus 
IRαup  = τup  −  τf  .

A  Fast  Inelastic  Collision: 
Now you have the apparatus calibrated and can do a  fast angular collision.  As you observed 
in the previous measurement, there is a signiﬁcant friction torque τf  acting on the rotor.  This 
torque  is  always  present  and  must  be  taken  into  account  when  you  analyze  your  results.  A 
“fast” collision is one in which the angular impulse of τf  is too small to aﬀect the conservation 
of  angular momentum  during  the  collision  (§ 12.1.8  of  course  notes). 
Take  a  large  brass  washer  with  one  smooth  side  and  one  with  Velcro  glued  onto  it.  If 
you  drop  it  Velcro  side  down  onto  the  spinning  rotor,  it  will  stick  to  the  Velcro  on  the 
rotating washer  and make  a  very  short  duration  collision.  For  this measurement,  set  up  the 
DataStudio  sampling  options  as  follows.

There  is  no  need  to  retain  data  before  the  delayed  start.  Spin  up  the  rotor  to  its maximum 
speed  and  release  the  red  button.  Then  click  the  DataStudio  start  button.  Wait  a  second 
or  two  and  drop  the  washer  as  accurately  as  you  can  over  the  axis  of  the  spinning  rotor. 
You  should  obtain  a  graph  something  like  the  one  at  the  left  below. 

The  graph  at  the  right  shows  the  collision  region  expanded.  From  this  graph  you  can  use 
the  Smart  Tool  to  ﬁnd  the  angular  velocities  before  and  after  the  collision,  ω1  and  ω2 ,  and 
also  estimate  the  duration  of  the  collision  δ t.  (I  estimated  δ t  between  5  and  10 ms  from my 
graph).  The values  in this table need to be ﬁlled  in while you do the experiment, as you will 
need  them  to  complete  your  report  or  for  the  problem  set.

A  Slow  Collision: 
This is a repeat of the previous measurement, except you drop the washer smooth side down. 
You  should  obtain  a  graph  something  like  this. 

The  main  diﬀerence  from  the  previous  experiment  is  that  the  collision  lasts  long  enough 
that  τf  has  a  signiﬁcant  impulse;  thus  the  angular momentum  is  reduced  during  the  course 
of  the  collision.  You  can  measure  one  new  parameter,  the  angular  acceleration  αc  of  the 
rotor  during  the  collision.  If  you  look  closely,  you  can  see  that  αc  is  not  constant  during 
the  collision.  However  the  average  value  will  be  good  enough  for  your  analysis.  You  may 
ﬁnd  it  two  ways:  either  from  (ω2  − ω1 )/δ t  or  by  a  Linear  Fit  to  the  data  points  during  the 
collision.  Use  the method  you  like  best.

2.  Use  the  values  you  found  for  τf  and  δ t  to  estimate  the  angular  impulse  of  τf  during

3.  Use  the  value  you  found  for αc  to  estimate  the  total  torque  τc  on  the  rotor  during  the

4.  The  torque  τc  is  made  of  two  parts:  the  friction  torque  τf  from  the  bearings  and  the 
torque  τRW  the  washer  you  dropped  exerts  on  the  rotor.  By  the  3rd  law,  the  rotor 
exerts  an  equal  and  opposite  torque  on  the  washer.  Since  you  know  τf ,  subtract  it 
from  τc  to  ﬁnd  an  estimate  for  τRW .

Part  Four:  Nonconservative  Work  in  the  Slow  Collision 
You can ﬁnd τRW  a diﬀerent way, because it produces the angular acceleration of the dropped 
washer, whose  average  value  is αW  = ω2/δ t.  Use  this  relation  to  estimate  τRW  and  compare 
it  to  the  previous  estimate  you made: 

The  torque  τRW  comes  from  the  sliding  friction  between  the  washer  on  the  rotor  and  the 
washer you dropped.  Thus there must be some non­conservative work.  You may calculate  it 
if you know the angular “distance” the washer slides over the rotor before it reaches the same 
angular  velocity  as  the  rotor,  and  you  do  have  enough  information  to  ﬁnd  that.  The  angle 
the  rotor  rotates  through  during  the  collision  is  (analogous  to  linear  motion  with  constant 
acceleration) 

ΔθR  = ω1δ t − 

1 
|αc |δ t2 
2 

while  the  dropped  washer  rotates  through  an  angle 

ΔθW  =

1 
|αW  δ t2 .
|
2 

Thus  the  non­conservative  work  done  by  the  sliding  friction  between  the  two  washers  will 
be 

WN C,W  = τRW (ΔθR  − ΔθW ). 

You  can  also  calculate  the  non­conservative  work  done  by  the  bearing  friction  during  the 
collision 

WN C,B  = τf ΔθR . 

Calculate these two amounts of non­conservative work and compare their sum to the change 
2  −  2 (IR  + IW )ω2  during  the  collision.
