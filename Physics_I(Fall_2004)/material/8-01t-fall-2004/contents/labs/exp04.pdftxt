Experiment  04:  Uniform  Circular  Motion 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
The  direct  goal  of  this  experiment  is  to  study  a“conical  pendulum”  like  the  one  in  your 
homework  assignment  this  week.  A  ﬁshing  sinker  (the  “mass”)  is  attached  to  a  rotating 
shaft by a spring and you will adjust the angular velocity of the  shaft rotation, and measure 
the  radius  rm  of  the  circular  motion  of  the  mass,  calculate  the  centripetal  force,  and  use 
the  results  to  ﬁnd  the  force  constant  of  the  spring.  To  simplify  the  analysis  of  your  results, 
assume  that  the mass  of  the  spring  can  be  neglected. 

You  should  learn  at  least  the  following  things  from  this  experiment: 
•	 An  experimental  veriﬁcation  of  the  force  required  to  produce  centripetal  acceleration. 
•	 This system has an instability at a critical angular frequency, ωC , for the shaft rotation; 
you  will  observe  the  approach  to  this  instability  and  understand  what  causes  it. 
•	 You  will  get  more  experience  in  analyzing  your  measurements  to  ﬁnd  properties  you 
may want  to  know  (the  spring  force  constant)  and  you may  ﬁnd  that  the  spring  has  a 
property  (pre­tension)  that  we  have  not  discussed  before. 

Setting  Up  the  Experiment: 
The  apparatus  includes  a  viewer  to  facilitate  measuring  the  radius  of  the  mass’s  motion, 
rm .  It  is  a  white  teﬂon  block  with  a  black  viewing  tube  and  it  slides  in  a  slot  in  the  top 
cover  of  the  apparatus.  A  small  nail  protudes  down  into  the  slot  and  should  be  placed  to 
engage  the  loop  of  the  brass wire  that  has  a  LED  taped  to  it;  that  is  so  the  LED  will move 
to  illuminate  the  mass  as  you  try  to  read  its  position.  (This  all  works  better  if  the  room 
lights  are  oﬀ.)  Another  nail  protrudes  into  the  viewing  tube  and  can  be  lined  up  over 
the black stripe around the mass; the same nail also allows you to read the radius on the scale.

wrmFirst you need to know the mass mm  of the ﬁshing sinker.  The one I used had mm  = 9.3 gm, 
but you should ask your instructor for the right mass for your apparatus (most of them seem 
to  have  a mm  = 8.5 gm.) 
Next,  attach  the mass  and  spring  to  the  hook  on  the  shaft  inside  the  box. 
Before  you  turn  on  the  apparatus,  you  should 
measure  r0 ,  which  is  the  value  that  rm  would  have 
if  the  spring  were  not  stretched  at  all.  Stand  the 
box  on  its  side  and  hold  the  counterweight  and  the 
shaft  so  that  the  spring  and  mass  hang  down  along 
the  scale.  Use  the  viewer  to  measure  the  value  of 
r0  =  rm (ω  =  0)  when  the  mass  is  hanging  still;  you 
can use r0  to calculate how much the spring stretches 
when  it  is  rotating. 
Next  connect  the  apparatus  to  its  12V  power  supply 
via  the  connector  on  the  side. 
You  should  replace  the  side  cover  to  the  box 
before  you  turn  on  the  motor.  The  lead  sinker 
moves  at  fairly  high  speed  and  would  give  a  nasty 
whack  to  your  ﬁnger  if  it were  hit  by  it.  Turn  on  the 
circular  motion  apparatus  and  try  diﬀerent  speeds 
to  see  how  it  behaves.  You  will  use  DataStudio  to 
measure  the  rotation  period,  T ,  of  the  mass,  and 
from  that  calculate  the  angular  rotation  frequency 
ω = 2π/T . 

As  the  motor  rotates,  a  magnet  in  the  counterweight  triggers  a  reed  relay  on  the  top  cover 
of  the  box  and makes  a  voltage  pulse  every  time  the magnet  passes  under  it. 
A  voltage  sensor  should  be  connected  from  the  ScienceWorkshop  750  interface  to  the  two 
banana  jacks  that  are  farthest  away  from  the  speed  control  knob. 
In  DataStudio  drag  a  voltage  sensor  to  the  appropriate  input  on  the  750  interface;  double­
click  the  voltage  sensor  and  set  it  to  low  sensitivity  and  a  sample  rate  of  5000  Hz  in  the 
window  that  opens.  Set  the  sampling  options  (either  from  the  “Experiment”  main  pull­
down menu or  the“Options” button of  the “Experiment Setup” window)  to “none”  for both 
automatic  start  and  stop.  After  that,  DataStudio  will  make  measurements  continuously 
when  you  click  the  start  button.  To  display  the  voltage  pulses,  drag  the  Voltage  in  the 
“Data”  window  to  the  Scope  icon  in  the  “Display”  window.  That  will  open  up  a  scope 
display.  Set  it  to  1 V/div  on  the  vertical  scale  and  20 ms/div  on  the  horizontal  (time)  scale. 
The  �  symbol  to  the  left  of  the  ms/div  label  on  the  x­axis  reduces  the  time  to  sweep  a 
division  (increases  the  sweep  rate)  and  the  �  symbol  does  the  opposite.  Slide  up  the  trigger 
level  symbol Δ  on  the  y ­axis  of  the  graph  to  about  0.5V;  this  will  give  a more  stable  scope 
pattern.  You should see voltage pulses like this on the scope display after you click the Start 
button.

rmMaking  Measurements: 
Measure  the  radius  rm (ω) of  the mass’s  circular motion  for  three diﬀerent angular velocities 
to give values of rm  between 5 and 10 cm.  Allow the speed to stabilize before you make your 
measurement.  To  ﬁnd  the  rotation  period  on  the  scope  display,  you  may  ﬁnd  it  helpful  to 
click  on  the  single  trace  button  at  the  top  of  the  display  graph  and  use  the  smart  tool.  For 
each measurement  you  need  to  determine  rm (ω)  and  the  rotational  period  T . 
Your  goal  is  to  complete  a  table  like  the  one  below  for  ω  =  0  and  for  three  or  four  values 
of  ω  >  0.  The  values  for  T  and  rm  (shown  in  bold  type)  should  be  entered  as  you  do  the 
experiment;  all  the  other  values  will  be  calculated  from  them  when  you  do  the  analysis.

The  table  contains  the  values  I  measured,  but  you  may  have  a  diﬀerent  spring  and  ﬁshing 
sinker  mass  and  so  may  get  something  quite  diﬀerent.  You  calculate  ω  = 2π/T  and  ﬁnd 
the  amount ΔX  the  spring  stretched  using ΔX  = rm  − r0 .

A note about gravity:  if you have been think­
ing  as  you  read  this,  you  should  wonder  why  I 
am not considering the eﬀect of gravity.  Because 
of  gravity,  the  spring  and  mass  will  hang  down 
at  some  angle  θ ,  as  shown  exaggerated  at  the 
right.  The  spring  and  mass  will  actually  sweep 
out a conical path inside the box; that’s why this 
apparatus  is  often  called  a  conical  pendulum. 

If  you  ignore  the  mass  of  the  spring  and  simply  analyze  a  free  body  diagram  of  the  sinker, 
you  will  ﬁnd  that  tan θ = rmω 2/g .  For  the  smallest  non­zero  rmω  in my  table,  tan θ � 250. 
Thus  θ  is  very  close  to  90◦  (θ  >  89.75◦ )  and  it  is  a  good  approximation  to  ignore  gravity 
and  pretend  the motion  is  in  a  horizontal  plane. 
This  apparatus  shows  that  it  is  relatively  easy  to  generate  centripetal  accelerations  from 
250  to  1000  times  that  of  gravity  in  rotating  machinery.  In  a  laboratory  ultra­centrifge, 
accelerations  of  700 000 g  can  be  attained  with  ω � 10 000 s−1  (90 000  rpm).

rmrsqApproaching  the  Instability: 
To begin this analysis, enter your values for ω  in the X  (left) column and rm  in the Y  (right) 
column  of  a  new  data  table  in  DataStudio.  To  create  a  data  table  in  DataStudio,  choose 
“New  Empty  Data  Table”  from  the  main  “Experiment”  pull­down  menu.  (If  you  want  to 
give  a  title  to  the  data  and  units  for  the X  and  Y  variables,  double­click  the  table  entry  in 
the  “Data”  window,  and  a  window  will  open  for  you  to  do  this.) 

When  your  data  have  been  entered,  you  will  get  a  table  that  looks  like  the  one  above. 
Next, plot  them on a graph by dragging  the  entry  from  the Data window onto Graph  in  the 
Displays  window.  Here  is  my  plot.  There  is  also  a  ﬁtted  line,  which  I  discuss  on  the  next 
page.

You  should  use  DataStudio  to  ﬁt  your  rm (ω)  data  to  the  expression 

y = 

A 
1 − (x/B )2 

This  function  is  not  in  DataStudio ’s  library  of  functions,  so  under  the  “Fit”  button  of  the 
graph’s  toolbar,  pick  the  User­Deﬁned  Fit  option.  When  you  do  that,  probably  nothing 
will  happen  except  a  new  entry  called  “User­Deﬁned  Fit”  will  appear  in  the  Data  window. 
If  you  double­click  it,  that  should  open  a  window  like  the  one  below.  If  the  Automatic 
button  is  not  depressed,  click  it  so  that  it  becomes  depressed;  that  means  DataStudio  will 
try  to  ﬁnd  the  values  of  A  and  B  that  provide  the  best  ﬁt  to  your  data  points.  Type 
A/(1­(x*x)/(B*B))  into  the  window  to  deﬁne  your  function  and  click  the  Accept  button. 
DataStudio  will  probably  complain  that  it  could  not  ﬁnd  a  ﬁt;  that  is  a  sign  the  program 
needs  some  help  from  you.  Type  some  reasonable  values  into  the  Initial  Guess  ﬁelds  that 
have opened up (Good guesses would be A = 5 cm and B  = 150 s−1 ) and click Accept again. 
The  ﬁtted  parameter  values  should  appear  in  the  window,  the  ﬁt  curve  should  be  plotted 
on  your  graph  and  a  text  box  should  open  on  the  graph  that  also  lists  the  ﬁt  results. 

As you can see for my data, the above expression is a very good ﬁt.  Let’s see why I expected 
that.  We  know  that  the  centripetal  force  is  given  by 

Fc  = mm rm ω 2 

while  the  force  exerted  by  the  spring,  where  I  use  the  symbol  r0  for  rm (ω = 0),  is 
Fspring  = (rm  − r0 )k

If  I  equate  the  two  forces  and  solve  the  resulting  equation  for  rm  I  ﬁnd 

rm  = 

r0 
1 − mmω 2/k 

This  is  the  expression  I  ﬁt  above;  you  can  see  that  the  parameter A  should  be  the  quantity 
you  measured  for  r0  = rm (ω  = 0).  You  can  also  see  that  the  mass  will  “escape”  (rm  → ∞)

You  can  understand  why  this  instability  occurs  if  you  diﬀerentiate  the  two  force  equations.

For  ω  <

more  slowly  with  rm  than  the  restoring  force  provided  by  the  spring  does;  the  spring  can 
always  stretch  a  bit more  to  provide  enough  force  to  hold  the mass  in  its  circular  path.  For 
ω ≥
k/m, the opposite is true and stretching the spring—so long as it obeys Hooke’s law— 
only  makes  the  situation  worse.  Something  catastrophic  will  happen.  To  prevent  damage, 
the  power  supply  in  your  apparatus  should  have  been  adjusted  to  keep  ω  <  ωc .  If  it  was 
not,  you may have been  able  to  turn  it up  enough  to  reach ωc .  That usually manifests  itself 
by  a  loud  clattering  noise  when  the  sinker  hits  the  walls  of  the  plastic  box. 
This  instability  shows  up  in  some  other  circumstances.  You  may  have  experienced  it  while 
blowing  up  party  balloons  by  mouth;  it  is  especially  obvious  with  long  skinny  balloons. 
In  that  case,  the  stretched  rubber  provides  a  restoring  force  (analogous  to  the  spring)  to 
counterbalance  the  air  pressure  in  the  balloon.  Above  a  critical  pressure,  the  force  required 
to  contain  the  pressure  increases  more  rapidly  with  the  balloon’s  radius  than  the  rubber 
restoring force does.  The balloon does not usually pop, however;  instead  it suddenly  inﬂates 
to  a  larger  radius  and  remains  whole  because  the  highly  stretched  rubber  provides  an  even 
greater  restoring  force  (it  has  a  larger  rate  constant).  The  balloon  does  not  obey  Hooke’s 
law. 
An  analogous  instability  can  occur  in  arteries  weakened  by  disease  and  often  leads  to  an 
aneurism,  often  fatal  when  the  artery  ruptures. 
If  you  want  a  challenge,  see  if  you  can  derive  an  equation  for  the  radius  as  a  function  of 
pressure  for  a  balloon  or  artery  (a  cylindrical  tube)  that  follows  Hooke’s  law.

Finding  the  Spring  Rate  Constant: 
Note:  you  don’t  have  to  do  this  ﬁt  in  order  to  turn  in  your  report  for  this  experiment. 
However,  it  is  required  for  a  problem  on  your  next  problem  set  (which  is  attached  as  the 
last page  of  this document).  There  should be  enough  time  to do  the ﬁt  in  class  and you  can 
ﬁll  in  the  relevant  numbers  on  the  last  page. 
The  springs  supplied  for  this  experiment  have  been  wound  to  have  a  “pre­tension.”  That 
means a certain force F0  must be applied to the spring before the spring will begin to stretch, 
and the  force  law  is given by Fspring  = F0 + kΔX .  (In 8.01T we will usually call k the spring 
force constant, but  if you  look at the  literature of companies that manufacture springs,  they 
use  the  term  “rate  constant”.)  When  you  analyze  your  results  to  ﬁnd  the  rate  constant  k 
you  will  need  to  use  this  expression: 

For  example,  from my  table  I  need  to  satisfy  the  equations. 

Fspring  = F0  + kΔX . 

2.44 = F0  + 0.012k 
4.83 = F0  + 0.024k 
10.5 = F0  + 0.055k 

(1) 
(2) 
(3) 

Here  are  three  equations  and  two unknowns,  so  the  coeﬃcients F0  and k that  I want  to ﬁnd 
are  overdetermined;  a  consistent  set  of  values  does  not  likely  exist. 
Whenever  you  have  more  measurements  than  adjustable  parameters,  which  is  always  a 
desirable  situation,  you  need  to  ﬁnd  the  parameters  F0  and  k that  represent  some  kind  of 
“best  ﬁt”  compromise. 
You  should  type  the  numbers  into  a  DataStudio  table,  plot  them,  and  use  the  program’s 
Linear  Fit  function.  Create  a  new  table  as  you  did  for  the  rm  and  ω data. 
Type  your mmrmω 2  values  into  the  Y ­axis 
(right)  column  and  your  ΔX  values  into 
the  X ­axis  (left)  column.  When  the  ta­
ble  is  complete,  plot  the  data  by  drag­
ging  them  from  the  “Data” window  to  the 
Graph  icon  in  the  “Displays”  window. 
You  can  also  export  the  data  as  an  ASCII 
text  ﬁle  (e.g.,  to  the  desktop  of  your  com­
puter) which you could send to yourself by 
email if you want a machine-readable file for 
later analysis with Xess. (With only three points, 
I'd use a pencil and paper and type them into Xess 
by hand.)

Select  the  Fit  tab  on  the  graph  toolbar  and  ask  DataStudio  to  do  a  linear  ﬁt.  Here  is  what 
I  obtained. 

The  results  are  F0  = 0.27 ± 0.13 N  and  k  =  187 ± 4 N/m.  As  rm  could  only  be  measured 
to  two  signiﬁcant  ﬁgures,  I  should  quote  k  only  to  two  signiﬁcant  ﬁgures  as  well.  The 
pre­tension  comes  from  subtracting  two  almost  equal  numbers  and  could  well  be  zero.  (A 
negative  pre­tension  would  make  no  sense  because  ΔX  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  distance  the 
spring  is  stretched  from  the  length  it  has  when  the  applied  force  is  zero.)  You  can measure 
the  period  T  rather  accurately,  so  the main  source  of  error  is  rm .
