Experiment  03:  Modeling  Forces 

Fall  Term  2004 

Physics  8.01T 

Group: 

Participants: 

Note:  each group should hand in a completed copy of this page (one page per group) before 
leaving  the  classroom  today. 

(a)  Consider  the  exponential  function 

y = A e−C x 

that  you  ﬁt  to  your measured  force. 

1.  What  value  did  you  ﬁnd  for  A ?  (Give  your  answer  in  pennies  or  N.) 

2.  What  value  did  you  ﬁnd  for  C ? 

3.  What  is  the  characteristic  distance 	 �  over  which  the  force  decays  by  a  factor  1/e ? 
(Give  your  answer  in mm.) 

(b)  Use  the  “Slope  Tool”  on  your  graph  of  ln(F )  vs.  ln(gap)  to  ﬁll  in  the  table  below. 

Gap  (mm): 

d ln(F ) 
d ln(gap) 

: 

(Choose  six  values  of  the  gap  that  are  approximately  evenly  spaced  over  the  range  from 
the minimum  to  the maximum  values  you measured.  Do  not  use more  than  two  signiﬁcant 
ﬁgures  in  your  answer.)
