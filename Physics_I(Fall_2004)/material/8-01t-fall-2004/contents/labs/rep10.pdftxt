Experiment  10:  Energy  Transformation 

Section: 

Table  and  Group: 

Participants: 

Each group need turn in only one report.  Make sure that you each have a copy of your data, 
as  you  will  need  it  for  a  problem  on  Problem  Set  13.  (You  can  ﬁnd  a  copy  of  the  problem 
at  the  end  of  the  notes  for  the  experiment.) 
Calibration: 
You ﬁt the temperature of your thermistor by the equation T  = B −A ln(R) .  Enter the room 
temperature during your measurements  and  the parameters A  and B  for your  thermistor  in 
the  table  below. 

B  (◦C) 

A  (◦C) 

Troom  (◦C) 

Friction  Heating: 
When  you  ﬁt  your  heating  curve  to  T (t) =  C  + B t(1 −  t/A),  what  did  you  ﬁnd  for  the 
parameters ? 

C  (◦C) 

B  (◦C/s) 

A  (s) 

What mass  of  water mw  was  in  your  jar ?


Electric  Heating:  What  did  you measure  for  the  heater  resistance  and  applied  voltage ?


R  (Ω) 

V  (volts) 

When  you  ﬁt  your  heating  curve  to  the  expression  T (t) =  C + B t(1 − t/A),  what  did  you 
ﬁnd  for  the  parameters ? 
C  (◦C) 

B  (◦C/s) 

A  (s) 

What mass  of  water mw  was  in  your  jar ?
