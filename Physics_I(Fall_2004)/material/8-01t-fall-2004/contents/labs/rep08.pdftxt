Experiment  08:  The  Physical  Pendulum 

Section: 

Table  and  Group: 

Participants: 

Each group need turn in only one report.  Make sure that you each have a copy of your data, 
as  you  will  need  it  for  a  problem  on  Problem  Set  10.  (You  can  ﬁnd  a  copy  of  the  problem 
at  the  end  of  the  notes  for  the  experiment.) 

Part  One:  Bare  Ruler  Pendulum 
Enter  your  data  for  the  three  initial  amplitudes  of  the  ruler  pendulum  into  the  table  below.

1.  Estimate  the  error  in  your measurement  of  the period T  of  the pendulum  and  explain 
why  you made  that  estimate. 

2.  The 	 ﬁrst  order  correction  to  the  sin θ  =  θ  approximation  gives  a  period 
T (θ0 ) =  T (0)[1  +  θ2 
0 /16]  where  θ0  is  the  angular  amplitude  (in  radians)  of  the 
pendulum  motion  and  T (0)  is  the  period  assuming  the  approximation  is  exact. 
Calculate  the  correction  and  compare  it  to  your  estimated  error. 

3.  Were  you  able  to  detect  any  evidence  of  the  sin θ = θ  approximation  breaking  down?
