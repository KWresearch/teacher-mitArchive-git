Experiment  05A:  Static  Equilibrium 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  will  measure  and  analyze  the  forces  when  bodies  are  in  static 
equilibrium: 
•	 A  weight  is  suspended  from  a  string  that  spans  the  horizontal  distance  between  two 
horizontal  support  points.  You  will  measure  the  tension  in  the  string  and  see  how 
it  depends  upon  the  amount  of  “slack”  in  the  string.  You  will  plot  your  results  and 
compare  them  to  the  expected mathematical  expression. 

Suspending  a  Weight: 

Hang  a  100 gm  brass  weight  (brass  +  holder  mass  is  105 gm,  so  weight  is  1.03 N)  from  the 
center  of  a  string  between  supports  as  shown  in  the  photo  above.

One  end  of  the  string  is  clamped  between 
two  washers  so  that  you  can  adjust  its 
length.  The  other  passes  over  a  bearing 
as  a  low­friction  pulley  to  transmit  the 
tension  force  to  the  force  sensor.  It  is 
very  important  for  the  string  to 
pass  over  this  pulley  for  all  your 
measurements  so  that  the  force  will 
be  measured  correctly. 

As you can ﬁgure out  from  the  free body diagram 
to  the  right,  when  the  weight  is  hung  from  the 
middle  of  the  string  the  two  tensions  are  equal 
and  given  by 

T  = M g/(2 sin θ) 

In  this  experiment  you  know  M g  = 1.03 N.  DataStudio 
can  measure  the  force  and  calculate  sin θ  for  you.  Then 
you will make  a  plot  and  carry  out  a  ﬁt  to  see  if  you  can 
verify  the  equation  above. 
Position  the  sliding  T­square  far  enough  to  the  right 
of  center  so  that  it  does  not  interfere  with  the  brass 
weight.  Align  the  right  edge  of  the  ruler  with  the 
center  of  a  column  of  holes.  As  the  holes  in  the  board 
are  on  1/2 in  centers,  the  horizontal  distance  from  the 
string  support  point  (the  pulley)  to  the  ruler  will  be  a 
multiple  of  1/2 in.  Keep  this  same  horizontal  distance 
for  all  of  your  measurements.  A  second  string  (if 
tight  enough)  along  the  top  marks  the  horizontal  line 
between  the  two  string  support  points.  The  vertical 
drop from this line can be measured along the ruler edge.

To  begin,  start  up 

DataStudio

and  connect  the  force  sensor. 

Drag  the  force  sensor  icon  to  the  interface  in  the  Experiment  Setup  window.  Double­click 
the  force  sensor  icon  to  open  a  window  to  set  the  Sensor  Properties.  Under  the  “General” 
tab,  choose  a  sample  rate  of  10 Hz,  and  “Slow  Force  Changes  (Spring  Tests)”.  Under  the 
“Calibration”  tab,  choose  Sensitivity:  “Low  (1x)”.  (The  force  sensor  records  force  as  a 
negative  number  when  you  pull  on  it.)  Next,  click  the  Options  button  on  the  Experiment 
Setup  window.  That  will  open  another  window  like  this  one:

Make  sure  the  top  three  boxes  are  checked,  then  choose  “New  Keyboard  Data”  from  the 
pull­down  list  in  the  Keyboard  Data  area.  Click  the  “Edit  All  Properties”  tab;  that  will 
open  another  window  which  gives  you  an  opportunity  to  name  the  variable,  choose  units 
for  it,  and  so  on—just  as  you  would  do  if  entering  data  into  a  table.  Choose  the  variable 
name,  such  as  Vertical  Drop,  and  the  units  (inches). 
After  you  click  OK  on  the  Manual  Sampling  Options  window,  a  new  entry  with  the  name 
you  chose  for  your  variable  (e.g.,  “Vertical  Drop  (inches)”)  should  appear  in  the  Data 
window.  You  are  now  ready  to  begin measurements. 
There  is  no  need  to  calibrate  the  force  sensor,  but  you  must  tare  it  before  starting  your 
measurements  by  pressing  the  tare  button  on  it  when  there  is  no  force  applied  to  it.  You 
might  also  want  to  set  up  a  Meter  display  so  you  can  see  what  the  force  sensor  readings 
are;  to  do  that,  drag  the  force  sensor  entry  in  the Data window  onto  the Meter  entry  in  the 
Displays  window. 
Hints:  if  you  measure  the  vertical  drop  with  a  ruler  divided  into  1/8,  1/16  inches,  and  so 
on  (be  careful,  some  rulers  may  have  1/10 inch  divisions)  you  will  have  to  convert  them  to 
decimals  before  typing  them  into  the  window.  You  could  avoid  that  hassle  by  expressing 
the  horizontal  distance  to  the  pulley  support  in mm  (1 in  is  25.4 mm),  put  the mm  scale  of 
the  ruler along  the  right  edge of  the T­square,  and do all your measurements  in mm  instead 
of  inches.  It  will  also  be  easier  if  you  slide  the  ruler  up  or  down  so  that  an  even  inch  (or 
cm)  marker  lines  up  with  the  horizontal  line  between  the  supports.  To  minimize  parallax 
error,  try position  your  eye  so  your  line  of  sight  is perpendicular  to  the board whenever  you 
align  or measure  things. 
Adjust  the  string  length  so  the  weight  is  low  (close  to  the  table  top).  When  you  click  the 
Start  button,  it  will  change  to  a  “Keep”  button,  a  stop  button  with  a  red  square  in  it  will 
appear  beside  it,  and  the  force  will  be  displayed  on  the  meter.  Before  every  measurement 
make  sure  the  string  is  on  the  pulley,  as  illustrated  on  the  second  page.  When  you 
have  measured  the  vertical  drop,  click  the  Keep  button.  That  will  cause  DataStudio  to 
record  the  force  and  open  up  a  window  like  this  one: 

Type your measured vertical drop into the window and click OK. Loosen the wing nut clamp, 
shorten the string, re­position the weight in the middle of the string, and repeat the process. 
Do  this  for  nine  or  ten  diﬀerent  string  lengths,  including  two  or  three where  the  string  is  so 
tight  that  the  suspension  point  of  the  weight  is  less  than  1.25 in  below  the  horizontal  line 
between  the  suspension  points.  To  get  these  points,  you  will  have  to  have  some  tension  in 
the  string  even  when  the  weight  is  not  hung  on  it.  (That  is  because  the  string  stretches; 
the  measured  force  will  still  be  correct  when  the  weight  is  suspended.)  Also,  measure  the 
lengths  carefully  when  θ  is  small,  in  order  to  get  a  good  value  for  sin θ . 
When  you  have  taken  the measurements  you  want,  click  the  red  stop  button.

You  will  now  have  two  data  sets  in  the  Data  window.  One  will  be  the  force  measurement, 
and  the  other  will  be  the  values  you  typed  in  for  the  vertical  drop;  both  will  be  identiﬁed 
by  the  same  run  number.  They  are  both  dependent  variables  (the  independent  variable  in 
each  case  is  the  time  of  the measurement),  so  you  can  do  calculations  on  them. 
To  calculate  sin θ ,  click  the  Calculate  button  up  by  the  timer  window.  That  will  open 
a  Calculator  window.  Type  Sin  theta  =  sin(arctan(x/H))  in  the  deﬁnition  window. 
(Replace  “H”  by  the  horizontal  distance  between  the  edge  of  your  ruler  and  the  pulley;  in 
my  case  H  was  8.0 in.)  Under  the  Variable  pull­down  menu  check  “Data  Measurement”; 
that  will  open  another  window  that  allows  you  to  choose  your  “Vertical  Drop”  variable. 
After  you  click  Accept,  there  should  be  an  entry  labeled  “Sin  theta  =  sin(arctan(x/8.0))” 
in  the  Data  window.  Again,  this  is  an  independent  variable  with  the  measurement  time  as 
the  dependent  variable. 
The  force  sensor  records  force  as  a  negative  number  when  you  pull  on  it.  That  is  not  a 
problem,  but  if  you’d  rather  see  the  tension  as  a  positive  number,  you  can  do  a  calculation 
on  the  force  data  (Tension  =  ­1*x)  to  change  that. 
Now  you  are  ready  to  analyze  your  data.  What  you  want  is  a  plot  of  the  force  (or  tension) 
along  the  Y  axis  and  sin θ  along  the  X  axis.  To  get  it,  drag  your  force  data  onto  “Graph” 
in  the Displays window.  That will make  a graph with  force on  the Y  axis  and measurement 
time  on  the  X  axis.  Next,  drag  your  “Sin  theta”  data  from  the  Data  window  onto  the 
X  axis  of  the  graph  you  just made  (make  sure  that  the dotted  line  appears  only  around  the 
X  axis,  and  not  around  the  entire  graph,  before  you  release  the  drag).  That  should  give 
you  a  graph  like  this  one. 

The  next  step  is  to  ﬁt  a  function  to  your  data.

From analysis of the free body force diagram we expected T  = M g/(2 sin θ), so ﬁt a function 
of the form T  = A/ sin θ  to the data.  DataStudio  has an Inverse Fit function, but it includes 
a  background  term,  which  we  do  not  want.  So,  a  User­Deﬁned  Fit  is  required.  Make  that 
choice  on  the  graph  and  type  the  deﬁnition  y  =  A/x  in  the  Curve  Fit  window.  (If  you 
don’t  get  the  Curve  Fit  window  right  away,  double­click  either  the  User­Deﬁned  Fit  entry 
in  the  Data  window  or  the  text  box  that  appeared  in  your  graph.)  After  you  click  Accept 
to  do  the  ﬁt,  you  should  get  something  like  the  ﬁt  line  on  my  graph.  (I  had  12  data  points 
∼ |
| < 
∼ sin θ <
∼ 0.6  and  0.6 N < T  ∼ 13 N.) 
corresponding  to  0.04 < 
To  see  how  well  your  measurements  follow  the  prediction,  you  can  look  at  the  graph,  and 
you can be more quantitative by using the Root MSE (remember, because of the DataStudio 
bug,  you  should  divide  it  by  the  square  root  of  the  number  of  points  in  the  ﬁt—in my  case 
that  was  3.5).  So  my  RMS  error  was  about  ±0.08 N.  The  accuracy  of  the  force  sensor  is  a 
bit better than that, but when  I  include the uncertainty  in tan θ  from my measurements the 
experiment  certainly  seems  consistent  with  the  predicted  behavior.  (You  will  explore  this 
idea  quantitatively  in  your  report.) 
There  will  be  a  problem  related  to  this  experiment  in  problem  set  05;  it  is  also  attached  as 
the  last  page  of  this  document.

Section  and  Group: 

Your  Name: 

You  may  work  together  as  a  group  to  solve  this  problem,  but  each  group  member  should 
turn  in  a  copy  of  this  answer  with  problem  set  05.  If  you  like,  just  ﬁll  in  the  information 
above,  complete  this  page,  and  attach  it  to  your  homework  solutions. 

Suppose  a  rope  is  tied  rather  tightly  between  two  trees  that  are  30 m  apart.  You  grab  the 
middle of the rope and pull it perpendicular to the line between the trees with as much force 
as  you  can.  Assume  this  force  is  1000 N  (about  225 lb),  and  the  point where  you  are  pulling 
on  the  rope  is  1 m  from  the  line  joining  the  trees. 

1.  How much  is  the  force  tending  to  pull  the  trees  together ? 

2.  Give  an  example  where  you  think  this might  be  of  practical  use.
