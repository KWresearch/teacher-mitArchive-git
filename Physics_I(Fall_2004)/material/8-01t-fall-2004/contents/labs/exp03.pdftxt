Experiment  03:  Modeling  Forces 

Purpose  of  the  Experiment: 
In  this  experiment  you  will  measure  the  repulsive  force  between  two  ceramic  magnets  as  a 
function  of  the  distance  between  them.  This  experiment  has  two  goals: 
1.  More  practice  in  using  the  computer  to  analyze  data.  You will  take  the  data  by  hand 
and  enter  them  into  a  table  in  the  computer  so  that  you  may  then  use  DataStudio 
to  make  graphs  of  the  data  and  to  look  for  a  mathematical  function  that  represents 
your measurements. 
2.  Finding  a  theory  to  explain  the  forces  requires  a  deeper  understanding  of magnetism. 
You  will  acquire  that  next  term  in  8.02,  so  we  will  mostly  be  searching  for  sensible 
ways  to  think  about  measurements  that  we  do  not  understand.  In  an  appendix  to 
these  notes  I  will  suggest  an  approximate  model  to  explain  the  measurements  that  is 
based  on  something  you  will  learn  in  8.02. 

The photo at the left shows the apparatus for this 
experiment.  You  will  need  four  rectangular  ce­
ramic  magnets  with  a  hole  in  the  middle,  a  plas­
tic  coin  holder,  and  about  50  pennies.  Stick  the 
magnets  together  in  pairs  to  make  two  stronger 
magnets.  Slide  the  coin  holder  over  the  rod,  fol­
lowed by  the  two paired magnets oriented  so  they 
repel,  and  place  the  rod  into  the  hole  in  the  cen­
ter of the wooden base.  The upper magnet will be 
held  up  by  the  bottom  one  and  they  will  align  so 
the  long  axis  of  one magnet’s  rectangle  is perpen­
dicular  to  the  long  axis  of  the  other  magnet.  If 
you  add  pennies  to  the  coin  holder,  their  weight 
will  force  the  two  magnets  closer  together.  You 
should  add  pennies  equally  to  both  sides  to  avoid 
tilting  and  friction  with  the  rod. 

In  the  experiment you will make a  table of  the gap between  the magnets  for various weights 
pressing  them  together  and  thereby  measure  the  “force  law”  for  the  repulsion  between  the 
magnets.  I  suggest  that  you  try  to  complete  the  table  below,  or  one  very  similar.

Gap  (mm) 

It  is  convenient  to  measure  the  force  in  units  of  pennies;  if  you  want  to  convert  to  a  more 
conventional  unit,  a  penny  has  a mass  of  2.50 gm  so  a  force  of  1  penny  is  0.0245 N.

I  weighed  the  other  items  and  found  that  the  plastic  coin  holder  (with  no  rubber  bands) 
and  two magnets  together  weigh  10  pennies;  this  is  the minimum  force  you  will  have. 
Measure  the  gap  with  your  transparent  plastic  ruler.  I  found  the  best  way  to  do  it  was 
to  measure  the  distance  from  the  experiment  base  to  the  bottom  of  the  upper  magnet  and 
subtract  from  it  the  distance  from  the  base  to  the  top  of  the  lower magnet.  It  is  convenient 
to  express  the  gap  in  mm.  (I  found  it  ranged  from  3.0  to  18  mm  and  that  I  could  measure 
it  to ±0.5 mm) You may  use  diﬀerent weights  than  in  the  table,  but measure  the  gap  for  at 
least  eight  diﬀerent  weights  over  the  range  from  10  to  60  pennies. 

Analysis  of  Your  Measurements: 
In  order  to  analyse  your  results  you  should  start  up  DataStudio  and  enter  them  into  a  ta­
ble.  The DataStudio  “howto” document explains how  to  do  this; 

Be sure to type the gap values in the X  (left) column of your table 
and  the  corresponding  force  in  the  Y  (right)  column.  Give  the  table  a  useful  name,  such  as 
“Magnetic  Force”,  label  the  X  and  Y  columns  “Gap”  and  “Force”,  respectively,  and  enter 
their  units  as  “mm”  and  “pennies”  (don’t  type  any  of  the  quotation marks).  Plot  the  data 
by dragging  the “Magnetic Force” entry  in  the program’s “Data” window onto  the “Graph” 
entry  in  the  “Displays”  window.  You  should  get  a  graph  like  this  one. 

To  continue  the  analysis  you  will  need  two  more  data  sets:  one  with  the  gap  as  the  X 
variable  and  the  natural  log  of  the  force  as  the  Y  variable,  and  a  second  data  set  with  the 
gap  as  the  X  variable  and  the  natural  log  of  the  gap  as  the  Y  variable.  I  was  never  able 
to  ﬁgure  out  a  way  to  get  DataStudio  to  do  any  calculations  on  the  independent  variable, 
so  you  will  have  to  do  it  by  hand,  with  a  calculator.  Make  a  new  table,  like  you  did  to  put 
your  measurements  into  the  computer,  and  lable  it  “Log  Gap”  or  something  similar.  Put 
your measured  gap  values  in  the X  column  and  their  natural  log  in  the  Y  column.

You  can make  a  data  table  “Log Force”  in  the  same way,  but  here  is  how  to  get DataStudio 
to  do  it  for  you.  Click  the  Calculate  button  on  the  toolbar,  to  the  right  of  timing  counter 
window  (it  should  be  the  one  with  orange  “00:00.0”  in  it).  That  should  open  a  calculator 
window: 

Move  the  window  to  a  convenient  location  and  type  the  deﬁnition  you  see  here  “LogF  = 
ln(y)”  and  click  “Accept”.  If  you  get  the  message  ‘Please  deﬁne  variable  ”y”’  that  you  see 
here,  click  the  pull­down  menu  (down  arrow)  in  the  “Variables”  area  and  choose  “Data 
Measurement”.  That will open a yellow window  that oﬀers a choice among all of  the entries 
currently  in  the  “Data”  window.  Select  your  magnetic  force  measurement,  and  then  click 
the  “Accept”  button  when  you  return  to  the  calculator  window.  That  will  create  a  new 
data  set  called  “LogF  =  ln(y)”  in  the  “Data”  window.  This  data  set  will  have  the  gap  as 
the  independent  variable  and  the  natural  log  of  the  force  as  the  dependent  variable.  You 
now  have  the  three  data  sets  you  need  to  continue  the  analysis.

First, plot your ”LogF =  ln(y)” data by dragging  it  from  the “Data” window onto “Graph” 
in  the  “Displays”  window.  You  will  get  a  graph  like  this: 

Your  graph  will  not  (yet)  have  the  line  ﬁt  on  it,  but  if  you  look  at  the  data  points  you 
will  see  they  look  awfully  close  to  being  on  a  straight  line.  To  test  this  perception,  choose 
“Linear  Fit”  under  the  graph’s  “Fit”  buton  and  you  will  get  the  straight  line  ﬁt  as  on  my 
graph.  This  makes  it  pretty  clear  that  the  force  law  must  be  exponential.  However,  let’s 
see  if  it  resembles  a  power  law.  To  test  that,  make  a  plot  of  ln(f orce)  on  the  Y  axis  and 
ln(gap)  on  the X  axis.  DataStudio  makes  it  easy.  Remove  the  linear  ﬁt  from  the  graph  and 
drag  the  “Log Gap”  data  from  the  “Data” window  onto  the X  axis  of  the  graph.  That will 
give  a  plot  like  this  one.

It is obvious that these points do not fall on a straight line, so a power law is not a good rep­
resentation of the force.  You could use the Slope Tool on this graph to see how d ln(y)/d ln(x) 
varies  with  the  gap.  If  you  were  going  to  represent  the  data  as  F  = xn ,  where  x  is  the  gap, 
the  power  n  would  have  to  be  a  function  of  the  gap  and  this  slope  tells  you  what  it  would 
be. 
It  would  be  correct  to  conclude  that  an  exponential  force  law  describes  the  measurements 
well  and  would  be  useful  to  interpolate  to  ﬁnd  the  force  for  diﬀerent  gap  values  than  you 
measured.  I  would  leery  of  using  it  to  extrapolate  too  far  beyond  a  gap  of  20 mm  and,  of 
course,  negative  gaps  do  not make  sense.  Here  is  a  plot  of  an  exponential  ﬁt  to  the  data. 

So  far,  this  analysis  has  not  given  much  insight  into  what  causes  the  force  between  the 
magnets  and  why  it  follows  an  exponential  law.  You might  think  that  is  because  you  don’t 
know  enough  about  electromagnetism  yet,  but  read  the  following  appendix  for  the  real 
explanation.

Explanation  of  the  “Exponential”  Force  Law: 
This discussion is not part of what you need to know for 8.01T, but I hope your curiosity has 
been piqued enough  that you will  read  it.  It goes a bit beyond what you will probably  learn 
in  8.02  (but  hopefully  not  8.022)  but  you may  see  it  again  if  you  take  8.02  next  semester. 
The part that goes beyond 8.02 is that the external magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬂat magnet like those 
used  in  this  experiment  is  the  same  as  that  of  a  current  loop  ﬂowing  around  the  edges  of 
the  magnet.  That  means  the  two  magnets  will  exert  the  same  force  on  each  other  as  two 
rectangular  current  loops  would.  So  I  can  solve  a  diﬀerent  problem  and  get  the  answer  for 
the magnets. 
Once  that  is understood  (or  at  least  accepted)  the  rest  of  the  solution  could be  found by  an 
8.02 student who knows the Biot­Savart rule for calculating the magnetic ﬁeld of a wire that 
carries  an  electrical  current  and  the  Lorentz  rule  to  calculate  the  force  on  a  wire  carrying  a 
current  when  in  a magnetic  ﬁeld. 
The  goal  is  to  ﬁnd  the  force  between  two  rectangular  current  loops  oriented  so  their  long 
axes  are  crossed.  The  two  rules  mentioned  above  tell  us  that  the  short  side  of  each  loop 
experiences forces only due to the currents ﬂowing in the long sides of the other loop.  (If you 
want  to  know why, wait  until  8.02.)  Now  I  introduce  an  approximation:  that  the  long  sides 
of  the  other  loop  extend  inﬁnitely  in  both  directions—but  only  for  purposes  of  calculating 
their  magnetic  ﬁelds.  This  makes  the  calculation  of  their  magnetic  ﬁelds  so  easy  that  you 
could do  it  in your head  (if you were  taking 8.02 !).  The  force  can  also be  calculated  in your 
head,  once  you  do  a  little  trigonometry  that  might  be  better  done  on  paper.  Since  there 
is  a  total  of  four  short  sides  in  the  two  loops,  multiply  the  result  by  four.  If  you  were  an 
� 
� 
excellent  student  in  8.02,  you  would  then  come  up  with  this  answer  for  the  force:

where  l  is  the  length  of  the  long  sides  of  the  rectangular  loops,  w  is  the  length  of  the 
short  sides,  z  is  their  separation,  and  I  is  the  current  ﬂowing  in  each  loop.  The  quantity 
µ0  (=  4π × 10−7  in  S.I.  units)  is  called  the  permittivity  of  free  space.  This  is  the  kind  of 
expression  you  love  to  have  as  a  theoretical  model  to  ﬁt  your  data  to,  because  it  has  only 
two  parameters:  the  current  I  and  the  fact  that  z  might  not  be  zero  when  the  gap  is  zero 
(because of the thickness of the magnets).  Everything else is geometry that can be measured. 
The  fraction  involving  l,  w,  and  z  is  dimensionless,  so  all  you  need  to  do  is  express  these 
three  lengths  in  the  same  units,  say mm,  and  things  will  come  out  right. 
Well,  for  our  magnets  l  =  1 in  =  25.4 mm  and  w  = 3/4 in  =  19 mm,  and  I  will  assume 
z  =  x + B ,  where  x  is  the  gap  between  the  magnets.  If  I  put  in  the  numbers  and  let 
A = 2µ0I 2/π  the  expression  to  ﬁt  is

I  typed  this  into  DataStudio  and  got  an  excellent  ﬁt  with  A =  23.6 ± 6.4 pennies  and  B  = 
2.6 ± 2.4 mm.  The  Root  MSE  (correcting  for  DataStudio ’s  idiosyncracies)  was  1.2 pennies. 
The  graph  is  shown  below. 

This  function  does  not  represent  the  data  any  better  (statistically  speaking)  than  the  ex­
ponential,  but  I  like  it  much  better  because  I  understand  where  it  comes  from;  it  has  some 
intellectual  content.  Furthermore,  I  am  unable  to  think  of  any  explanation  based  on  elec­
tromagnetism  that  would  give  an  exponential  forec  law. 
After  converting  A  from  pennies  to  Newtons  (multiply  by  0.0245),  I  was  able  to  calculate 
I  =  170 ± 24 A.  It’s  impressive  to  think  that  that  this  pair  of  little  permanent  magnets  is 
the  equivalent  of  170 A  of  current  ﬂowing  around  a  loop. 
An interesting question is why did the exponential force law represent the data so well?  Was 
this a  rare accident?  I  think not.  There  is a computational  technique  in applied mathemat­
ics  called Pad´e  Approximants  in which  a  function  that  is  diﬃcult  to  evaluate  analytically  is 
approximated  by  the  ratio  of  two  polynomials, which  are much  easier  to  calculate.  I  looked 
up  some  of  the  Pad´e  approximants  for  ex  and  the  function  above  is  not  one  of  them.  How­
ever, I can imagine that many functions can be approximated as the ratio of two polynomials 
that are not a true Pad´e approximant to them;  the approximation will work,  just not as well 
or over as wide a range as a true Pad´e approximant.  This a more subtle example of what we 
saw  in  the  regression  analysis  of  the  ﬁrst  experiment;  there may  be many  functions  that  ﬁt 
your data  equally well and you  simply do not have  enough data  to distinguish among  them. 
That’s where  a  knowledge  of  the  science  that  underlies  the measurements  is  essential;  here, 
it’s  knowledge  you  won’t  have  until  8.02.  Regression  analysis  should  always  be  combined 
with  an  understanding  of  what  you  are  doing  and  a  healthy  scepticism. 
If you are  ever  interested  in Pad´e approximants,  I  recommend  the book Pad´e  Approximants 
by George A Barker, Jr. and Peter Graves­Morris, published by Cambridge University Press 
in  1996.
