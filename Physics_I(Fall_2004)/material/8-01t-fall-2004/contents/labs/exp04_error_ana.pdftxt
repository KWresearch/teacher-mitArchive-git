Introductory  Error  Analysis 

Linear   Regression:   Least-Squares   Fits

It  is  common  to  try  to  ﬁt  known  curves  to  a  set  of  data  points  {(xi , yi )}n 
i=1 . 
Indeed,  you  have  already  done  this  using  DataStudio  several  times. 
If  the  desired  ﬁt  is  to  y  as  a  linear  funcion  of  x,  the  “best”  ﬁt,  that  which

where  all  sums  are  from  i  = 1  to  n.  These  expressions  are  often  written  more 
compactly  as 

(cid:4)y (cid:5)(cid:4)x2(cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)(cid:4)xy (cid:5)
(cid:4)xy (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)(cid:4)y (cid:5) 
� 
b =  (cid:4)x2 (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)2  , 
(cid:4)x2 (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)2

where  if  g  is  any  function  of  x  and  y ,  (cid:4)g (cid:5) =  n 
gi . 
These  calculations  are  simple  but  tedious,  which  makes  them  good  candidates 
for  either  a  calculator  or  computer.  Any  scientiﬁc  calculator  will  have  a  linear 
regression  feature  (but  possibly  with  diﬀerent  names  for  the  slope  and  intercept). 
As  we  have  seen  with  DataStudio,  ﬁtting  a  “best”  straight  line  is  quick  and  easy. 
If  DataStudio  is  not  available,  any  spreadsheet  program  should  be  able  to  do 
the  calculations  for  you.  What  follows  is  a  short  guide  to  using  Xess,  the  default 
spreadsheet  program  on  server at MIT. 

a = 

,

When  the  window  appears,  start  entering  data.  It’s  recommended  that  you  enter 
the values of xi  in one column and the values of yi  in an adjacent column.  If you have 
exported your data  to a “tab-separated value” ﬁle (one with a .tsv  extension),  you 
can  import  your data directly  into your Xess  session;  go  to “File” on  the menu  bar. 
If,  for  instance  for  Experiment  4,  Circular  motion,  your  data  consists  of  the 
measures  values  of  rm  and  the  calculated  values  of  ω ,  you  can manipulate  the  data 
to  ﬁnd  ∆X  and  F .  If  your  values  for  rm  are  in  Column  B,  starting  with  cell  B1, 
click  on  cell  C1  and  in  the  edit  line  enter 

1 

=B1-4.1 

followed  by  a  return  (my  unstretched  spring  length  was  4.1  cm).  Click  again  in 
cell  C1  and  copy  the  formula,  either  from  “Edit”  on  the  menu  bar  or  Control-f. 
Then  drag  into  the  rest  of  the  cells  in  Column  C  where  you  want  the  formual 
applied.  What  you  see  is  the  value  of  the  cell  immediately  to  the  left  minus  4.1. 
The  terminology  is  that  the  “B1”  is  a  “relative”  attribute. 
Similarly,  click  on  cell  D1  and  enter 
=C1*8.6*A1*A1/1000 

followed  by  a  return.  (This  assumes  that  the  values  for  ω  are  in Column A.)  I  used 
a mass  of  8.6 gm,  and  the  division  by  1000  will  give  a  force  in  newtons. 
To  plot  the  calculated  force  as  a  function  of  the  extension,  highlight  Columns 
C  and  D,  go  to  “Graph”  on  the  menu,  select  “New  Graph”  and  “Scatter  Graph” 
to  get  the  plot.  Adjust  the  features  as  desired  using  “Edit”  and  “Options”  on  the 
graph  window. 
To  ﬁnd  the  best-ﬁt  line,  click  in  an  empty  cell  and  enter 
=@LINCOEF(C1..C5,D1..D5) 

to  display  the  slope  (a)  and  intercept  (b).  (I  had  four  non-zero  measurements,  so  I 
needed  to  give  the  range  in  the  columns  to  include  all  ﬁve  points). 
To  graph  this  line,  go  to  another  empty  cell  and  enter 
=@LINFIT(C1..C5,D1..D5) 
to calculate a xi + b for each value in Column C. Of course, you could use the best-ﬁt 
parameters  to  do  this  yourself,  but  since  it’s  a  built-in  function,  we’ll  use  it. 
To  graph  this  line  on  the  same  graph  as  the  calculated  force  vs  displacement 
graph,  go to “Edit” “Data Sets” on the graph window.  At the top, you’ll see a  slide 
bar  under  “1”.  Either move  the  slide  to  the  right  or  click  to  the  right  of  the  bar  to 
bring  up  Data  Set  2.  In  the  “X  Data”  ﬁeld  enter  C1..C5  and  in  “Y  Data”  enter 
F1..F5  (or  the  corresponding  cells where  you  put  the  LINFIT  values).  For  the  best 
display,  select  “Line”  for  “Segment  Type”  and  “None”  for  “Marker.” 
In  Data  Studio  you may  have  noticed  that  when  you make  a  linear  ﬁt  to  data, 
the  window  describing  the  ﬁt  has  an  entry  for  “r”,  the  correlation  coeﬃcient. Of 
course  Xess  can  do  this.  In  an  empty  cell  enter  =@CORR(C1..C5,D1..D5). The 
calculation  of  the  correlation  coeﬃcient  is  a  bit  messy,  but  the  spreadsheet  doesn’t 
mind  at  all.

Determining  the  Best-Fit  parameters 

Suppose  you  have  plotted  n  data  points  (x1 , y1 ),  (x2 , y2 ),  . . . , (xn , yn ),  and 
you  suspect  a  linear  relation between  the values  of x  and  y ;  how  can  you determine 
what  linear  relation  best  ﬁts  your  data? 

The  most  enlightening  way  is  to  plot  the  data  and  ﬁt  a  line  by  eye.  This  line 
is  characterized  by  a  slope  and  an  intercept  that  can  be  read  oﬀ  of  the  graph. 

A  more  rigorous  way  is  to  deﬁne  what  we  mean  by  the  “best”  straight  line. 
Suppose  a  candidate  line  is  given  by  y = a + b x.  Then,  each  xi  gives  a  value  for  y . 
This will in general not be yi  (if it were,  then al l of the data would ﬁt a line exactly), 
so  denote  the  diﬀerence  between  yi  and  its  predicted  value  by  i  =  yi  − (a + bxi ) 
Here,  i  is  the  “error  in  yi .”  Then,  consider  the  sum  of  the  squares  of  these  errors 
(we  need  to  square  the  errors  before  adding  since  a  negative  error  is  as  bad  as  a 
positive  one,  and  we  don’t  want  them  to  cancel).  This  sum,  denoted  by  Φ,  is  the 
quantity  we  wish  to  minimize;  we  want  to  ﬁnd  the  values  of  a  and  b  that  give  us 
the  Least  Squares 

So,  for  a  trial  a  and  b, and  a  given  set  of  n  data  points,  we  have 
� 
n 
(yi  − (a + b xi))
i=1 

S  =

2  . 

To  make  things  easier,  we’ll  introduce  some  compact  notation.  For  any  function  g 
of  x  and  y , let

n
gi  ≡ 
n 
i=1 
i=1 

g (xi , yi ) ≡ (cid:4)g (cid:5).

In  this  notation,  then,

= (cid:4)y 2 (cid:5) + a 2  + b2 (cid:4)x 2 (cid:5) + 2 a b (cid:4)x(cid:5) − 2 a (cid:4)y (cid:5) − 2 b (cid:4)xy (cid:5). 

(Note  that  (cid:4)x(cid:5)(cid:4)y (cid:5) (cid:7)= (cid:4)xy (cid:5);  the  product  of  a  sum  is  not  the  sum  of  the  products,  but

This  is  a  fancier  version  of  completing  the  square,  as  we  used  in  minimizing  Vc  to 
ﬁnd the arithmetic mean as the “Best” average of a sample.  Clearly, much hindsight 
was  used  to  obtain  the  result  in  this  form.  What  was  done was  to  isolate  the  terms 
containing  a,  completing  the  square with  those  terms  by  adding  (b(cid:4)x(cid:5) − (cid:4)y (cid:5))2 , then 
completing  the  square  with  the  b-terms. 
The  error  will  be  minimized  when  both  terms  in  parentheses  are  as  small  as 
possible  in  absolute  value;  that  is,  when  they  vanish.  The  “best”  line  is  then  that 
for  which 

b = 

(cid:4)xy (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)(cid:4)y (cid:5)
(cid:4)x2 (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)2 

a = (cid:4)y (cid:5) − b(cid:4)x(cid:5) = 

(cid:4)y (cid:5)(cid:4)x2 (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)(cid:4)xy (cid:5) 
.
(cid:4)x2 (cid:5) − (cid:4)x(cid:5)
2

The  same  result  can  be  obtained  from  calculus  by  setting  ∂Φ  and  ∂ b  to  zero  and 
∂Φ
∂ a 
solving  the  two  linear  equations  for  a  and  b. 
Many  calculators have  this  capacity, making determination  of  a  and  b wonder-
fully  simple.  If  you’re  not  sure  how  to  do  such  things  on  your  calculator,  let  us 
know  (but  please  bring  the  instruction  booklet). 
The  best  way  of  all  is  to  plot  your  points  and  use  linear  regression.  This  way, 
you  can  see  if  there  are any  points  that  are  clearly wrong  (but  never discard  a data 
point without good reason), or  if the data even suggest a  linear ﬁt at all.  Also, with 
an  eyeball ﬁt  you can  obtain an  estimate of  the  error  in a or  b by  seeing what  range 
of  a  and  b  correspond  to  the  extreme  “reasonable”  (as  opposed  to  “best  ﬁt”)  lines 
to  your  data.
