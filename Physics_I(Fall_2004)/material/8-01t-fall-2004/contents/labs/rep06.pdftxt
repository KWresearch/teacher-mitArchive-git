Experiment  06:  Work,  Energy,  Harmonic  Oscillator 

Section  and  Group:


Participants:


Each  group  need  turn  in  only  one  report.  Make  sure  you  keep  a  record  of  data  you 
need  for  problem  set  07. 

Enter  the  positions measured  by  your  group  into  this  table. 

Quantity: 

x0 (m) 

h1 (m) 

h2 (m) 

U (h1 ) (mJ)  U (h2 ) (mJ) 

F  (mN) 

Your  value: 
Use these numbers along with M  = 0.75 kg, θ = 1.97◦  and g = 9.805 m/s2  to calculate U (h1 ), 
U (h2 ) and how much non­conservative work was done by friction between the turning points 
h1  and  h2 . 

If  the  friction  force  is  constant,  what  is  its magnitude ?


What  is  the  coeﬃcient  of  rolling  friction  µk  between  the  cart  and  the  track ?


What  period  T  did  you measure  for  the  spring  harmonic  oscillator ? 

Use  it  to  calculate  the  spring  constant k  and  compare  the answer  to  the  result you  got  from 
a  linear  ﬁt  to  the  force­position  graph.
