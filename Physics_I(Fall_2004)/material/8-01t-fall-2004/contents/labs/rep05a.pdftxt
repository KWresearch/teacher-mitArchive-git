Experiment  05A:  Static  Equilibrium 

Section  and  Group:


Participants:


Each  group  need  turn  in  only  one  report. 
When  you  ﬁt  an  expression  of  the  form  T  = A/ sin θ  to  your  data: 

1.  What  value  did  your  ﬁt  give  for  A,  and  how  does  it  compare  to M g/2 ? 

2.  What  did  your  ﬁt  give  for  the  Root  MSE ?  (Remember  to  divide  by 
to  correct  for  the  bug  in  DataStudio.) 

√

no. of  points 

3.  Suppose  that  the  RMS  error  were  ±0.15 N  and  the  coeﬃcient  A  were  0.5 N.  Assume 
that  the  RMS  error  comes  from  errors  in  the  measurement  of  the  vertical  distance 
from  the  point  the  weight  attaches  to  the  string  and  the  horizontal  line  between  the 
string  support  points,  which  you may  take  to  be  40 mm  apart. 
Estimate  how  much  the  measurement  error  would  be  when  sin θ  = 0.1  and  when 
sin θ  = 0.5.  Give  your  answer  in  mm. 
(You  should  use  the  approximation 
sin θ � tan θ � θ  in  doing  this  calculation.) 

4.  Does  the  estimate  above  indicate  that  it  is  the  likely  source  of  the  error ?
