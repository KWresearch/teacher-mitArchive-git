A tetherball is attached to a post by a string. The string passes through a hole in the center 
of the post at the top. The string is gradually shortened by drawing it through the hole. 
Ignore gravity. 

Until the ball hits the post, 

a)  The energy and angular momentum about the center of the post are constant. 

b)  The energy of the ball is constant but the angular momentum about the center of 
the post changes. 

c)  Both the energy and the angular momentum about the center of the post, change. 

d)  The energy of the ball changes but the angular momentum about the center of the 
post is constant. 

Explain your reasoning.  The tension force points radially in; so torque about central

Problem 1c: (5 points) 

A  cart  on  a  horizontal  table  is  connected  to  one  end  of  a  spring.  The  other  end  of  the 
spring  is  attached  to  a  wall.  The  cart  is  set  in  motion  perpendicular  to  wall  so  that  it 
oscillates about its equilibrium point. There is negligible friction between the cart and the 
table. 

A  lump  of  sticky  putty  is  dropped  vertically  onto  the  cart  and  lands  the  instant  the  cart 
has its maximum velocity. The putty sticks without bouncing. During the collision

the velocity of the cart is constant; the mechanical energy of the system consisting

the velocity of the cart changes; the mechanical energy of the system consisting of 
the putty and the cart changes. 

the velocity of the cart is constant; the mechanical energy of the system consisting 
of the putty and the cart changes. 

Explain  your  reasoning.  Answer  C.  There  is  an  external  spring  force  acting  on  the 
system consisting of the putty and the cart so if the collision takes place over a finite non (cid:173)
zero interval of time, the velocity will decrease. If the collision between the putty and the 
cart  is  instantaneous  so  we  can  ignore  the  impulse  from  the  external  spring  force,  the 
momentum of  the system  in  the horizontal direction  is constant. The  initial momentum  is 
just  the mass of  the cart  times  the  initial velocity of  the cart. The  final momentuim  is  the 
mass of the putty and cart times the final velocity of the system. Since the mass increases 
the velocity fo the system decrease.  

The collision is completely inelastic so the mechanical energy is not conserved. Suppose 
you  consider  the  putty  and  cart  as  the  system,  assume  the  collision  is  instantaneous  so 
that the system does not move during the collision. Then the spring force does no external 
work  on  the  system.  Some  of  the  initial mechanical  energy  is  converted  into  heat.  Some 
of  this  heat  dissipates  into  the  atmosphere  while  the  rest  flows  into  the  cart  and  putty. 
Thus the energy of the system decreases due to the loss of heat to the atmosphere.

A  figure  skater  is  spinning  with  her  arms  held  close  to  her  body.  She  relaxes  her  arm 
muscles  and  her  arms  move  outward.  Compared  to  her  initial  rotational  kinetic  energy, 
her rotational kinetic energy after she her arms move outward is 

a)  the same.  

b)  larger.  

c)  smaller.  

Explain your reasoning. Answer C. We assume that there is negligible frictional torque 
acting  on  the  skater  while  she  relaxes  her  arm  muscles  and  her  arms  move  outward. 
Therefore  the  angular  momentum  about  the  central  axis  is  constant,  I cm ,0ω0  = I cm , fω .f 
The  final  angular  velocity  is  therefore ω = ( I cm
,0  / I 
)ω .  The  final  rotational  kinetic 
f

Since  the  moment  of  inertia  increases  as  she  moves  her  arms  out,  the  ratio 
( I cm ,0  / I 
) < 1 . Thus the kinetic energy decreases,

Note her  arms move outward because  there  is not  enough  force pulling  them  inward  and 
so  they  actually move  in  a  curved  trajectory  but  not  in  circular motion. The  arms  appear 
to move  radially  outward  to  the  skater.  Remember  that  the  skater  is  not  a  rigid  body.  In 
order  to  prevent  her  arms  from  departing  from  her  body,  she must  apply  a  force  to  slow 
the arms down and stop them. This work is dissipative changing  kinetic energy into heat.

In the lab frame, Cart B has mass  mB  and is moving to the right with initial velocity  v r 
B ,0 . 
Cart A has mass  mA  = 2mB   and is at rest. Cart B collides elastically with cart A. After the 
collision,  Cart  A  moves  up  an  incline  plane  that  makes  an  angle θ  with  respect  to  the 
horizontal.  You  may  assume  that  the  track  is  frictionless  and  the  acceleration  due  to 
gravity is  g .

collision?

A  steel  washer,  is  mounted  on  a  cylindrical  rotor  of  radius  r  .  A  massless  string,  with  a 
mass  m  attached to the other end, is wrapped around the side of the rotor and passes over 
a massless  pulley. Assume  that  there  is  a  constant  frictional  torque  about  the  axis  of  the 
rotor.  The  mass  is  released  and  falls.  As  the  mass  falls,  the  rotor  undergoes  an  angular 
acceleration  of  magnitude  α   .  After  the  string  detaches  from  the  rotor  and  the  rotor

coasts  to  a  stop  with  an  angular  acceleration  of  magnitude  α2 .  Let  g   denote  the 
gravitational constant.
