Problem 1: static equilibrium 

You  are  able  to  hold  out  your  arm  in  an  outstretched  horizontal  position  thanks  to  the 
action  of  the  deltoid  muscle.  Assume  the  humerus  bone  has  a  mass  of  m  ,  the  center  of 
mass of  the humerus  is a distance    d  from  the scapula,  the deltoid muscle attaches  to  the 
humerus a distance a distance  s  from the scapula and the angle the deltoid muscle makes 
with the horizontal is α.  A schematic representation of this action looks as follows: 

a)  What is the tension T in the deltoid muscle? 

b)

 What are the vertical and horizontal components of the force exerted by the 
scapula (shoulder blade) on the humerus? 

Solution: 

Choose the unit vectors  ˆi  to point horizontally to the right and  ˆj  vertically upwards. Let 
F  and  F  be the horizontal and vertical components of the force exerted by the scapula

(shoulder blade) on the humerus ? The condition that the sum of the forces acting on the

Problem 2: water bucket 

A  water  bucket  attached  to  a  rope  and  spun  in  a  vertical  circle  of  radius  r  . 
Suppose the bucket has mass  m  and that the bucket can be approximated as a point mass 
at  the  end  of  the  rope.  The  rope  breaks  when  the  bucket  is  moving  vertically  upwards. 
The bucket rises to a height  h  above the release point. 

a)  What was the velocity of the bucket when it was released?  
\ 
b)  What was the tension in the cord when it broke?  

Solution: 

The force diagram on the bucket is shown in the figure.

Choose the initial state, at time

final state, at time

Choose zero for potential energy at the 
point where the string breaks.

Initial Energy: The initial kinetic energy is  K  0  =  m

E f  = K f  + U  = mgh .

Non-conservative work: There is no non-conservative work.

This equation can be solved for the escape velocity,  v0 ,

Just before the string broke the radial force equation is 

Therefore Newton’s Second Law in the radial direction,  rˆ ,  is 

So the tension in the string is

Problem 3: spring and loop 

A  mass  m   is  pushed  against  a  spring  with  spring  constant  k   and  held  in  place  with  a 
catch.  The  spring  compresses  an  unknown  distance  x  .  When  the  catch  is  removed,  the 
mass  leaves  the spring and slides along a frictionless circular  loop of radius  r  . When  the 
mass  reaches  the  top  of  the  loop,  the  force  of  the  loop  on  the mass  (the  normal  force)  is 
equal to twice the weight of the mass.  

a)  Using  conservation  of  energy,  find  the  kinetic  energy  at  the  top  of  the  loop. 
Express your answer as a function of  k, m, x, g, and R. 

b)  Using Newton’s second law, derive the equation of motion for the mass when it is 
at the top of the loop. 

c)  How far was the spring compressed? 

Solution: 

Choose polar coordinates with origin at 
the center of the loop. Let   x  denote the 
displacement of the spring from the 
equilibrium position. Choose the zero 
point for the gravitational potential 
energy U grav   = 0  at the bottom of the 
loop. Choose the zero point for the 
spring potential energy when the spring 

is at the equilibrium position. 
U spring   ( x  = 0 ) = 0 . 

Initial Energy: Choose for the initial state, the instant before the catch is released. The 
initial kinetic energy  K 0  = 0 . The initial potential energy is non-zero, U 0  = (1
) 
. So 
 2
 kx

the initial mechanical energy is  

E0  = K0  + U 0  = (1

)

. 

Final Energy: Choose for the final state, 
the instant the mass is at the top of the 
loop. The final kinetic energy

K f  =
2  since the mass is in 
2 
motion. The final potential energy is

non-zero, U  = mg

So the final mechanical energy is

f 

Non-conservative Work: Since we are assuming the track is frictionless, there is no  
non- conservative work. 

Change in Mechanical Energy: The change in mechanical energy is therefore zero, 

0 = Wnc   = ∆ Emechanical   = E f  − E0 . 

Thus mechanical energy is conserved,  E f  = E0 , or 

1
2mgR  +  mv f 
2

2  = 

1 kx

. 

So the kinetic energy at the top of the loop is 
1  mv  f
2

2  = 

1 kx 2  − 2mgR . 
2 

b)  The  force  diagram  is  shown  in  the  figure.  Therefore  Newton’s  Second  Law  in  the 
radial direction,  rˆ ,  is 

−mg − N  = − m v

2  R .

f 

When the mass reaches the top of the loop, the force of the loop on the object (the normal 
.
force) is equal to twice the weight of the mass,   N 2mg
= 

Therefore the Second Law becomes 

3mg  = m v   2  R .
f 

We can rewrite this condition in terms of the kinetic energy as 

3  mgR  =

c)	 Substituting the force condition into the energy condition that we found in part a) 
yields,

Problem 4: inclined plane, friction, spring 

An  object  of  mass  m   slides  down  a  plane  which  is  inclined  at  an  angle θ.  The  object 
starts  out  at  rest  a  distance  d   from  an  unstretched  spring  that  lies  at  the  bottom  of  the 
plane. The spring has a constant  k . 

a)	 Assume the incline plane is frictionless. How far will the spring compress when 
the mass first comes to rest? 

b)	 Now assume that the incline plane has a coefficient of kinetic friction µ . How
k
far will the spring compress when the mass first comes to rest? 


c)  In case b), how much energy has been lost to heat?  


Solution: 

Let  x  denote the displacement of the spring from the equilibrium position. Choose the 
zero point for the gravitational potential energy U grav  = 0  at the bottom of the inclined 
plane but at the location of the end of the unstretched spring. Choose the zero point for 
the spring potential energy when the spring is at the equilibrium position, 
spring   ( x  = 0 ) = 0 . 
U 

Initial Energy: Choose for the initial state, the instant the object is released at the top of 
the inclined plane. The initial kinetic energy  K 0  = 0 . The initial potential energy is non(cid:173)
= mgd sinθ. So the initial mechanical energy is  
zero, 
U 0 

E0  = K0  + U  = mgd sinθ.
0 

8 

Final Energy: Choose for the final state, when the object first comes to rest and the 
spring is compressed a distance x at the bottom of the inclined plane. The final kinetic 
energy  K f  = 0  since the mass is in motion. The final potential energy is non-zero, 
1 kx
sin θ. Notice that the gravitational potential energy is negative because 
U f  = 
2  − xmg
2 
the object has dropped below the height of the zero point of gravitational potential 
energy. 

So the final mechanical energy is  

E f  = K f  + U f  = 

1 kx 2  − xmg sinθ. 
2 

Non-conservative Work: Since we are assuming the track is frictionless, there is no  
non- conservative work. 

Change in Mechanical Energy: The change in mechanical energy is therefore zero, 

0 = Wnc   = ∆ Emechanical   = E f  − E0 . 

Thus mechanical energy is conserved,  E f  = E0 , or 

This is a quadratic equation

Problem 5: elliptic orbit 

A satellite of mass  m  is in an elliptical orbit around a planet of mass  m p   which is located 
at  one  focus  of  the  ellipse.  The  satellite  has  a  velocity  v   at  the  distance  r   when  it  is 
a	
a
furthest  from the planet. The distance of closest approach is  rp . 

a)	 What is the magnitude of the velocity  v p   of the satellite when it is closest to the 
planet? 

b)	 If the satellite were in a circular orbit of radius  r  = rp , is it’s velocity  v  greater
c	
c
than, equal to, or less than the velocity  v p  of the original elliptic orbit? Justify 
your answer. 

Solution: 

Choose zero for the gravitational potential energy to be when the satellite and planet are 
(

separated by an infinite distance, U r = ∞ = 0 . When the satellite is at closest approach 
the energy is
