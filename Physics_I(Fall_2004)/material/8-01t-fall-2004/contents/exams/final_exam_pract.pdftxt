Study Guide Final Exam 

The final exam will consist of a two sections. 

Section 1:  multiple choice concept questions. There may be a few concept questions on 
time and special relativity but no analytic questions. 

Section 2: analytic problems with some concept questions requiring written responses. 
The analytic questions will be divided into part A covering the material since the third 
test. Part B will cover problems from the entire year. Examples of section 2 questions are 
given below. Test questions will not use numbers so you do not need a calculator. 

Part A: Kinetic Theory, First Law of Thermodynamics, Heat Engines 

Problem 1 Energy Transformation, Specific Heat and Temperature 

Suppose  a  person  of  mass  m = 6.5 ×101 kg
 
 
s
 
is  running  at  a  speed  v = 3.8 m
and  is 
expending  9.45 ×102 W  of  power  during  a  1.0  101  km  workout.  Suppose  the  runner
×
converts 20% of  the  internal energy change  into mechanical work. The rest of  the energy 
goes  into  heat.  If  the  specific  heat  of  the  runner  is c = 4.19 ×103  J
kg
− K ,  how  much 
 
 
would the body temperature rise after running the10 km ?

temperature of the gas is 273 K. The pressure of the gas is 1.01 x 105 Pa. The gas constant

Problem 3: Carnot Cycle of an Ideal Gas 

In  this  problem,  the  starting  pressure P   and  volume  V   of  an  ideal  gas  in  state  a,  are

given.  The  ratio  RV  = V  / V  > 1   of  the  volumes  of  the  states  c  and  a  is  given.  Finally  a 
c

constant  γ = 5/3  is given.  You do not know how many moles of the gas are present. 

a) Read over steps (1)- (4) below and sketch the path of the cycle on a  P V  plot on the
−
graph below. Label all appropriate points. 

(1) In the first of four steps,  a  to  b , an ideal gas is compressed from V  to Vb  while no
a
heat is allowed to flow into or out of the system. The compression of the gas raises the 
temperature from an initial temperature  T  and to a final temperature  T  . During this
1

process the quantity  PV γ = constant , where γ= 5/3 .

b
compression is finished?  


b)  What is the change in internal energy of the gas during this change of state?


c)  What is the work done by the gas during this compression? 


(2) The gas is now allowed to expand isothermally from  b  to  c , from volume  V  tob
volume  V  .c

d)  Express  the  work  done  by  the  gas  in  this  process  Wcb   and  the  amount  of  heat  Qcb
that must  be  added  from  the  heat  source  at  T2     in  terms  of   P  ,  V  ,  T  ,  T ,  and  V  .

(3) When the gas has reached point  c  is expands from V  to Vd  while no heat is allowed
c
to flow into or out of the system. The expansion of the gas lowers the temperature and 
pressure from an initial temperature  T2  to a final temperature  T  . During this process the

quantity  PV γ = constant .

i)  Find  the work done by  the  system on  the  surroundings  Wad   and  the  amount of heat 
Q
ad   that  flows  between  the  system  and  the  surroundings.  Are  these  quantities 
positive or negative? Explain whether heat  is added  to  the  system or  removed  from 
the heat source at  T1 .

A  reversible heat  engine  can be  run  in  the other direction,  in which  case  it does negative 
work Wcycle   on the world while “pumping” heat  Qcycle (into

Consider that you have a large swimming pool and plan to heat your house with a heat 
pump that pumps heat from the pool into your house.  A large plate in the water will 
remain at  0  oC   due to the formation of ice.  You pick  T2  to be  50  oC , which will be the 
temperature of the (large) radiators used to heat your house.  Assume that your heat pump 
has the maximum efficiency allowed by thermodynamics. 

a)	 What is the heat gain and the refrigerator performance for this cycle? Be careful to 
use units of Kelvin for temperature. 

b)  If your house formerly burned 1200 gallons of oil in a winter (at $2.00/gallon), how 
much will the electricity cost (at $0.10 per kilowatt-hour) to replace this heat using 
the heat pump?  A gallon of oil has mass 3.4 kg and contains 1.4 ×10  J  gal-1 .

c)  The ice cube that appears in your pool over the winter will be how many meters on 
each side? (It takes  3.35 ×10  J  to melt one kg of ice; it takes up this much heat when 
6
freezing.)  The density of ice is  0.931 ×10  kg  m -3
.

This would be great for cooling your house in the summer – even if the pool warmed up 
enough to swim in it, you could still cool your house by running the heat pump in reverse 
as an air conditioner!  More practically, you might be able to use ground water (and the 
dirt around it) as the heat sink.
