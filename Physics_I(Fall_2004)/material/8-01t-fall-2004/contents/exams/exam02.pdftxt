Problem 1: (20 points) Concept Questions: Circle the correct answer. 

a)	

(4  points)  A  puck  of  mass  M  is  moving  in  a  circle  at  uniform  speed  on  a 
frictionless  table  as  shown  above.  It  is  held  by  a  string  which  holds  a  suspended 
bob,  also  of  mass  M,  at  rest  below  the  table.  Half  of  the  length  of  the  string  is 
above  the  tabletop  and  half  below.  What  is  the  centripetal  acceleration  of  the 
moving puck? 

1.	
less than g  
2.	 g 
3.	 greater than g  
4.	 zero 
5.	
insufficient information 

b)	 (4 points) An object moves counter-clockwise along the circular path shown 
below. As it moves along the path its acceleration vector continuously points 
toward point S. The object 

1.	 speeds up at P, Q, and R. 
2.	 slows down at P, Q, and R. 
3.	 speeds up at P and slows down at R. 
4.	 slows down at P and speeds up at R. 
5.	 speeds up at Q. 
6.	 slows down at Q. 
7.	 No object can execute such a motion.

c)  (4  points) A  ball  is  rolling without  slipping  in  a  spiral  path  down  the  inside  of  a 
hollow cone. 

The work done by the inner surface of the cone on the ball is  

1.  positive  
2.  zero 
3.  negative 
4.  Impossible to determine 

d) (4 points) Suppose you want to ride your mountain bike up a steep hill. Two paths 
lead from the base to the top, one twice as long as the other. You start and end at rest. 
Compared to the average force you would exert if you took the short path, the average 
force you exert along the longer path is 

1.  one quarter as much.  
2.  one third as much. 
3.  one half as much. 
4.  the same.  
5.  undetermined-it depends on the time taken.  

e) (4 points) When the cart maximally compresses the spring at the bottom of the 
track, the cart’s 

1.  velocity and acceleration are zero. 
2.  velocity is nonzero but its acceleration is zero. 
3.  acceleration is nonzero, but its velocity is zero. 
4.  velocity and acceleration are both nonzero.

Part 2: Analytic Questions: Show all your work. 

Problem 2: (20 points)  A child is trying to shoot a marble of mass  m  in order to hit the 
center  of  a  small  box  using  a  spring  loaded  marble  gun.  The  marble  gun  is  fixed  on  a 
table and shoots  the marble horizontally from  the edge of  the  table. The edge of  the  table 
is  a  height  h   above  the  top  of  the  box  (the  height  of  which  is  negligibly  small).  The 
center  of  the  box  is  some  horizontal  distance  d   away  from  the  table.  The  spring  has  a 
spring  constant  k .  By  what  distance  x   should  the  child  compress  the  spring  so  that  the 
marble lands in the center of the box? Let  g  denote the gravitational constant. The given 
quantities in this problem are  m  ,  k ,  g ,  h , and  d . Express  x  in terms of whatever given 
quantities you may need.  

Answer:

Problem 3: (20 points) A Back Bending Exercise 

When  a  person  of  mass  m   bends  over  or  lifts  an  object,  the  main  muscles  that  lift  the 
back  are  the  erector  spinae  (sacrospinal  muscles).  These  muscles  act  approximately  at  a 
r 
F  ,  at  a  point  that  is  2 3  of  the 
single  point  on  the  vertebral  column  and  exert  a  force,  m
distance  from  base  of  the  spine    to  the  center  of  mass  of  the  head  and  arms.  The  cord 
applies  the  force  at  an  angle α  relative  to  the  axis  of  the  vertebral  column.  The  sacrum 
r 
Fd
exerts  a  force, 
,  on  the  spine  at  an  unknown  angle  β  relative  to  the  axis  of  the 
vertebral column.  

Assume  that  mass  of  the  head  and  arms  is  m2  = (1 5 ) m  where  m   is  the  mass  of  the 
person. The  center  of mass  of  the  trunk  is 
  of  the  distance  from  the  base  of  the  spine 
1 2
to  the  center  of  mass  of  the  head  and  arms.    Assume  that  mass  of  the  trunk  is 
m1  = ( 2 5 ) m  , where  m  is the mass of the person. Let  g denote the gravitational constant. 

In  this  problem  assume  the  given  quantities  are  m  ,  α,  and  g .  Express  your  answers 
below in terms of these quantities. 

a)  What  is  the  magnitude  of  the  force  rF    that  the  sacrospinal  muscles  exert  on  the 
m
spine? 
b)  What is the angle  β that the force of the sacrum on the spine,  r 
F  , makes relative 
d
to the axis of the vertebral column? 
r 
F
d ? 

c)  What is the magnitude of the force 

Answer:

Problem 4: (20 points) 

Consider  an  ideal  spring  that  has  an  unstretched  length  l0 .  Assume  the  spring  has  a 
constant  k . Suppose the spring is attached to an cart of  mass  m  that lies on a frictionless 
plane  that  is  inclined  by  an  angle θ  from  the  horizontal.  Let  g denote  the  gravitational 
constant. The given quantities in this problem are  l0 ,  m , k , θ, and  g . 

a)  The  spring  stretches  slightly  to  a  new  length  l
l0   to  hold  the  cart  in 
>
equilibrium. Find the length  l  in terms of the given quantities. 

b)  Now  move  the  cart  up  along  the  ramp  so  that  the  spring  is  compressed  a 
distance  x   from  the  unstretched  length  l0 .  Then  the  cart  is  released  from 
rest. What  is  the  velocity  of  the  cart  when  the  spring  has  first  returned  to 
its unstretched length  l0 ? 

c)  What is the period of oscillation of the cart?

Problem 5: (20 points)  

A  ball  of  negligible  radius  and mass  m  hangs  from  a  string  of  length  l .  It  is  hit  in  such  a way 
that  it  then  travels  in  a  vertical  circle  (i.e.,  the  tension  in  the  string  is  always  greater  than  zero). 
The initial speed of the ball after being struck is  v0 . You may ignore air resistance. Let  g  denote 
the gravitational constant. 

a)  Find the speed of the ball when the string is horizontal. 

b)  Find the tension in the string when the string is horizontal.
