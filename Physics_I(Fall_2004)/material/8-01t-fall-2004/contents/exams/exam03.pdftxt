A tetherball is attached to a post by a string. The string passes through a hole in the center 
of the post at the top. The string is gradually shortened by drawing it through the hole. 
Ignore gravity.

a)  The energy and angular momentum about the center of the post are constant. 

b)  The energy of the ball is constant but the angular momentum about the center of 
the post changes. 

c)  Both the energy and the angular momentum about the center of the post, change. 

d)  The energy of the ball changes but the angular momentum about the center of the 
post is constant. 

Explain your reasoning.

Problem 1c: (5 points) 

A  block  on  a  horizontal  table  is  connected  to  one  end  of  a  spring.  The  other  end  of  the 
spring  is  attached  to  a  wall. 
The  block  is  set  in  motion  perpendicular  to  wall  so  that  it 
oscillates about its equilibrium point. 

A lump of sticky putty is dropped vertically onto the block and lands the instant the block 
has its maximum velocity. The putty sticks without bouncing. During the collision 

a)	

b)	

c)	

d)

of the putty and the block is constant. 

the  velocity  of  the  block  is  constant;  the  mechanical  energy  of  the  system 
consisting of the putty and the block is constant. 

the velocity of  the block changes;  the mechanical energy of  the system consisting 
of the putty and the block changes. 

the  velocity  of  the  block  is  constant;  the  mechanical  energy  of  the  system

Problem 2: (25 points) 
In the lab frame, Cart B has mass  mB  and is moving to the right with initial velocity  v r 
B ,0 . 
Cart A has mass  mA  = 2mB   and is at rest. Cart B collides elastically with cart A. After the 
collision,  Cart  A  moves  up  an  incline  plane  that  makes  an  angle  θ  with  respect  to  the 
horizontal.  You  may  assume  that  the  track  is  frictionless  and  the  acceleration  due  to 
gravity is  g . 

a)	 What are  the directions and velocities of Cart A and Cart B  immediately after  the 
collision? 

b)	 What distance does Cart A move along the incline plane when it comes to rest?

Problem 3: (30 points)  

A  steel  washer,  is  mounted  on  a  cylindrical  rotor  of  radius  r  .  A  massless  string,  with  a 
mass  m  attached to the other end, is wrapped around the side of the rotor and passes over 
a massless  pulley. Assume  that  there  is  a  constant  frictional  torque  about  the  axis  of  the 
rotor.  The  mass  is  released  and  falls.  As  the  mass  falls,  the  rotor  undergoes  an  angular 
acceleration  of  magnitude  α   .  After  the  string  detaches  from  the  rotor  and  the  rotor 
1
coasts  to  a  stop  with  an  angular  acceleration  of  magnitude  α .  Let  g   denote  the
2
gravitational constant. 

a)  What is the moment of inertia  I  of the rotor assembly (including the washer) 
R 
about the rotation axis? Show all your work. Express your answer in terms of the 
given quantities  r  , α , α ,  m  , and  g .

b)  Suppose the rotor has an angular velocity ω , when a second washer of moment 
0
of inertia  I
 is dropped on top of the first washer. It takes a time  ∆t  for the 
W
dropped washer to move at the same angular velocity as the rotor. What is the 
angular velocity ω  of the assembly immediately after the collision is finished 
f
and the dropped washer and rotor move at the same angular velocity ω ? Express 
f
your answer in terms of the quantities  I 
,  I 
, α ,  ∆t , and ω  as needed.

Problem 4: (25 points) 

The center of mass of a bicycle wheel of  radius  R  and mass  m   is  initially spinning with 
angular  velocity ω .  The  wheel  is  lowered  to  the  ground  without  bouncing.  As  soon  as
0
the wheel touches the level ground, the wheel starts to move forward until it begins to roll 
without slipping with an unknown  final angular velocity ω  and an unknown velocity of
f
the center of mass  vcm  f  . Assume that all the mass of the wheel is located on the rim.  
, 

a)  Draw a  free body diagram of all  the  forces acting on  the bicycle wheel while  it  is 
moving forward. 

b)	 What  is  the  relation  between  the  angular  velocity  of  the  wheel  ωf   and  the 
velocity of the center of mass  vcm  f   when it begins to roll without slipping? 
, 

c)	 What  is  the  velocity  of  the  center  of  mass  of  the  wheel  when  it  begins  to  roll 
without slipping?
