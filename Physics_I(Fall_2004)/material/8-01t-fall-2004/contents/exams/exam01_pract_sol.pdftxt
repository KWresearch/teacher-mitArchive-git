Practice Exam 1 Solutions 

Concept Questions: Briefly answer the following questions. 

1. When a car accelerates  forward, which  force  is  responsible  for  this acceleration? State 
clearly which body exerts this force, and on which body the force acts. 

Answer: The friction force of the road acting on the wheels accelerates the car forward. 

2. A weightlifter and a barbell are both at rest on a  large scale. The weightlifter begins to 
lift  the  barbell,  ultimately  holding  it  motionless  above  her  head.  Does  the  scale  reading 
ever  differ  from  the  combined  weight  of  the  two  bodies  at  any  time  during  the  lift? 
Explain. 

Answer: Choose positive direction upwards. The motion of the barbells is as follows:  

Stage 1: Barbells are being accelerated upwards as weightlifter jerks them from the floor.

Stage  2:  Barbells  move  at  constant  velocity.  Since  acceleration  is  zero, 
scale doesn’t change.

Stage  3:  Barbells  are  being  decelerated  as  the  weight  lifter  brings  them  to  rest  above 
head.  Since  acceleration  is  negative  upwards,  N m total g

shows decrease. 

3. As a space shuttle burns up its fuel after take-off, it gets lighter and lighter and its 
acceleration larger and larger. Between the moment it takes off and the time at which it 
has consumed nearly all of its fuel, is its average speed larger than, equal to, or smaller 
than half its final speed? Explain why. 

Answer: In figure 1, the graph of velocity vs. time for both cases are shown, constant  
acceleration and non-constant acceleration.  

Figure 1: velocity graphs for constant and non-constant acceleration  

When  the  acceleration  is  constant,  the velocity  is  a  linear  function of  time. Therefore  the 
average velocity is given by (see figure 1) 
1 ( v

( )  + vx ,0  ) =

Hence for an object starting at rest, the average velocity is one half of the final velocity.  

Suppose  the  space  shuttle  reaches  the  same  final  velocity  but  it’s  acceleration  is 
increasing.  In  figure  1,  Since  the  average  velocity  is  always  less  in  the  non-constant 
acceleration  case  than  the  constant  acceleration  case,  the  average  velocity  for  the  non-
constant acceleration case must be less than one half the final velocity.  

Alternatively, we  also  defined  average  velocity  as  v  ≡ ∆x
t
.  Since  the  displacement  is 
f 
x 
the  area  under  graph  of  velocity  vs.  time, we  see  from  figure  1,  that  for  the  case  of  non-
constant  acceleration  the  displacement  is  less  than  the  constant  acceleration  case,  hence 
the  average  velocity  for  the  non-constant  acceleration  case  is  less  than  one  half  the  final 
velocity (which is the average velocity for the constant acceleration case.) 

4. Can astronauts floating in orbit tell which objects within their space-ship would be 
heavy or light on Earth even though everything in the ship is effectively weightless? 
Explain. 

Answer: Yes. From the equivalence principle, gravitational mass is equal to inertial 
mass, 

mgrav  = min  . 

Therefore if the astronauts apply the same force to two different objects, and measure the 
accelerations.

From these measurements, hey can determine the inertial mass ratio,

, 

The object that has the smaller acceleration has the greater inertial mass, and hence 
would be heavier on earth. 

5. A monkey clings to a rope that passes over a pulley. The monkey’s weight is balanced 
by the mass m of a block hanging at the other end of the rope; both monkey and block are 
motionless. In order to get to the block, the monkey climbs a distance L (measured along 
the rope) up the rope. 

(a) Does the block move as a result of the monkey’s climbing? 
(b) If so, in which direction and by how much? 

Answer: The force diagrams are shown in the above figure. As the monkey pulls up on 
the rope, there is a force down on the rope (tension). This tension is transmitted through 
the rope (assume a massless rope). This is also the force on the object. Both Both the 
monkey and object satisfy Newton’s Second Law  

mg  T  ma y .
− = 

So both objects accelerate upwards with the same acceleration. 

Note that the length of the rope is 

l

y +πR  y

As the monkey climbs, the rope is getting shorter at a rate, 

2d l  
dt 2  = a y ,1  + a y , 2  = 2a .y 

 
Since the accelerations are both negative, the length of the rope obeys, 
1 ( 2a   t   .

Each object moves half the distance that the rope decreases in length! 

6. A basketball player is jumping vertically upward in order to land a shot. Her legs are 
flexed and pushing on the floor so that her body is accelerated upward. 

a)	 Draw  free-body  diagrams  of  the  player’s  body  and  Earth.  Show  the  relative 
magnitudes  of  the  various  forces  and  describe  each  in  words  (i.e.,  contact, 
gravitational,  etc.,  and  indicate  which  object  exerts  that  force  and  on  what). 
Identify the action-reaction pairs. 

b)  Repeat  this  exercise  for  the  situation  immediately  after  the  player’s  body  breaks 
contact with the floor. 

c)  Finally, consider, in the same manner, the situation at the top of the jump. 

Analytic Questions: Show all your work. 

Problem 1 One dimensional kinematics: track event 

During a track event two runners, Bob, and Jim, round the last turn and head into the final 
stretch  with  Bob  a  distance d   in  front  of  Jim.  They  are  both  running  with  the  same 
velocity  v0 .  When  the  finish  line  is  a  distance  s   away  from  Jim,  Jim  accelerates  at  a 
constant  aJ    until  he  catches  up  to Bob  and  passes  him.  Jim  then  continues  at  a  constant 
speed until he reaches the finish line. 

a) How long did it take Jim to catch Bob? 

b) How far did Jim still have to run when he just caught up to Bob? 

c) How long did Jim take to reach the finish line after he just caught up to Bob? 

Bob starts  to accelerate at a constant  aB   at  the exact moment  that  Jim catches up  to him, 
and  accelerates  all  the way  to  the  finish  line  and  crosses  the  line  exactly when  Jim  does. 
Assume Bob’s acceleration is constant. 

d) What is Bob’s acceleration? 

e) What is Bob’s velocity at the finish line? Who is running faster?

An object with mass  m  slides down a roof a distance  d  that is inclined at an angle of  φ 
to  the  horizontal.  The  contact  surface  between  the  roof  and  object  has  a  coefficient  of 
kinetic friction µ .  The edge of the bottom of the roof is at a height  h  above the ground.

What  is  the  horizontal  displacement  from  the  edge  of  the  roof  to  the  point  where  the 
object hits the ground? 

Problem 3 A block 1 of mass  m1 , constrained to move along a plane inclined at angle φ 
to  the  horizontal,  is  connected  via  a  massless  inextensible  string  that  passes  over  a 
massless  pulley,  to  a  second  block  2   of  mass  m2 .  Assume  the  coefficient  of  static 
friction  on  the  between  the  block  and  the  inclined  plane  is  µ   and  the  coefficient  of
s
kinetic friction is µ . Assume the gravitational constant is  g .

a)	 What is the relation between the masses of block 1 and block 2 such that the 
system just starts to slip?  

For the following questions suppose block 2 has a mass greater than the value you 
found in part a). 

b) 	 Calculate the acceleration of the blocks.  

c)	 Calculate the tension in the rope. 

d)	

If the block  2  starts out at a height  h  above the bottom of the inclined plane and 
is released at rest. How long does it take to fall a distance s s  ?  Note that block 1 
starts off a distance greater than  s  from the pulley. 

Problem  4:  Suppose  a MIT  student wants  to  row  across  the Charles River.  Suppose  the 
water  is  moving  downstream  at  a  constant  rate  of  1.0  m/s.  A  second  boat  is  floating 
downstream  with  the  current.  From  the  second  boat’s  viewpoint,  the  student  is  rowing 
perpendicular to the current at 0.5 m/s. Suppose the river is 800 m wide. 

a)  What  is  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  the  velocity  of  the  student  as  seen  from  an 
observer at rest along the bank of the river? 

b) How far down river does the student land on the opposite bank? 

c) How long does the student take to reach the other side?

horizontal force, as shown below.

b) What is the acceleration of the blocks?

two blocks. 


Problem 6:  In  the projectile motion experiment, a ball of diameter  is projected upwards 
at an angle θ with respect  to  the horizontal. The ball  leaves  the  tube at a height  h  above 
the  ground.  Just  as  it  leaves  the  tube,  the  ball  passed  a  photogate  which  measures  the 
voltage  across  a  photo-transistor.  The  width  of  the  graph  of  voltage  vs.  time  at  half 
maximum is  ∆T . The ball has diameter  D . How long will it take the ball to return to the 
same height that it left the tube? How far in the horizontal direction has it traveled at that 
point. What is the direction and magnitude of the velocity at that point?
