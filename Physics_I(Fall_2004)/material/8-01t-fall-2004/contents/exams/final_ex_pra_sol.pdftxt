Problem 1 Energy Transformation, Specific Heat and Temperature 

Suppose  a  person  of  mass  m = 6.5 ×102  kg
 
is  running  at  a  speed  v = 3.8 m
 
s
 
and  has  a 
catabolic  power  output  (rate  of  internal  energy  consumption)  9.45 ×102 W  during  a 
1.0  1 1  km  workout. Suppose the runner converts 20% of the internal energy change into 
×
mechanical work. The  rest of  the  energy goes  into heat.  If  the  specific heat of  the  runner 
is c = 4.19 ×103  J
− K ,  how  much  would  the  body  temperature  rise  after  running

Problem 3: Carnot Cycle of an Ideal Gas 

In  this  problem,  the  starting  pressure P   and  volume  V   of  an  ideal  gas  in  state  a,  are
a
a
given.  The  ratio  RV  = V  / V  > 1   of  the  volumes  of  the  states  c  and  a  is  given.  Finally  a 
c
a 
constant  γ = 5/3  is given.  You do not know how many moles of the gas are present. 

a) Read over steps (1)- (4) below and sketch the path of the cycle on a  P V  plot on the
−
graph below. Label all appropriate points. 

(1) In the first of four steps,  a  to  b , an ideal gas is compressed from V  to V  while no
a
b
heat is allowed to flow into or out of the system. The compression of the gas raises the 
temperature from an initial temperature  T  and to a final temperature  T  . During this
1
2
process the quantity  PV γ = constant , where γ= 5/3 . 

a)  What is the pressure  P  and volume of the gas V  after the compression is 
b
b
finished? 

Answer: According to the ideal gas law,  P V   = n   RT  2  and  P V   = n   RT  1  so

Is  this  heat  positive  or  negative?  Explain  whether  it  is  added  to  the  system  or

Answer: This is an isothermal expansion so the temperature does not change  ∆ = 0 . Thus

the internal energy is constant,

The gas does work on the surroundings because it is expanding. The pressure is not 
constant during this expansion. Since the gas is expanding by an isothermal process, the 
Ideal Gas Law relates the pressure and volume variation according to 

P =

Therefore the work done by the gas on the surroundings is the integral

From The First Law of Thermodynamics,

Thus  the  heat  that  flows  into  the  system  from  the  heat  source  at  temperature  T2   is  equal 
to the work done by the expanding gas.

Note  that  this  heat  flow  must  flow  from  the  higher  temperature  heat  source  into  the 
system  because  as  the  gas  expands  it  should  lose  internal  energy  and would  decrease  its 
temperature  unless  heat  flows  into  the  system  keeping  the  internal  energy  and  hence  the 
temperature constant.

(3) When the gas has reached point  c  is expands from V  to Vd  while no heat is allowed
c
to flow into or out of the system. The expansion of the gas lowers the temperature and 
pressure from an initial temperature  T  to a final temperature  T  . During this process the
2

quantity  PV γ = constant . 

f)  What is the pressure  P  and the volume V  of the state d of the gas after the 
d
d
expansion is finished? 

Answer: This calculation is identical to part a), with state d replacing state a, and state c 
replacing state b. So the volume  V  is then

The gas does work on the surroundings since the gas is expanding.  

(4) The gas is now compressed isothermally from  d  to  a  at constant  T  from volume  Vd

back to V  .a

i)  Find  the work done by  the  system on  the  surroundings  Wad   and  the  amount of heat

10 

positive or negative? Explain whether heat  is added  to  the  system or  removed  from 
the heat source at  T1 . 

Answer:   When  the gas undergoes compression  it will  increase  its  internal energy but heat 
flows  out  of  the  system  maintaining  constant  internal  energy,  ∆U = 0  and  hence  the 
compression is isothermal. The calculation of the work and heat is similar to step (2) except 
the temperature is held at  T  . The work done by the system on the surroundings is negative

Consider that you have a large swimming pool and plan to heat your house with a heat 
pump that pumps heat from the pool into your house.  A large plate in the water will 
remain at  0  oC   due to the formation of ice.  You pick  T2  to be  50  oC , which will be the 
temperature of the (large) radiators used to heat your house.  Assume that your heat pump 
has the maximum efficiency allowed by thermodynamics. 

a)	 What is the heat gain and the refrigerator performance for this cycle? Be careful to 
use units of Kelvin for temperature. 

b)  If your house formerly burned 1200 gallons of oil in a winter (at $2.00/gallon), how 
much will the electricity cost (at $0.10 per kilowatt-hour) to replace this heat using 
the heat pump?  A gallon of oil has mass 3.4 kg and contains 1.4 ×10  J  gal-1 .

⋅

c)  The ice cube that appears in your pool over the winter will be how many meters on 
each side? (It takes  3.35 ×10  J  to melt one kg of ice; it takes up this much heat when 
6
freezing.) 

This would be great for cooling your house in the summer – even if the pool warmed up 
enough to swim in it, you could still cool your house by running the heat pump in reverse 
as an air conditioner!  More practically, you might be able to use ground water (and the 
dirt around it) as the heat sink.

Problem 5: (Planetary Orbits) 

Comet  Encke  was  discovered  in  1786  by  Pierre  Mechain  and  in  1822  Johann  Encke 
determined  that  its  period  was  3.3  years.  It  was  photographed  in  1913  at  the  aphelion 
distance,  r  = 6.1  1011 m , (furthest distance from the sun) by the telescope at Mt. Wilson.

a)  Explain why angular momentum is conserved about the focal point and then write 
down  an  equation  for  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum  between  aphelion 
and perihelion. 

b)  Explain why mechanical energy is conserved and then write down an equation for 
conservation of energy between aphelion and perihelion. 

c)  Find the velocities at perihelion and aphelion.

Problem 6: escape speed of moon 

Find  the  escape  speed  of  a  rocket  from  the  moon.  Ignore  the  rotational  motion  of  the 
moon.  The  mass  of  the  moon  is  m = 7.36 ×1022 kg
 
.  The  radius  of  the  moon  is 
R = 1.74 ×106 m .

Problem 7: (Torque and angular acceleration)

I  = (1 /  2  ) m R
moment  of 
inertia 
2
cm 
p 
about  the  center  of  mass  is  hung  from  a 
ceiling  with  a  massless  string.  A 
massless  inextensible  rope  is  wrapped 
around  the  pulley  an  attached  on  one 
side  to  an  object  of  mass  m1   and  on  the 
other side to an object mass  m2  > m  . At
1 
time  t = 0 ,  the  objects  are  released  from 
rest. 

a)  Draw the free body diagram on the pulley and the two objects. 

b)  Write down Newton’s Second Law for the pulley and the two objects. 

c)  Write down the rotational equation of motion for the pulley. 

d)  Find  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  the  translational  acceleration  of  the  two 
objects. 

e)  How long does it take for the object of mass  m2  to fall a distance  d ? 

f)  What is the tension on the two sides of the rope?

Problem 8: Projectile Motion 

A  bat  hits  a  baseball  into  the  air  with  an  initial  speed,  v0  = 5.0 ×101 m / s ,  and  makes  an 
angle θ= 3.0 ×10  deg  with respect to the horizontal. How high does  it go from  the point 
1
where  it  was  hit?  How  far  does  the  ball  travel  if  it  is  caught  at  exactly  the  same  height 
that it is hit from? When the ball is in flight, ignore all forces acting on the ball except for 
gravitation.
