Problem 1a) (5 points) Collisions and  Center of Mass Reference Frame 

In  the  lab  frame,  Cart A  is  at  rest. An  identical  cart  B,  of  the  same mass, moving  to  the 
right, collides elastically with cart A. After  the collision, describe  the motion of  the carts 
in  a  reference  frame moving with  the  center  of mass.  (You may  find  a  picture may  help 
clarify your explanation.)

Problem 1b) (5 points) Collisions  
An object  P  has an  initial velocity  v r .  It  strikes an  initially  stationary object  Q  which  is 
attached to a massless spring, as shown.  

Assume that the masses of  P  and  Q  are equal. At the point of maximum compression of 
the spring, is the momentum of  Q  greater, equal, or less than the initial momentum of  P . 
Explain your reasoning.

Problem 1c) (5 points) Torque and Moment of Inertia 

Two wheels with  fixed  hubs,  each  having  a mass  of  1 kg ,  start  from  rest,  and  forces  are 
applied:  F1  = 1N    to  the  first  wheel  and  F2   to  the  second  wheel,  as  shown.  Assume  the 
hubs  and  spokes  are  massless,  so  that  the  moment  of  inertia  about  the  center  of  mass  is 
= mR 2  .  How  large  must  the  force  F2
be  in  order  to  impart  identical  angular 
I 
cm 
accelerations on each wheel? Explain how you arrived at your result.

Problem 1d) (5 points) Angular Momentum and Rotational Energy  

A figure skater stands on one spot on the ice (assumed frictionless) and spins around with 
her  arms  extended. When  she pulls  in her  arms,  she  reduces her moment of  inertia  about 
the  spin  axis  passing  through  her  center  of mass  and  her  angular  speed  increases  so  that 
her  angular  momentum  is  conserved.  Compared  to  her  initial  rotational  kinetic  energy, 
her rotational kinetic energy after she has pulled in her arms must be  

1.  the same.  
2.  larger because she's rotating faster.  
3.  smaller because her moment of inertia is smaller.  

Explain your reasoning.

Problem 1e) (5 points) Rolling without slipping 

A  bicycle  tire  rolls  without  slipping  across  the  ground  (moving  to  the  left  in  the  figure 
below).  Describe  the  direction  and  magnitude  of  the  velocity  at  each  of  the  four  points 
shown in the figure as seen from an observer at rest on the ground.

Problem 2: Exploding Puck 

A hockey player shoots a “trick” hockey puck along the ice towards the center of the goal 
from a position  d  directly in front of the goal. The initial speed of the puck is  v0  and the 
puck has a mass  m . 

Half  way  to  the  goal  the  puck  explodes  into  two  fragments.  One  piece  of  mass 
m 1  = ( 3 5 ) m 
  comes  back  towards  the  player  and  passes  d
  to  the  side  of  the  spot  it 
3 8
was  initially  shot  from  with  a  speed  v 1, f  = ( 5 12  ) v  .  The  other  piece  of  the  puck  with
0 
mass  m 2  = ( 2 5 ) m  continues on towards the goal with a speed  v 2 ,  f  . 

Assume  that  there  is  no  friction  as  the  puck  slides  along  the  ice  and  that  the  mass  of 
explosive in the puck is negligible. 

a) Write down the equations for conservation of momentum of the puck and fragments in 
terms of the quantities shown in the figure above.  

b) By what distance,  y , does the piece that continues towards the goal miss the center of 
the goal? Express your answer in terms of  d .

Problem 3: Torque, Rotation and Translation 

 A Yo-Yo of mass  m  has an axle of radius  b  and a spool of radius  R . It’s moment of 
inertia can be taken to be  I  = (1 2 ) mR   and the thickness of the string can be neglected.

The Yo-Yo is released from rest. 

a)  What is the tension in the cord as the Yo-Yo descends? 

b)

 Use conservation of energy to find the angular velocity of the Yo-Yo when it 
reaches the bottom of the string. 

c)  What happens to the Yo-Yo at the bottom of the string?

Problem 4: Rolling Cylinder 

A  solid  cylinder  of  mass  m   and  radius  R   is  initially  thrown  along  a  wooden  floor 
hallway with  an  initial  speed  v0   and  zero  initial  angular velocity ω = 0  as  shown  in  the
0 
figure below. 

a)	 What  is  the  moment  of  inertia  of  the  cylinder  about  the  axis  of  rotation  of  the 
cylinder? 

b)	 What effects does friction have on the cylinder before it reaches its final speed? Is 
the friction static or kinetic? Which direction does it point? 

c)  What  is  the  angular  speed, ω ,  of  the  cylinder  when  it  just  starts  to  roll  without 
f
slipping? Express your answer in terms of   m ,  R  , and  v0 .

Problem 5: Experiment 7: Physical Pendulum 

A physical pendulum consists of a rod of 
mass  m1  pivoted at one end. The rod has 
length  l1  and moment of inertia  I1  about 
the pivot point. A disc of mass  m2  and 
radius  r2  with moment of inertia  I cm 
about it’s center of mass, is rigidly 
attached a distance  l2  from the pivot 
point.  The pendulum is initially 
displaced to an angle θ  and then
0
released from rest. 

a) What is the moment of inertia of the physical pendulum about the pivot point?  


b) What is the angular acceleration of the pendulum about the pivot point? 


c) What is the angular velocity of the pendulum when the pendulum is at the bottom of  

it’s swing?


d) If the disc is moved further from the pivot, will the period of the pendulum increase or 

decrease or stay the same?

Problem 6: Experiment 11 Angular Momentum 

A steel washer, is mounted on the shaft of a small motor. The moment of inertia of the 
motor and washer is  I  . Assume that the frictional torque on the axle remains the same 
0 
throughout the slowing down. The washer is set into motion. When it reaches an initial 
angular velocity ω , at  t = 0 ,  the power to the motor is shut off, and the washer slows 
0
down until it reaches an angular velocity of ω  at time  tb . At that instant, a second steel
b
washer with a moment of inertia  I  is dropped on top of the first washer. Assume that 
w 
the second washer is only in contact with the first washer.  The collision takes place over 
a time  ∆ =  − t  . Assume the frictional torque on the axle remains the same. The two 
t
ta
b 
washers continue to slow down until at they stop at  t f  . 

a)  Describe how you measured the moment of inertia in the experiment. 

A torque was applied to the rotor by a string that was supporting a weight. When the 
weight was dropped, the rotor began to accelerate. The acceleration was measured by 
making a straight line fit to the voltage vs. time graph, and then using the calibration 
factor for turning voltage into angular frequency. Once the string unwound, the frictional 
deceleration was measured in a similar fashion.  

The rotational dynamics for the two stages are given by 

RT −τf  = Iαup 

−τf  = Iαdown 

Note that αdown < 0 

The first two equations above imply that 

RT Iαdown  = Iαup  .
+ 

The force equation for the first stage is given by 

mg − T  = maup  . 

The linear acceleration and angular acceleration are constrained by 

a  = Rα .

Combining these last two equations and solving for the tension yields

T mg
= 

 − mαRup 

Substituting the tension into the combined torque equation yields 

mg − mαRup  + Iαdown  = Iαup 

We can solve this for the moment of inertia 

I  =

mgR − mαRup  mgR − mαRup 
=

b)  What is the angular deceleration while the first washer and motor is slowing 
down? 

c)  What is the angular velocity of the two washers immediately after the collision is 
finished? 

d)  What is the angular deceleration after the collision?
