Practice Exam 2 

Note: The Exam 2 will have a few concept questions on the test. Review all the 
concept tests from class to prepare for this. 

Problem 1: static equilibrium  

You  are  able  to  hold  out  your  arm  in  an  outstretched  horizontal  position  thanks  to  the 
action  of  the  deltoid  muscle.  Assume  the  humerus  bone  has  a  mass  of  m  ,  the  center  of 
mass of  the humerus  is a distance    d  from  the scapula,  the deltoid muscle attaches  to  the 
humerus a distance a distance  s  from the scapula and the angle the deltoid muscle makes 
with the horizontal is α.  A schematic representation of this action looks as follows: 

a)  What is the tension T in the deltoid muscle? 

b)  What are the vertical and horizontal components of the force exerted by the 
scapula (shoulder blade) on the humerus? 

Problem 2: Water Bucket 

A  water  bucket  attached  to  a  rope  and  spun  in  a  vertical  circle  of  radius  r  . 
Suppose the bucket has mass  m  and that the bucket can be approximated as a point mass 
at  the  end  of  the  rope.  The  rope  breaks  when  the  bucket  is  moving  vertically  upwards. 
The bucket rises to a height  h  above the release point. 

a)  What was the velocity of the bucket when it was released?  
\ 
b)  What was the tension in the cord when it broke?  

Problem 3: spring and loop 

A  mass  m   is  pushed  against  a  spring  with  spring  constant  k   and  held  in  place  with  a 
catch.  The  spring  compresses  an  unknown  distance  x  .  When  the  catch  is  removed,  the 
mass  leaves  the spring and slides along a frictionless circular  loop of radius  r  . When  the 
mass  reaches  the  top  of  the  loop,  the  force  of  the  loop  on  the mass  (the  normal  force)  is 
equal to twice the weight of the mass.  

a)  Using  conservation  of  energy,  find  the  kinetic  energy  at  the  top  of  the  loop. 
Express your answer as a function of  k, m, x, g, and R. 
b)  Using Newton’s second law, derive the equation of motion for the mass when it is 
at the top of the loop. 

c)	 How far was the spring compressed? 

Problem 4: inclined plane, friction, spring 

An  object  of  mass  m   slides  down  a  plane  which  is  inclined  at  an  angle θ.  The  object 
starts  out  at  rest  a  distance  s   from  an  unstretched  spring  that  lies  at  the  bottom  of  the 
plane. The spring has a constant  k . 

a)	 Assume the incline plane is frictionless. How far will the spring compress when 
the mass first comes to rest? 

b)	 Now assume that the incline plane has a coefficient of kinetic friction µ . How
k
far will the spring compress when the mass first comes to rest? 


c)  In case b), how much energy has been lost to heat?  


Problem 5: elliptic orbit 

A satellite of mass  m  is in an elliptical orbit around a planet of mass  m p   which is located 
at  one  focus  of  the  ellipse.  The  satellite  has  a  velocity  v   at  the  distance  r   when  it  is
a	
a
furthest  from the planet. The distance of closest approach is  rp . 

a)	 What is the magnitude of the velocity  v p   of the satellite when it is closest to the 
planet? 

b)	 If the satellite were in a circular orbit of radius  r  = rp  , is it’s velocity  v  greater
c	
c
than, equal to, or less than the velocity  v p  of the original elliptic orbit? Justify 
your answer.
