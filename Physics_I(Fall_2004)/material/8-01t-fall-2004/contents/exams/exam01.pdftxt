Problem 1: (10 points) Concept Questions: Briefly answer the following 
questions. 

a)  (5  points)  Two  people  are  running  forward  at  the  same  speed.  One  person  throws  a 
ball sideways to the other person at a constant speed v as see by the thrower. Describe the 
motion of  the ball  as  seen by  a person  standing on  the ground.  In particular  according  to 
the person on the ground is the ball moving faster, slower, or the same speed compared to 
the speed of the ball v as seen by the thrower? 

Explain your answer: 

b) (5 points) You are standing on a spring bathroom scale in an elevator and look at the 
scale while the elevator is at rest with respect to the ground. In between floors, when the 
elevator is moving at a constant speed with respect to the ground, you look at the scale 
again. Does the scale show a greater value, the same value, or a lower value? 

Explain your answer.

Part 2: Analytic Questions: Show all your work. 

Problem 2: (30 points)  Two identical blocks of given mass  m  ,  are attached together by 
a massless  string  and  constrained  to move  along  a  plane  that  is  inclined  at  a  given  angle 
φ  to  the  horizontal.  The  upper  block  is  connected  via  a  second  massless  inextensible 
string  that passes over  a massless pulley,  to  a  third block of unknown mass  m  . Assume
u
the  coefficient  of  static  friction  between  the  block  and  the  inclined  plane  is  given  as  µs
and the coefficient of kinetic friction is given as  µ . Assume the gravitational constant is 
k
given as  g . 

a)	 What is the mass of the third block such that the blocks just start slipping up the 
inclined plane? Include in your answer a briefly explanation of how you intend to 
model this problem?  

b) 	 Now suppose the string between the two identical blocks is cut. How does your 
model change? What are the accelerations of the lower block and the upper block 
on the inclined plane? 

Answer:

Problem  3:  (30 points) An  object  of  given mass  m   starts with  a  given  velocity  v0   and 
slides an unknown distance  s  along a floor and then off the top of a staircase. The goal of 
this  problem  is  to  find  the  distance  s  .  The  coefficient  of  kinetic  friction  between  the 
object and the floor is given byµ . The object strikes at the far end of the third stair. Each 
k
stair  has  a  given  rise  of  h   and  a  given  run  of  d .  You  may  neglect  air  resistance  and 
assume the gravitational constant is given as  g . 

a)	 Briefly describe how you intend to model the motion of the object? What are the 
given quantities in this problem? 

b) 	 What is the velocity of the object just as it leaves the top of the staircase? Express 
your answer in terms of the given quantities only. 

c) 	 What is the acceleration of the object while it slides on the floor? Express your 
answer in terms of the given quantities only. 

d)	 What is the unknown distance  s  that the object slides along the floor? Express 
your answer in terms of the given quantities only. 

Answer:

Problem  4:  (30  points) A  person  of  given mass  m   is  standing  on  a  scale  in  an  elevator 
in  Building  24.  Initially  the  elevator  is  at  rest.  The  elevator  then  begins  to  ascend  to  the 
sixth  floor  that  is a given distance  h   above  the  starting point. The elevator undergoes an 
unknown  constant  acceleration  a   for  a  given  time  t1 .  Then  the  elevator  moves  at  a 
constant velocity for a time  t2  = 4t1  . Finally the elevator brakes with a deceleration of the 
same  magnitude  as  the  initial  acceleration  for  a  time  t3  = t1   until  stopping  at  the  sixth 
floor. Assume the gravitational constant is given as  g . The goal of this problem is to find 
the magnitude of the acceleration and the readings on the scale.  

a)	 Briefly explain how you intend to model this problem. 

b) 	 What  is  the  magnitude  of  the  acceleration  and  deceleration  of  the  elevator? 
Express your answer in terms of the given quantities.  

c) 	 When  the  elevator  is  accelerating  upwards,  what  is  the  magnitude  of  the  contact 
force between the person’s feet and the scale? 

d)	 When  the elevator  is braking, what  is  the magnitude of  the contact  force between 
the person’s feet and the scale?
