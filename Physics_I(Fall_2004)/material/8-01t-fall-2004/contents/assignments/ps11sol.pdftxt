Problem 1 : Bohr hydrogen atom 

The Bohr hydrogen atom models  the atom as an electron orbiting  the proton under  the  influence 
of an electric force producing uniform circular motion with radius  a0 . The mass of the electron is 
m	 = 9.1  10  31  kg

a)	 Write  down  the  equation  that  arises  from  the  application  of  Newton’s  2nd  Law  to  the 
electron. 

Since  the  electron  is  much  less  massive  than  the  proton  the  reduced  mass  is  the  mass  of  the 
electron.  Te radial component of Newton’s Second Law is then

4.  The  torque  τ   is  made  of  two  parts:  the  friction  torque  τ   from  the  bearings  and  the
c
f
torque τ  due exerted by  the washer you dropped on  the rotor. By  the 3rd  law,  the  rotor 
RW
exerts  an  equal  and  opposite  torque  on  the washer.  Since  you  know τ ,  subtract  it  from
f

τ  to find an estimate for τRW .

c

Answer:  The  total  torque  is  equal  to  the  frictional  torque  and  the  torque  τ   exerted  by  the 
RW
washer 

So the torque τ  exerted by the washer is

τtotal  =τ  τ RW
