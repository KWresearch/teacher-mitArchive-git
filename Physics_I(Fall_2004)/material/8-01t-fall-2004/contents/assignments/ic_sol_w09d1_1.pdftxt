Problem 27: Elastic One Dimensional Collision 

Consider the elastic collision of two carts along a track; the incident cart 1 has mass   m1  and 
moves with initial velocity  v1,0  . The target cart has mass   m2  = 2m   and is initially at rest 
1 
v2 ,0   = 0 . Immediately after the collision, the target cart has final speed  v1, f   and the target cart has 
final speed  v2 ,  f  . Calculate the final velocities of the carts as a function of the initial velocity  v1,0  . 

Solution 
a) Draw a momentum diagram. 

Figure 10.11 Momentum flow for a one-dimensional collision. 

b) Find the equation for conservation of momentum in the lab reference frame. 

Thus 

m v   = −m v   + 2m v2 ,

v1,0  = −v1, f  + 2v2 , f  . 

c) Find the equation for conservation of energy in the lab reference frame.

Thus

d)  Using these two equations, calculate the final velocities of the target cart and the incident 
cart. 

We shall solve for  v 2 ,  f  . From the momentum equation,  

v 1, f  = 2v 2 , f  − v 1,0 . 

The energy equation becomes 

v 1,0  = ( 2v

2 , f 

− v 1,0  ) + 2v 2 , f  = 4v 2 , f

Thus

We can now  solve  for  v 2 ,  f  . There are  two solutions. The  first  is  the  trivial v 2 ,  f  = 0 , which  is  just 
the  initial  state when  the  target  is  at  rest.  The  reason we  get  this  solution  is  that  the  energy  and 
momentum equations are the same if we reverse the direction of time (change the direction of all 
velocities). The second solution is the one of interest, 

v 2 ,  f

=  v 1,0 .

Then the final velocity of the incident cart is

v 1, f  = 2v 2 , f  − v 1,0  =  v 1,0  − v 1,0  =

Problem 28: (Conservation of Momentum) 

Two people, each with mass  m p  , stand on a railway flatcar of mass  m  . They jump off one end
c
of the flatcar with velocity of magnitude  u  relative to the car. The car rolls in the opposite 
direction without friction. 

a)  What is the final velocity of the car if the two people jump at the same time? 

b)  What is the final velocity of the car if the two people jump off one at a time? 

c)  In which of the two above cases, does the railcar have the greatest final velocity?

Problem 29: Pendulums and Collisions 

A simple pendulum consists of a bob of mass  m1  that is suspended by a massless string. The bob 
is pulled out and released from a height  h  as measured from the bottom of the swing and swings 
0
downward  in  a  circular  orbit. At  the  bottom  of  the  swing,  the  bob  collides with  a  block  of mass 
m2  that is initially at rest on a frictionless table. Assume the pivot point is frictionless. 

a)	 What  is  the  velocity  of  the  bob  immediately  before  the  collision  at  the  bottom  of  the 
swing? 

b) 	 Assume  the  collision  is  perfectly  elastic.  The  block moves  along  the  table  and  the  bob 
moves  in  the  opposite  direction  but with  the  same  speed  as  the  block. What  is  the mass, 
m2 , of the block? 

c)  Suppose the collision is completely inelastic due to some putty that is placed on the 
block. What is the velocity of the combined system immediately after the collision? 
(Assume that the putty is massless.) 

d)  After the completely inelastic collision, the bob and block continue in circular motion. 
What is the maximum height,  h f  ,  that the combined system rises after the collision?
