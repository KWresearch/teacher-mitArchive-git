Problem Set 7: Potential Energy, Change in Mechanical Energy Solutions 

Problem 1: Gravitational Potential and Kinetic Energy 

A  satellite  of  mass  m  = 5.0 ×102  kg
  is  initially  in  a  circular  orbit  about  the  earth  with  a  radius 
and  velocity  v0  = 3.1  103 
  around  the  earth.  Assume  the  earth  has  mass 
m
r0  = 4.1  107  m 
s

and  radius  r  = 6.4 ×106  m  .  Since  m  >> m  ,  you  may  find  it  convenient  to  ignore 
m  = 6.0 ×10 24  kg

certain terms. Justify any terms you choose to ignore.  

a) 	 What  is  the  magnitude  of  the  gravitational  force  acting  on  the  satellite? What  is  the  centripetal 
acceleration of the satellite?  

b)	 What  are  the  kinetic  and  potential  energies  of  the  satellite  earth  system?   State  any  assumptions 
that you make. Specify your reference point for zero potential energy. What is the total energy? 

As  a  result  of  a  satellite  maneuver,  the  satellite  trajectory  is  changed  to  an  elliptical  orbit.  This  is 
accomplished  by  firing  a  rocket  for  a  short  time  interval  and  increasing  the  tangential  speed  of  the 
satellite  to  ( 5 4  v  . You may  assume  that during  the  firing,  the  satellite does not noticeably  change  the 
)  0 
distance from the center of the earth. 

c)	 What are  the kinetic and potential energies of  the earth-satellite at  the point of closest approach? 
Specify your reference point for zero potential energy. What is the total energy? 

d)	 How much energy was necessary to change the orbit of the satellite? 

e)  What speed would the satellite need to acquire so that it can escape to infinity? 

 
 
 
 
 Problem 2: Conservation of Mechanical Energy and Newton’s Second Law 

A small object of mass  m  = 0.2 kg
is placed at the top of a large sphere of radius  R  = 0.5 m  resting 
on  the ground.  The object  is given a negligibly  small velocity  so  that  it  starts  to  slide down  the  sphere. 
Assume  the  surface  of  the  sphere  is  frictionless  and  the  sphere  is  fixed  to  the  surface  of  a  table.  In  this 
problem, you will try to find where the object hits the ground. 

a)  Briefly describe how you intend to model the motion. Here are some questions which should 
help guide your thinking. Is there any special condition(s) that describe when the object leaves 
the sphere? Does the normal force do any work on the object? Does the principle of 
Conservation of Energy replace  Newton’s Second Law in the radial  direction or are they 
independent? 

b)  At what angle will the mass leave the sphere? 

c)  What is the velocity of the mass when it just leaves the sphere? 

d)  How far from the bottom of the sphere will the mass hit the ground? 

 
Problem 3: Conservation of Energy and Newton’s Second Law: Tetherball 

A ball of negligible radius and mass  m  = 0.1 kg
hangs from a string of length  l  = 0.5 m . It is hit 
in such a way that it then travels in a vertical  
circle (with negligible loss of energy). The initial 
speed of the ball after being struck is  
v0  = 7.0 m
s
. 

a)  Find the speed of the ball at the top of the circle. 

b)  Find the tension in the string when the ball is at the top of the circle. 

 
 
 
Problem 4: Spring-mass harmonic oscillator 

Consider  an  ideal  spring  that  has  an  unstretched  length  l  . Assume  the  spring  has  a  constant  k .
0
Suppose  the  spring  is  attached  to  a  mass  m   that  lies  on  a  horizontal  frictionless  surface.  The 
spring-mass  system  is  compressed  a  distance  of  x0   from  equilibrium  and  then  released  with  an 
initial speed  v0  toward the equilibrium position.  

a)  What is the period of oscillation for this system? 


b)  How long will it take for the mass to first return to the equilibrium position? 


c)  How long will it take for the mass to first become completely extended?


d)  Draw  a  graph  of  the  position  and  velocity  of  the  mass  as  a  function  of  time.  Carefully

label your axes and clearly specify any special values. 

Problem 5: Analysis Experiment 06 Post 

a) Enter the values from your experiment into the table below. 

aup (m/s2) 

adown (m/s2) 

U(h1) (mJ) 

U(h2) (mJ) 

Use these numbers, along with M = 0.75 kg, to calculate the friction force on the cart. Compare it 
with the value you obtained from the potential energy difference between the turning points h1 
and h2. 

b) Explain briefly in words why it makes sense to fit the function A sin[2π(x-C)/T] to the force 
peaks when the cart bounces off the spring on the force sensor. 

c) Enter the results of your fit to the second bounce into this table: 

A (N) 

k (N/m) 

A2/2k (mJ) 

and use them to find the force constant of the spring. Compute the potential energy stored in the 
compressed spring, A2/2k, and compare it with the average of U(h1) and U(h2) from the table 
above.
