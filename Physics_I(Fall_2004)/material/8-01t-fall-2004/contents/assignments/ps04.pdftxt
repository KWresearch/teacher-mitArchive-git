Problem 1: (Rotational kinematics) 

The  earth  is  spinning  about  its  axis with  a  period  of  23  hours  56 min  and  4  sec.  The  equatorial 
radius of the earth is  6.38 ×106  m . The latitude of Cambridge, Mass is  42 o  22′ . 

a)  Find the velocity and centripetal acceleration of a person at MIT as they undergo circular 
motion about the earth’s axis of rotation.  

b)	 The  rotation  of  the  Earth  is  slowing  down.  In  2004,  the  Earth  took  1.01 s   longer  to 
complete  365   rotations  than  in  1924. What  was  the  average  angular  deceleration  of  the 
Earth in the time interval from 1924 to 2004? 

Problem 2: Second Law Applications: uniform circular motion 

A  mass  m   is  connected  to  a  vertical  revolving  axle  by  two  massless  inextensible  strings  of 
length  l ,  each making  an  angle  of  450  with  the  axle.  Both  the  axle  and  the mass  are  revolving 
with angular velocity ω. Gravity is directed downwards. 

a)	 Draw a clear force diagram for m  . 

b)  Find the tension in the upper string,  Tupper  , and lower string, Tlower   . 

Problem 3: Experiment 5: Static Equilibrium Pre-Class Question 

A  pivoted  beam  is  supported  by  a  cable  that  is  attached  to  the  beam  a  distance 
2 3  of  the  way
along  the  beam  from  the  pivot.  The  center  of  mass  of  the  beam  is 
  the  distance  from  the 
1 2
r 
pivot. The beam makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal.  There is a unknown force,  F , 
acting at the pivot. 

If  the beam  is  raised by  tightening  (and  shortening  the  cable),  explain whether  the magnitude of 
r 
force acting at the pivot,  F , increases, stays the same or decreases. 
Problem 4: Experiment 04 Analysis 

Fill  in  the  table  below  with  the  numbers  from  your  Experiment  04.    Use  at  least  3  non-zero 
values of  angular velocity ω,  4 if you made that many measurements. It is acceptable to do this 
problem  in collaboration with your  lab partners  in  the experiment.   You may either do  it  in class 
using DataStudio or you may export your table from DataStudio as a text file and save it, 
and do the fit later using software such as Xess. 

Data Table: experiment 04 

ω 
rm 

Fit these data to an expression of the form 

rm  ω 
(
)

A 
 = 
/
1 (ω ω )c 
− 

2

Repeat  the  fit  when  A  is  not  an  adjustable  parameter,  but  the  value  you  measured  for 
r0  = rm  (ω= 0) .  When  you  do  that,  this  is  a  fit  with  one  adjustable  parameter,  and  it  is  not 
necessary to include ω= 0  in the fit; it is automatically included by the choice  r0  = r  (ω= 0) .
m 

a)	 What value did your fit give for A, and how does it compare to your measured  r0 ? 

b)  Do you get a “better” fit when A is an adjustable parameter, or not?  (Explain.) 

c)  What did  the one-parameter fit give for the critical frequency ω ?  Compare it to  k m/
c
for the spring in your experiment.  

d)	 What  root  mean  squared  error  did  the  fit  give  you?  How  does  it  compare  with  the 
accuracy you estimate for your measurements of  r  (ω) ?  (Remember, if you used a User-
m

Defined  Fit  in  DataStudio,  divide  the  program's  Root  MSE  by  the  square  root  of  the 
number of data points you used in your fit.)
