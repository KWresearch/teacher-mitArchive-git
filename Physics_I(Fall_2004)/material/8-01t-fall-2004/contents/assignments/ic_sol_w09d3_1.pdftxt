Problem 30  Moment of Inertia of a Uniform disc. 

A uniform disc of mass  m  and radius  R  is mounted on an axis passing through the center of the 
disc,  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  disc.  In  this  problem,  you  will  calculate  the  moment  of 
inertia about two different axes that pass perpendicular to the disc. One passes through the center 
of  mass  of  the  disc  and  the  second  passes  through  a  point  on  the  rim  of  the  disc  a  distance  R 
from  the  center. As  a  starting  point,  consider  the  contribution  to  the moment  of  inertia  from  the 
mass element  dm   show in the figure below. 

Step 1: We can  take  the point  S   to be  the center of mass of  the disc. The axis of  rotation passes 
through the center of the disc, perpendicular to the plane of the disc.  

Step 2: We choose cylindrical coordinates with the coordinates  ( r ,θ)  in the plane and the  z  -axis 
perpendicular to the plane. 

Step 3: The area element  da   = rdrdθ  can be thought of as the product of arc length  rdθ with the 
radial width  dr   , (Figure 9). Since the disc is uniform, the mass per unit area is a constant,  

σ=

Therefore  the  mass  in  an  infinitesimal  area  element  a  distance  r   from  the  axis  of  rotation  is 
given by 

Step 4: When the disc rotates, the mass element traces out a circle of radius  r

Step  5:  The  integral  is  now  an  integral  in  two  dimensions  as  the  angle θ  varies  from θ= 0  to 
θ= 2π,  and  the  radial  coordinate  r   varies  from  r  = 0  to  r R .  Thus  the  limits  of  the  integral

are

Step 6: The integral can now be explicitly calculated by first integrating the θ-coordinate:

Problem 30 Turntable 

A  turntable  is  a uniform disc of mass 1.2 kg  and  radius  1.3  10  1 m . The  turntable  is  spinning  at 
× −
an  initial  constant  frequency  of  f 0  = 33  cycles/min  .  The  motor  is  turned  off  and  the  turntable 
slows to a stop in 8.0 s due to frictional torque. Assume that the angular acceleration is constant. 
What is the magnitude of the frictional torque acting on the disc?  

Answer: Initially, the disc is spinning with a frequency 
cycles  
f 0  = (33 cycles   )(1min  
) = 0.55 
60 s
s 
min 

= 0.55Hz  . 

So the initial angular velocity is

ω = 2π f 0  = (2π

The final angular velocity is zero, so the angular acceleration is

Since the angular acceleration is negative, we confirm that the disc is slowing down. 

The  moment  of  inertia  of  the  turntable  about  an  axis  passing  perpendicular  to  the  disc  and 
through the center of mass is

Problem 31: Simple Pendulum 

A  pendulum  consists  of  an  object  hanging  from  the  end  of  a  string.  The  object  is  pulled  to  one 
side and allowed  to oscillate.  If  the object has negligible size and  the string  is massless,  then  the 
pendulum is called a simple pendulum.  

a)  Find the equation of motion for the object.  


b)  Show that the object undergoes simple harmonic motion when the initial angle is small 

and you can approximate  sinθ≅θ. 


c)  For small angles, what is the period of oscillation?


d)  Is the angular velocity the same as the angular frequency for the object?


The torque about the pivot point is given by 

r 
r 
τ S  = r ,  × mg = lrˆ × mg

( sin  θθˆ + cos  θrˆ ) = − lmg

sin  θkˆ .

The angular acceleration is a vector pointing along the z-axis, 

rα = 

d  θkˆ .

2dt 

Remark: The z-component of the angular acceleration vector is 
negative. 


The moment of inertial of a point mass about the pivot point is

and can be positive or

The rotational dynamical equation is 

Therefore

−lmg   sinθkˆ  = ml   2  d  θkˆ .

2dt 

Thus we have the equation of motion for the simple pendulum, 

−lmg   sinθ= ml   2  d  θ

When the angle of oscillation is small, then we can use the small angle approximation 

Then the pendulum equation becomes 

sinθ≅θ. 

2d  θ

This equation is similar to the mass-spring equation,

that described the oscillation of a mass about the equilibrium point of a spring. Recall that the 
angular frequency of oscillation was given by 

ωspring  

= 

k 
m 

.

So by comparison, the angular frequency of oscillation for the pendulum is approximately  

with period 

ωpendulum  ≅

T  =

By analogy with the spring, if the pendulum has been displaced by a small angle θ  and released
0
from rest, the angle that the pendulum makes with the vertical as a function of time is given by 

( )  =θ cos((   g
θ t 
0 

l t
/  ) ) . 

The angular velocity of the pendulum is then given by the derivative 

d
θ/

 dt = −(  g l
/ 

)θ sin((
0 

g l t
/ )
 

) .

This varies sinusoidally with time and is not equal to the angular frequency which is a constant 
associated with the periodic nature of the motion.
