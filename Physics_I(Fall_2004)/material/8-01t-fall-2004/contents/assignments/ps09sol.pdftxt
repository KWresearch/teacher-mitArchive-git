Problem 3: Experiment 9: Collisions 

Part One Inelastic Collision: 

Analysis:  Complete  the  analysis  of  your  data  table  by  following  the  two  steps  below,  and 
answer Question 1 below. 

You  will  analyze  this  collision  as  seen  by  two  different  observers.  One  observer  is  at  rest  with 
respect  to  the  classroom. This  reference  frame  is  called  the  lab  reference  frame. The  observer  is 
moving  at  a  velocity  equal  to  the  center  of  mass  velocity  of  the  two  cart  system.  This  frame  is 
called the center of mass reference frame.  

Step 1: Draw  two momentum diagrams  for both carts  immediately before and  immediately after 
the  collision,  one  describing  the  collision  in  the  lab  reference  frame,  and  one  describing  the 
collision in the center of mass reference frame. 

Answer: 

Figure 1: Collision in lab reference frame 

Figure 2: Collision in center of mass reference frame 

You  made  three  different  trial  collisions;  the  first  with  equal  masses,  and  the  second  and  third 
with  unequal  masses.  Use  your  measured  values  to  complete  the  following  table.  Entries  to  the 
left of  the double vertical bar are before  the  two carts collide;  those  to  the  right are after  the  two 
carts collide but before the collision with the force sensor. Hand the table in with your homework 
solutions. 

Step 2:

a)  First calculate the initial kinetic energy  K  and the final kinetic energy K  in the ‘lab

reference frame’. The difference between the two,  K 2  − K1  = W 
,  is the non-conservative 
nc  
work internal work, W  = K f  − K 0  , due to the totally inelastic collision. This work is due 
nc 
to forces that irreversibly deform the bodies during the collision.

Question 1:  In  the center of mass  reference  frame:  the velocity of  the  incident cart A moves 
forward with a  slower velocity,  v r 
r
A,1  − v 
,  than  in  the  lab  frame;  the cart B moves backward 
cm 
with a velocity,  − v r 
; After the collision, the two carts are stuck together and are at rest!  So
cm 
the  final  kinetic  energy  is  zero,  K f  ′ = 0 .  Therefore  the  non-conservative  work  in  the  center 
of mass reference frame is given by     

W  = K f  ′ − K 
nc 

CMCS 

= − KCMCS  .

Show  that  K f  − K 0  = − K 
.  This  will  require  a  calculation.  Does  your  experimental  data 
cmcs 
verify this theoretical result?  

Solution:  For  the  first  two  cases  the  data  agrees  with  the  theory.  For  the  third  case  when  the 
incident mass  is  twice  the  target mass  ,  the  final velocity  is  less  than  the  center of mass velocity

indicating  that  there  is  some  additional  loss  of  energy  due  to  friction.  Since  the  target  is  more 
massive, the incoming energy loss due to friction may be greater.

Since  the carts are constrained  to move along  the  track,  there  is no  rotation  in  this collision. The 
displacement  of  an  individual  particle  during  the  collision  in  the  lab  reference  frame  can  be 
considered  to  be  a  vector  sum  of  the  displacement  relative  to  the  center  of  mass,  and  a 
displacement due to the center of mass motion, 
dri lab   = dri ,cm   + dr r

This  is  not  zero  because  the  individual  particles  do  not  necessarily  displace  the  same  amount. 
This is the result of the deformation of the body, 
rdri cm   ≠ dr r 
j ,cm  
, 

So when we  sum  over  all  particle  pairs  this  gives  the  total  internal work.  This  only  depends  on 
the  motion  relative  to  the  center  of  mass,  so  in  either  reference  frame,  the  internal  work  is  the 
same, hence the change in kinetic energy should also be the same. 

Part Two Elastic Collision: 

Analysis:  Complete  the  analysis  of  your  data  table  by  following  the  two  steps  below,  and 
answer Question 2-5 below. 

Once again you made three trials. Since the motion sensor can only calculate the initial and final 
velocities of the incident cart, you needed to measure the impulse of the second cart on the force 
sensor to determine the velocity of the target cart. 

Step 1: Draw a momentum diagram for the collision immediately before the cart B hits the force 
sensor and after cart B rebounds from the force sensor. 

9 

Figure 3: Elastic collision of Cart B with force sensor 

Step 2:  If we assume  that cart B collides elastically with  the  force  sensor,  the momentum of  the 
cart  B  changes  by  ∆p r  = − 2mB  v B ,2   .  This  change  in  momentum  is  the  impulse  that  the  force 
r
B 
sensor exerts on  the  target cart. The  target cart  therefore exerts an equal but opposite  impulse on 
the  force  sensor with magnitude  J  = 2m
 v
B B ,2  . So measuring  the  impulse  allows  you  to  calculate 
the  velocity  of  the  target  cart,  vB ,2   = J  2mB  .  Use  your  measured  values  to  complete  the 
following  table.  Velocity  entries  to  the  left  of  the  double  vertical  bar  are  before  the  two  carts 
collide;  velocity  entries  to  the  right  are  after  they  collide  but  before  the  collision  with  the  force 
sensor. Hand the table in with your homework solutions.

Question 2: Assuming that the collision is elastic, based on the principles of conservation of 
momentum and conservation of energy, calculate the theoretical final velocities for cart B and 
cart A for the three trials. Show your work. (These calculations are involved for the second and 
third trials.) Briefly describe whether or not your measured values agree with your calculated 
values from part d. Are the collisions elastic?

For the first case, the final velocity of the incident cart was zero, and the target cart was traveling 
at  nearly  the  initial  velocity  of  the  incident  cart.  The  collision  was  elastic.  For  the  second  case, 
the  final  velocity  of  the  both  the  incident  cart  and  the  target  cart wee  smaller  than  the  predicted 
0.5vi   indicating  that  the  collision  was  not  elastic.  For  the  third  case,  the  target  cart  was  5% 
slower than the predicted value, while the incident cart was 11% slower, again indicating that the 
collision was not quite elastic. 

Part Three: Modeling the Elastic Collision 

Question 3: The repulsive force between the two carts is modeled by the force law  

F Ae− x l

where  x  is the separation between the carts and  l  is a characteristic length associated with the 
collision. If the carts start very far apart (an infinite distance), the work required to bring them to 
a separation distance  d  is

Calculate this integral.  The result is the equivalent of the potential energy stored in a spring 
(1 / 2)kx 2   that satisfies a linear restoring force law. 

Solution: The change in potential energy in bringing the carts from an infinite distance apart to a 
distance d apart is the negative of the work done by the repulsive magnetic force

Question 4: Suppose there are two of these carts on a track, one cart with mass  m  and speed 
vA,1  runs into the other, which has equal mass and is initially at rest. Find the minimum 
separation  d  between the carts during the collision. You may assume that  A  is sufficiently large

Problem 4: (Ballistic Pendulum) 

A  simple  way  to  measure  the  speed  of  a  bullet  is  with  a  ballistic  pendulum.  This  consists  of  a 
wooden  block  of mass  m1 into which  a  bullet  of mass  m2   is  shot. The  block  is  suspended  from 
two cables, each of  length  L .  The  impact of  the bullet causes  the block and embedded bullet  to 
swing through a maximum angle ϕ. The initial speed of the bullet is  v0 . 

a)	 How fast  is  the block and embedded bullet moving  immediately after  the bullet comes  to 
rest in the block? Assume that the time the bullet takes to come to rest is negligibly small. 
Express  your  answer  in  terms  of  the  quantities  m1 ,  m2 ,  L ,  g ,  v0 ,  and ϕ. You may  not 
need all these quantities. 

b)  Find a relation for the initial speed of the bullet as a function of  m1 ,  m2 ,  L ,  g , and ϕ.
