Fall Term 2004 

Problem 1 A car is driving at a constant but unknown velocity,  v0 , on a straightaway. 
A  motorcycle  is  a  distance  d   behind  the  car.  Initially,  they  are  both  traveling  at  the 
same  velocity.  The  motorcycle  starts  to  pass  the  car  by  speeding  up  at  a  constant 
acceleration  a  .  When  the motorcyclist  is  side  by  side with  the  car,  the motorcycle 
m
stops accelerating and  is  traveling at  twice  the velocity of  the car. How  long does  the 
motorcycle accelerate? What was  the  initial velocity of  the car and motorcycle? How 
far did the motorcycle travel while accelerating? Express all your answers in terms of 
the given quantities in the problem. 

I. 

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 

We  assume  you’ve  recognized  the  problem  is  in  the  domain  of  kinematics  – 
the quantitative description of motion.  What is the problem asking?  What are 
the  given  conditions  and  assumptions?  What  is  to  be  found  and  how  is  this 
determined or constrained by the given conditions? 

In  particular:  how  many  objects  are  there,  is  the  motion  in  1,  2,  or  3 
dimensions,  is  the motion  relative  or  is  there  some  logical  absolute  reference 
frame?    Qualitatively  describe  the  motion  (in  each  coordinate  and  of  each 
body if there are several). 

Model: Look for the three most common model motions – either the velocity 
or  the  acceleration  is  constant  or  the  motion  is  uniform  circular.    Often  these 
apply  only  to  part  of  the  time  (or  to  only  one  body)  –  i.e.  might  the 
acceleration  be  constant  but  different  before  and  after  the  rocket  engine  stops 
or between the two racing cars?  Is the motion an example of uniform circular 
motion. 

Advice:  Write  your  own  representation  of  the  problem’s  stated  data:  draw  a 
motion diagram (strobe picture), a graph of position or velocity or acceleration 
vs.  time,  or  a  diagram.    Make  a  table  of  these  quantities  vs.  time  if  it’s 
numerical.    What  are  the  initial  conditions  and  how  do  you  represent 
conditions  mathematically  (e.g.  until  car  A  passes  car  B).    A  great  many 
problems  will  involve  special  motion,  perhaps  in  one  or  another  coordinate: 
constant  velocity,  constant  acceleration,  uniform  circular  motion,  relative 
motion – learn to recognize these motions.  Get the problem into your brain!   

Question:  Describe  the  strategy  you  have  chosen  for  solving  this  problem. 
You  may  want  to  consider  the  following  issues.  What  does  a  sketch  of  the 

1 

problem  look  like?  What  type  of  coordinate  system  will  you  choose?  What 
information  can  you  deduce  from  a  plot  of  distance  vs.  time  for  both  the  car 
and  the  motorcycle?  What  conditions  must  be  satisfied  when  the  person  just 
catches up to the streetcar? 

Answer:  Note:  Your  answer  should  include  a  sketch  and  coordinate  system  for  the 
system  where  you  clearly  indicated  your  choice  of  origin,  positive  directions  and 
reference  frame;  a  single  graph  showing  qualitatively  the  position  of  the  motorcycle 
and the driver as a function of time. 

Modeling the problem: 

This is a two body problem with each body undergoing one dimensional motion.  

First  I  sketch  the  problem  and  introduce  a  Cartesian  coordinate. My  first  question  is 
where  should  I  choose  my  origin.  I  will  choose  t = 0   to  depict  the  moment  the 
motorcycle is at the origin and the car is at a positive distance  d . At an arbitrary time, 
I  introduce  the  position  functions  x 1 ( )    for  the  motorcycle  and  x 2 ( )    for  the  car.  I 
t
t
denote the time the car overtakes the motorcycle as  t f  . 

Figure 1: Coordinate System 

I  am  specifically  interested  in  the  time  period  that  the motorcycle  is  accelerating  at  a 
constant  rate while  the  car  is moving with  a  uniform  velocity. This means  that  I will 
need  two sets of kinematic equations for position and velocity for  the motorcycle and 
car  noting  that  the  acceleration  of  the  car  is  zero,  a  = 0 .  I  can  relate  these  sets  of 
c
equations  by  two  extra  conditions  that  are  stated  in  the  problem.  At  the  moment  the 
motorcycle  overtakes  the  car,  the  positions  are  equal  and  the  motorcycle  velocity  is 
twice the car. (figure 2).

The key is to translate all this information into specific equations.

Devise  a  Plan  -  set  up  a  procedure  to  obtain  the  desired 
solution 

General  - Have  you  seen  a  problem  like  this  –  i.e.  does  the  problem  fit  in  a 
schema  you  already  know?    Is  a  part  of  the  problem  a  known  schema;  could 
you  simplify  this problem  so  that  it  is?  Can you  find any useful  results  from 
the  given  initial  conditions  and  other  data  even  if  it  is  not  the  solution?    Can 
you  imagine  a  route  to  the  solution  if  only  you  know  some  apparently  not 
given  information?    Count  the  unknowns  and  check  that  you  have  that  many 
independent equations. 

In  particular:    choose  the  best  type  of  coordinate  system  to  simplify  the 
problem,  pick  the  orientation  and  location  of  the  origin  of  the  coordinate 
system in accord with the initial conditions.  Warning: almost always it is best 
to  pick  positive  to  the  right  or  up  and  represent  downwards  acceleration,  for 
example,  as  –g.    Given  that  the  problem  involves  some  particular  type  of 
motion  (constant  acceleration,  circular  motion)  think  over  all  the  equations 
that involve this concept. 

Question: Devise a plan for solving for: how  long does  the motorcycle accelerate?; what 
was  the  initial  velocity  of  the  car  and  motorcycle?;  how  far  did  the  motorcycle  travel 
while accelerating? 

Answer:  

I  can  write  down  the  kinematic  equations  for  the  motorcycle,  with  the  initial  position 
corresponding to my choice of origin,  x1,0  = 0 ; the initial velocity, the unknown  v1,0  = v0 ; 
and the acceleration of the motorcycle  a1  = a  ; then

The  initial position of  the  car  is  x2 ,0   = d ;  the  initial velocity of  the  car  is  the  same  as  the 
motorcycle  v2 ,0   = v0  ; and  the acceleration of  the car  is  a  = 0 ; so  the kinematic equations 
2 
for position and velocity of the car are 

x ( t ) = d + v t

0 

.

 

Note that the velocity of the car is constant,  

vx ,2 ( )  = v0 .
t 

At the overlap time,  t  , I can now state the two extra conditions mathematically. The first 
f 
is that the position of the car and the motorcycle are equal, 
x ( t  ) = x
t f ) .

This becomes, using our kinematic equations for position, 

1 a t  2  = d + v t f  .
v t f  + 
2  m f

I notice an immediately simplification, so I rewrite this condition as 

1 a t 2  = d 
2  m f

My  second  condition  at  the  overtake  time  is  that  the  velocity  of  the motorcycle  is  twice 
the velocity of the car, 

v

x ,1 (

 = 2v .0 

This equation becomes using the equation for the velocity of the motorcycle 

This equation simplifies to

 = 2v0 .

Summary: I now collect my two equations, 

1 a t 2  = d 
2  m f

m f = v0 .
a t  

I  now  see  that  I  have  two  equations  and  two  unknowns,  the  time  of  overlap,  t
,  and  the
f 
unknown  initial  velocity,  v .  Although  the  distance  and  acceleration  are  not  given 
0
specific  values  they  are  specified  as  given  constants  hence  I  will  treat  the  representing 
symbols  as  known  quantities.  Two  independent  equations  with  two  unknowns  are 
solvable.  So  I  just  need  to  decide  which  quantity  I  will  solve  for  first.  Since  the  first 
question  asks  how  long  does  the  motorcycle  accelerate;  I  will  solve  for  the  time  of 
overlap,  t
.  Then  I  will  solve  for  the  unknown  velocity,  and  finally  for  the  distance  the 
f 
motorcycle travels using

III. Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 

This  generally  involves  mathematical  manipulations.    Try  to  keep  them  as 
simple  as  possible  by  not  substituting  in  lengthy  algebraic  expressions  until 
the  end  is  in  sight,  make  your  work  as  neat  as  you  can  to  ease  checking  and 
reduce careless mistakes.   Keep a clear  idea of where you are going and have 
been  (label  the  equations  and  what  you  have  now  found),  if  possible,  check 
each step as you proceed.   

Solution: From the first equation, time of overlap,  t

, is

IV. Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 

5 

Can you  see  that  the answer  is correct now  that you have  it – often  simply by 
retrospective  inspection?    Can  you  solve  it  a  different  way?  Is  the  problem 
equivalent  to  one  you’ve  solved  before  if  the  variables  have  some  specific 
values?  

In  particular:  Check  dimensions  if  analytic,  units  if  numerical.    Check 
special  cases  (i.e.  if  a  =  0  does  the  solution  simplify?),  check  that  a  general 
expressions reproduce the given initial conditions.  Does it depend sensibly on 
the  various  quantities  (e.g.  is  the  time  greater  if  the  initial  velocity  is  less?)? 
Is  the  scaling  what  you’d  expect  (time  decreases  with  the  square  root  of  the 
acceleration, distance at some later time proportional to initial velocity)? Is the 
answer  physically  reasonable  (especially  if  numbers  are  given  or  reasonable 
ones substituted). 

Review  the  schema  of  the  problem  –  what  is  the  model,  the  physical 
approximations, the concepts needed, and any tricky math manipulation. 

Question:  Choose  what  you  think  are  reasonable  values  for  the  distance  d ,  and 
the  constant  acceleration  a .  What  values  do  you  then  calculate  for  how  long  the 
m
motorcycle  accelerates?;  what  is  the  initial  velocity  of  the  car  and  motorcycle;  and 
how  far does  the motorcycle  traveled while accelerating? Do your values make sense 
to you? 

Answer:  

Units:  My  equation  for  the  time  it  took  to  overtake  the  car  is  t f  =  2 /d a
 
.  The  units
m 
(dimensions)  of  time  are  seconds,  [dim t ] =  m / m  s -2  = s ,  and  velocity,  v0  =  2da ,
⋅
f 
m 
has  unit  (dimensions)    [dim v ] =  (m)(m  s -2 )  = m  s  .  Both  quantities  have  the  correct 
-1 
⋅ 
⋅ 
0 
units. 

Values:  Suppose  the  car  is  moving  at  v0 = 20 m  s  ,  and  is  a  distance  d =10 m ahead  of 
-1
⋅
the motorcycle.  Then  the  acceleration  of  the motorcycle  can  be  found  from  the  equation 
v0  =  2da  yielding

or  twice  the  gravitational  acceleration.  Note  the  final  velocity  of  the  motorcycle  is 
v (t  )= 40 m  s -1 . It’s really moving along!

The time it takes to overtake the car is then

This  is  not  an  unreasonable  number  for  the  time.  Notice  that  a  double  negative  is 
appropriate  here  because when we  do  these  types  of  calculations,  the  best we  can  say  is 
that our result does not contradict our experience. 

Different Approaches to solving the Problem: I found that my two conditions for when 
the motorcycle overtakes the car simplifies to 

1 a t 2  = d 
2  m f

m f = v0 .
a t  

These  equations  look  suggestive,  so  can  I  find  a  nice  physical  reason  for  this  equation? 
Suppose  I move with  the car. Then  the car has zero velocity and  the motorcycle has zero 
initial velocity, v = 0 , but the acceleration of the motorcycle relative to the car is still the 
0 
same.  So in this reference frame, the position of the motorcycle is 

and the velocity is  

1 ( ) = 
x′  t 

1 a t
m2 

2 

 

v

′ x ,1 ( )  = a t
t
.m 

 

The velocity of the motorcycle at  t f  is 

Thus the velocity equation is just 

v

t f 
′ x ,1 (

)

 = v0 

v0 

= a t
m 

.

 

So  the  reason  the  two  conditions  have  such  a  simple  form  is  that  they  are  the  result  of 
solving the problem in a reference frame moving with the car.
