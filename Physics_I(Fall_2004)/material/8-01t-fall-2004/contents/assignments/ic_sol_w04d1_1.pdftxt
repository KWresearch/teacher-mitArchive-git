In-Class-Problem 11: Whirling Objects 

Two objects of equal mass  m  are whirling around a shaft with a constant angular 
velocity ω. The first object is a distance  d  from the central axis, and the second object is 
a distance  2d  from the axis. You may assume the strings are massless and inextensible. 
You may ignore the effect of gravity. Find the tensions in the two strings.  

As you begin this problem, consider what types of force diagrams you may need. In 
particular what body or system of bodies will use for your free body diagram. It never 
hurts to draw as many free body diagrams as you can. 

Solution: 

Free Body Diagrams: force diagrams for each object.

We can now solve for the tension in the string between the inner object and the outer 
object. From the force equation for outer object, the tension in the string between the 
inner object and the outer object is

The tension in the string between the shaft and the inner object can be found by using the 
result from part b) in the force equation for the inner object yielding,

In-Class Problem 12: Object undergoing Circular Motion on the Inside 
of a Cone 

Consider an object of mass  m  that moves in a circular orbit with constant velocity  v0
along the inside of a cone. Assume the wall of the cone is frictionless. The cone makes an 
angle φ with respect to a vertical axis.  

a) Find the radius of the orbit of the object in terms of the given information. 

In the Look Back – check your solution and method of solution part of our methodology 
answer the following questions. 

b)	 Is the normal force a centripetal force or is a compopnent of the normal force the 
centripetal force in this problem? 

c)	

Is the radius of the circular orbit independent of the mass of the object? Explain why 
or why not.

Choose cylindrical coordinates as shown in the above figure. Choose the unit vector  rˆ  to 
point  in  the  radial  outward  direction.  Since  we  are  now  working  in  three  dimensions, 
choose  the  unit  vector  kˆ   to  point  upwards.  (Note  that  the  unit  vector  θˆ   is  now 
automatically  defined  to  point  into  the  page.  Since  there  are  no  forces  in  this  direction, 
we need not worry about it while solving the problem.) 

The  force  diagram  on  the  object  is  shown  in  the  figure  above.  The  two  forces  acting  on 
the object are  the normal force of  the wall on  the object and the gravitational force. Then 
Newton’s Second Law becomes:

F = ma v 

becomes: 

These equations become

b) The centripetal force in this problem is the vector component of the contact force that  
points radially inwards,  Fcent  = N  cos φ.

c) The radius is independent of the mass because the component of the normal force in 
the vertical direction must balance the gravitational force so the normal force is 
proportional to the mass. Therefore the radially inward component of the normal force is 
also proportional to mass. Since this force is causing the object to accelerate inward, by 
Newton’s Second Law, the mass will cancel and the acceleration is independent of the 
mass. Therefore the radius is also independent of the mass.

In-Class Problem 13: Car on a Banked turn 

A  car  of  mass  m   is  going  around  a  circular  turn  of  radius  R   with  constant  speed v   , 
which is banked at an angle φ with respect to the ground.  The car is held up on the bank 
by  static  friction  between  the wheels  and  the  road with  a  coefficient  of  static  friction µ .s
Let  g   be  the magnitude  of  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity.  Derive  an  expression  for  the 
minimum velocity necessary to keep the car moving in a circle without slipping down the 
embanked turn. Express your answer in terms of the given quantities. 

Car on banked turn undergoing circular motion  

Solution 

As  you  try  to  Understand  –  get  a  conceptual  grasp  of  the  problem  consider  the 
following  question.  There  are  all  types  of  resistive  forces  acting  on  the  car  along  the 
direction  of  motion  of  the  car;  for  example:  air  friction  and  rolling  resistance.  Do  you 
need to know these in order to model this problem? Explain your reasoning. 

Choose  cylindrical  coordinates.  Choose  unit  vectors  rˆ   pointing  in  the  radial  outward 
direction  and  kˆ   pointing  upwards  (figure  6.2.5).  (Once  again,  the  unit  vector  θˆ   is 
implicitly defined.) The force diagram on  the car  is shown  in figure 6.2.5 when  the car  is 
just about to slide down the embanked turn.

When  v min  < < v v 
0 , the car would slide down the banked turn if static friction did not

hold it up.  v v

Newton’s Second law,  F = ma v , becomes (in the radial and vertical directions) 

mv 
rˆ : − N  sinφ+ f static  cosφ= −
r 
Nkˆ  :
cosφ+ f static  sinφ− mg  = maz

When  v
vmin  , the ‘just slipping’ condition is that the acceleration in the z-direction is 
=
zero, and the static friction has its maximum value: 

a  = 0  and  f static   = µN

so the force equations become
