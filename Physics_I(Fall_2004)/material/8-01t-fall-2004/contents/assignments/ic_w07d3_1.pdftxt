Both  these  problems  today  are  hard. We  would  like  you  to  concentrate 
your discussions on  the physics  ideas  that enable you  to set-up and plan 
a  strategy  for  solving  these problems. We may  interrupt  the discussions 
to discuss the problems.

Problem 22:  Journey to the Center of the Earth 

Imagine that one drilled a hole with smooth sides straight through the center of the earth.  
If the air is removed from this tube (and it doesn’t fill up with water, liquid rock, or iron 
from the core) an object dropped into one end will have enough energy to just exit the 
other end after an interval of time. Your goal is to find that interval of time.  

a)  The gravitational force on an object of mass m, located inside the earth a distance 
r < Re, from the center (Re is the radius of the earth), is due only to the mass of 
the earth that lies within a solid sphere of radius r.  What is the gravitational force 
as a function of the distance r from the center?  Express your answer in terms of g 
and Re . Note: you do not need the mass of the earth to answer this question. You 
only need to assume that the earth is of uniform density. 

b)  Using the concept of force explain how the object-earth system for objects inside 
the earth is analogous to an object-spring system. 

c)  What is the potential energy inside the earth as a function of r for the object-earth 
system? Can you think of a natural point to choose a zero point for the potential 
energy? Find out how long this journey will take. 

d)	 How does this time compare to a satellite in low earth orbit (i.e. orbits just above 
the surface of the earth)?  

e)	

In order to shorten the travel time, the sender travels down the hole a distance 
until she is only a fraction of the radius of the earth, β Re,  (Re is the radius of the 
earth) from the center.  The recipient travels down a similar distance from the far 
end in order to catch the object.  By how much if any is the travel time thereby 
reduced (as a function of β)?

Problem 23: Beads Sliding along a Ring 

A ring of mass m1 hangs from a thread, and two identical beads of mass m2 slide on it 
without  friction. The beads  are  released  simultaneously  from  the  top of  the  ring  from 
rest  (actually  they  need  a  very  small  initial  speed  but  this  can  be  ignored)  and  slide 
down  opposite  sides.  Assume  m2  >  (3/2)  m1.  Then  ring  will  start  to  rise  when  the 
beads reach a critical angle θc with respect to the vertical.  

a)  Draw  free  body  force  diagrams  for  the  ring  and  the  beads. What  direction  is  the 
force  of  the  bead  on  the  ring  pointing?  Does  it  change  as  the  bead  moves?  Can 
you still proceed with an analysis using Newton’s Second Law if you are not sure 
which  way  this  force  points?  Try  to  find  a  physical  explanation  for  the  direction 
of this force. What is the condition that the ring just starts to rise? 

b)	 Does  the mechanical energy change between when  the beads are  released and  the 
ring  just  starts  to  rise? Write  down  an  equation  that  describes  the  changes  in  the 
mechanical energy.  

c) 	 This  is hard! Can you  show  that  the  ring will  start  to  rise  if m2 >  (3/2) m1?  Find 
the angle θc with respect to the vertical direction that this occurs.
