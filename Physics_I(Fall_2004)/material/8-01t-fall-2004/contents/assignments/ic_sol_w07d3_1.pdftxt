Problem 22:  Journey to the Center of the Earth 

Imagine that one drilled a hole with smooth sides straight through the center of the earth.  
If the air is removed from this tube (and it doesn’t fill up with water, liquid rock, or iron 
from the core) an object dropped into one end will have enough energy to just exit the 
other end after an interval of time. Your goal is to find that interval of time.  

a)  The gravitational force on an object of mass m, located inside the earth a distance 
r < Re, from the center (Re is the radius of the earth), is due only to the mass of 
the earth that lies within a solid sphere of radius r.  What is the gravitational force 
as a function of the distance r from the center?  Express your answer in terms of g 
and Re . Note: you do not need the mass of the earth to answer this question. You 
only need to assume that the earth is of uniform density. 

Answer: 

Choose a radial coordinate with unit vector  rˆ  pointing outwards. The gravitational force 
on an object of mass  m  at the surface of the earth is given by two expressions  

v 
F 
grav

Therefore we can solve for the gravitational constant acceleration

When the object is a distance  r  from the center of the earth, the mass of the earth that 
lies outside the sphere of radius  r  does not contribute to the gravitational force. The only 
contribution to the gravitational force is due to the mass enclosed in the sphere of radius 
r  ,

Since the mass density is given by

b)  Using the concept of force explain how the object-earth system for objects inside 
the earth is analogous to an object-spring system. 

Answer: The minus sign indicates that the force is always directed towards the center of 
the earth (restoring force) and proportional tot eh distance from the center of the earth. 
This is analogous to the restoring force of a spring, 
v 
Fspring   = −kxxˆ , 

2 

 
 
 
where the ‘spring constant’ for gravitation is given by  

k 

grav  

=

mg  .
Re 

This means that the object will undergo simple harmonic motion just like a spring.  

c)	 What is the potential energy inside the earth as a function of r for the object-earth 
system? Can you think of a natural point to choose a zero point for the potential 
energy? Find out how long this journey will take. 

Answer: We can define a potential energy for gravitation inside the earth that is 
analogous to the spring potential energy function with zero point for potential energy 
chosen at the center of the earth and

If we release the object from rest at the surface of the earth , the initial mechanical energy 
is all potential energy and is given by

When the object reaches the center of the earth, the mechanical energy is all kinetic 
energy, 

E f  = K f  =

Since there are no external work acting on the system, the mechanical energy is constant  

and

there is no well defined direction when the object is located at the origin.

From Newton’s Second Law,  F = ma v , in the radial direction becomes

e) In order to shorten the travel time, the sender travels down the hole a distance until she 
is only a fraction of the radius of the earth, β Re,  (Re is the radius of the earth) from the 
center.  The recipient travels down a similar distance from the far end in order to catch 
the object.  By how much if any is the travel time thereby reduced (as a function of β) ? 

Answer: If the object starts closer to the earth the period is still the same because we 
have only changed the initial conditions we have not changes the ‘spring constant’ of 
gravitation.

Problem 23: Beads Sliding along a Ring 

A ring of mass m1 hangs from a thread, and two identical beads of mass m2 slide on it 
without  friction. The beads  are  released  simultaneously  from  the  top of  the  ring  from 
rest  (actually  they  need  a  very  small  initial  speed  but  this  can  be  ignored)  and  slide 
down opposite sides. Assume m2 > (3/2) m1. The ring will start to rise when the beads 
reach a critical angle θc with respect to the vertical.  

a)  Draw  free  body  force  diagrams  for  the  ring  and  the  beads. What  direction  is  the 
force  of  the  bead  on  the  ring  pointing?  Does  it  change  as  the  bead  moves?  Can 
you still proceed with an analysis using Newton’s Second Law if you are not sure 
which  way  this  force  points?  Try  to  find  a  physical  explanation  for  the  direction 
of this force. What is the condition that the ring just starts to rise? 

b)	 Does  the mechanical energy change between when  the beads are  released and  the 
ring  just  starts  to  rise? Write  down  an  equation  that  describes  the  changes  in  the 
mechanical energy.  

c)	 This  is hard! Can you  show  that  the  ring will  start  to  rise  if m2 >  (3/2) m1?  Find 
the angle θc with respect to the vertical direction that this occurs.
