Problem 1 (measurement of g) 

The  acceleration  of  gravity  can  be  measured  by  projecting  a  body  upward  and  measuring  the 
time  that  it  takes  to  pass  two  given  points  in  both  directions.  Suppose  a  friend  throw  a  ball 
straight up outside your window. You measure the distance  h  from the bottom of the lower pane 
of glass to the top of the upper pane of glass. You measure the time interval  T the body takes to
A
cross first rise past  the bottom of  the  lower pane of glass and  then drop past  the same  line on  the 
way down. You also measure the time interval  T  the body takes to disappear past the top of the 
B
upper  pane  of  glass  and  then  reappear  past  the  same  line  on  the  way  down.  Assume  that  the 
acceleration  is  constant,  (negligible  air  resistance),  the  problem  is  to  find  an  expression  for  the 
acceleration of the body in terms of the measured quantities.   

a)  Describe  the  strategy  you  have  chosen  for  solving  this  problem.  You  may  want  to 
consider  the  following  issues.  Where  do  your  measured  quantities  appear  on  a  plot  of 
height vs.  time? What  type of coordinate system will you choose? Where  is a good place 
to choose your origin? 

b)  Find an expression for the acceleration of the body in terms of the measured quantities. 

Problem 2 One dimensional kinematics: track event 

During a track event two runners, Bob, and Jim, round the last turn and head into the final stretch 
with Bob  2.0 m in front of Jim. They are both running with the same velocity  8.0 m s −1  . When 
− 
the finish line is  4.8 ×101 m  away from Jim, Jim accelerates at 1.0 m s
 until he catches up to 
−2
−
Bob. Jim then continues at a constant speed until he reaches the finish line.  

a)  Describe the strategy you have chosen for solving this problem 

b)  How long did it take Jim to catch Bob? 

c)  How far did Jim still have to run when he just caught up to Bob? 

d)  How long did Jim take to reach the finish line after he just caught up to Bob? 

Bob starts to accelerate when Jim just catches up to him, and accelerates all the way to the finish 
line and crosses the line exactly when Jim does. Assume Bob’s acceleration is constant. 

e)  What is Bob’s acceleration? 

f)  What is Bob’s velocity at the finish line? Who is running faster? 

Problem 3: 

(projectile motion, softball) 

A softball is hit over a third baseman’s head. The third baseman, as soon as it is hit, turns around 
and runs straight back with an average velocity of   v1  = 7.0m  s -1   for a time interval  ∆ = 2.0s 
t
⋅	
and catches the ball at the same height it left the bat. The third baseman was initially 
d1  = 1.8 ×10  m  from home plate.

a)  Describe  the  strategy  you  have  chosen  for  solving  this  problem.  You  may  want  to 
consider the following issues. What type of coordinate system will you choose? Where is 
a good place to choose your origin? 

b)	 What was the initial speed and angle of the softball when it left the bat?  

c)	 Write down a vector expressions for  the position and velocity of  the softball  0.1 s  before 
the ball was caught? 

Problem 4:  (Experiment 3 Modeling Forces Three Pre-Lab Question) 

In  your  Experiment  3:  Modeling  Forces,  you  will  measure  the  magnitude  of  the  force 
between small magnets as a function of the distance  x  between the centers of the magnets.  
r

a)  Suppose  the  magnitude  of  the  force  decreases  exponentially  according  to    F  = ae
where  a  and  b  are constants. Suppose you plot the natural logarithm of the magnitude of 
r 
F 
,  vs.  the  distance  x   between  the  centers  of  the  magnets.  What 
the  force, 
ln 
information can you deduce from the slope of this plot?

F


b)  Suppose for some range of separation of  the magnets,  the magnitude of  the force obeys a 
r
power  law,  F 
=

and  d   are  constants.  Describe  a  graphical  procedure

where 
d
which we enable you to determine the power law constant  d . 

Problem 5: Experiment 2 Projectile Motion Data Analysis 

a) Did your group perform the Falling Ball Experiment or the Projected Ball Experiment? 

Part A: Measurement of Exit Velocity 

1)  For  either  the  falling  or  projected  ball  experiment,  measure  the  angle  of  the  tube.  Make  a  

measurement of the height of the exit point of the tube above the ground.  


Angle = ________,  Uncertainty  = _________.  


Height  = _________, Uncertainty  = _________.  


What are the uncertainties in these measurements?

2)  Run  three  trials  of  the  ball  undergoing  projectile  motion  at  the  same  angle.  For  each  trial, 
measure  the  horizontal  displacement  between  the  point  where  the  ball  hits  the  ground  and  the 
exit point of the tube.  

3) Use the results of your three measurements, height above ground, horizontal distance to 
impact, and angle, to calculate the magnitude of the exit velocity of the ball. What are the errors 
in these measurements? You may use as a measure of your error the average deviation of your 
measurements. See Class Notes: Error Analysis. 

4) When  the  ball  exits  the  tube  it  crosses  the  photogate.  Based  on  your  calculation  for  the  exit 
velocity, what  is  the  time  interval ∆T   the ball  takes  to  travel a distance  D = 12 mm   (equal  to  the 
diameter of the ball)?  

5) When  the ball  crosses  the photogate,  the photogate  circuitry  records  the voltage  as  a  function 
of  time  which  you  can  graph  with  the  Data  Studio  software.  From  the  graph,  record  the  pulse 

width  (corresponding  to  the  time  interval  it  takes  the  ball  to  cross  the  photogate)  at  half  the 
maximum voltage height.  

What are the errors in these measurements? You may use as a measure of your error the average 
deviation of your measurements. See Class Notes: Error Analysis. 

6) How does the time interval that you calculated in part 4), compare to the average time interval 
you measured  in  part  5)?  Briefly  explain  the  physical  basis  for  any  discrepancies  between  your 
calculations and measurements. 

7) Let  D = 12 mm   is  the diameter of  the ball and  ∆T   is  the  time  interval  that  the ball  travels  its 
diameter  when  it  exits  the  tube.  Based  on  your  measurements  in  part  5),  calculate  the  average 
 T
 
exit velocity,  vexit  = D
/ ∆
. 

8) Compare your result in part 7) to the calculation of the exit velocity based on measurements of 
height  above  ground,  horizontal  distance  to  impact,  and  angle  in  part  3).  How  do  your  results 
compare? 

9) What is the major source of error in this experiment?  

Part B: Measurement of the Gravitational Constant  

10) If you only made one experiment (three trials) you can use your three measurements above 
but now only use your photogate calculation for the exit velocity. Enter your data in the table 
below. If you repeated the experiment (three trials) at a different angle, use your second set of 
data with your photogate calculation for the  exit velocity.

estimate for the fractional error  ∆g g  for your measurement of the gravitational constant?
