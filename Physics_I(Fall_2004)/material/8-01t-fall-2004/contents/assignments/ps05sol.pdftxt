Problem 1: (Second Law Applications: synchronous satellite) 

A synchronous satellite goes around the earth once every 24 h, so that its position appears 
stationary  with  respect  to  a  ground  station  The  mass  of  the  earth  is  m  = 5.98 ×1024  kg

2  . Your goal  is  to find  the radius of  the orbit of a synchronous 
2
satellite that circles the earth. 

 

a)	 Describe  what  motion  models  this  problem.  Write  down  a  vector  description  of 
the  acceleration.  Clearly  indicate  your  choice  of  unit  vectors  and  your  reasoning 
for choosing them. 

b)	 What  is  the  radius  of  the  orbit  of  a  synchronous  satellite  that  circles  the  earth? 
Approximately how many earth radii is this distance?  

Answer: 

Problem 2: (Circular motion: banked turn) 

A car of mass  m  is going around a circular turn of radius  R  which is banked at an angle 
θ with  respect  to  the ground. Assume  there  is  a  coefficient of  static  friction  µ  between
s
the wheels  and  the  road. Let  g  be  the magnitude of  the  acceleration due  to gravity. You 
may neglect kinetic friction. In each part below show your force diagrams.  

a)	 Describe the motion of the car if the car is traveling very slowly or extremely fast. 
Is  it  possible  for  the  car  to  travel  at  speeds  such  that  it  can  undergo  circular 
motion?    If  so,  what  coordinate  system  best  suits  this  problem.  In  particular, 
describe the acceleration vector in terms of your coordinate system unit vectors. 

b)	 Derive an expression  for  the minimum velocity necessary  to keep  the car moving 
in  a  circle  without  slipping  down  the  embanked  turn.  Express  your  answer  in 
terms of the given quantities. 

c)	 Derive an expression for  the maximum velocity necessary to keep  the car moving 
in  a  circle  without  slipping  up  the  embanked  turn.  Express  your  answer  in  terms 
of the given quantities. 

d)	 Derive an expression for  the velocity necessary  to keep  the car moving  in a circle 
without  slipping  up  or  down  the  embanked  turn  such  that  the  static  friction  force 
vanishes. Express your answer in terms of the given quantities.

Problem 3: Experiment 5 Static Equilibrium Analysis 

Part a) Suppose a rope of mass  m = 0.1kg  is connected at the same height to two walls 
and is allowed to hang under its own weight. At the contact point between the rope and 
the wall, the rope makes an angle θ= 100  with respect to the horizontal. The object is to 
find the tension in the rope at the end and at the middle of the rope.In order to find the 
tension in the rope at the end and at the middle of the rope, you will need to think 
cleverly what to include as the system in your free body diagrams. Describe  

a)	 What choice did you make for the system for you free body force diagram. Show 
all the forces acting on the diagram. What is the tension at the ends of the rope 
where it is connected to the walls? 

b)  What choice did you make for the system for you free body force diagram. Show 
all the forces acting on the diagram. What is the tension in the rope at a point 
midway between the walls? 

Answer: 

Part b) A device  called  a  capstan  is used  aboard  ships  in order  to control a  rope which  is 
under  great  tension.  The  rope  is  wrapped  around  a  fixed  drum,  usually  for  several  turns 
(the  drawing  below  shows  about  three  fourths  turn  as  seen  from  overhead).  The  load  on 
the  rope  pulls  it  with  a  force  T  ,  and  the  sailor  holds  it  with  a  much  smaller  force  TB .

angle  subtended by  the  rope on  the drum? Here’s a hint: choose a  small mass element of 
arc  length  R∆θ.  Carefully  indicate  the  forces  acting  on  this  section  of  the  rope.  Is  the 
tension constant in this section?

Problem 4: Static Equilibrium The Knee 

A man of mass  m = 70 kg
 
  is  about  to  start  a  race. Assume  the  runner’s weight  is  equally 
distributed  on  both  legs.  The  patellar  ligament  in  the  knee  is  attached  to  the  upper  tibia  

r 
T ,  that  the  ligament 
and  runs  over  the  kneecap. When  the  knee  is  bent,  a  tensile  force,  

exerts on the upper tibia,  is directed at an angle of θ= 400  with respect  to  the horizontal.

The  femur  exerts  a  force

connected  a  distance,  d  = 3.8 cm
 
,  directly  below  the  contact  point  of  the  femur  on  the 
tibia.  The  contact  point  between  the  foot  and  the  ground  is  a  distance  s = 3.6  101 cm
× 
from  the  vertical  line  passing  through  contact point  of  the  femur  on  the  tibia. The  center 
of  mass  of  the  lower  leg  lies  a  distance  x = 1.8  101 cm   from  this  same  vertical  line. 
×
Suppose the mass of the leg is a 1/5 of the mass of the body.  

 

a)  Explain the origin of the forces that are shown in the above force diagram. 


b)  What are the equations for static equilibrium of the forces? 


c)  About point will you choose to analyze the torques? What are the equations for 

static equilibrium of the torques? 
d)  Find the magnitude of the force  r 
T  of the patellar ligament on the tibia. 
e)  Find the direction α of the force of the femur  r 
F  on the tibia. 

Answer:  

Choose the unit vectors  ˆi  to point horizontally to the right  and  ˆj  vertically upwards. The 
two conditions for static equilibrium are 

(1) The sum of the forces acting on the rigid body is zero, 
r

(2) The vector sum of the torques about any point S in a rigid body is zero,

Since the weight is evenly distributed on the two feet, the normal force on one foot is 
equal to half the weight, or 

the second equation becomes

will make no contribution to the torque about this point  S . Choose counterclockwise c as
