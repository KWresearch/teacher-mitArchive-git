Hand in one solution per group.  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
II. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 
IV. 

Problem 22:  Escape Velocity and Mechanical Energy 

The asteroid Toro, discovered in 1964, has a radius of about  R = 5.0 km  and a mass of 
about  mt = 2.0 ×1015  kg . Let’s assume that Toro is a perfectly uniform sphere. What is the 
escape velocity for an object of mass  m  on the surface of Toro? Could a person reach 
this speed (on Earth) by running?

Problem 23: Circular Motion and Conservation of Mechanical Energy 

An object of mass  m  is released from rest at a height  h  above the surface of a table. The 
object slides along the inside of the loop-the-loop track consisting of a ramp and a 
circular loop of radius  R  shown in the figure. Assume that the track is frictionless. When 
the object is at the top of the track it pushes against the track with a force equal to three 
times it’s weight. What height was the object dropped from?
