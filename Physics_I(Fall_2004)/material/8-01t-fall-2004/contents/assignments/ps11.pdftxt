Note: The rotational dynamics for the two stages are given by 

RT −τf  = Iαup 

−τf  = Iαdown 

Note that αdown < 0 . 

The first two equations above imply that 

RT Iαdown  = Iαup  .

The force equation for the first stage is given by 

mg − T  = maup  . 

The linear acceleration and angular acceleration are constrained by 

a  = Rα  .

Combining these last two equations and solving for the tension yields

1.  Use the moments of inertia  I R  and  IW  along with ω  and ω  to calculate the angular

momentum before and after the collision and compare them.  

2.  Use the values you found for the friction torque τ  and δt  to estimate the angular 
f
impulse of τ  during the collision. Compare it to the angular momentum difference that 
f
you just calculated.

2.  Use the value you found for the friction torque τ  and δt  to estimate the angular impulse

3.  Use the value you found for the angular acceleration during the collision, α , to estimate 
c
the total torque τ  on the rotor during the collision.

4.  The  torque  τ   is  made  of  two  parts:  the  friction  torque  τf   from  the  bearings  and  the
c
torque τ  due exerted by  the washer you dropped on  the  rotor. By  the 3rd  law,  the  rotor 
RW
exerts  an  equal  and  opposite  torque  on  the washer.  Since  you  know τ  ,  subtract  it  from
f
τ  to find an estimate for τRW .
