Problem Set 4: Due Tues Oct 5 at 4:00 pm. 


Problem 1: (Relative Inertial Frames)


You  and  a  friend  are  in  an  elevator  that  is  rising  at  constant  but  unknown  velocity  v0 .  You  are 
curious  to  know what  speed  the  elevator  is moving. You  each  happen  to  be  carrying  altimeters. 
You  get  an  idea  and  drop  your  keys  from  a  height  h   above  the  floor  of  the  elevator.  You  hold 
one altimeter at the point where you dropped the keys and your friend places the other one on the 
floor.  You  check  your  altimeter  when  you  release  the  keys  and  find  the  keys  are  a  height  d 
above  sea  level. Your  friend  checks  the other  altimeter when  the keys hit  the  floor and  finds  the 
keys  are  the  same  height  d   above  sea  level.  Assume  that  the  gravitational  constant  is  g .  You 
will  analyze  this  problem  from  two  different  reference  frames.  The  first  reference  frame moves 
with the elevator. The second reference frame is fixed to the ground. 

a) 	 As seen  from a  reference  frame moving with elevator, how  long does  it  take  for  the keys 
to hit the floor?  

b) 	 As  seen  from  a  reference  frame  fixed  to  the  ground,  using  your  result  from  part  a),  find 
an expression for the speed of the elevator in terms of the height  h . 

c) 	 As  seen  from  a  reference  frame  fixed  to  the  ground,  what  maximum  height  above  sea 
level did the keys reach? 

Problem 2 Concept Question: (Hooke’s Law) 

2 

A  body  of mass  m   is  suspended  from  a  spring with  spring  constant  k   in  configuration  (a)  and 
the  spring  is  stretched  0.1m .  If  two  identical  bodies  of mass  m / 2    are  suspended  from  a  spring 
with  the same spring constant  k   in configuration (b), how much will  the spring stretch? Explain 
your answer. 

Problem 3: Free Body Diagrams 

Two teams, A and B, are competing in a tug-of-war. Team A is stronger, but neither team is 
moving because of friction.  

a)  Draw free-body diagrams for team A, for team B, and for the rope. 

b)

 Both the following statements are true; explain them. Two teams having a tug of war 
must always pull equally hard on one another. The team that pushes harder against the 
ground wins. 

Problem 4: Second Law and projectile motion 

An object with mass  m  = 2.0 kg
  slides down a  roof a distance 6.0 m on a  roof  that  is  inclined at 
an  angle  of  3.0 ×10  deg   to  the  horizontal.  The  roof  has  a  coefficient  of  kinetic  friction 
1
µ = 2.0  10  1 .  The  edge  of  the  bottom  of  the  roof  is  at  a  height  h  = 9.0 m  above  the  ground.
× −
k
What  is  the  horizontal  displacement  from  the  edge of  the  roof  to  the  point where  the  object  hits 
the ground?

Problem 5: (Experiment 4 Circular Motion Pre-Lab Question) 

Consider a spring with negligible mass that has an unstretched length  l0  = 8.8 ×10  m  .  A body 
−2
of mass,  m1  = 1.5 ×10−1 kg
, is suspended from one end of the spring. The other end of the spring 
is fixed.  After a series of oscillations has died down, the new stretched length of the spring is 
l  = 9.8 ×10−2 m  . 

part a) 	

parts b) - d) 

a)	 Assume that the spring satisfies Hooke’s Law when it is stretched. What is the spring 
constant? 

The  body  is  then  removed  and  one  end  of  the  spring  is  attached  to  the  central  axis  of  a  motor. 
The axis of the motor points along the vertical direction.  A small ball of mass, m  = 3.0 ×10−3 kg
,
n
is  then  attached  to  the  other  end  of  the  spring.  The  motor  rotates  at  a  constant  frequency, 
f  = 2.0 ×101  Hz  . 

b)  How long does it take the ball to complete one rotation? 

c)  What is the angular frequency of the ball in radians per sec? 

Neglect the gravitational force exerted on the ball. Assume that the ball and spring rotate in a 
horizontal plane. 

d)	 What is the radius of the circular motion of the ball? 

Problem 6: Experiment 3: Analysis 

Suppose the function 

with 

y A= 

9170 z
4z  + 500 z 2  + 5000 

z

= 

x

 + B

fits  the  force  law  you  measured  in  an  experiment  to  determine  the  force  between  two  magnets, 
where  y is  the  force  and  x  is  the  gap  between  the  magnets,  measured  in  mm.    The  parameters 
obtained  from  the  fit  are  A  =  0.60  N  and  B  =  3  mm.  Now  suppose  you  approximate  the  force 
with a different law 

y A e
= 
1

−Cx  = A e
1 

−C ( z  B  )
−

a)	 Find the parameters A1 and C so that this function will give the same force as the first one 
when z = 5 mm and z = 15 mm.  

b)  As you  saw  in  the notes  for Experiment 03, both of  these  functions  fit  the measurements 
equally  well  (in  the  sense  that  the  RMS  error  is  the  same  for  both)  when  the  force  was 
measured  over  the  approximate  range  5 ≤ z ≤ 20
  that  you  were  able  to  measure.  If  you 
 
were able  to measure  the  force out  to z = 30, do you  think  it would be possible  to decide 
which  of  the  two  functions  was  a  better  representation  of  the  force  law?  (Use  the 
parameters you have from above, and explain your answer.)
