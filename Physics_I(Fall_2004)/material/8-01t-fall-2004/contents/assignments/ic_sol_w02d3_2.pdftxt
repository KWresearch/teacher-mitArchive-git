In-Class Problems 2 and 3: Projectile Motion Solutions 

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
II. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 

For the first problem we have posed a series of questions for each of the above steps to 
help you learn how to use the problem solving strategy. We then leave space for your 
group to answer the question. You don’t need to answer all these questions but they 
should help you approach the problem. 

In the second problem, we invite you to try to solve it without help. If you would like 
some hints, we do pose a series of hints to consider. 

In-Class Problem 2: Throwing a Stone Down a Hill 

A person is standing on top of a hill which slopes downwards uniformly at an angle 
φ with respect to the horizontal. The person throws a stone at an initial angle θ0
from the horizontal with an initial speed of  v0 . You may neglect air resistance. How 
far below the top of the hill does the stone strike the ground?

I. Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 

How  would  you  model  the  horizontal  and  vertical  motions  of  the  stone?  Draw  a  graph 
and a coordinate system. Where did you choose your origin? What choices did you make 
for  positive  axes?  Do  your  choices  for  positive  directions  affect  the  signs  for  position, 
velocity,  or  acceleration?  In  terms  of  your  coordinate  system,  is  there  any  constraint 
condition  for  the  horizontal  and  vertical  position  of  the  stone  when  it  hits  the  ground  in 
terms of the specified quantities in the problem (be careful with signs)? 

Answer: 

The  problem  involves  constant  velocity  in  the  horizontally  direction  and  constant 
acceleration  a  in the vertical direction.  
y 

I  will  choose  a  Cartesian  coordinate  system  with  the  origin  at  the  point  the  stone  is 
thrown  with  vertical  upwards  positive  and  horizontal  to  the  right  as  positive.  Therefore 
a  = − g  . The key constraint condition is that the point where the stone strikes the hill has 
y 
y f  < 0  and  x f  > 0   Therefore  tan φ= y
x f 
for  φ< 0  or  tan φ= − y
x f 
for  φ> 0 .  I
/

will choose φ> 0 .

II. Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 

In  terms  of  your  choices  that  you made  in  your model,  what  equations  are  applicable  to 
this  problem?  Identify  the  different  symbols  that  appear  in  your  equation.  Are  they 
treated  as  knowns  or  unknowns?  Do  you  have  enough  equations  to  solve  the  problem? 
Identify the quantity that you would like to solve for and design a strategy to find it. 

Plan: I write down the horizontal and vertical equations for projectile motion

III. Carry our your plan – solve the problem!  

Be careful with signs!!!!! 

I am trying to solve for the final vertical position  y f  . I will solve the horizontal equation 
for  t f  yielding 

t f  = x f  /

v0

I will introduce the constrain condition

I will substitute this value for  t f   into the vertical equation

IV. Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 

Does your solution make sense? Check special cases: what do you expect for an answer if 
the  person  is  throwing  the  stone  on  level  ground,  or  throwing  the  stone  over  a  vertical 
cliff. Does your solution agree in these limits? 

Answer:  If  φ= 0   I  ned  to  be  careful  because  this  implies  that  tan φ= 0   so  I  cannot 
divide  by  tan φ= 0 .  Instead  I  need  to  note  that  y f  = 0 .  Then  the  equations  of  motion 
become 

x f  = v0  cos θt0  f 

0 = v0  sin

I can solve the second equation for  t f  ,

and then for  x f 

x f  = 2v0

The stone never hits the ground.

In-Class Problem 3: Hitting the Bucket 

A person is standing on a ladder holding a pail. The person releases the pail from rest at a 
height  h   above  the  ground. A  second  person  standing  a  horizontal  distance  s2   from  the 
1
pail  aims  and  throws  a  ball  the  instant  the  pail  is  released  in  order  to  hit  the  pail.  The 
person throws the ball at a height  h  above the ground, with an initial speed  v0 , and at an
2
angle θ  with respect to the horizontal. You may ignore air resistance.

Questions: 

a)  Find an expression for the angle θ  that the person aims the ball in order to hit the 
0
pail as a function of  the other variables given in the problem 

b)  If  the  person  aims  correctly,  find  an  expression  for  the  range  of  speeds  that  the 
ball must be thrown at in order to hit the pail? 

In case you need some help, try answering these questions.

the ball can be thrown in order that the ball will collide with the pail? 

There  are  two  objects  involved  in  this  problem.  Each  object  is  undergoing  free  fall,  so 
there  is  only  one  stage  each. The  pail  is undergoing  one  dimensional motion. The  ball  is 
undergoing  two  dimensional  motion.  The  parameters  h ,  h ,  and  s are  unspecified,  so
1
2
2
our answers will be functions of those symbolic expressions for the quantities. 

Since  the  acceleration  is  unidirectional  and  constant,  we  will  choose  Cartesian 
coordinates,  with  one  axis  along  the  direction  of  acceleration.  Choose  the  origin  on  the 
ground  directly  underneath  the  point  where  the  ball  is  released. We  choose  upwards  for 
the positive y-direction and towards the pail for the positive x-direction. 

We  choose  position  coordinates  for  the  pail  as  follows.  The  horizontal  coordinate  is 
constant  and  given  by  x = s2  .  The  vertical  coordinate  represents  the  height  above  the 
1

Question: What equations of motion follow from your model for the position and velocity 
functions of each body? 
Model:  The  pail  undergoes  constant  acceleration  ( a y ) = − g   in  the  vertical  direction

Equations of Motion for Ball: 

The  initial  position  is  given  by  ( x0 ) = 0 ,  ( y0 ) = h2 .  The  components  of  the  initial 
2

velocity  are  given  by  ( v y ,0  ) = v0  sin (θ )  and  ( vx ,0 ) = v0  cos (θ ) ,  where  v0   is  the

Question:  Clean  up  your  equations.  What  strategy  can  you  design  for  finding  the  

angle the second person needs to aim the ball?

We shall apply the conditions we found for the ball hitting the pail.

Question:  When does the ball collide with the pail? 

Answer: In order  to  find  the  time of collision as a  function of  the  initial speed, we begin 
with our results that

Question: At what height does the ball collide with the pail? 

Answer:  We  can  use  the  y-coordinate  function  of  either  the  ball  or  the  pail  at  t
Since it had no initial y velocity, it’s easier to use the pail,

Question:  What  is  the  minimum  speed  the  person  must  throw  the  ball  in  order  to 
ensure that there will be a collision? 

Answer: Suppose the ball and the pail collide exactly at the ground at the time  t

Question: check your algebra and your units. Any obvious errors? 


Answer: No obvious errors.  


Question: Can you see that the answer is correct now that you have it – often simply

by retrospective inspection? 


Answer:  The  person  aims  at  the  pail  at  the  point  where  the  pail  was  released.  Both  

undergo free fall so the key result was that the vertical position obeys

Question: Substitute some values for the initial conditions that test the limits of your 
answer. Make  the  pail  very  far  away  or  very  close  and  what  your  answer  predicts 
about the time of flight or the collision height. 

Answer:  Let  s = 10 m ,  v0  = 20 m  s -1 ,  let  h = 2 m ,  and  h1  = 4 m  .  Then  the  condition
