Problem Set 8: Center of Mass, Momentum and Impulse: Solutions  

Problem 1: Pre-Experiment 07 Concept Questions 

a)	 Cart A is at rest on a straight horizontal track with negligible friction. An identical cart B, 
moving to the right, collides with cart A. They stick together. After the collision, which 
of the following is true?  

1.	 Carts A and B are both at rest. 
2.	 Carts A and B move to the right with a speed greater than cart B's original speed.  
3.	 Carts A and B move to the right with a speed less than cart B's original speed.  
4.	 Cart B stops and cart A moves to the right with speed equal to the original speed of cart 
B. 

Explain your reasoning. 

b)  Cart A is at rest on a straight horizontal track with negligible friction. An identical cart B, 
moving to the right, collides elastically with cart A. They do not stick together. After the 
collision, which of the following is true? 

1.	 Carts A and B are both at rest. 
2.	 Cart B stops and cart A moves to the right with speed equal to the original speed of cart 
B. 
3.	 Cart A remains at rest and cart B bounces back with speed equal to its original speed.  
4.	 Cart A moves to the right with a speed slightly less than the original speed of cart B and 
cart B moves to the right with a very small speed.

c) Suppose you drop paperclips into an open cart rolling along a straight horizontal track 
with negligible friction. As a result of the accumulating paperclips, explain whether the 
momentum and kinetic energy increase, decrease, or stay the same.

Problem 2:  Center of Mass 

The  mean  distance  from  the  earth  to  the  sun  is  r  = 1.49 ×1011 m  .  The  mass  of  the  earth  is 
,e s
 and the mass of the sun is  m  = 1.99 ×1030  kg
m  = 5.98 ×1024  kg
. The mean radius of the earth is 
e
s
r  = 6.37 ×106  m  .  The  mean  radius  of  the  sun  is  r  = 6.96 ×108  m  .  Where  is  the  location  of  the 
e
s
center of mass of the earth-sun system? 

Problem 3: Impulse and Momentum 

, starting from rest, falls a height of  3.0 m  and then collides with 
A ball of mass  m1  = 8.0 ×10 −2  kg
the  ground. The  ball  bounces  up  to  a  height  of  2.0 m . The  collision with  the  ground  takes  place 
over a time,  ∆t  = 5.0 ×10 −3  s  .

a)  What is the momentum of the ball immediately before the collision? 

b)  What is the momentum of the ball immediately after the collision? 

c)  What is the average force of the ground on the ball?

d)  What impulse is imparted to the ball? 

e)  What is the change in the kinetic energy during the collision?

Problem 4: 

A  block  of  mass  mb   on  a  horizontal  table  is  connected  to  one  end  of  a  spring  with  spring 
constant  k   . The other end of  the spring  is attached  to a wall.   The block  is set  in motion so  that 
it oscillates about its equilibrium point with amplitude  A 0 . 

a)	 What is the period of the motion? 

A lump of sticky putty of mass  m p   is dropped onto the block. The putty sticks without bouncing. 
The putty hits the block at the instant when the velocity of the block is zero.  

b)	 Find  the  new  period,  the  new  amplitude,  and  the  change  in  mechanical  energy  of  the 
system. 

The  putty  is  removed  and  the  block  is  set  in motion with  the  same  amplitude  A 0 . This  time  the 
putty is dropped and hits the block at the instant the block has its maximum velocity. 

c)	 Find  the  new  period,  the  new  amplitude,  and  the  change  in  mechanical  energy  of  the 
system.
