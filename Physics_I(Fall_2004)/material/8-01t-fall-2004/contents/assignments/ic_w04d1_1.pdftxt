Hand in one solution per group.  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
II. 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution

In-Class-Problem 11: Whirling Objects 

Two objects of equal mass  m  are whirling around a shaft with a constant angular 
velocity ω. The first object is a distance  d  from the central axis, and the second object is 
a distance  2d  from the axis. You may assume the strings are massless and inextensible. 
You may ignore the effect of gravity. Find the tensions in the two strings.  

As you begin this problem, consider what types of force diagrams you may need. In 
particular what body or system of bodies will use for your free body diagram. It never 
hurts to draw as many free body diagrams as you can. 

Solution:

In-Class Problem 12: Object undergoing Circular Motion on the Inside 
of a Cone 

Consider an object of mass  m  that moves in a circular orbit with constant velocity  v0
along the inside of a cone. Assume the wall of the cone is frictionless. The cone makes an 
angle φ with respect to a vertical axis.  

a) Find the radius of the orbit of the object in terms of the given information. 

In the Look Back – check your solution and method of solution part of our methodology 
answer the following questions. 

b)	

c)	

Is the normal force a centripetal force or is a compopnent of the normal force the 
centripetal force in this problem? 

Is the radius of the circular orbit independent of the mass of the object? Explain why 
or why not. 

Solution:

In-Class Problem 13: Car on a Banked turn 

A  car  of  mass  m   is  going  around  a  circular  turn  of  radius  R   with  constant  speed v   , 
which is banked at an angle φ with respect to the ground.  The car is held up on the bank 
by  static  friction  between  the wheels  and  the  road with  a  coefficient  of  static  friction µ .s
Let  g   be  the magnitude  of  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity.  Derive  an  expression  for  the 
minimum velocity necessary to keep the car moving in a circle without slipping down the 
embanked turn. Express your answer in terms of the given quantities. 

Car on banked turn undergoing circular motion  

Solution 

As  you  try  to  Understand  –  get  a  conceptual  grasp  of  the  problem  consider  the 
following  question.  There  are  all  types  of  resistive  forces  acting  on  the  car  along  the 
direction  of  motion  of  the  car;  for  example:  air  friction  and  rolling  resistance.  Do  you 
need to know these in order to model this problem? Explain your reasoning.
