Problem 30  Moment of Inertia of a Uniform disc.


A uniform disc of mass  m  and radius  R  is mounted on an axis passing through the center of the 
disc,  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  disc.  In  this  problem,  you  will  calculate  the  moment  of 
inertia about two different axes that pass perpendicular to the disc. One passes through the center 
of  mass  of  the  disc  and  the  second  passes  through  a  point  on  the  rim  of  the  disc  a  distance 
R from  the  center.  As  a  starting  point,  consider  the  contribution  to  the  moment  of  inertia  from 
the mass element  dm   show in the figure below.

Problem 30 Turntable 

A  turntable  is  a  uniform  disc  of mass  1.2  kg  and  radius  1.3  10  1 m . The  turntable  is  spinning  at 
× −
an  initial  constant  frequency  of  f 0  = 33  cycles/min   .  The  motor  is  turned  off  and  the  turntable 
slows to a stop in 8.0 s due to frictional torque. Assume that the angular acceleration is constant. 
What is the magnitude of the frictional torque acting on the disc?

Problem 31: Simple Pendulum 

A  pendulum  consists  of  an  object  hanging  from  the  end  of  a  string.  The  object  is  pulled  to  one 
side and allowed  to oscillate.  If  the object has negligible size and  the string  is massless,  then  the 
pendulum is called a simple pendulum.  

a)  Find the equation of motion for the object. 


b)  Show that the object undergoes simple harmonic motion when the initial angle is small 

and you can approximate  sinθ≅θ . 

c)  For small angles, what is the period of oscillation? 

d)  Is the angular velocity the same as the angular frequency for the object?
