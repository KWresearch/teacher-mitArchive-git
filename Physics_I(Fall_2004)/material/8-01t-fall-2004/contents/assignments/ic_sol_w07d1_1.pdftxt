Problem 22:  Escape Velocity and Mechanical Energy 

The asteroid Toro, discovered in 1964, has a radius of about  R = 5.0 km  and a mass of 
about  mt = 2.0 ×1015  kg . Let’s assume that Toro is a perfectly uniform sphere. What is the 
escape velocity for an object of mass  m  on the surface of Toro? Could a person reach 
this speed (on Earth) by running? 

Solution: 

The only potential energy in this problem is the gravitational potential energy. We choose 
the zero point for the potential energy when the object and Toro are an infinite distance 
apart, U gravity (r0  = ∞ ≡ 0 . Then the potential energy when the object and Toro are an 
)
infinite distance  r  apart is given by 

U gravity (r) = −

Gm m 
 with U gravity (r  = ∞) ≡ 0 .

r 

The expression escape velocity refers to the minimum velocity necessary for the object to 
escape the gravitational interaction of the asteroid and move off to an infinite distance 
away. If the object has a velocity less than the escape velocity, it will be unable to escape 
the gravitational force and must return to Toro. If it has a velocity greater than the escape 
velocity, it will have a non-zero kinetic energy at infinity. So the condition for the escape 
velocity is that the object will have exactly zero kinetic energy at infinity. 

We choose our initial state, at time  t0 , when the object is at the surface of the planet with 
velocity equal to escape velocity. We choose our final state, at time  t f  , to occur when the 
separation distance between the asteroid and the object is infinite.

Final Energy: The final kinetic energy is  K f  = 0 , since this is the condition that defines 
escape velocity. The final potential energy is zero, U  = 0  since we chose the zero point
f 
for potential energy at infinity. So the final mechanical energy is  

E f  = K f  + U  = 0 .

Non-conservative work: There is no non-conservative work.

Considering that Olympic sprinters typically reach velocities of 12  m s −1 , this is an easy
⋅ 
velocity to attain by running on Earth. It may be harder on Toro to generate the 
acceleration necessary to reach this speed by pushing off the ground, since any slight 
upward force will raise the center of mass and it will take substantially more time than on 
earth to come back down for another push off the ground. 

Problem 23: Circular Motion and Conservation of Mechanical Energy 

An object of mass  m  is released from rest at a height  h  above the surface of a table. The 
object slides along the inside of the loop-the-loop track consisting of a ramp and a 
circular loop of radius  R  shown in the figure. Assume that the track is frictionless. When 
the object is at the top of the track it pushes against the track with a force equal to three 
times it’s weight. What height was the object dropped from? 

Solution:

We choose polar coordinates with origin at the center of the loop. We choose the zero 
point for the potential energy U  = 0  at the bottom of the loop.  

Initial Energy: We choose for our initial state, the instant the mass is released. The 
initial kinetic energy  K 0  = 0 . The initial potential energy is non-zero, U 0  = mgh . So the 
initial mechanical energy is  

E0  = K0  + U  = mgh .
0 

Final Energy: We choose for our final state, the instant the mass is at the top of the loop-
1 mv f

2  since the mass is in motionat rest. The

Non-conservative Work: Since we are assuming the track is frictionless, there is no  
non- conservative work. 

Change in Mechanical Energy: The change in mechanical energy is therefore zero, 

0 = Wnc  = ∆ Emechanical  = E f  − E0 . 

Thus mechanical energy is conserved,  E f  = E0 , or 

2mgR +

1 mv f

2  = mgh . 

Missing Condition: The normal force of the track on the object is perpendicular to the 
direction of the motion of the object so this force does zero work,  
r 
⋅ d rN r

 = 0 .

Therefore the work-kinetic energy theorem does not account for the action of this force.  

When there are forces that do no work in some direction, set up the Second Law in 
that direction, 

r 
F⊥ = ma r 
⊥  . 

We show the force diagram when the mass is at the top of the loop. Therefore Newton’s 
Second Law in the radial direction,  rˆ ,  is 

−mg − N  = − m

f 

Notice from the information given in the example, the normal force of the loop on the 
r 
object is  N = −3mg r r . (This is the action-reaction pair). 

Therefore the Second Law becomes 

4mg  = m  v   2  R .
f 

We can rewrite this condition in terms of the kinetic energy as 

2mgR = 

1 mv

Summary: Our two equations are therefore

The second equation (from the Newton’s Second Law) can be substituted into the 
conservation of mechanical energy equation to yield , 

So the initial height is 

4mgR  = mgh  .
