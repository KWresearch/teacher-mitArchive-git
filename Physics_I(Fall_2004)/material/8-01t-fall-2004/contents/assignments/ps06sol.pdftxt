Problem  1.  Experiment  5  b)  Analysis. 

a)  We  know  that  when  the  string  is  about  to  slide,  the  tension  varies  as 
T (�) =  T0e−µs � .  It  means  that  T2  =  T1e−µs � .  On  the  other  hand,  analyzing 
the  free-body  diagrams  for  the  masses,  we  conclude  that  T1  =  m1g  and 
T2  = m2g .  Thus  the maximum  ratio of  the masses before  the  string  starts  to 
slide  is 

m1 
m2 

= eµs � 

b)  If  we  assume  that  the  string  is  massless,  the  derivation  of  the  tension  of 
the string, which is given in the description of Experiment 5 b) is unchanged, 
except  that  the  friction  force  is now µk N .  Thus  the  tension  varies  as T (�) = 
T0e−µk � .  Since  both  masses  move  with  the  same  acceleration,  T1  − m1g  = 
−m1a  and  T2  − m2g = m2a.  Thus 

m2 (g + a) = m1 (g − a)e −µk � . 

The  solution  of  this  equation  is 

m1e−µk �  − m2 
a = g 
m2  + m1e−µk � 

Problem  2.  Experiment  6  Pre-Lab  Question. 

a)  The  work  done  on  the  cart  by  the  force  of  gravity  before  is  comes  in 
contact  with  the  spring  is 

W  = (mg sin �)l 

and  is  equal  to  the  change  in  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  cart W  = Kf  − Ki  = 
2 /2.  Thus  the  velocity  of  the  cart  when  it  ﬁrst  contacts  the  spring  is 
mvf 
 
�
vc  = 2g l sin � . 
b)  The  peak  force  is  achieved  when  the  spring  compression  is  at  maximum, 
i.e.  just  before  the  spring  is  about  to  bounce  back.  Assuming  this  point

is  a  distance  d  from  the  point  where  the  cart  ﬁrst  contacts  the  spring,  the 
work  done  by  the  spring  on  the  cart  during  the  collision  is  W  =  −kd2/2. 
The gravitational  force does positive work W  = mg sin �d on  this part of  the 
tra jectory.  Again, the change of the cart’s kinetic energy is equal to the work 
done  by  the  external  forces: 

Wtotal  = mg sin �d −

Problem  3.  Concept  Question:Work. 

Since the block starts at rest and ends at rest, the change in the block’s kinetic 
energy  is �K  = 0.  Thus  the  total work  done  on  the  block Wtotal  = W1 + W2 
must  be  zero.  Thus  the  amounts  of  work  done  by  the  two  people  are  equal 
in magnitude  and  are  of  the  opposite  sign. 

Problem  4.  Work-kinetic  energy. 

a)  It  is  easier  to  do  the  problem  using  Work-Kinetic  Energy  theorem.  The 
problem  is  naturally  split  into  two  part:  motion  on  the  inclined  plane  and 
motion  on  the  horizontal  plane. 

b)  The  work  done  by  the  friction  force  on  the  way  down  is 

Wf d  = −µk1 lmg cos �.

and  the  same  block  on  the  horizontal  plane  (right) 

c)  The  work  done  by  the  gravitational  force  on  the  way  down  is 

Wg  = (mg sin �)l. 

d)  The  change  in  kinetic  energy  is  �K  = Kb  − 0 = Wf d  + Wg .  Thus  at  the 
bottom  of  the  plane  the  kinetic  energy  is 

Kb  = mg l(sin � − µk1 cos �). 

e)  The  work  done  by  the  friction  force  while  the  ob ject  is  sliding  on  the 
horizontal  surface  is 

Wf s  = −µk2mgx, 
where  x  is  the  distance  the  ob ject  has  slid  on  the  horizontal  plane. 

f )  Again,  the  change  in  kinetic  energy  is  equal  to  the  work  done  by  friction 
0 − Kb  = −Kb  = Wf 2 ,  thus 

−mg l(sin � − µk1 cos �) = −µk2mgd 

and  for  the  distance  d  we  ﬁnd
