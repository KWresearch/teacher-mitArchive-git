Problem 1: Isothermal Ideal Gas Atmosphere 

a)	 Find the root mean square (rms) speed of an oxygen molecule at T = 300K at sea level. 

b)	 Find the root mean square z-component of the velocity of an oxygen molecule at T = 300K at 
sea level. 

c)	

If a molecule with the above z-velocity were in a large evacuated container, to what maximum 
height H would it rise? 

d)	 Find the rms z-component of velocity of a nitrogen molecule at T = 300K and height H 
assuming that the atmosphere extends that high (which it does)? 

Problem  2:  Measuring  Speeds  of  Gas  Molecules  The  actual  speeds  of  atoms  and 
molecules were first measured directly  in 1930 by  the following experiment. A beam of bismuth 
atoms,  evaporated  from  an  ‘oven’,  passed  through  some  defining  slits  in  a  hollow  cylinder  of 
radius R = 4.7 ×10−2  m ,  rotating  with  frequency  f  = 1.2 ×10  Hz  .  The  cylinder  had  a  narrow  slit 
2
cut  in  one  side  parallel  to  its  axis.  A  glass  plate  was  mounted  opposite  the  slit  in  the  cylinder. 
(See  sketch).  The  fastest  atoms  would  arrive  at  the  leading  edge  of  the  plate  and  the  slower 
atoms would  distribute  themselves  further  back  along  the  plate.  The  following  graph  shows  the 
results  for  Bismuth  atoms  at  a  temperature T  = 827 0C  .  In  this  problem  we  shall  calculate  the 
velocity  of  the  Bismuth  atoms  at  the  maximum  of  the  distribution  curve.  The  Bismuth  atoms 
have a molecular weight M  = 2.09 ×102  g   mole   . 

a)  What is the displacement backwards along the glass of the maximum of the curve? 


b)  What angle (in radians) does this correspond to?


c)  How  long  does  it  take  for  the  cylinder  to  rotate  through  this  angle?  (This  corresponds  to  

the time it takes the Bismuth atom to cross the diameter of the cylinder). 

d)  What is the velocity of these Bismuth atoms? 

v 2  = 3RT
 M
e)  Using 
the  universal  gas
,  where 
theorem

the 
rms
constant R = 8.31 J mole  − K  ,  calculate  the  root  mean  square  velocity  of  the  Bismuth 
atoms. How does your answer compare to part d)?

The person cycles for 4 hours and covers 100 miles. The person has mass  m  = 60 kg .

c)  How many kilocalories did the person burn up?


d)  What rate did the cyclist generate heat?  


e)  What happens to this heat?


Answer: 

a) The cyclist applies an average force by pedaling. Suppose the bicyclist pedals at an angular 
velocity ω . Then the power output of the cyclist is
0

P =τω0  = 3.0 × 10  W .

Now assume that the cyclist applies an average force  F  and the radius of the crankshaft is
ave
r0 . Then the cyclist applies a torque 

τ= F r

The crankshaft on my bicycle is  r0  ≅ 0.17 m . 

So the average force exerted by the cyclist is

The angular velocity of the cyclist legs and the angular velocity of the wheel depends on the gear 
ratio. Let’s assume that at this gear ration at 25 mph is about 5. The angular velocity ω  of the

bicycle is given by 

ω = v 
cm

/ r

where  r1  is the radius of the wheel. The radius of the wheel on bicycle is  r  ≅ 0.342 m .

So the velocity of the bicycle is approximately 

v  = (25 mph)(0.45 m  s -1  / mph) = 11.3 m  s  .

Note that cyclist pedal with two legs and they only apply a force per leg over an angle θ. 

So the effective force on each leg is the average force divided by two divided by the fraction of

Problem 43: Thermodynamic Cycle for an Ideal Gas Heat Engine  
a) 

In-Class Problem 44 Power plant efficiency 
A  large  coal-fired  power  plant  generates  about  10  W   average  power.    This  is  enough  to  meet 
9
the load of approximately 106  Americans.  In the plant, the coal is burned to create high pressure 
steam, which then runs a heat engine.  Practical considerations limit the temperature of the steam 
to  typically  750 K   (~ 900  o F ,  this  would  be  superheated  steam;  the  vapor  pressure  of  water  at 
this  temperature  is  impracticably  high).    Similarly,  the  heat  has  to  be  removed  from  the  heat 
engine  at  well  above  room  temperature  if  a  cooling  tower  is  used  (these  might  have  a 
temperature around  350 K ). 

a)  Assuming  that  the  plant  achieves  75%   of  the  thermodynamically  allowed  efficiency, 
estimate  how many  kilograms  of  coal  the  plant will  consume  per  day.    (Anthracite,  the  best 
coal, has roughly  2.8 ×107 J  kg 
-1 .)
⋅ 

Answer:  The ratio of the power output to the power input is the efficiency of the plant, 

The maximum allowed efficiency is 

εplant  = Pout  / Pin 

ε=

∆T 
T2 

= 

750 K-350 K
750 K 

= .53 .

The plant achieves  75%  of this efficiency, so the efficiengy of the plant is 

∆T 
εplant  = (.75) 
T2 

750 K-350 K
= (.75) 
750 K 

= 0.4

The power output per day is 

Pout  = (10  J  s -1 )(8.64 ×10 4  s  day)=8.64 ×10  J  day -1 .

The necessary power input is therefore 

Pin  = Pout  /εplant  = (8.64 ×1013  J  day  ) /(.4) = 2.16 ×1014 J  day  .

b)  The energy content of Anthracite per kilogram, the best coal, is roughly  2.8 ×107 J  kg  . The

⋅ 
amount of  kilograms of coal the plant will consume per day will be  

 

(mass  of  coal  ) / day  = (energy  input  day  ) /(energy  of  coal  / kilogram)

(mass  of  coal  ) / day  = (2.16 ×1014  J  day  ) /(2.8 ×10  J  kg -1 ) = 7.7 ×10  kg  day

c)	 How many railroad cars full is this (1 loaded car’s mass is ~10  kg ), and how long would the 
5
train be in miles (1 car is about 75 feet long)? 

Answer:  

The number of railroad cars per day full of coal is 

cars  / day  = 

(mass  of  coal  ) / day 
(mass  of  coal  / car  ) 

= (7.7 ×10  kg  day -1 ) /(10  kg) ≅ 77 .

6	
⋅ 

So we need about 80 cars per day. 

The length of the train is then about 1 mile since 

length  = (# number  of  cars )(length  / car  ) ≅ (80)(75 ft) = (6000 ft)(1 mile/5280 ft) = 1.1 miles 

The  laws  of  thermodynamics  therefore  considerably  complicate  the  generation  of  mechanical 
energy  in  today’s  society.  One way  to deal with  this  is cogeneration such as practiced  in MIT’s 
20 ×106  W=20 MW   power  plant:  the  waste  heat  from  the  generator  is  used  to  heat  the  campus 
(but  what  to  do  in  the  summer?).    As  you  can  see,  a  HUGE  improvement  in  energy  efficiency 
and  concomitant  reduction  in  waste  heat  awaits  the  development  of  economically  practical 
alternatives  (such  as  fuel  cells)  to  burning  fuel  and  using  heat  engines  to  transform  this  to 
mechanical energy.
