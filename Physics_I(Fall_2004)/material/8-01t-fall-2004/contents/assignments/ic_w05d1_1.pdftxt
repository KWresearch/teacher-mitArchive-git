Hand in one solution per group.  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
II. 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution

In-Class-Problem 14: Whirling Objects, U-Control Model Airplane 

A U-control airplane of mass M  is attached by wires of  length L (and negligible mass) to 
the  “pilot”  who  controls  the  lift  provided  by  the  wing.  (The  wires  control  the  plane’s 
elevator.) The plane’s engine keeps it moving at constant speed v.   

a)  Briefly describe how you intend to model the motion of the object?  What 
directions are you choosing for analyzing the components of your forces and state 
why? 

b)	 Find the total tension T in the wires when the plane is flown overhead in a circle 
so that the wires make an angle θ with the ground.  Remember that the wings can 
provide lift only in the direction perpendicular to their area, i.e. in a direction 
perpendicular to the wires.  Think carefully before selecting the angle of your 
coordinate system.   

c)  The plane will go out of control and crash if the tension is not maintained.  Given 
a particular speed of the plane, v, is there some angle θcrirt which you would 
advise the pilot not to exceed? If possible, exhibit a speed vsafe, at which the 
plane would be safe at any angle?

In  this  problem  assume  that  the  moon  is  only  under  the  influence  of  the  earth’s 
r 
gravitational  force  given  by  a  magnitude  F ,  = −G m mm  rˆ 
.  Also  assume  that  the

moon  is  moving  in  a  circular  orbit  around  the  earth  and  that  the  moon  travels  with  a

a)  Briefly describe how you intend to model the motion of the object?  What 
directions are you choosing for analyzing the components of your forces and state 
why? 

b) 	 Calculate the period of the moon’s orbit around the earth. 

c)	

Is  this  the  same  period  as  the  time  between  full  moons  as  seen  from  the  earth? 
Explain your reasoning.

In-Class Problem 16: Consider a planet of mass  m1  in orbit around a extremely 
massive star of mass  m2 . The period of the orbit is  T . Assume that there is a uniform 
distribution of dust, of density ρ  throughout the space surrounding the star and 
24π  4
> Gπρ  . The gravitational effect of this 
extending well beyond the planet with

in addition to the gravitational attraction between the star and the planet. You may 
neglect any drag forces due to collisions with the dust particles. 

a)  Briefly describe how you intend to model the motion of the object?  What 
directions are you choosing for analyzing the components of your forces and state 
why? 

b)  Find an expression for the radius of the orbit of the planet. 

c)  If there were no dust present, would the radius of the circular orbit be greater, 
equal, or less than your result from part a). Briefly explain your reasoning.  

Several  billion  years  later,  the  dust  cloud  has  vanished,  but  now  assume  that  there  is  a 
repulsive force acting on the planet that is given by

d)	 Show  that  there  are  two  possible  circular  orbits  for  the  planet  that  have  the  same 
velocity  v . Find the radii of these orbits.
