Problem 1: Estimation (see section 1.10 in course notes) 

In  a  recent  publication  of  Nature,  Australian  scientists  determined  that  during  the  last  ice  age 
(22,000  to  19,000  years  ago)  the  sea  level  reached  its  low  point,  425  to  440  feet  below  the 
present level due to the change of sea water to glacial ice. 

a)	 What approximate volume of ice would this correspond to? 

b)  If this additional ice were evenly divided between the polar ice caps, estimate how far the 
northern hemisphere ice sheet would extend southward. 

Problem 2: Kinematics (see chapter 2 in course notes) 

Two stones are released from rest at a certain height, one after the other.  

a)  Will the difference in their speeds increase, decrease, or stay the same? 

b)  Will their separation distance increase, decrease, or stay the same? 

c)  Will the time interval between the instants at which they hit the ground be smaller than, 
equal to, or larger than the time interval between the instants of their release? 

Problem 3: Radians and Estimation (see section 1.11 in course notes) 

a)	 Hold  a  dime  at  arm’s  length. What  angle  in  radians  is  subtended  by  the  diameter  of  the 
dime? 

b)  Using your result from part a), estimate the length of the infinite corridor at MIT. In order 
to  do  this,  choose  a  reference  height  at  one  end  of  the  corridor  and  estimate  its  height. 
Then go  to  the other end of  the corridor and measure what fraction of the diameter of the 
dime  corresponds  to  your  reference  height.  You  can  now  calculate  the  length  of  the 
corridor  by  using  similar  triangles.  The  length  is  published  by  MIT.  Can  you  find  the 
published value? 

c)  Now  use  your  dime  and wait  until  the moon  is  out  (the moon  is  new  on  Sept.  14  so  you 
need  to  make  a  measurement  as  quickly  as  possible  on  the  quarter  moon)  to  try  an 
estimate the angular diameter of the moon. If you could not measure the moon, recall that 
during a total eclipse, the moon is almost exactly the same angular diameter as the sun. If 
it  takes  the  sun  two  minutes  to  set  (ignore  atmospheric  distortions),  what  is  the  angular 
diameter  of  the  moon?  Once  you  have  this  estimate,  what  additional  information  would 
you  need  in  order  to  estimate  the  mass  of  the  moon?  Make  some  estimates  regarding 
these  additional  quantities  and  then  estimate  the  mass  of  the  moon.  Look  up  the  actual 
value and compare it with your estimate. How did you do?

Problem  4:  Graphical  Analysis:  Two  Bodies,  One  Dimensional  Motion  (see 
Chapter in course notes) 

A  person  starts  running  with  a  constant  velocity  trying  to  catch  a  streetcar  that  is  initially 
2.0 ×101 m  away  from  a  person  and  has  just  started  to  accelerate  from  rest  with  a  constant 
acceleration of  0.9 m s   . 2  The person runs just fast enough to catch the streetcar and hop on. 

a)  Describe  the  strategy  you  have  chosen  for  solving  this  problem.  You  may  want  to 
consider the following issues. What does a sketch of the problem look like? What type of 
coordinate  system  will  you  choose?  What  information  can  you  deduce  from  a  plot  of 
distance vs.  time for both  the person and  the streetcar? What conditions must be satisfied 
when the person just catches up to the streetcar 

b)  Now  show  all  your  work  in  answering  the  following  three  questions.  How  long  did  the 
person  run? What  is  the velocity of  the person when  they  just caught up  to  the  streetcar? 
How far did the person run?

Problem 6: Experiment Two Projectile Motion Pre-Lab Question Wednesday 
September 15 (read Experiment 2) 

Read Experiment 2 before you begin this problem. 

In  the  Experiment  2:  Projectile Motion,  a  ball  of  diameter  is  allowed  to  roll  through  a  tube  that 
makes an angle θ with respect to the horizontal. The ball leaves the tube at a height  h  above the 
ground.  Just as it leaves the tube, the ball passed a photogate which measures the voltage across 
a  photo-transistor. The width  of  the  graph  of  voltage  vs.  time  at  half maximum  is  ∆T . The  ball 
has diameter D . Find an expression  in  terms of  the given  information  for  the horizontal distance 
the ball traveled when it just hits the ground.
