In-Class-Problem 20 Calculating Work Integrals 

a) Work done by Gravity Near  the Surface of  the Earth:   Consider an object of mass 
m  near  the  surface  of  the  earth  falling  directly  towards  the  center  of  the  earth.  The 
gravitational force between the object and the earth is nearly constant. Suppose the object 
starts from an initial point y0 and moves to a final point yf  closer to the earth. How much 
work does the gravitational force do on the object as it falls? 

Solution:  The  displacement  of  the  body  is  negative,  ∆ ≡y
force is given by 

y f  − y  < 0 .  The  gravitational
0 

r
F 
grav 

ˆj = − mg
ˆj .
r
= mg = Fgrav  y 
, 

 

The work done on the body is then 

Wgravity  = Fgravity  y ∆ = − mg
y
, 

∆y .

 

For  a  falling  body,  the  displacement  of  the  body  is  negative, ∆ ≡y
the work done by gravity is positive, 

y f  − y  < 0 ;  therefore
0 

Wgravity  = Fgravity  y ∆ = − mg
y
, 

 
y
∆  > 0 .

The gravitational force is pointing in the same direction as the displacement of the falling 
object so the work should be positive. 

When  an  object  is  rising  while  under  the  influence  of  a  gravitational  force, 
y f  − y  > 0 . The work done by the gravitational force for a rising body is negative, 
y
∆ ≡ 
0 

Wgravity  = Fgravity  y ∆ = − mg
y
, 

 
y
∆  < 0 ,

 since gravity is pointing in the opposite direction as the object is displaced.

b) Work Done by the Spring Force: Connect one end of a spring with spring constant k 
to an object resting on a smooth table and fix the other end of the spring to a wall. Stretch 
the  spring  a  distance  x0  and  release  the  object.  How  much  work  does  the  spring  do  on 
the object as a function of the stretched or compressed length of the object? 

Solution: We  first  begin  by  choosing  a  coordinate  system  with  origin  at  the  position  of 
the  body  when  the  spring  is  at  rest  in  the  equilibrium  position.  We  choose  the  ˆi   unit 
vector  to  point  in  the  direction  the  body  moves  when  the  spring  is  being  stretched.  We 
choose the coordinate function  x t
( )  
 to denote the position of the body with respect to the 
origin (equilibrium position) at time  t . In Figure 8.5.2 we illustrate the coordinate system 
by  showing  the  equilibrium  position  and  the  position  of  the  body  at  time  t   when  it  is 
t0 ,  the  position  of  the  body  is  x0  ≡ x t = t0 ) ,  and  at  time 
stretched,  x t  . Note  that  at  t
(
( )  
= 
t f    the  position  of  the  body  is  denoted  by  x f  ≡ x t = t f ) . Note  that  x0   and  x f    can  be 
t
( 
=
positive, zero, or negative.

The spring force on the body is given by

In Figure  8.5.3 we  show  the  graph  of  the  x -component  of  the  spring  force  as  a  function 
of  x   for both positive values of  x  corresponding  to stretching, and negative values of  x 
corresponding to compressing of the spring.

The work done is just the area under the curve for the interval  x0  to x f  , 
x = x f 
=x x f 
W  = ∫  F dx = ∫  ( −kx  dx .
) 
x 
=x x0 
x = x0 

This integral is straightforward and the work done by the spring force on the body is 

x x f = 
W  = ∫  ( −kx
x x0 = 

) dx

When  the  absolute value of  the  final distance  is  less  than  the absolute value of  the  initial 
x f 
<  x0  ,  the  work  done  is  positive.  This  means  that  if  the  spring  is  less 
distance, 
stretched  or  compressed  in  the  final  state  than  in  the  initial  state,  the  work  done  by  the 
spring force is positive. The spring force does positive work on the body when the spring 
goes  from  a  state  of  ‘greater  tension’  to  a  state  of  ‘lesser  tension’. We  shall  see  that  the 
positive work done by the spring force decreases the potential energy stored in the spring.

c) Work  done  by  the  Inverse  Square  Gravitational  Force:  Consider  an  object  of  mass  m 
moving directly towards the sun (mass ms). Initially the object is at a distance r0 from the 
center of the sun. The object moves to a final distance rf  from the center of the sun. How 
much  work  does  the  gravitational  force  between  the  sun  and  the  object  do  on  the  object 
during this motion? 

Solution: The gravitational force between the sun and the body is given by 

r 
GMm
F  = F ˆr = −

ˆr .

The  work  done  by  this  gravitational  force  on  the  body  is  the  area  under  the  curve  in 
Figure 8.5.4 and is given by the integral 

r f

GMm ⎞
W  = ∫ F  dr = ∫ ⎛
⎟ dr .

Upon evaluation of this integral, we have for the work 

r f

⎛ − 
W  =  ∫ ⎝

⎛  1
⎟⎟ . 
⎜⎜  − 
⎝ rf 
r0 
⎠

 

Since  the  body  has  moved  closer  to  the  sun,  rf  < r  ,  hence  1 /  r   > 1 / r  .  Thus  the  work
0 
f
0 
done by gravitational force between the sun and the body on the body is positive, 

⎛  1
1 ⎞ 
W Gmms  ⎜  − 
⎟⎟ > 0 .

⎜ rf

We  expect  this  result because  the gravitational  force points along  the direction of 
motion,  so  the  work  done  by  the  force  is  positive.  Also  we  expect  that  the  sign  of  the 
work  is  the  same  for a body moving closer  to  the  sun as a body  falling  towards  the earth 
in  a  constant  gravitational  field.  We  shall  see  that  the  positive  work  done  by  the 
gravitational force will decrease the potential energy stored in the gravitational field.

In-Class Problem 21: Spring-Object on an Inclined Plane with Friction  

A object of mass  m   is pushed against a spring at  the bottom of a plane that is inclined at 
an  angle  θ  with  respect  to  the  horizontal  and  held  in  place  with  a  catch.  The  spring 
compresses a distance  x0  and has spring constant  k .  The catch is released and the object 
slides up the inclined plane. At x = 0 the object detaches from the spring and continues to 
slide up the inclined plane. 

Assume that the incline plane has a coefficient of kinetic friction µ . How far up the
k
inclined plane does the object move from the point where the object detaches from the 
spring?
