Problem 1 A car is driving at a constant but unknown velocity,  v0 , on a straightaway. 
A  motorcycle  is  a  distance  d   behind  the  car.  Initially,  they  are  both  traveling  at  the 
same  velocity.  The  motorcycle  starts  to  pass  the  car  by  speeding  up  at  a  constant 
acceleration  a  .  When  the motorcyclist  is  side  by  side with  the  car,  the motorcycle 
m
stops accelerating and  is  traveling at  twice  the velocity of  the car. How  long does  the 
motorcycle accelerate? What was  the  initial velocity of  the car and motorcycle? How 
far did the motorcycle travel while accelerating? Express all your answers in terms of 
the given quantities in the problem. 

I. 

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 

We  assume  you’ve  recognized  the  problem  is  in  the  domain  of  kinematics  – 
the quantitative description of motion.  What is the problem asking?  What are 
the  given  conditions  and  assumptions?  What  is  to  be  found  and  how  is  this 
determined or constrained by the given conditions? 

In  particular:  how  many  objects  are  there,  is  the  motion  in  1,  2,  or  3 
dimensions,  is  the motion  relative  or  is  there  some  logical  absolute  reference 
frame?    Qualitatively  describe  the  motion  (in  each  coordinate  and  of  each 
body if there are several). 

Model: Look for the three most common model motions – either the velocity 
or  the  acceleration  is  constant  or  the  motion  is  uniform  circular.    Often  these 
apply  only  to  part  of  the  time  (or  to  only  one  body)  –  i.e.  might  the 
acceleration  be  constant  but  different  before  and  after  the  rocket  engine  stops 
or between the two racing cars?  Is the motion an example of uniform circular 
motion. 

Advice:  Write  your  own  representation  of  the  problem’s  stated  data:  draw  a 
motion diagram (strobe picture), a graph of position or velocity or acceleration 
vs.  time,  or  a  diagram.    Make  a  table  of  these  quantities  vs.  time  if  it’s

numerical.    What  are  the  initial  conditions  and  how  do  you  represent 
conditions  mathematically  (e.g.  until  car  A  passes  car  B).    A  great  many 
problems  will  involve  special  motion,  perhaps  in  one  or  another  coordinate: 
constant  velocity,  constant  acceleration,  uniform  circular  motion,  relative 
motion – learn to recognize these motions.  Get the problem into your brain!   

Question: Describe  the  strategy  you  have  chosen  for  solving  this  problem. You may 
want  to  consider  the  following  issues. What  does  a  sketch  of  the  problem  look  like? 
What  type  of  coordinate  system  will  you  choose? What  information  can  you  deduce 
from a plot of distance vs.  time for both  the car and  the motorcycle? What conditions 
must be satisfied when the person just catches up to the streetcar? 

Answer:  Note:  Your  answer  should  include  a  sketch  and  coordinate  system  for  the 
system  where  you  clearly  indicated  your  choice  of  origin,  positive  directions  and 
reference  frame;  a  single  graph  showing  qualitatively  the  position  of  the  motorcycle 
and the driver as a function of time.

Devise  a  Plan  -  set  up  a  procedure  to  obtain  the  desired 
solution 

General  - Have  you  seen  a  problem  like  this  –  i.e.  does  the  problem  fit  in  a 
schema  you  already  know?    Is  a  part  of  the  problem  a  known  schema;  could 
you  simplify  this problem  so  that  it  is?  Can you  find any useful  results  from 
the  given  initial  conditions  and  other  data  even  if  it  is  not  the  solution?    Can 
you  imagine  a  route  to  the  solution  if  only  you  know  some  apparently  not 
given  information?    Count  the  unknowns  and  check  that  you  have  that  many 
independent equations. 

In  particular:    choose  the  best  type  of  coordinate  system  to  simplify  the 
problem,  pick  the  orientation  and  location  of  the  origin  of  the  coordinate 
system in accord with the initial conditions.  Warning: almost always it is best 
to  pick  positive  to  the  right  or  up  and  represent  downwards  acceleration,  for 
example,  as  –g.    Given  that  the  problem  involves  some  particular  type  of 
motion  (constant  acceleration,  circular  motion)  think  over  all  the  equations 
that involve this concept. 

Question: Devise a plan for solving for: how  long does  the motorcycle accelerate?; what 
was  the  initial  velocity  of  the  car  and  motorcycle?;  how  far  did  the  motorcycle  travel 
while accelerating?

III. Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 

This  generally  involves  mathematical  manipulations.    Try  to  keep  them  as 
simple  as  possible  by  not  substituting  in  lengthy  algebraic  expressions  until 
the  end  is  in  sight,  make  your  work  as  neat  as  you  can  to  ease  checking  and 
reduce  careless mistakes.   Keep  a  clear  idea of where you  are going  and have 
been  (label  the  equations  and  what  you  have  now  found),  if  possible,  check 
each step as you proceed.

IV. Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 

Can you  see  that  the answer  is correct now  that you have  it – often  simply by 
retrospective  inspection?    Can  you  solve  it  a  different  way?  Is  the  problem 
equivalent  to  one  you’ve  solved  before  if  the  variables  have  some  specific 
values? 

In  particular:  Check  dimensions  if  analytic,  units  if  numerical.    Check 
special  cases  (i.e.  if  a  =  0  does  the  solution  simplify?),  check  that  a  general 
expressions reproduce the given initial conditions.  Does it depend sensibly on 
the  various  quantities  (e.g.  is  the  time  greater  if  the  initial  velocity  is  less?)? 
Is  the  scaling  what  you’d  expect  (time  decreases  with  the  square  root  of  the 
acceleration, distance at some later time proportional to initial velocity)? Is the 
answer  physically  reasonable  (especially  if  numbers  are  given  or  reasonable 
ones substituted). 

Review  the  schema  of  the  problem  –  what  is  the  model,  the  physical 
approximations, the concepts needed, and any tricky math manipulation. 

Question:  Choose  what  you  think  are  reasonable  values  for  the  distance  d ,  and 
the constant acceleration  a  .  What values do you then calculate for how long did the 
m
motorcycle  accelerate?;  what  was  the  initial  velocity  of  the  car  and  motorcycle;  and 
how  far  did  the  motorcycle  traveled  while  accelerating?  Do  your  values  make  sense 
to you?
