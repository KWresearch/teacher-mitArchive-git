Problem 1: (Second Law Applications: synchronous satellite) 

A  synchronous  satellite  goes  around  the  earth  once  every  24  h,  so  that  its  position  appears 
stationary with respect to a ground station The mass of the earth is  m  = 5.98 ×1024  kg
. The mean 
e
r  = 6.37 ×106  m  .  The  universal  constant  of  gravitation 
is
is 
radius  of 
the  earth 
e
G  = 6.67 ×10−11  N  − m
kg
2  . Your goal is to find the radius of the orbit of a synchronous satellite 
2
that circles the earth. 

a)	 Describe  what  motion  models  this  problem.  Write  down  a  vector  description  of  the 
acceleration. Clearly indicate your choice of unit vectors and your reasoning for choosing 
them. 

b)	 What  is  the  radius  of  the  orbit  of  a  synchronous  satellite  that  circles  the  earth? 
Approximately how many earth radii is this distance?  

Problem 2: (Circular motion: banked turn) 

A car of mass  m  is going around a circular turn of radius  R  which is banked at an angle θ with 
respect  to  the ground. Assume  there  is a coefficient of static  friction  µ  between  the wheels and
s
the  road.  Let  g   be  the  magnitude  of  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity.  You  may  neglect  kinetic 
friction. In each part below show your force diagrams.  

a)	 Describe  the motion  of  the  car  if  the  car  is  traveling  very  slowly  or  extremely  fast.  Is  it 
possible  for  the  car  to  travel  at  speeds  such  that  it  can  undergo  circular  motion?    If  so, 
what  coordinate  system  best  suits  this  problem.  In  particular,  describe  the  acceleration 
vector in terms of your coordinate system unit vectors. 

b)  Derive  an  expression  for  the  minimum  velocity  necessary  to  keep  the  car  moving  in  a 
circle  without  slipping  down  the  embanked  turn.  Express  your  answer  in  terms  of  the 
given quantities. 

c)  Derive  an  expression  for  the  maximum  velocity  necessary  to  keep  the  car  moving  in  a 
circle without  slipping up  the  embanked  turn. Express your  answer  in  terms of  the given 
quantities. 

d)  Derive an expression for the velocity necessary to keep the car moving in a circle without 
slipping  up  or  down  the  embanked  turn  such  that  the  static  friction  force  vanishes. 
Express your answer in terms of the given quantities.

Problem 3: Experiment 5 Static Equilibrium Analysis 

Part a) Suppose a rope of mass  m = 0.1kg  is connected at the same height to two walls and is 
allowed to hang under its own weight. At the contact point between the rope and the wall, the 
rope makes an angle θ= 100   with respect to the horizontal. The object is to find the tension in 
the rope at the end and at the middle of the rope.In order to find the tension in the rope at the end 
and at the middle of the rope, you will need to think cleverly what to include as the system in 
your free body diagrams. Describe  

a)	 What choice did you make for the system for you free body force diagram. Show all the 
forces acting on the diagram. What is the tension at the ends of the rope where it is 
connected to the walls? 

b)  What choice did you make for the system for you free body force diagram. Show all the 
forces acting on the diagram. What is the tension in the rope at a point midway between 
the walls? 

Part  b) A  device  called  a  capstan  is  used  aboard  ships  in  order  to  control  a  rope which  is  under 
great  tension.  The  rope  is  wrapped  around  a  fixed  drum,  usually  for  several  turns  (the  drawing 
below shows about three fourths turn as seen from overhead). The load on the rope pulls it with a 
force  T , and the sailor holds it with a much smaller force  TB . Show that  TB  = T e µθ , where  µ
−  s
A
A	
s
is  the  coefficient  of  static  friction  and θ  is  the  total  angle  subtended  by  the  rope  on  the  drum? 
Here’s  a  hint:  choose  a  small  mass  element  of  arc  length  R∆θ.  Carefully  indicate  the  forces 
acting on this section of the rope. Is the tension constant in this section?

Problem 4: Static Equilibrium The Knee 

A  man  of  mass  m  = 70 kg
  is  about  to  start  a  race.  Assume  the  runner’s  weight  is  equally 
distributed on both  legs. The patellar  ligament  in  the knee  is attached  to  the upper  tibia and  runs 
over the kneecap. When the knee is bent, a tensile force,  r 
T , that the ligament exerts on the upper 
tibia, is directed at an angle of θ= 400  with respect to the horizontal. The femur exerts a force  r 
F

on  the  upper  tibia.  The  angle, α,  this  force  makes  with  the  vertical  will  vary  and  is  one  of  the 
unknowns  to  solve  for.  Assume  that  the  ligament  is  connected  a  distance,  d  = 3.8 cm
,  directly 
below  the  contact  point  of  the  femur  on  the  tibia.  The  contact  point  between  the  foot  and  the 
ground  is  a  distance  s  = 3.6  101 cm
  from  the  vertical  line  passing  through  contact  point  of  the 
×
femur  on  the  tibia.  The  center  of mass  of  the  lower  leg  lies  a  distance  x  = 1.8  101 cm    from  this 
×
same vertical line. Suppose the mass of the leg is a 1/5 of the mass of the body.  

a)  Explain the origin of the forces that are shown in the above force diagram. 


b)  What are the equations for static equilibrium of the forces? 


c)  About point will you choose to analyze the torques? What are the equations for static 

equilibrium of the torques? 
d)  Find the magnitude of the force  r 
T  of the patellar ligament on the tibia. 
e)  Find the direction α of the force of the femur  r 
F  on the tibia.
