Problem  1.  Measurement  of  g . 

a)  The  ball  moves  in  the  vertical  direction  under  the  inﬂuence  of  the  con­
stant  force  of  gravity1 .  Hence  in  our  approximation  the  ball  undergoes  one-
dimensional  motion  with  constant  acceleration  g .  Let  us  introduce  vertical 
axis x and choose the positive direction to point up.  We then place the origin 
of  the coordinate system at the bottom of  the  lower pane of glass and choose 
to measure the time from the moment when the ball rises past the origin,  i.e. 
we  choose  x0  = 0  and  t0  = 0  (See  Fig.  1).  With  our  choice  of  initial  position 

and  time,  the  equation  for  x(t)  is 

Figure  1:

and  the  graph  of  x(t)  should  look  like  the  one  on  Fig.  1  The  velocity  of  the 
ball  is  given  by 

x(t) = v0 t − 

(1)

v(t) = v0  − g t 
(2) 
b) Using Fig. 1,  it  is  easy  to understand  that  the  time  the ball  travels across 
the  window,  i.e.  the  interval  of  time  between  the  moment  it  rises  past  the 
bottom  of  the  lower  plane  of  glass  and  disappears  past  the  top  of  the  upper 
pane,  is  �  = (TA − TB )/2.  Since  the  height  of  the  glass  is  h, we  obtain,  from 
Eq.  (1)

To ﬁnd the second equation, we notice that the highest point of the tra jectory

corresponds  to  v = 0  and  t = TA/2.  Thus  we  can  ﬁnd  v0  as 

v0  = gTA/2 

We  now  substitute  this  result  back  into  Eq.  (3)  and  obtain

Problem  2.  Track  event. 

a)  Let  us  place  the  origin  of  the  coordinate  system  at  48 m  before  the  ﬁnish 
line,  which  is  the  position  of  Jim  when  he  starts  accelerating,  and  measure 
the  time  from  the moment Jim passes  this point.  Then Bob’s  initial position 
is x0  = 2 m and  the diagram of x(t)  should  look  like  the one  shown on Fig.2.

We  can  identify  two  distinct  phases  of motion: 

Phase  I:  for  0  <  t  �  tC  Jim  accelerates  with  constant  acceleration  aJ  =

1 m/s  while  Bob moves  with  constant  velocity  v0=8 m/s.

Phase  II:  for  tC  <  t  �  tF  Jim  runs  with  constant  velocity  vJ 2  while  Bob

accelerates  with  constant  acceleration  aB .


The  position  of  Jim  during  Phase  I  is  described  by 

xJ (t) = v0 t + 

aJ t2 
2 

and  his  velocity  is 

vJ (t) = v0  + aJ t 
The  position  and  velocity  of  Bob  during  Phase  I  are  given  by 

xB (t) = x0  + v0 t 
vB (t) = v0 

(6) 

(7) 

(8) 
(9) 

b) When Jim catches up to Bob, xB  = xJ .  Hence we ﬁnd that this happened 
at 
 


t = tC  = 2x0/aJ  = 2s. 

(10) 

c) We can use either (8) or (6) together with (10) to ﬁnd the position of both 
runners  when  Jim  catches  up  to  Bob.  It  is 

xC  = x0  + v0 tC  = 18 m 

(11) 

Hence both  runners are xF  − xC  = 48 m − 18 m = 30 m  away  from  the ﬁnish 
line. 

d)  After  Jim  caught  up  to  Bob,  he moves  with  constant  velocity 

vJ 2  = v0  + aJ tC  = 10 m/s 

(12) 

Therefore,  it  will  take  him  (xF  − xC )/vJ 2  = 3  s  to  reach  the  ﬁnish. 

e)  During  Phase  II,  Bob’s  position  is  given  by 

xB2 (t) = xC  + v0 (t − tC ) + 

aB (t − tC )2

At  the  ﬁnish  line  t =  tF  and  xB  = xF .  Using  the  above  equation,  we  obtain 
Bob’s  acceleration  during  Phase  II: 

(xF  − xC ) − v0 (tF  − tC ) 
aB  = 2 
(tF  − tC )2 

� 1.3  m/s2 

(14)

f )  Bob’s  velocity  at  the  ﬁnish  line  is 

vB (tF ) = v0  + aB2 (tF  − tC ) = 12  m/s. 

(15) 

Bob  is  running  faster at  the ﬁnish  line.  This  can also be  seen  easily  from  the 
diagram  on  Fig  2. 

Problem  3.  Pro jectile  motion.  Softball. 

a)  We  use  a  Cartesian  coordinate  system  with  the  origin  located  above  the 
home  plate  at  the  point  where  the  ball  leaves  the  bat.  Let  axis  x  point 
towards  the  third  base  and  the  axis  y  point  upwards.  In  this  coordinate 
system  the motion  along  x  is  decried  by  a  pair  of  equations 

vx (t) = vx0 

x(t) = vx0 t 

(16) 

and  the motion  along  y  is  described  by 

vy (t) = vy0  − g t 

y(t) = vy0 t − 

g t2 
2 

(17)

where  g  is  the  gravitational  acceleration. 

b)  The  ball  reaches  the  highest  point  on  its  tra jectory  at  t  = �t/2.  Using 
the  equation  for  vy (t),  we  ﬁnd 

vy0  = g�t/2. 

(18) 

The  distance  that  the  ball  travels  along  x  before  the  third  baseman  catches 
it,  is  d1  + v1�t.  Thus  we  ﬁnd 

vx0  = 

d1  + v1�t 
.

(20)

c)  The moment  of  time  corresponding  to  0.1  s  before  the  ball  was  caught  is 
t = �t − 0.1  s.  Using  (16)  and  (17),  we  obtain 

x = 30.4 m
y = 0.9 m

vx  = vx0  = 16m/s 
vy  = −8.8 m/s, 

which  can  be  written  in  vector  form  as 

θr = (30.4θı + 0.9θδ) m 

(21)

(23) 

and 

(24) 
θv = (16θı − 8.8θδ) m/s. 
Here θı and θδ are vectors of unit length in the direction of x and y  correspond­
ingly. 

Problem  4.  Pre-Lab  question. 

a)  Since  ln | θ | =  ln a − bx,  the  tangent  of  slope  of  the  graph  gives  constant 
F 
b:  tan � = −b.

b)  This  time  ln |F | =  ln c + d ln x.  Hence  d  can  be  obtained  from  the  slope 
θ
of  the  graph  of  ln |F |  vs  ln x. 

Problem  5.  Experiment  2  Data  analysis. 

Part  A  We  performed  the  pro jected  ball  experiment.  The  tube  was  set 
at  the  angle  �0  =  30�  and  the  exit  point  was  1.21 m  above  the  ground.  We 
estimate the uncertainty in the measurement of hight to be 2 mm = 2 10−3 m

and  in  the measurement  of  the  horizontal  distance  to  be  5 10−3m.  Although 
is  is  somewhat  diﬃcult  to  estimate  the  uncertainty  in  the  measurement  of 
angle,  it  is  likely  to  be  a  few  degrees.  We  take  ��0  = 1� .  The  error  in  the 
measurement  of  the  pulse  width  �T  is  about  10%  of  the  measured  value. 
The  results  of  the  experiment  are  summarized  in  the  table  below.  Here  d  is 
the  horizontal  distance,  v0T  is  the  calculated  exit  velocity  based  on  theory, 
�T  is the measured pulse width and v0C  is the calculated exit velocity based 
on  the  pulse  width.

We  see  that  the  exit  velocity  calculated  using  the  theory  agrees  fairly  well 
with  the  value measured  in  the  experiment. 

Part B We use the same measurements as  in Part A, but this time calculate 
the  gravitational  constant  g  using  the  value  of  the  initial  velocity  calculated 
from  our measurements  of  the  pulse  width,  v0C

We  note  that  an  error  of  about  10%  in  the  measurement  of  �T  introduces 
the  same  fractional  error  in  the  calculation  of  v0 .  Indeed,
