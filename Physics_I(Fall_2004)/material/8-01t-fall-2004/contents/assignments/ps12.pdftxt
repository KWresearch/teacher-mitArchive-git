Problem 1: Isothermal Ideal Gas Atmosphere 

a)	 Find the root mean square (rms) speed of an oxygen molecule at T = 300K at sea level. 

b)	 Find the root mean square z-component of the velocity of an oxygen molecule at T = 300K at 
sea level. 

c)	

If a molecule with the above z-velocity were in a large evacuated container, to what maximum 
height H would it rise? 

d)	 Find the rms z-component of velocity of a nitrogen molecule at T = 300K and height H 
assuming that the atmosphere extends that high (which it does)? 

Problem  2:  Measuring  Speeds  of  Gas  Molecules  The  actual  speeds  of  atoms  and 
molecules were first measured directly  in 1930 by  the following experiment. A beam of bismuth 
atoms,  evaporated  from  an  ‘oven’,  passed  through  some  defining  slits  in  a  hollow  cylinder  of 
radius R = 4.7 ×10−2  m ,  rotating  with  frequency  f  = 1.2 ×10  Hz .  The  cylinder  had  a  narrow  slit 
2
cut  in  one  side  parallel  to  its  axis.  A  glass  plate  was  mounted  opposite  the  slit  in  the  cylinder. 
(See  sketch).  The  fastest  atoms  would  arrive  at  the  leading  edge  of  the  plate  and  the  slower 
atoms would  distribute  themselves  further  back  along  the  plate.  The  following  graph  shows  the 
results  for  Bismuth  atoms  at  a  temperature T  = 827 0C .  In  this  problem  we  shall  calculate  the 
velocity  of  the  Bismuth  atoms  at  the  maximum  of  the  distribution  curve.  The  Bismuth  atoms 
have a molecular weight M  = 2.09 ×102  g  mole . 

a)  What is the displacement backwards along the glass of the maximum of the curve? 

b)  What angle (in radians) does this correspond to? 

c)  How  long  does  it  take  for  the  cylinder  to  rotate  through  this  angle?  (This  corresponds  to 
the time it takes the Bismuth atom to cross the diameter of the cylinder). 

d)  What is the velocity of these Bismuth atoms? 

e)  Using 
v 2  = 3RT
 M
 
the  universal  gas
,  where 
theorem 
equipartition 
the 
rms
constant R = 8.31 J mole  − K  ,  calculate  the  root  mean  square  velocity  of  the  Bismuth 
atoms. How does your answer compare to part d)? 

Problem 3: Burning Calories 

A racing bicyclist, traveling at an average speed of 25 mph, has a metabolic rate of 

The average power output is 

dE / dt = 1.36

×10

 W . 

dW  / dt = 3.0

 
×102  W . 

The person cycles for 4 hours and covers 100 miles. The person has mass  m = 60 kg . 

a)  What is the average force that the person applies? 

b)  What is the ratio of power output to catabolic rate, ε= 

dW  / dt  ?
dE / dt


c)  How many kilocalories did the person burn up? 


d)  What rate did the cyclist generate heat?  


e)  What happens to this heat?
