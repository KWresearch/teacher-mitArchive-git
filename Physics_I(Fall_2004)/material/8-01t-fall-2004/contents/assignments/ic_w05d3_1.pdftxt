Hand in one solution per group.  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
II. 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution

In-Class-Problem 17 Static Equilibrium: Forearm 

The human forearm (including the hand) can be regarded as a lever pivoted at the joint of 
r 
F  acting on the forearm at the elbow. The forearm is 
the elbow with a downward force 
r 
T
d
pulled upward by the tendon of the biceps 
 which connects to the forearm a distance 
r 
T  makes an angle of 
900  with the horizontal.  The forearm 
from the joint. The tendon 
and hand have a mass of  m1  . Assume the center of mass of the forearm and hand is a 
distance  x 
from the joint. Suppose an object of mass  m2 rests in the hand a distance 
cm
2 x 
away from the joint of the elbow.  See the accompanying figure.

a)	 What are the equations for static equilibrium of the forces? 

b)	 About point will you choose to analyze the torques? What are the equations for 
static equilibrium of the torques? 
c)  What upward force  r 
T  must the tendon exert to keep the forearm horizontal? 
d)	 What is the downward force  r 
F  on the forearm at the elbow joint?

In-Class-Problem 18 Static Equilibrium: Suspended Beam 

A rod of length  2.0 m and mass 4.0 kg is hinged to a wall at one end and suspended from 
the  wall by a cable which is attached to the other end of the rod at an angle of β = 30o to 
the  rod  (see  sketch).  Assume  the  cable  is  massless.  There  is  a  pivot  force  acting  on  the 
beam.  The  magnitude  and  direction  of  this  force  is  unknown.  One  of  the  most  difficult 
parts of these types of problems is to introduce an angle for the pivot force and then solve 
for  that angle  if possible.  In  this problem you will  solve  for  the magnitude of  the  tension 
in the cable and the direction and magnitude of the pivot force. 

a)	 Draw a free body force diagram for the beam. Clearly indicate your choice of 
angle for the pivot force. 

b)	 What are the equations for static equilibrium of the forces? 

c)  About point will you choose to analyze the torques? What are the equations for 
static equilibrium of the torques? 

d)	 What is the tension in the cable? 

e)	 What angle does the pivot force make with the beam? 

f)	 What is the magnitude of the pivot force?

In-Class-Problem 19 Static Equilibrium: The Ankle 

A  person  of mass  m  = 75 kg
  is  crouching with  his/her weight  evenly  distributed  on  both 
tiptoes.    The  forces  on  the  skeletal  part  of  the  foot  are  shown  in  the  diagram.  In  this 
position,  the  Achilles  tendon  in  under  considerable  tension,  r 
T ,  and  makes  an  angle  of 
α= 37 0   with  the  horizontal.  The  tendon  acts  on  the  ankle  a  horizontal  distance 
d  = 10.8 cm
  from  the  point  where  the  foot  contacts  the  floor.    The  tibia  acts  on  the  foot 
with magnitude,  F  ≡  r 
F
   and makes  an  angle  β with  the  vertical.  This  force  acts  on  the 
ankle  a  horizontal  distance  s  = 4.8 cm
from  the  point  where  the  foot  contacts  the  floor. 
You may ignore weight of the foot.  

a)  Find the magnitude of the tension in the Achilles tendon,  T  ≡  r 
T
 . 
b)  Find the magnitude,  F  ≡  r 
F
  , and the angle , β,  of the tibia force on the ankle.
