Problem 1: Experiment Five b) Analysis 

Two  unequal  masses  ( m  m  
)  are  suspended  by  a  string  over  a  rod.  The  coefficient  of  static

friction  between  the  string  and  the  rod  is  µ ,  and  the  coefficient  of  sliding  friction  is  µ  < µ .

Recall that the tension in the string is not constant (see Problem Set 5: Problem 3 part b). 

a)  What is the largest ratio  m m before the string starts to slide?

b)  What is the magnitude of the acceleration of the masses after sliding has begun.

Problem 3: Concept Question: Work 

Two people push  in opposite directions on a block  that  sits atop a  frictionless  surface  (The  soles 
of  their  shoes  are  glued  to  the  frictionless  surface).  If  the  block,  originally  at  rest  at  point  P, 
moves  to  the  right  without  rotating  and  ends  up  at  rest  at  point  Q,  describe  qualitatively  how 
much work is done on the block by person 1 relative to that done by person 2? 

Problem 4: Work-kinetic energy 

An  object  of  mass  m  = 4.0 kg
,  starting  from  rest,  slides  down  an  inclined  plane  of  length 
l  = 3.0 m  . The  plane  is  inclined  by  an  angle  of θ= 300  to  the  ground. The  coefficient  of  kinetic 
friction µ = 0.2 .  At  the  bottom  of  the  plane,  the  mass  slides  along  a  rough  surface  with  a 
k
coefficient  of  kinetic  friction  µ = 0.3 until  it  comes  to  rest.  The  goal  of  this  problem  is  to  find 
k
out how far the object slides along the rough surface. 

a)	 Describe  how  you  will  model  this  motion.  Include  a  free  body  diagram  for  the  object 
while  it  is  on  the  inclined  plane  and  while  it  is  sliding  along  the  horizontal  surface. 
Explain  whether  Newton’s  Second  Law  or  the  Work-Kinetic  Energy  Theorem  provides 
an easier approach to this problem. 

b)  What  is  the  work  done  by  the  friction  force  while  the mass  is  sliding  down  the  inclined 
plane? Is this positive or negative? 

c)  What  is  the  work  done  by  the  gravitational  force  while  the  mass  is  sliding  down  the 
inclined plane? Is this positive or negative? 

d)	 What is the kinetic energy of the mass just at the bottom of the inclined plane? 

e)  What is the work done by the friction force while the mass is sliding along the ground? Is 
this positive or negative? 

f)	 How far does the object slide along the rough surface?
