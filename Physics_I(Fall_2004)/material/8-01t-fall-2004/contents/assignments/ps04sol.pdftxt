Problem  1.  Rotational  Kinematics. 

a)  In 2004,  the period of rotation  is TE  = 86164 s.  Thus the angular velocity 
is 

θE  =

� 7 10−5 s

TE 
The  radius  of  the  circle  of  rotation  of  the  person  at MIT  is 
r = RE  cos � � 4.71 106 m. 
Hence  the  linear  velocity  is 

2� 
v = θE r =  RE  cos � � 343.7 m/s
TE 
and  the  centripetal  acceleration  is 
a = θ 2 r � 0.025m/s2 .

where  T2004  and  T1924  refer  to  the  period  of  the  Earth’s  rotation  in  2004  in 
1924  and �t = 80 years.  Substituting  numbers,  we  obtain

Problem  2.  Second  Law  Applications. 

a)  The  force  diagram  is  shown  on  Fig.  1. 

b)  Using  the  coordinate  system  shown  on  Fig.  1,  we  get 

r  :  T1  sin � + T2  sin � = mar  = mθ 2 l sin � 
y  :  T1 cos � − T2 cos � − mg = 0,

Problem  3.  Static  Equilibrium. 

When  the  beam  is  in  equilibrium,  the  sum  of  all  forces  and  the  sum  of  all 
torques  should  be  zero.  Considering  the  torque  about  the  pivot  (see  Fig.  2) 
and  introducing  the  coordinate  system with  y  pointing  up  and  x  pointing  to 
the  right,  we  have: 

and 

x  :  Fx  − T  cos � = 0 
y  :  Fy  + T  sin � − mg = 0

where  T  is  the  tension  in  rope,  Fx  and  Fy  denote  x  and  y  component  of  φF 
and  we  introduced  two  additional  parameters  —  the  height  h  of  the  point 
where  the  rope  is  connected  to  the  pole  and  angle  �  (see  Fig.  2). 

To  solve  the  above  equations,  we  note  that  the  torque  equation  gives

a)  Our  ﬁt  gave  A  = 4.7 cm,  which  is  close  (within  the  measurement  error) 
to  r0  = 4.8 cm. 

b) We  get  a better ﬁt when A  is  an  adjustable parameter  (root mean  square 
error  is π = 0.07 cm vs π = 0.14 cm when  it  is not adjustable —  see Fig. 3).
