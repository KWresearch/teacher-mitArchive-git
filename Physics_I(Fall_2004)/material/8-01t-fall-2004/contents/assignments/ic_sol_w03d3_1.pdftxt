In-Class Problems 7-10: Newton’s Laws of Motion Solutions  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
II. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution 

In-Class Problem 7: Law of Addition of Velocities (Morning Session) 

a) Suppose two cars, Car A, and Car B, are traveled along roads that are perpendicular to 
each other.  An observer is at rest with respect to the ground. A second observer is in Car 
ˆj , 
r
A. According to the observer on the ground, Car A is moving with a velocity  v A  = vA 
ˆi . 
r
and Car B is moving with a magnitude of velocity  v B  = vB 

What is the velocity of Car B according to the observer in Car A?  Express your answer 
as a vector, and in terms of the direction and magnitude of the velocity.

In-Class Problem 8: Gravitational slingshot  

A  comet  of mass  m   is  initially  in  the Oort Cloud which  is  a distance  far  enough  away  from  the 
sun that you may approximate it as infinity. Due to random motions in the cloud, the comet picks 
up  a  negligibly  small  initial  velocity  but  it  now  moves  out  of  the  cloud  and  heads  directly 
towards  the  sun. Denote  the mass  of  the  sun  by  m  .  The  planet  Jupiter  is  directly  in  the way  of 
s
the comet. Let  m j  denote  the mass of Jupiter. Assume Jupiter  is  in a nearly circular orbit around 
the  sun  with  radius  rs , j  and  has  tangential  velocity  v j  ,  as measured  in  a  reference  frame  at  rest 
with  the  sun. When  the  comet  reaches  the  orbit  of  Jupiter,  the  comet  has  a  velocity,  v  = 
2v  j 
c 
directed towards the sun. Jupiter’s gravity changes  the direction of  the comet’s path by 90o  until 
the comet  is moving opposite  the direction of  Jupiter’s velocity. As  seen by an observer moving 
with the planet Jupiter, the comet changes its direction but not the magnitude of its velocity  v  ′ .c

after slingshot 

a)	 As  seen  in  a  reference  frame  moving  with  the  planet  Jupiter,  what  is  the  magnitude  of 
comet’s velocity  v  ′  before the collision? Express your answer in terms of  v j  .

b)	 As  seen  in  a  reference  frame  at  rest  with  the  sun,  what  is  the  magnitude  of  the  comet’s 
final  velocity  after  it’s  flyby  of  Jupiter?  Did  it  speed  up,  stay  the  same  speed,  or  slow 
down? Express your answer in terms of the initial velocity of the comet  v  = 
2 v j

In-Class Problem 9: Painter on a Platform 

A painter of mass  m1  stands on a platform of mass  m2  and pulls himself up by two ropes 
which hang over massless pulleys. He pulls each rope with a force  F  and accelerates 
upward with a uniform acceleration  a . Find the acceleration a.

In-Class Problem 10: Glass on a tablecloth (Afternoon Session) 

Consider  a  glass  that  is  resting  on  top  of  a  tablecloth.  The  glass  has  mass  m1   and  the 
tablecloth  has mass  m2 .  Suppose  the  coefficient  of  static  friction  between  the  tablecloth 
and glass is given by  µ , and the table is highly polished so it is nearly frictionless. What 
s
is  the maximum  force  that  the  tablecloth  can  be  pulled  horizontally  so  that  the  glass  and 
table cloth move together without slipping?
