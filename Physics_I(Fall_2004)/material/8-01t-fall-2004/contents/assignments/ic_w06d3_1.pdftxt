Hand in one solution per group.  

We would like each group to apply the problem solving strategy with the four stages (see 
below) to answer the following two problems.  

Understand – get a conceptual grasp of the problem 
I. 
Devise a Plan - set up a procedure to obtain the desired solution 
II. 
III.  Carry our your plan – solve the problem! 
IV. 
Look Back – check your solution and method of solution

In-Class-Problem 20 Calculating Work Integrals 

a) Work done by Gravity Near  the Surface of  the Earth:   Consider an object of mass 
m  near  the  surface  of  the  earth  falling  directly  towards  the  center  of  the  earth.  The 
gravitational force between the object and the earth is nearly constant. Suppose the object 
starts from an initial point y0 and moves to a final point yf  closer to the earth. How much 
work does the gravitational force do on the object as it falls?

b) Work Done by the Spring Force: Connect one end of a spring with spring constant k 
to an object resting on a smooth table and fix the other end of the spring to a wall. Stretch 
the  spring  a  distance  x0  and  release  the  object.  How  much  work  does  the  spring  do  on 
the object as a function of the stretched or compressed length of the object?

c) Work  done  by  the  Inverse  Square  Gravitational  Force:  Consider  an  object  of  mass  m 
moving directly towards the sun (mass ms). Initially the object is at a distance r0 from the 
center of the sun. The object moves to a final distance rf  from the center of the sun. How 
much  work  does  the  gravitational  force  between  the  sun  and  the  object  do  on  the  object 
during this motion?

In-Class Problem 21: Spring-Object on an Inclined Plane with Friction  

A object of mass  m   is pushed against a spring at  the bottom of a plane that is inclined at 
an  angle  θ  with  respect  to  the  horizontal  and  held  in  place  with  a  catch.  The  spring 
compresses a distance  x0  and has spring constant  k .  The catch is released and the object 
slides up the inclined plane. At x = 0 the object detaches from the spring and continues to 
slide up the inclined plane. 

Assume that the incline plane has a coefficient of kinetic friction µ . How far up the
k
inclined plane does the object move from the point where the object detaches from the 
spring?
