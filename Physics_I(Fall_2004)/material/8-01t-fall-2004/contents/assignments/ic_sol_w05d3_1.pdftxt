In-Class-Problem 17 Static Equilibrium: Forearm 

The human forearm (including the hand) can be regarded as a lever pivoted at the joint of 
r 
F  acting on the forearm at the elbow. The forearm is 
the elbow with a downward force 
r 
T
d
pulled upward by the tendon of the biceps 
 which connects to the forearm a distance 
r 
T  makes an angle of 
900  with the horizontal.  The forearm 
from the joint. The tendon 
and hand have a mass of  m1  . Assume the center of mass of the forearm and hand is a 
distance  x 
from the joint. Suppose an object of mass  m2 rests in the hand a distance 
cm
2 x  away from the joint of the elbow.  See the accompanying figure.

In-Class-Problem 18 Static Equilibrium: Suspended Beam 

A rod of length  2.0 m and mass 4.0 kg is hinged to a wall at one end and suspended from 
the  wall by a cable which is attached to the other end of the rod at an angle of β = 30o to 
the  rod  (see  sketch).  Assume  the  cable  is  massless.  There  is  a  pivot  force  acting  on  the 
beam.  The  magnitude  and  direction  of  this  force  is  unknown.  One  of  the  most  difficult 
parts of these types of problems is to introduce an angle for the pivot force and then solve 
for  that angle  if possible.  In  this problem you will  solve  for  the magnitude of  the  tension 
in the cable and the direction and magnitude of the pivot force. 

a)  Draw a free body force diagram for the beam. Clearly indicate your choice of 
angle for the pivot force. 

b)  What are the equations for static equilibrium of the forces? 

c)  About point will you choose to analyze the torques? What are the equations for 
static equilibrium of the torques? 

d)  What is the tension in the cable? 

e)  What angle does the pivot force make with the beam? 

f)  What is the magnitude of the pivot force?

In-Class-Problem 19 Static Equilibrium: The Ankle 

A person of mass  m = 75 kg
 
is 
crouching with his/her weight evenly 
distributed on both tiptoes.  The forces 
on the skeletal part of the foot are shown 
in the diagram. In this position, the 
Achilles tendon in under considerable 
r 
T , and makes an angle of 
tension, 
α= 37 0  with the horizontal. The tendon 
acts on the ankle a horizontal distance 
d  = 10.8 cm
 
 from the point where the 
foot contacts the floor.  The tibia acts on 
r 
F

the foot with magnitude,  F  ≡ 
and 
makes an angle β with the vertical. This 
force acts on the ankle a horizontal 
distance  s = 4.8 cm
 
from the point where 
the foot contacts the floor. You may 
ignore weight of the foot. 

a)  Find the magnitude of the tension in the Achilles tendon,  T  ≡  r

b)  Find the magnitude,  F  ≡ 

Solution: 

We shall apply the two conditions of static equilibrium, 

(1) The sum of the forces acting on the rigid body is zero,

The first condition that the sum of the forces is zero becomes

 β+ T sin

 α= 0 . 

Since the weight is evenly distributed on the two feet, the normal force on one foot is 
equal to half the weight, or 

N  = (1 2 ) mg

, 

 

the second equation becomes 

ˆ : 1  2  
j  (
) mg − F cos  β+ T sin  α= 0 

Choose the point of action of the tendon on the ankle as the point  S  to compute the
r 
torque about. Note that the force,  F , that the tibia exerts on the ankle will make no 
contribution to the torque about this point  S . Choose counterclockwise  as the positive 
direction for the torque, this is the positive  kˆ  direction. The torque force diagram on the 
ankle is shown below.

Then the torque due to the force of the tendon  r

We can now solve for the direction β of the force of the tibia 
Rewrite the two force equations as 

r 
F  on the ankle as follows. 

F cos β
 = (1  2 ) mg

F sin β= T cos α 

Dividing these equations yields
