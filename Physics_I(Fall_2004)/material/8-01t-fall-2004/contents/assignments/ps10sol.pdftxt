Problem 2: Experiment 09 Physical Pendulum 

Part One: Ruler Pendulum 

The  ruler  has  a mass mr =  0.159  kg,  a width a = 0.028 m,  a  length b = 1.00 m,  and  the distance 
l
from the pivot point to the center of mass is   = 0.479 m.  

Enter  your  measured  period  into  the  Tmeas  column  of  the  table  below  and  calculate  the  other 
entries using the formulas

and 

with g = 9.805 ms-2. 

Solution: 

The first part of the analysis of the experiment is to calculate the moment of inertia about an axis 
passing through the center of mass, perpendicular to the plane formed by the sides of the ruler. In 
particular,  choose  Cartesian  coordinates  with  the  origin  at  the  center  of  mass,  and  the  x-axis 
along the length, and y-axis along the width. The mass per unit area

The mass element is rotating about the z-axis in a circular orbit with radius   r⊥  = ( x  + y 2 )1 2   , so

the moment of inertia about the center of mass of the ruler is

Part Two: Added Mass 

Consider  the  effect  of  a  brass  weight  clipped  to  the  ruler.  The  weight  is  shaped  like  a  washer 
with an outer  radius ro = 0.016 m and an  inner  radius ri = 0.002 m;  it has a mass mw = 0.050 kg. 
It  is clipped  to  the ruler so  that  the  inner hole  is over  the 0.500 m mark on  the ruler, or l = 0.479 
m  from  the  pivot  point.  The  clip  has  a  mass  mc  =  0.0086  kg  and  you  may  assume  its  center  of 
mass is also over the 0.500 m mark on the ruler.  If you treat the washer and clip as point masses, 

4 

 
 
 
 
then, as was discussed in the notes for Experiment 08, the combined unit (ruler, weight and clip) 
has a moment of inertia about the pivot point

1.	 Use  these  two  expressions  to  derive  an  equation  of  motion  for  the  pendulum  and 
calculate  its  period  T  in  the  small  amplitude  ( sinθ≅θ )  approximation.    Express  your 
answer algebraically in terms of the variables a, b, d, l, mr, mw, mc, and g. 

Answer: 

2. Evaluate your result numerically and compare with the value you measured in your

If you  treat  the brass object washer as a point mass,  its moment of  inertia about  the pivot 
point  P  is  Iw,P  =  mwl2.  If  the  brass  object  is  a  washer  with  an  inner  radius  ri   and  outer 
radius  r  , then moment of inertia about its center of mass given by  I  =  1 m r

expression Iw,P = mwl2 ? 

Solution: 

In Problem 1, you showed that the moment of inertia of a washer about the center of mass is

Problem 3: Stall Torque of Motor 

The  following  simple  experiment  can measure  the  stall  torque  of  a motor.  (See  sketch.) A mass 
m  is attached to one end of a thread. The other end of the thread is attached to the motor shaft so 
that when  the motor  turns,  the  thread will wind around  the motor  shaft. The motor  shaft without 
thread  has  radius  r0  = 1.2 ×10−3 m  .  Assume  the  thread  winds  evenly  effectively  increasing  the 
radius of the shaft. Eventually the motor will stall.  

a)	 Suppose  a  mass  m  = 5.0 ×10−  kg
stalls  the  motor  when  the  wound  thread  has  an  outer 
2
radius of  rf  = 2.4 ×10−3 m  . Calculate the stall torque.  

Answer: 

b)  Suppose 
the  motor  has  an  unloaded 
full 
throttle  angular 
frequency  of 
ω = 2πf 0  = 2π( 6.0
Hz )
 
 
×10
(unloaded  means  that  the  motor  is  not  applying  any 
1

torque).  Suppose  the  relation  between  angular  frequency ω and  the  applied  torque τ of 
the motor is given by the relation  

− b
ω=ω  τ 
0 
s kg   m  
where  b   is a constant with units 
. Using your result from part a), calculate  the 
2
− 
constant  b . Make a graph of ω vs. τ. 

Answer:

c)  Graph the power output of the motor vs. angular frequencyω. At what angular frequency 
is  the  power maximum? What  is  the  power  output  at  that maximum? Briefly  explain  the 
shape  of  your  graph.  In  particular,  explain  the  power  output  at  the  extremes τ= 0  and 
τ=τstall   . 

Answer: 

d)  What torque does the motor put out at its maximum power output?

Problem 4 (Conservation of Angular Momentum) 

A  meteor  of  mass  m  = 2.1  1013  kg
  is  approaching  earth  as  shown  on  the  sketch.  The  radius  of 
×
the  earth  is  r  = 6.37 ×106  m  .  The  mass  of  the  earth  is  m  = 5.98 ×1024  kg
.  Suppose  the  meteor 
e	
e
has  an  initial  speed  of  v0  = 1.0 ×101 
m
s
. Assume  that  the meteor  started very  far  away  from  the 
earth. Suppose  the meteor  just grazes  the earth. The  initial moment arm of  the meteor  ( h  on  the 
sketch)  is  called  the  impact  parameter. You may  ignore  all  other  gravitational  forces  except  the 
earth. The effective target size of the earth as initially seen by the meteor is the area πh 2 . 

a)  Draw a force diagram for the forces acting on the meteor. 

b)	 Can  you  find  a  point  about  which  the  gravitational  torque  of  the  earth’s  force  on  the 
meteor is zero for the entire orbit of the meteor? 

Answer: 

c)	 What  is  the  initial  angular momentum  and  final  angular momentum  (when  it  just  grazes 
the earth) of the meteor? 

Answer:

d)  Apply  conservation  of  angular  momentum  to  find  a  relationship  between  the  meteor’s 
final velocity and the impact parameter  h . 

Answer: 

e)  Apply  the constant energy relation  to find a relationship between the final velocity of the 
meteor and the initial velocity of the meteor. 

Answer: 

f)	 Use  your  results  in  parts  d)  and  e)  to  calculate  the  impact  parameter  and  the  effective 
target size of the earth.

Problem 5:  Platform Diving 

In  the  2002 World  Cup  Trials,  Kyle  Prandi  set  up  a  diving  record  with  a  back  3  ½  somersault 
pike  from  the 10 m board. He pushed off  from  the board  at  an  angle of θ = 46     with an  initial 
0
0 
speed  v  = 3.3 m/s .  You  may  assume  that  his  body  was  completely  straight  with  his  arms 
0 
stretched above his head when he jumped.  

He took .33 seconds to enter into a tuck after completing ½ a rotation. At the .49 second mark he 
returned  to  his  starting  height. Once  in  a  full  tuck, he  completed 2  revolutions  at  the 1.1  second 
mark.  At  that  point  he  began  to  straighten  out  which  he  finished  at  the  1.47  second  mark  after 
making  ¼  rotation.  He  made  1  more  rotation,  when  his  fingers  touched  the  water  1.65  seconds 
after he  left  the platform. When he  touched  the surface his  legs were bent but his center of mass 
was 1.3 m above  the surface of  the water. Kyle  is 1.7 m  long and when his arms are straight out 
above  his  head,  his  length  is  2.2  m.  His  mass  is  63  kg.  His  center  of  mass  is  0.9  m  above  his 
soles. You may see the jump at
