Mindmapping

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Brainstorming: MindMapping (by Tony Buzan)

! From sequential thinking and note taking 
to tree structures
! Rearrange ideas
! Establish connections
! Let associations emerge

Day 4.5

3

Mindmapping

! A whole-brain 
alternative to 
linear thinking
! Retain both the 
overall picture 
and the details
! Promote 
associations

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! You see what you 
know and where the 
gaps are
! Clears your mind of 
mental clutter
! It works well for 
group brainstorming

Communication Tools

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Transportation Policy depends to a great extent 
on two-way communications:
! Policy analysts "# elected officials
! Elected officials "# other politicians
! Elected officials "# mass media
! Public at large "# elected officials
! …………………. "# ………………….
! But impact of a message is based on:
! words (7%), 
! how words are said (38%), and, 
! non verbal clues (55%)

How Do you Visualize Change???
Remember that simulations could be critical

Models and Forecasting…

! Forecasting:
! Short term 
extrapolation:The future on 
the basis of the past
! Applicable to slow 
incremental change
! The problem is that people 
believe that this situation 
will continue for ever
! But…

Forecasting

Scenarios

uncertainty

predictability

Time into the future

Day 4.5

…And Scenarios

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! A conceptual description of the future based on 
cause and effect
! Invent and analyze several stories of equally 
plausible futures to bring forward surprises and 
unexpected leaps of understanding
! Goal is not to create a future, nor to choose the 
most probable one, but to make strategic 
decisions that will be sound (or robust) 
under all plausible futures

Day 4.5

12

Scenarios: Why?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! History is a continuum of pattern breaks
! We react to uncertainty thru denial                   
(that is why a quantitative model is so reassuring!)
! But we can’t predict the future with certainty
! By providing alternative images of the future:
! We go from facts into perceptions, and,
! Open multiple perspectives
! Mental models, and myths, control what you do 
and keep you from raising the rightquestions
! Goal: Suspend disbelief in a story long enough to 
appreciate its potential impact

Day 4.5

13

Scenarios: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Examine the environment in which your 
actions will take place and see how 
those actions will fit in the prevailing 
forces, trends, attitudes and influences
! Identify driving forces and critical 
uncertainties
! Challenge prevailing mental modes
! Rehearse the implications

Day 4.5

14

Scenarios: Stages

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

2.

1.

Identify focal issue or decision
Identify driving forces in the local environment
Identify driving forces in the macro environment
3.
4. Rank the importance and uncertainty of each
Select scenario logics (so as to tell a story)
5.
Flesh-out the scenario in terms of driving forces
6.
7. Analyze implications
8. Define leading indicators for monitoring

Day 4.5

15

Scenarios: Rules

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Goal: 
! Required decisions under each scenario? Vulnerabilities? 
Can we control the key driving forces?…
! Good scenarios should be plausible, but also 
surprising by breaking old stereotypes
! Do not assign probabilities to each alternative 
scenario
! Assign a name to each scenario
! A total of 3-4 scenarios: Not just two extremes 
plus a probableone. Good to have a wildcard

Day 4.5

Reading on Scenarios

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! “The Art of the Long View” by Peter 
Schwartz
! “Scenarios: The Art of Strategic 
Conversation” by Kees van der Heijden

Both authors work for the Global Business 
Network (www.gbn.org) and come from the 
Shell Planning Group

Scenarios …and Demographics

! Fertility rate:
! Avg no. of children  
born to women over 
their lifetime
! Birth rate:
! Total no of births 
divided by the size 
of the population
! Canada claims a 
low fertility rate 
(1.7) but a high 
birth rate. How 
come?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Scenarios …and Demographics

! According to Professor David K. Foot (“Boom, 
Bust and Echo”), future scenarios entail some 
certainty: In 10 yrs, we will all be 10 yrs older
! Demographics, not only predictable, but 
inevitable. The most powerful, yet underutilized 
tool, to understand the past and foretell the 
future
! Age is a good predictor of behavior… and 
therefore, a good forecasting tool

Day 4.5

19

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Scenarios …and Demographics

! Is age a good predictor for:
! Real estate?
! Transit use?
! Use of hard drugs?
! If age is a good predictor, 
then:
! Establish number of people in 
each age group
! Define probability for each age 
group, of participation in a 
given behavior or activity

Day 4.5

A 19 yr old has little money
and plenty of time to wait
in the bus stop
