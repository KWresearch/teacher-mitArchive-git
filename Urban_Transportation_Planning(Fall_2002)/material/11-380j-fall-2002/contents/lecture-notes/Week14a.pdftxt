Why Traffic Calming?

! The faster you go, the higher 
the probability of an accident, 
as:

! Your vision focus narrows with 
speed
! For a given reaction time, 
distance covered is proportional 
to speed
! The faster you go, the longer 
the stopping distance

Why Traffic Calming?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! The faster you go, the higher the 
seriousness of an accident
! For instance, the kinetic energy of an 
automobile (1.2 tons at 35 mph) is at 
least 150 times higher than for a 
pedestrian (180 pounds) at 3 mph
! Such a collision at:
! 20 mph, means bone fractures and 
concussions
! Between 20-30 mph, medium seriousness
! More than 30 mph, very high probability of 
either death or permanent disability

Why Traffic Calming?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! To avoid segregation of public 
spaces and maintain its 
livability
! Underpasses, skywalks and 
other “solutions”, do not 
provide “eyes on the street”

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! When you drive at 
30 mph, you tend 
to focus your sight 
far ahead

! And you narrow 
the sight area

! You fail to see the 
surroundings

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! But if you drive 
at 20 mph, you 
start to see 
what lies on 
the sides

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! The basic idea is to 
change the perceptions of 
the driver through the 
introduction of new 
physical features
! These self-enforcing
features tend to break 
the infinite continuity that 
encourages speed with or 
without speed warnings

Traffic Calming: How?

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Raised crosswalks
! Narrower pavement widths
! Chicanes through urban furniture or parking 
! Changes in the pavement texture
! Mini-roundabouts
! Cul-de-sacs
! Eliminating some movements
! Civilizedgreen waves
! ……………………………….

Traffic Calming: How?
Raised crosswalks

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Double function
! You accommodate to gradient:
! 7% for 40-45 km/hr
! 10% for 30 km/hr
! 12% for 25 km/hr or less
! Every 60-100 meters plus proper 
warning
! The top needs a minimum width, 
specially for buses

Traffic Calming: How?
Raised intersections

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! The automobile 
finds itself in 
neutral grounds…

Traffic Calming: How?
Bulb-outs

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Pros:
! Decrease 
exposure
! Higher visibility 
specially for 
children
! Easy 
implementation

Traffic Calming: How?
Civilized Green Waves

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

They need low cycles to avoid
late-comers driving fast (at night)

Fri Dec 6

Traffic Calming: How?
CivilizedGreen Waves

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Plus often changes in 
horizontal 
alignment, refuge 
islands, narrowing 
the road width…

Fri Dec 6

22

Traffic Calming: How?
CivilizedPedestrian signals

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Longer timing for 
pedestrians
! Lower total cycles
! Green waves for 
pedestrian 
movements

Fri Dec 6

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Traffic Calming: How?
Narrowing the pavement

! Improving public 
spaces:
! New urban furniture, 
including trees
! New activities
! Weather shelters to 
encourage people use 
of the streets

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Traffic Calming: How?

! Not an end by itself, just 
the means to an end
! It must be accompanied by 
other measures to improve 
the urban environment so 
as to encourage more 
pedestrians

Design Criteria

! Including other 
important issues:
! Location
! Self-enforcement
! Liability
! Reversibility
! Public participation
! Overall traffic scheme
! Traffic deviated to other 
areas

Fri Dec 6

Location

! Sensitive areas:
! Schools
! Transit stations
! Senior citizens
! Areas with high 
accident rates 
! High speeds 
eg.transition
areas from the 
expressway into 
the urban 
network

Traffic Calming: The Process

Fri Dec 6

31

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Not an easy process at the beginning

My good friend the
city engineer...

Fri Dec 6

32

But once you begin...

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! There is not enough 
money to 
accommodate all 
the requests
! The best is the 
change in 
behavioral patterns

Fri Dec 6

33

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Look for an easy winner...

! Nothing like a school

Fri Dec 6

34

Once they try...

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! “Bulb-outs ”… everywhere
! Today a pedestrianized plaza

Fri Dec 6

35

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Always go easy at the beginning...

! Even if you have 
to cheat a bit like 
my good friend 
Jan Gehl…

In a nutshell, ten rules

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

1. Every change is hard to implement
2. Start by the easiest job
3. You need allies
4. You have to minimize risks
5. Technical competence a must
6. Not isolated measures, but packages
7. Short term results, a must
8. But don’t forget to plant a few seeds
9. Everyone sees things differently
10. Success is hard to measure
But if you want, you can!
