The Automobile - Infrastructure

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Road system:
! Hierarchical system:
! From turnpike to local street
! From unimpeded movement to 
access to properties
! Uninterrupted segments:
! Turnpike (access control)
! Interrupted segments:
! Traffic signals, stops…

Mobility

Arterials

Collectors

Land Access

Locals

The Automobile + Infrastructure

! Other support systems:
! Traffic Police
! Traffic Management Centers
! Parking
! Gas stations
! Garages

The Automobile – Demand Served

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! HBW: Home-based work
! HBO: Home-based other:
! Shopping trips
! School trips
! Personal and recreational trips
! NHB: Not home-based (ie: Business trips)

HBW represents less than 35%
Peak-spreading and latent demand

Highway Capacity

! The Power of Little 
Numbers 
! Sophisticated models 
are indeed needed
! But so, are little 
numbers in the back of 
an envelope

! Who wants to be taken 
for a ride?

Automobile Capacity = 
Throughput  (Veh/hr/ln)

Level-Of-Service (LOS)
= Flow/Capacity
(or I/C  or V/C)

Level of Service A

Notice density and spacing 
among vehicles

LOS: A changing reality

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Human adaptation is the key… 
! From infrastructure construction to 
management of the existing system
! The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 
speed-flow curve:
! People learning to drive congested roads
! The initial dream of ITS

The Automobile – Capacity

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Vehicle throughput in controlled 
sections:
! Traffic signals, roundabouts, all-stops…
! Automobiles and trucks – reaction times
! Saturation and gridlock

The Automobile – Capacity

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! PEOPLE throughput :
! Vehicle throughput times OCCUPANCY
! Auto-occupancy (a non-technical issue)
! HBW…         1.1
! HBO-shop…  1.4
! HBO-social… 1.7
! NHB……       1.6

Day 4

The Automobile – Levels-Of-Service

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! The power of A to F
! From spot values to travel times
! Living under saturated conditions

The Automobile – Costs

! Fixed Costs:
! Vehicle purchase
! Insurance

Not considered out-of-pocket expenses

Day 4

17

The Automobile – Costs

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Variables Costs:
! Gasoline
! Oil and maintenance
! Parking
! Tolls
! Automobile Industry -> Service Economy

Ratio between Fixed and Variable Costs

Day 4

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

The Automobile – Costs

! Social costs:
! Roads
! Management of road system
! Environmental costs:
! Accidents (Swedish Govt.)
! Noise  (pedestrian areas)
! Air pollution: cold-start, f(speed)
! Land consumed 
! Energy
! Segregation
! ………………

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
Transit – Demand Served

! HBW represents > 50%
! Peak hours
! Peak directional flows

Easy to accept overcrowding at peak to justify 
service during off-peak hours

Day 4

21

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Transit - Capacity

! Vehicle size
! Headway (and fleet size)
! Commercial speed

Day 4

22

Transit - LOS

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

LOS related to Capacity and Quality of Service

Day 4

23

Transit - LOS

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Occupancy
! Hours of service
! Headway
! Lateness or reliability
! Comfort
! …. And other quality-related aspects

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Capital Costs:
! >50-75 years horizon
! Not included in operating costs
! Operating Costs:
! Cop=Cd*veh-miles +Ct*veh-hr + Cs*fleet
! Environmental Costs:
! Accident rate
! Noise, soot…

Day 4

27

Buses

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Flexibility for route adjustments
! Closer stop spacing
! In search of higher quality:
! Low floor buses for an aging population
! Bus stops:
! Real time info on arrivals (and eventually downstream)
! Maps, transfers, info on ticketing and validation

Day 4

28

Buses

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Buses

! Capacity:
! Bus type and size:
! Easy access and egress
! No of doors
