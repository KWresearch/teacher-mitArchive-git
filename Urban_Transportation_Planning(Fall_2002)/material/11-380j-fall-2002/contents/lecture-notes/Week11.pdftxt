Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
ITS as a Tool - Main Objectives?

! To increase road capacity at low cost?
! Or, just an opportunity to promote a more 
efficient and diversified transport system?
! Should it be used to enhance mobility --
Or to improve accessibility? Or perhaps, just 
to substitute some trips on certain days?

Thur Nov 14

ITS Deployment

! ITS Deployment 
requires:
! Important organizational 
changes
! A new path from control 
to sharing information
! A transition from 
hierarchical systems to 
networks

ITS Integration: A bumpy road

! Let’s share information:
! The public needs a single source of multi-
modal information
! The operators can benefit by sharing real 
time info
! Let’s decide with others in mind:
! Impacts or synergies on third parties?
! Modularity of equipment and architecture?

ITS Integration: A bumpy road

ITS is not a technical issue but a new 
frame for:
> Voluntary cooperation
> Seeing the big picture
> Bringing others into the decision process
> Adopting necessary new policies

ITS Deployment

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

In short, ITS other than short-term mitigation 
tools, may serve :
$ To become catalysts for change 
$ To establish new two-way relationships
$ To create new spaces for collaboration
$ To provide a global vision of the transport 
system

… But, ITS involves a long complex and 
difficult path, which has to be taken

Final thought

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! What do you think…
! Is ITS good or bad?
! Does it help to bring down some barriers?
! Is technology in general or bad?

! The trouble is that we have to master the 
technology
! … And to top it off, it requires wisdom

Monthly on Home Security
