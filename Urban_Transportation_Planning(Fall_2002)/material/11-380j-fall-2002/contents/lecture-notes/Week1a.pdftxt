Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

“It is wonderful when a calculation is 
made, how little the mind is actually 
employed in the discharge of any 
profession”

- Dr. Samuel Johnson

That is why I am here today with no answers 
but rather with just lots of questions

Transit

Is it a panacea?

A tram with say 230 
riders is equivalent to 
177 automobiles
with an occupancy 
ratio of 1.3... 
provided they are 
all choice riders

Transit

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002
