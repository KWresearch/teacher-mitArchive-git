Transport and Land Uses

! Let us design a new freeway…
! Present traffic on existing roads?
! Design speed? Desired LOS? Budget?
! But…
! How many new dwellings will be built nearby?
! How many office bldgs? Technology parks?
! How many parking places are needed?
! What size for the new shopping center?
! ………??
! From road builders to urban planners!

Transport and Land Uses

! Thanks to 
J.Kenworthy and F. 
Laube – “The 
Millennium Cities. 
Data base for 
Sustainable 
Transport” 
sponsored by the 
UITP, we know 
that some 
parameters are 
very critical

Urban Density is critical…

The higher the density, the higher…

… the percentage of sustainable modes

Job density is also a critical parameter

Problems

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Triggers:
! Housing density
! Suburban job centers
! Segregation of land uses
! Parking availability and cost
! Results:
! Unbalanced modal split
! Increased economic, environmental and social 
costs

Day 6

Better Processes

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Transport projects opportunities:
! Development (macro):
! Strategic and long-term
! Examples like Curitiba, Toronto, Stockholm…
! Self-containment vs dispersal
! Urban growth along axes through zoning and land-
use incentives
! Rehabilitation (micro):
! Tactical, short term but also effective
! In-fill development vs new demand management

Day 6

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Better Processes

! Development (macro):
! Curitiba as an example

Day 6

15

Better Processes

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Rehabilitation (micro):
! It can be implemented rather quickly
! Local actions spilling over the metropolitan scale
! Zürich’s per capita transit trips above Curitiba’s
! Any transport project – however minor – can 
be approached as an improvement 
opportunity, for instance:
! Improving a traffic intersection and…
! The excuse of a new Light Rail

stop traffic growth

Transport Solutions

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Car Parking:
! Critical for modal split
! To be seen in a wider context than just on-
site provision
! Complementary measures (pedestrian 
improvements, transit…) a must
! On-site parking to distinguish between 
shoppers and commuters

Day 6

Transport Solutions

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Park-Ride facilities:
! Visible, well signed and secure
! Again to be seen in a larger context
! It should not preclude high-density 
development near rail stations
! Price should be lower than downtown
! Shuttle service of prime quality: frequent 
service, priority to reach downtown faster 
than by car (similar to an airport car rental shuttle)

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Traffic Management:
! Traffic Calming a first step:
! It fosters more convivial public spaces
! It triggers a new relationship between 
pedestrians and cars
! It facilitates biking
! Other steps:
! To divert through traffic
! Priority for bus or LRT service

Day 6

Transport Solutions

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Pedestrians and 
Cyclists:
! O-D pathing
! Road crossings
! Street furniture
! Traffic calming
! Balanced activities 
throughout the day
! Public activities

Best Practices

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! The Netherlands ABC location policy:
! Locations:
! A: main transit hub – few parking - downtown
! B: district center or small town bus junction
! C: Not served by transit
! Activities:
! A: People intensive land uses
! B: Commercial and service activities with low 
turnout (e.g..: car sales, furniture dealers…)
! C: Goods intensive uses

! Strict parking policy
! 5 park-and-ride sites
! Reallocation of road space among buses, cyclists 
and pedestrians
! Traffic calming measures: 30 mph on major radials 
and 20 mph, elsewhere
! Safe and continuous cycle network
! Implementation of a pedestrian route network 
throughout the city

Day 6

37

Best Practices

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

! Global Vision, Local Action… 
! Don’t let the global vision rob you from 
opportunities for local change
! Local change, however limited, is important:
! We need early winners to jumpstart a new process
! Small changes may become showcases
! Don´t forget we need a new model…
! To start a process… more effective
than relying only on end-state planning

A Closing Thought

Urban Transportation Planning – Fall 2002

Do we have to resign ourselves to the 
role of the frog1? Or, can we act now?
