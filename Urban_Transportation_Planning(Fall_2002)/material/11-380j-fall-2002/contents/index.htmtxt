***** Course Description *****
This class is an introduction to planning transportation in metropolitan areas.
The approach, while rooted on the analytical tools which estimate outcomes
andÂ alternatives,Â is holistic. This means starting from a scan of the site,
its history and its current trends, in order to frame properly the problem,
including the relevant actors, institutions, roles and interests. The design
and evaluation of alternatives considers this complexity, in addition to
construction, operation and maintenance issues.Â  The decision-makingÂ and
implementation process, including the needed feedback mechanisms, focuses as
well on the need to build constituencies and alliances.
The course topics include the history of urban transportation, highway finance,
environmental and planning regulations, air quality, modal characteristics,
land use and transportation interaction and emerging information technologies
for transportation planning. Students either with a primary or peripheral
interest in transportation are equally welcome.
The course uses examples from the Boston metropolitan area extensively, both
because of its proximity and the strong influence Boston has had on US
transport policy. In parallel, examples from other countries describe the
challenges faced elsewhere, as well as lessons learned. There will be walking
tours of several transportation sites in Boston.
