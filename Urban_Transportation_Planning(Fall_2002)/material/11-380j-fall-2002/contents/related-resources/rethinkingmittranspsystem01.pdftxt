Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

Introduction 

“Our Institute  is undergoing a  transformation  -- a physical  transformation of new 
buildings, academic centers, activities complexes, and residential  housing.  At  the same 
time,  the City of Cambridge  is  changing, maturing  as  a  center  for high - tech and 
biotechnology as old  industrial sites are converted  to office and biochemical  lab use.  As 
the face of M.I.T. grows and changes, we must  look  to  the futur e of our “evolving 
campus”  in  the context of an evolving city. 

Along  the northern edge of our campus, we have  the  tremendous opportunity  to weave 
new connections in the fabric of Cambridge.  The Vassar Street rail corridor has long 
been  the center of a scar  that  divides  the main M.I.T.  campus  from  the  rest  of  the City  of 
Cambridge, strewn with empty lots and physically separated by an active rail line.  With 
the development of our campus  reaching  into and beyond  this  scar, we have  the unique 
opportunity to create new connections and new neighborhood where only vacant 
industrial  brownfields  now  exist1”. 

MIT is a world institution which focuses on technology, and which has a stated commitment to 
sustainable development and greenhouse gas emission reductio n,  through decreased  reliance on 
the auto and  increased use of  transit.  Thus MIT can set an example of sustainable urban form 
that  will  influence  patterns  world -wide.  In particular,  the perceptions which MIT  students 
develop are relevant, as  they will become leaders throughout the world. 

The course 1.252/11.380J – Urban Transportation Planning, offered  last fall, featured an 
application of  these principles  to MIT’s urban environment. In  this context,  this report 
summarizes the discussions  held in class on MIT’s problems and opportunities as well as  the 
recommendations contained in the reports written by the students  who took the course. 

These ideas are organized  as follows: 
•  General  recommendations  (“Cross-Cutting Issues”) requiring a paradigm shift  towards a 
more sustainable  form of mobility,  involvement  in  the Urban Ring planning process and 
architectural coherence  in favor of pedestrian access and  integration of surrounding urban 
activities. 
•	 Specific  recommendations on Massachusetts Avenue, Vassar Street, Memorial Drive and 
Kendall Square.  These range from traffic calming measures to a more balanced and 
agreeable  distribution  of  public  space

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

“Transportation  remains a key  force  in  shaping  the campus, because of  its urban  location. The 
campus  is  not  ga ted, and forms a contiguous part of the urban fabric in eastern Cambridge. It is 
because of  this continuity with  the city  that MIT  is bound  to work with  the city of Cambridge 
towards  common  goals  that  benefit  both  communities” 2 . 

It  is pertinent  to  remembe r that: 

“The Institute recognizes  that, as one of  the world's preeminent problem solvers,  it must 
perpetually  reinvent  itself.”3 

As editors, we would be very pleased if this report would fit-in with that tradition and lead to 
the establishment of a proce ss between  the MIT community,  the MIT  institution,  the MDC,  the 
Secretary of Environmental Affairs,  and  the City of Cambridge,  following  the guidelines 
suggested herein.  We feel that this report could well serve as a starting point for that process. 
Furthermore, we hope that an early implementation of the planned pedestrian safety steps would 
send  a  strong  signal  that progress  is  a priority  and  is  indeed possible.

Cross-cutting  issues 

The Challenge 

1. 

MIT  is a major  institution which needs  to  integrate   four aspects of  its  functioning: 

a.  internal; 
b. 
interactive with  business,  other  universities; 
c.  co- existence or  synergy with neighbors 
d.  growth 

2.	

MIT  is also a world  institution which  focuses on  technology,  the main driver of economic 
progress and simultaneously  a major  driver  of  environmental  degradation. 

a.	

the perceptions MIT students develop are highly  relevant, as  these students will become 
leaders throughout the world. 

b.	 MIT can set an example of sustainable urban form that will influence patterns world-
wide. 

3.	

4.	

MIT has a stated commitment to sustainable development and greenhouse gas emission 
reduction, decreased reliance on  the auto, and  increased use of  transit. 

MIT needs  to  interact with a business and  technology community which  is dispersed 
throughout an  au to- dependent metropolitan area, and depends on a  teaching and  research 
base which  is often  suburban.  While  it  is desirable  to  reduce unnecessary  auto use, MIT  is  in 
competition  for  talent and must provide some convenient auto access, and both commuter 
and visitor parking (visitor parking  is  in particularly short supply). 

5. 

MIT depends on access to the airport. 

1.252/11.380J - Urban Transportation Planning

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

The Opportunities 

1.	 Many MIT students and support staff have reasonably short convenient walk, transit, and 
bicycle options, particularly  to  the  northwest, where  the combination of Red Line and 
commuter rail provides access to a variety of urban and suburban housing choices. 

2.	 The proposed Urban Ring  transit service could make  transit substantially more convenient 
for a broader  range of choices, by expanding easy transit access to the Orange and Green 
Lines, the northern, western, and southwestern commuter rail services, and the airport. 

3.	 The Mass Pike Allston  interchange brings auto and  truck access close  to MIT, but creates 
congestion and conflict with Cambridge  residential  uses.  The Big Dig will make MIT more 
accessible to I-93N and I-93S, and Logan by auto and cab, but  the access path  to MIT  is not 
clearly  defined. 

4.  The Charles River is a spectacular environmental asset of great imageability. 

5.	 MIT does not  support  the housing needs of  its undergraduates, graduate  students,  faculty or 
staff, placing a burden on affordable urban housing.  It is publicly committed to increased 
student housing. 

6.	 MIT controls a significant amount of urban real estate , some in low efficiency land uses such 
as  surface parking. 

7.	 MIT  is growing, and constantly under construction.  This provides an opportunity  to "grow 
smart", achieving critical density for transit and reducing automobile parking.  It also means 
that constr uction disruption is a permanent condition, so a plan must include redundancy to 
accommodate key movements. 

1.252/11.380J - Urban Transportation Planning 

6 

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

The General Recommendations 

1.	 To make a significant demonstration of pragmatic sustainability and smart growth, MIT 
needs a "paradigm shift ", to  grow while  reducing generation of air pollution and greenhouse 
gases significantly; scenarios for 10%, 25%, and 50%  reduction would help to establish 
parameters  for a 10  to 15 year evolution. 

2.  Building blocks for achieving such reduction might include: 

•	 negotiating  a  group purchase  of  a University T Pass with  the MBTA,  to provide 
all MIT students, faculty, and staff free passes for the T. 

•	

•	

•	

the  number  of  parking  spaces  should  be  steadily  reduced,  and  be  re-prioritized 
for  visitor  and  short-term  use.
 
(Cambridge  needs 
to  develop  clear 
implementation rules for its Clean Air Act parking freeze substitute.) 

the  amount  of  student,  faculty,  staff,  and  general  affordable  housing  within 
walking distance should grow dramatically 

the  quality  of  transit  service,  pedestrian  safety  and  quality,  and  bicycle  safety 
and  quality,  should  improve  each  year.  A  set  of  pertinent  indicators  should  be 
established to gauge progress towards these goals. 

•	 architectural policies at MIT, which are quite eclectic and individualistic, need to 
be  revised  to  enhance  pedestrian  access,  consistent  with  universal  design 
principles. 

•	 A well-publicized and vigorous interactive process within the MIT community to 
assist  in  the  choice  of  strategies  to  achieve  improvement,  and  develop  political 
support  for  decisions.  Interaction  with  neighbors,  the  cities  of  Cambridge  and 
Boston, and State agencies such as MBTA and MDC are essential to success. 

•	 Systematic  measurements  of  progress  and  evaluation  with  public  discussion  of 
results  and  revisions  in  techniques  will  be  periodically  required  to  maintain 
commitment and effectiveness.

Re-Design of Massachusetts Avenue 

Pedestrian quality, public  transportation priority,  and bicycle  friendliness  are not  consistent 
priorities at present. 

77 Mass Ave: 
information, 
leaky  bus  shelters,  scant 
 
Today:
reasonable  pedestrian  safety  and  highly-imageable 
sense of grand entrance. 

Options: 

A.	 depressing  the  street  would  alienate  the 
pedestrian  level  from  the  buses,  cabs,  falafel 
trucks,  and  bicycle  routes  that  now  interact 
reasonably  well,  and  involve  the  disruption  of  massive  sewer  lines  now  being 
installed; Amherst St. access would be permanently disrupted.  Construction  impacts 
would be extremely high, in terms of cost, disruption, and  length of time. 

B.	

improving  the  existing  street  could  include  providing  bus/bicycle  lanes,  pedestrian 
bulb  outs,  state-of-the-art  bus  shelter  with  "next  bus"  information,  and  a  substantial 
improvement  to  the  #1  bus  (Dudley  to  Harvard),  with  improved  frequency  and 
schedule  adherence  (possibly  integrating  the  CT-1  with  the  1),  and  by  MIT 
participating in Harvard's privately-run shuttle service. 

C.	 providing  a  pedestrian  overpass  directly  from  the  first  floor  MIT  level  to  the  upper 
plaza  level  at  the  Student  Center,  that  might  spring  from  one  side  of  the  grand 
staircase  in  a  slight  arch  shape,  incorporating bus  and  taxi waiting  shelter under  it  at 
the  street  level,  complementing  but  not  replacing  the  at -grade  pedestrian  crossing. 
This  could  be  considered  to  provide  a  sort  of  signature  sculpture  celebrating  the 
connection of the two halves of the campus, but at a more modest cost and disruption 
than  depressing  the  street.  (On  the  other  hand,  it  might  reduce  the  critical  mass  of 
pedestrians at grade, and become the  excuse to increase auto orientation of the street.)

Mass Ave and Memorial Drive 
Today:   the  pedestrian  hazards  are  unacceptable,  at  a  minimum  traffic  signals  to  protect 
pedestrians and bicycles crossing Mass Ave along the Charles should be provided immediately. 

Recommendations: 

A .	 the  median  should  be  removed,  to  allow 
eastbound  Memorial  Drive  traffic  to  turn  left 
onto  Mass  Ave  (and  to  access  MIT),  and 
southbound  Mass  Ave  traffic  to  turn  left  onto 
Memorial  Drive  eastbound,  to  clarify  access  to 
and  egress  from Mass Ave  (and MIT).  The  lack 
of  provision  for  these  movements  creates  hazardous  conditions  elsewhere  on 
Massachusetts Avenue and Memorial Drive.  The  left  turn  from northbound Mass Ave 
to  westbound Memorial  Drive  could  be  provided  at  Amherst  and  Vassar Streets, with 
proper  signage,  if  permitting  left  turns  at  Memorial  Drive  would  overload  the 
intersection.  A full traffic analysis of the intersection would be required to determine if 
all  four  left  turns  could  be  permitted  at  the  intersection.  Having  some  automobile 
movements at the intersection at the bridge will reinforce the traffic light for pedestrians, 
and  calm  the  racing  that  occurs  on  the  bridge.  Pedestrian  and  bicycle  connections  to 
Boston are important. 

B.	 bicycle  lane  or  bus/bicycle  lane  treatment  of  Mass  Ave  must  continue  across  the 
Harvard  Bridge,  both  to  calm  auto  speeds  on  the  excessively  wide  bridge,  and  to 
provide  safety  for  bicycles  connecting  to  Boston  and  the  Storrow  bicycle  paths,  and  to 
eliminate the hazardous bicycle/pedestrian conflicts on the sidewalks. 

C . 	 the  intersection  at  Amherst  Street  needs  to  be  integrated  with  the  Memorial  Drive 
intersection, and include a left-turning lane for northbound Mass Ave to Amherst Street 
(and  westbound  Memorial  Drive)  lane.  Pedestrian  crossings  at  Mass  Ave  at  both  the 
MIT  and  river  sides  of Memorial  drive  and  on Amherst  Street  are  very  important  and 
require exclusive pedestrian phases.

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

Mass Ave and Vassar Street 
Today: Current pedestrian conditions are unacceptable.  Reintroducing an exclus ive pedestrian 
phase, and "no right turn on red" restrictions are needed to calm it down immediately. 

Recommendations: 

A .	 whether  the  "Urban  Ring"  is  eventually  to  be  BRT  on Vassar  Street,  BRT  or  LRT  on  the 
railroad,  or  BRT  or  LRT  in  a  grade-separated  under pass,  today  it  is  the  CT-2  bus  at 
Vassar. This requires bus shelters for both the CT-2 and #1 bus services, and a "cleaning 
up"  of  the  "street  and  sidewalkscape" 
here in the immediate future. 

B.	

the 
bus/bicycle/pedestrian 
redevelopment  of Mass Avenue  needs  to 
be  extended  to  Lafayette  Square  and 
Central  Square. 
(It  appears  that  this  is 
happening.) 

C . 	 Mass  Avenue  is  so  important  to  the 
activity  pattern  of  the  MIT  community 
today,  that  it  is  the  best  opportunity  to 
engage  the attention of students,  faculty, 
and  sta ff  in  an  interactive  participatory 
process. 
It  ought  to  be  possible  to 
develop  an  interactive  process  with  not 
only  "traditional"  methods,  with  the 
essential  face-to-face  workshops  and 
meetings, and displays in the entrance at 
77 Mass Ave and  the Student  Center.  It 
ought  to  be  possible  to  organize  an 
international  MIT  world  community 
interaction  via  email,  with  cutting-edge 
visualization  tools  to  test  reaction  to 
alternative  proposals  and  seek  new 
alternatives.  DUSP and the Media Lab, as well as CTS, should be major assets of MIT in 
developing  a  plan  for  the  improvement  of  Mass  Avenue  that  seriously  engages  the 
entire community and sets the stage for similar efforts on other campus issues. 

http://www.ai.mit.edu/~ychang/transportation/urbanring.html 

D.	 mid -range,  it  is extremely  important  for  land use at  the  four corners of  the  intersection, all 
of which  are  controlled  by MIT,  to  be  recycled  into more  pedestrian- oriented active uses, 
to  celebrate  the policy  that Vassar Street  is  to be  a more  important pedestrian  access.

Re-conceptualizing the relationship to the Charles River and 
Memorial Drive 

The  Charles  River  is  an  incredible  amenity  for  MIT,  and  the  symbolic  front  door  of  the 
university,  but  the  erosion  of  pedestrian  safety  and  access  to MIT  caused  by  the  existing  high-
speed auto orientation of the roadway needs to be dramatically reversed. 

The  fact  that  it  has  taken  the  MDC  years  to  respond  to  the  pedestrian  fatalities  and  begin  to 
install a pedestrian signal at Ames Street, while continuing to stonewall at Mass Ave (one of the 
100 worst  intersections  in Massachusetts),  is  an  embarrassment.  The MDC  is  supposed  to  be  a 
steward  of  parklands,  not  a  highway  agency.  MIT  should  directly  engage  State  Secretary  of 
Environmental Affairs Durand and Governor Swift (who is on the board of directors at MIT) to 
get reasonable attention from the MDC. 

Recommendations: 

Mass Ave/Memorial Drive intersection . 

The 
four-lane  underpass  of  Memorial  Drive  sets  a  parameter  of  speed  and  auto 
orientation  that  creates  safety  hazards  all  along  the  MIT  campus,  and  is  totally 
inconsistent  with  the  permanent  capacity  constraints  of  Memorial  Drive  further  west, 
where  the  "sycamores"  (London  Plane  Trees)  grace  the Harvard  area  of  the  river,  and  to 
the  east, where  the  traffic  lights  and  bottlenecks  near  the  Science Museum  constrain  the 
automobile.

Massachusetts Ave 

If  the  underpass  were  restricted  to 
one  moving  lane  in  each  direction, 
the  severe  hazards  to  the  west  (at 
Amherst  Alley),  and  the  three-lane 
raceway  to  the east  could be  calmed, 
producing  an  immediate  benefit  in 
terms  of  safety  and  compatibility. 
(The  current  construction,  creating  a 
left-turn  lane  to  accommodate  the 
westbound  vehicles  destined  to  U -
turn  to  access  the  Harvard  Bridge  to  Boston,  will  ease  the  westbound  hazard,  but 
exacerbate the eastbound hazard unless the intersection is signalized.  Another alternative 
would  be  to  permit  the  left  turn  from  westbound  Memorial  Drive  to  southbound  Mass 
Ave at the Mass Ave signal.)

Memorial Drive 

Ames Street, Wadsworth Street at the east end near the MIT Medical center, and Audrey Streets at west 
end   could be  signaliz ed  to  allow  auto  access  to  and  egress  from  the MIT  campus  to Memorial 
Drive. 

1.252/11.380J - Urban Transportation Planning 

11 

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

There  is  no more  imageable way  to  arrive  at MIT  by  auto  than Memorial Drive,  but  the 
modifications  to  Memorial  Drive  decades  ago  removed  the  MIT  access  features  and 
prioritized  speed on  the  roadway  to arrive at  the  eastern and western boundaries.  Auto 
access  and  turns  at  these  intersections  would  make  the  traffic  lights  "real"  and  increase 
pedestrian safety. 

Wadsworth  Street 

Kendall  Square  is  a  stone's  throw  from  the  Charles  River,  but with  no  auto  access  the 
relationship is unclear. 

Longfellow Bridge 

Access  from  Boston  to MIT  is  a  "secret"  right  turn, while  egress  from Kendall  Square  to 
Memorial  Drive  eastbound  is  impossible.  Short-range  signage  could  quickly  cure  the 
secret right turn problem.  A longer-range reconceptualization of the relationship between 
Kendall Square and Third Street to the river and Memorial Drive would require a longer-
range capital investment. 

Overpass at BU Bridge 

At the western approaches to Mass  Avenue  the  four-lane,  high -speed overpass at  the BU 
Bridge,  the  merges  with  the  connecting  ramps,  the  dangerous  unsignalized  left  turn  for 
vehicles  attempting  to  access  Vassar  Street  (caused  in  part  by  the  impossibility  of 
accessing MIT from Memorial Drive at Mass Ave or Ames Street) creates a bad situation at 
the western  gateway  to MIT  from  the Mass  Pike  interchange,  and  the  lack  of  clear  auto 
and  truck  access  to  the MIT  area  sends  regional  auto  and  truck movements  down River 
Street into the Central Square neighborhoods. 

In the short run, the overpass could be "calmed" in the eastbound direction by restricting it 
to  one  travel  lane,  and  the  left  turn  to  access Vassar  Street  either  signalized  or  prohibited 
(access to the Hyatt Hotel is signalized). 

In the longer run, the BU bridge is in very bad physical shape, creating an opportunity for 
the  entire  Charles  River  crossing,  including  the  Memorial  Drive  overpass,  the  railroad 
bridge, and the relationship to Vassar, and/or Albany Street to be totally restructured if a 
comprehensive  plan  is  developed  now .  Without  a  plan,  each  element  will  get  rebuilt 
physically locking in a dysfunctional pattern for another 50 to 100 years. 

Memorial Drive Median 

The  large  but  unusable median  of Memorial  Drive  could  be  reduced  to create more park land 
adjacent to the river, and formalizing bicycle lanes to reduce bicycle/ pedestrian conflicts.  This 

1.252/11.380J - Urban Transportation Planning 

12 

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

would  be  a  major  capital  investment,  requiring  planning,  but  is  an  opportunity  to  capture 
significantly expanded parkland adjacent to the river  -- a rare opportunity. 

Parking along Memorial Drive 

The parking along Memorial Drive, now essentially available to early-bird commuters, could be 
metered, to make it a visitor parking resource (and provide some revenue to MDC).

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

Re- conceptua lization of the Vassar Street/Railroad/Albany 
Street Corridor

This  is  an  area  of  increasing  priority  for  MIT,  as  major  new  buildings  and  re-landscaping  of  

Vassar  Street  are  underway.  The  MBTA  is  exploring  the  Urban  Ring.  The  growth  in  MIT-

related activities  in University Park  create new pressures  for pedestrian  railroad  crossings and  

new traffic generators along the major permeable interface with the Cambridge community. 

The Opportunities 
In  the short  run,  the CT- 2  bus  is  the Urban Ring  precursor, and improving its visibility and 
1.	
success is essential to both MIT, which will see dramatically improved transit accessibility, 
and the MBTA. 

2.	 Providing for an acceptable  truck route,  to relieve River Street,  is an essential good- neighbor 
responsibility  of MIT.  With  the current  fluid  land use  situation,  there  is no valid  excuse  for 
failing  to provide a  truck  route  in  the corridor  (either on Vassar or Albany Streets, or along 
the  railroad  right- of -way).  A short- term  truck  route  should be established  immediately, but it 
should be consistent with a  long-range plan that can evolve over time. 

3.  Pedestrian  (and possibly auto,  truck, and bus) crossings of  the  railroad need  to be  formalized 
and agreed to, to accommodate the growing need for interaction with the U niversity Park 
initiative. 

4.	 The short- , mid- ,  and  long- range plans for the Urban Ring and rail link in this corridor need 
to be conceptualized now  to establish a mutually compatible evolutionary path, or  it  is  likely 
that short- term actions either preclude or create major disruption problems  for  later  larger 
initiatives. 

1.252/11.380J - Urban Transportation Planning 

14 

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

The Options 
If a depressed or tunnel configuration for the essential existing rail link (and eventual 
1.	
possible BRT  or LRT Urban Ring  initiative)  is  to  be  preserved  as  an  option,  then Va ssar and 
Albany Streets will need  to be capable of serving auto, bus, and  truck needs, so  that  it will be 
possible  to handle  the complicated physical redevelopment of  the rail corridor  into a  tunnel, 
while maintaining rail service during construction, and  accommodating rail freight, 
commuter  rail, maintenance  access, possibly  inter-city rail, LRT or BRT in the completed 
configuration.  (MIT may  have  an  interest  in  a  long- range future that would allow the entire 
Albany-to-Vassar corridor to be conceptualized with no surface path in the current railroad 
alignment.) 

2.	 As the University Park-type development proceeds, creating opportunities for "walk  to MIT" 
housing, essential equity  issues of  including proportionate affordable housing, examining  the 
desirability  of  restoring  rent  control,  and  provision  of  service  jobs  and walk -to-MIT housing 
opportunities  for  traditional blue-collar Cambridge residents should be actively pursued with 
the City of Cambridge. 

The Recommendations 
1.	 MIT has been  strangely  silent on  t he Urban Ring.  There  is enormous opportunity  to  improve 
public  transportation  to  the MIT and Cambridge communities  in  this  initiative, and  it  is  the 
only opportunity to even explore the possibility of putting the existing rail link underground. 
MIT  needs   to proactively engage  in short- , mid-, and long-range  planning  process with  its 
neighbors and the MBTA. 

2.	 Vassar Street, even  if bus and  truck access  increase dramatically, will handle  far  less  traffic 
than Mass Ave, which bisects  the MIT campus, while pr oviding reasonable pedestrian safety 
and comfort, at  least at 77 Mass Ave.  The real problem  is not  the  traffic,  it  is  the  lousy 
environment created by MIT, with  lots of  "dead" buildings  such as  the parking garage and 
Metropolitan Storage.  Landscaping can't  "fix" Vassar, only  intensification of  the  land uses 
with buildings which generate  significant  activity  can  remedy  the  current unfriendly 
environment.

Kendall Square 
This is an area of great potential to implement a paradigm shift towards sustainability, but it is 
currently somewhat incoherent physically, with no clearly-articulated path to the future. 

Options and Recommendations 
1.	 The Kendall-MIT Red Line station  is  the one strong  link  to  the MBTA system at MIT, but 
Kendall  is  no Harvard  Square.  Undeveloped and underdeveloped MIT  real estate  in  the area 
is  the key  to a potential dramatic  transformation of  this situation  in  three ways:  first,  the 
incoherent relationship to the Charles River and Memorial Drive could be clarified by 
establishing  identifiable  boulevard-type connections from Broadway to Memorial Drive at 
Third Street, and two other opportunities closer to the Longfellow Bridge.  Secondly, the 
Sloan School  expansion  is  a major opportunity  to  establish  an MIT presence on  the Square. 
Thirdly,  increasing walk - to-work housing, both MIT and generally available, would 
humanize  the Square  and provide night  and weekend  activity  for  the Square  and  its public 
transportation services. 

2.  There is currently an excessive amount of off -street  parking  in  the area, given  the  level of 
transit access, and more parking being developed.  MIT needs  to control  its own parking 
demand, and to encourage its business neighbors to do the same. 

3.	 The  CT -2 bus, as precursor of  the Urban Ring, needs  to be given priority access to the T 
station and beyond to Lechmere, and that needs action now while the real estate is still fluid. 
Perhaps someday there will be a new tunnel LRT with an interchange with a new Red Line 
station at Albany/Vassar, and  that possibility should be explored seriously with MBTA.  In 
the short range, the CT- 2  is  the Urban Ring and  if  it cannot be made much more successful  it 
will dampen enthusiasm for a much larger capital investment.  Improved frequency should 
dramatically improve it.

Rethinking  the MIT Transportation  System 

4.	 Longfellow Bridge  is  the gateway  to  this part of MIT  from Boston and  the airport.  But  it  is 
currently a very auto- oriented  quasi- highway with no  sense of arrival at MIT.  In  the  short 
run,  improved  signage  for Memorial Drive, MIT and Kendall Square,  traff ic calming, 
additional pedestrian crossings, and removing the median fence could improve the situation, 
but  a  long-term game plan  to  improve  the connections between  the Square and  the river, and 
introduction of  important visible MIT buildings  is an opportunity for continuous 
improvement. 

There is major opportunity in the Square, but it can only be realized with an interactive process 
of communication with the City, business community, neighborhood residents, and the MBTA.
