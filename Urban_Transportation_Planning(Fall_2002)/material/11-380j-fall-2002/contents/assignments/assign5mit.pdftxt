Assignment #5 

Transportation at MIT 

THE TASK:  You are assigned to teams of five, to discuss issues as a group, with each student 
responsible  for  the  research  and  write-up  of  one  of  five  problem  areas.  The  task  is  to  make  a 
recommendation  to  the  President  of  MIT  which  includes  both  substantive  recommendations 
and recommendations for process.  The five specific issues are: 

1)  	

2)  	

3)  	

4)  	

5)  	

Appropriate  re-design  of  Massachusetts  Avenue. 
In  particular,  consider  the  proper 
design  at  Mass  Ave  and  Vassar  Street,  Mass  Ave  and  Memorial  Drive,  and  at  77  Mass 
Ave, including consideration of depressing Mass Ave to achieve a pedestrian connection 
similar to that at Harvard near the Law School. 

Appropriate  re-design  of  the  Vassar  Street  railroad  corridor,  including  intersections  at 
Memorial Drive/BU Bridge, Mass Ave and Main Street. 

Appropriate  re-design  of  Memorial  Drive,  including  the  Kendall  Square  area,  sailing 
pavilion, Mass Ave., Vassar Street/BU Bridge location. 

Appropriate  re-design  of  Kendall  Square,  including  the  intersection  at  Main  and 
Cambridge, Sloan School expansion, and other land use issues. 

Cross-cutting  issues,  such  as  parking  policy,  transit  pass  policy,  transit  service,  attitude 
towards  Urban  Ring,  bicycle  policy,  housing,  classroom,  laboratory,  and  architectural 
policies. 

APPROACH:  Walk  the areas and observe  them,  review  information you can access, define  the 
primary issues that should be addressed and a process for dealing with them. 

You can get information at the MIT website (web.mit.edu)  There is a link to "Evolving Campus" 
which  includes  "MIT  Building  Projects".  You  can  also  access  "Cambridge/Boston"  from  the 
Evolving Campus  site  and  get  the  "Town/Gown"  report.  Also,  traffic  studies  done  for  I.P.O.P. 
projects  are  on  file  at  Broadway  (an  annex  of  Cambridge  City  Hall).  Several MIT  projects 
(Stata, undergraduate residences, Media Lab) looked at issues at Vassar, Mass Ave, and Kendall 
Square areas. 

You are free to swap groups if it is more convenient.  Each paper should be 5-10 pages.
