11.380J/1.252J Urban Transportation Planning – Assignment #1 

Gateway Project 

Gateway Project 

The  site  visit  should  preferably  be  conducted  prior  to  the  second  class meeting,  to  support  class 
discussion,  but  in  any  event  the  team  visit must  be  completed, written  up  and  submitted  by  the 
third  week  of  the  semester.  By  way  of  example,  the  Kenmore  Square  gateway  would  include 
Storrow Drive (west of Charlesgate), Beacon Street, the bus terminal at Kenmore, the subway (both 
directions)  at  Kenmore,  the  Turnpike  at  Brookline  Avenue  (including  Turnpike  buses,  both 
directions), and commuter rail.  To observe this gateway will require an inter-disciplinary team of 
10  people.  The  Copley  Square  gateway  would  include  the  back  bay  transit  and  commuter  rail 
station,  Mass  Pike  and  commuter  rail  at  Clarendon,  and  Copley  Station/Green  Line  (both 
directions),  and  would  require  six  people.  Each  person  on  the  team  would  be  required  to 
contribute  two  paragraphs  concerning  their  observations  during  peak  and  off-peak  of  the 
particular  element  they  monitor,  as  well  as  contribute  to  the  overall  report.  We  will  assign  as 
many teams to as many gateways as we have student interest to support.
