Assignment 2: Millennium Database 

The Millennium Database assignment is an open-ended exercise that requires data mining 
and interpretation of findings. The database contains transportation related data from 
cities around the world. Develop a hypothesis and choose several cities and indicators to 
test your hypothesis. Remember that raising the right questions can be more challenging 
than answering them properly. 

Present your findings in a compelling way in a 5-page paper and prepare a short in-class 
presentation of your findings.
