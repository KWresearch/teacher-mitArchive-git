directly converges, is the absolute and essential importance of human development in its 
richest diversity. 
 

--Wilhelm von Humboldt, The Sphere and Duties of Government 
(cited as epigraph to J.S. Mill, On Liberty, 1859) 
 

 
Neither does it avail anything to say that the nature of the two sexes adapts them to their 
present functions and position, and renders these appropriate to them.  Standing on the 
ground of common sense and the constitution of the human mind, I deny that any one 
knows, or can know, the nature of the two sexes, as long as they have only been seen in 
their present relation to one another.  If men had ever been found in society without 
women, or women without men, or if there had been a society of men and women in 
which the women were not under the control of the men, something might have been 
positively known about the mental and moral differences which may be inherent in the 
nature of each.  What is now called the nature of women is an eminently artificial thing – 
the result of forced repression in some directions, unnatural stimulation in others. … [A] 
hot-house and stove cultivation has always been carried on of some of the capabilities of 
their nature, for the benefit and pleasure of their masters.  Then, because certain products 
of the general vital force sprout luxuriantly and reach a great development in this heated 
atmosphere and under this active nurture and watering, while other shoots from the same 
root, which are left outside in the wintry air, with ice purposely heaped all round them, 
have a stunted growth, and some are burnt off with fire and disappear; men, with that 
inability to recognize their own work which distinguishes the unanalytic mind, indolently 
believe that the tree grows of itself in the way they have made it grow …. 
 
Of all difficulties which impede the progress of thought, and the formation of 
well-grounded opinions on life and social arrangements, the greatest is now the 
unspeakable ignorance and inattention of mankind in respect to the influences which 
form human character.  Whatever any portion of the human species now are, or seem to 
be, such, it is supposed, they have a natural tendency to be: even when the most 
elementary knowledge of the circumstances in which they have been placed, clearly 
points out the causes that made them what they are. … The profoundest knowledge of the 
laws of the formation of character is indispensable to entitle any one to affirm even that 
there is any difference, much more what the difference is, between the two sexes 
considered as moral and rational beings; and since no one, as yet, has that knowledge (for 
there is hardly any subject which, in proportion to its importance, has been so little 
studied), no one is thus far entitled to any positive opinion on the subject.

[I]n  proportion to a man’s want of confidence in his own solitary judgment does he 
usually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of “the world” in general.  And the 
world, to each individual, means the part of it with which he comes in contact: his party, 
his sect, his church, his class of society: the man may be called, by comparison, almost 
liberal and large-minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own 
country or his own age.  Nor is his faith in this collective authority at all shaken by his 
being aware that others ages, countries, sects, churches, classes, and parties have thought, 
and even now think, the exact reverse.  He devolves upon his own world the 
responsibility of being in the right against the dissentient worlds of other people; and it 
never troubles him that mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is the 
object of his reliance, and that the same causes which make him a churchman in London 
would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Peking.
