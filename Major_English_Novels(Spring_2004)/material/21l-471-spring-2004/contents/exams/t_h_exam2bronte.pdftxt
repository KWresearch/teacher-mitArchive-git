21L471 Major English Novels 
Spring 2004 
Topics for take-home exam on Brontë, Wuthering Heights: answer both. 
Due Thurs. 3/18 in class. 
 

1.  Write about the significance of Lockwood’s two dreams (if the second one is a 
dream, that is) in Chapter 3 of Wuthering Heights.  Make sure to discuss 
Lockwood’s own behavior in these dreams and what it suggests.  (Think about the 
related ideas of “admitting,” “recognizing as kin,” and “forgiving.”) 
 
2.  What ideas does Brontë associate with the two houses of Thrushcross Grange and 
Wuthering Heights?  What are we to make of the fact that much of the novel’s 
action consists of traveling back and forth between them?  How does the second 
Catherine’s journey complement (or answer, or repair the damage of) the first’s? 

 
 
Guidelines: 
1.  responses must be typed and double-spaced throughout, using a 12-point font.  
(Times New Roman is good).  Pages should be numbered and stapled together. 
2.  Append a title page to your exam that includes your name, the date, and a signed 
pledge reading “This exam represents my own work and does not rely on outside 
sources, except where noted.”   
3.  You should not need to consult any outside sources to write these responses.  If 
you do, you must cite all such sources, including websites, on a Works Cited list 
at the end of your exam. 
4.  Brevity is not a virtue.  Thicken your responses with detailed reference to the text.  
When you cite the text, refer not only to page number but also to Volume and 
chapter numbers.  For example: (p. 311; Vol. III, ch. 2). 
5.  Please contact me if you have any questions.  If you need an extension for any 
reason, please ask as soon as possible.
