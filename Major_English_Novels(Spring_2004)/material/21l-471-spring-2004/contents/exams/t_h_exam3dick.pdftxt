21L471 Major English Novels 
Take-home exam on Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities 
Due Thurs. 4/15, in class 
 
Everyone should answer question 1, then choose either 2 or 3. 
 

 

1.  Examine the scene in Ch. 4 in which we first see Lucie Manette (esp. pp. 22-23).  
How does Dickens stage his presentation of this character, and what do his 
choices in this matter suggest about the role she is destined to play in the novel?  
Against what kind of forces is she defined by opposition in this scene and 
throughout the novel?  Make sure to give detailed analysis of the figures on the 
“gaunt pier-glass” behind Lucie when we first see her. 
 
2.  Write about the novel’s opposition of remembering and resenting versus 
forgetting and forgiving.  Which of these can set us free from the wrongs of the 
past?  Refer in your answer to such elements as Mme. Defarge’s knitting, Dr. 
Manette’s long-lost document, the illegible record left behind by a prisoner in the 
Tower of London, etc.   
 
3.  Write about the novel’s fascination with and horror of the urban mob.  According 
to Dickens, what happens to people when they become parts of a mob?  How does 
this ironically mimic what happened to the enemies of the Revolution?  Refer to 
several examples from the text to support your claims. 
 

 
Guidelines: 
1.  responses must be typed and double-spaced throughout, using a 12-point font.  
(Times New Roman is good).  Pages should be numbered and stapled together. 
2.  Append a title page to your exam that includes your name, the date, and a signed 
pledge reading “This exam represents my own work and does not rely on outside 
sources, except where noted.”   
3.  You should not need to consult any outside sources to write these responses.  If 
you do, you must cite all such sources, including websites, on a Works Cited list 
at the end of your exam. 
4.  Brevity is not a virtue.  Thicken your responses with detailed reference to the text.  
When you cite the text, refer not only to page number but also to Volume and 
chapter numbers.  For example: (p. 311; Vol. III, ch. 2). 
5.  Please contact me if you have any questions.  If you need an extension for any 
reason, please ask as soon as possible.
