Take-home exam on Joyce, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man 
 
NOTE: This exam is entirely OPTIONAL and can be done by anyone wishing to earn 
some EXTRA CREDIT.  There will be no exam on Rushdie. 
 
IF you choose to take this exam, it must be turned in by Tues. May 18 (at my office).  No 
extensions.  There is only one question: 
 

1.  Write about A Portrait as a story about the struggle to create a free Irishman.  
What forces, both external and internal to the self, oppose this effort?  Do you 
think Joyce intends us to see Stephen as having successfully achieved it by the 
end of the novel? 

 
Guidelines: 
1.  responses must be typed and double-spaced throughout, using a 12-point font.  
(Times New Roman is good).  Pages should be numbered and stapled together. 
2.  Append a title page to your exam that includes your name, the date, and a signed 
pledge reading “This exam represents my own work and does not rely on outside 
sources, except where noted.”   
3.  You should not need to consult any outside sources to write these responses.  If 
you do, you must cite all such sources, including websites, on a Works Cited list 
at the end of your exam. 
4.  Brevity is not a virtue.  Thicken your responses with detailed reference to the text.  
When you cite the text, refer not only to page number but also to Volume and 
chapter numbers.  For example: (p. 311; Vol. III, ch. 2). 
5.  Please contact me if you have any questions.
