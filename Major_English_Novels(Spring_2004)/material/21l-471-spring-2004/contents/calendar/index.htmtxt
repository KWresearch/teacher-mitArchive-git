This schedule shows the reading you should have done by a given day: it's
designed to spread your reading fairly evenly across the semester (e.g if four
class sessions are devoted to a novel, you should read at least a quarter of
the novel for each of those sessions). In class, however, I'll go slower over
some parts, faster over others. The schedule is subject to change, so if you
miss a class, check to make sure what's coming next.
