                      The use of information as a tool of government has been receiving increasing attention
                      in the environmental policy literature. Here are three examples. (Note that there is a
                      similar literature on product labeling for health purposes.)

                      Another literature opened up by thinking about information as a tool of government is
                      the extensive literature on place-based marketing and branding. See, for example:
