This course starts by examining the tools available to governments engaging in
urban design policy, and then considers how these tools are used in case
studies of San Francisco and Boston. (Photograph courtesy of Darwin70 on

***** Course Description *****
Governments at every level assume a measure of responsibility for seeking good
design. Some of that responsibility is exercised directlyâthrough the design
and construction of government buildings, for example. But most changes to our
environments are neither designed nor built by governments. Rather, they are
the result of the actions and investments of private individuals, institutions,
corporations, joint ventures, or private/public collaborations. Yet, the
actions of all of these actors are affected by the design policies of
government and the interventions that are undertaken to implement those
policies. In this advanced graduate-level seminar we will explore new ways of
thinking about urban design policy in an attempt to better understand just what
government doesâand what it can do effectivelyâin the realm of design
policy.
