Exercise #2: 
 
 
Objectives: 

“Thinking About Regulation” 

 
Assignment: 

 
 

 
 
 

This exercise asks you to focus on the tool of regulation.  You are 
asked to provide several examples of the use of regulation by 
government to achieve an urban design policy. 

Identify several examples of government use of regulation as a tool to 
implement an urban design policy or plan.  Be sure to select examples 
of both hard and soft regulation and distinguish between them.  
Describe these examples as precisely as you can, making clear the 
government's role in implementation.   Appraise the appropriateness of 
regulation to achieve the policy it is intended to achieve.  You should 
think about the match between the policy/plan and the actual or likely 
outcomes and assess the contribution that regulation as the tool of 
choice has made to achieving (or failing to achieve) the desired 
outcomes. 

Be very brief in your description; our emphasis is to build as wide a 
dossier of good examples rather than to dig deeply.  Two or three 
pages ought to be sufficient.
