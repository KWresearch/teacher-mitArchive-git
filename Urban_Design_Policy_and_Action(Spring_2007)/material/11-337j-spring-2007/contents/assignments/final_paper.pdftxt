Final Paper 
 
 
Objectives: 

This paper is designed to provide a synthetic exercise, drawing on the 
readings and the class discussions that we have had.  The idea is to 
demonstrate a link between the theory and actual programs designed to 
implement policy. 

 
Assignment: 

 
 

Write a 15-20 page research paper on a topic of your choice.  There 
are two styles of papers that students in this course have tended to use: 
 
1.  Pick an actual program that has been designed and implemented to 
pursue a policy in your field of interest.  Dissect the program using 
the concepts of the course (i.e., the tools approach to program 
design).  Speculate about works well in this program, and what 
might not work so well.  Finally, design an improved program.  
Please be sure that your paper is linked to the readings for the 
course. 

 
2.  Pick a problem in your field of interest that policy might address.  
Then, using each tool one at a time consider how each tool might 
be used alone to address this problem.  Finally, design a program 
that is a hybrid—that uses several tools together—that you feel 
would be more effective than any of the tools by themselves.  
Please be sure that your paper is linked to the readings for the 
course. 

 
You are certainly invited to propose a third style of paper, but please 
discuss it with Mark before you get too far into it.
