11.337J Urban Design Policy and Action  
 
 
Exercise #1:  “Thinking about Ownership and Operation: An Example” 
 
 
Objectives: 

This exercise is intended to get you to think about the tool ownership 
and operation by providing a concise account of an example of its use 
by government to achieve an urban design policy.  The exercise is to be 
done while you are doing the reading and before the classroom 
discussion on this tool. 

 
Assignment: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

From the literature or your experience, select as clear—and as ‘pure’—
an example as you can find of government use of ownership and 
operation as a tool to implement an urban design policy or plan.  
Describe this example very concisely in a way that makes clear the 
government's role in implementation, and appraise the evident match 
between the policy/plan and the outcome in terms of both the ‘fit’ of 
outcome to policy and the apparent contribution that ownership and 
operation as the tool of choice has made to achieving this outcome (or to 
the failure to realize the intended outcome). 

As you do this exercise, please also keep in mind the ideas presented in 
the readings about this tool. 

Be very brief in your description; our emphasis is to build as wide a 
dossier of good examples rather than to dig deeply.  Two pages should 
be more than enough.
