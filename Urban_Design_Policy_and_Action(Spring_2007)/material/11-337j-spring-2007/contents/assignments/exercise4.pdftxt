Exercise #4: “Incentives and Disincentives” 
 
 
Objectives:  This exercise is intended to have you focus on the use of incentives (and 
disincentives) as tools of government action.  It asks you to provide a 
concise account of examples of their use by government to achieve an 
urban design policy (or any other type of policy that you choose). 

 
Assignment:  From the literature or your experience, select several examples of the 
government’s use of incentives/disincentives as a tool to implement a 
policy or plan.  You should try to find examples of both direct and indirect 
incentives and disincentives.  (Note that Pearce uses the terms accounting 
subsidy and economic subsidy instead of direct and indirect.  Also note 
that the use of direct and indirect in this context is different from the way 
those words were used in the earlier readings.)

Note: a
  When this literature distinguishes between direct and indirect it is usually with 
respect to incentives.  It is less clear that the distinction can be usefully applied 
to disincentives, particularly direct disincentives.  Nevertheless, attempting to 
find an Example #3 should highlight interesting attributes of the various tools. 

 
 
Describe each example, making clear the role of the government in 
implementation.  How effective has each example been in your view?  Or, 
if it is an untried proposal, how effective is it likely to be? 

As you do this exercise, please keep in mind the ideas presented in the 
readings about incentives. 

Be very brief in your description.  Again, our emphasis is to build a wide a 
dossier of good examples with appropriate commentary rather than to dig 
deeply.  Several pages should be sufficient; less would probably be 
insufficient.
