Exercise #3: “Property Rights: An Example”

This exercise is intended to have you focus on the allocation and 
enforcement of property rights as a tool of government action.  It 
asks you to provide a concise account of examples of the use of 
property rights by government to achieve an urban design policy. 

From the literature or your experience, select an example of 
government use of property rights as a tool to implement an 
urban design policy or plan.  Describe this example concisely 
making clear the government’s role in implementation, and 
appraise the match between the policy/plan and the outcome in 
terms of both the ‘fit’ of outcome to policy and the contribution 
that a property rights approach has made to achieving the 
outcome (or to the failure to realize the intended outcome). 

As you do this exercise, please also keep in mind the ideas 
presented in the readings about property rights, particularly the 
Pearce reading. 

Be very brief in your description; our emphasis is to build a wide 
a dossier of good examples with appropriate commentary rather 
than to dig too deeply at this point.  Two pages would be 
sufficient; fewer would probably be insufficient. 

This is probably the most difficult tool to illustrate through an 
example.  Thus, you may find yourself relying more on the 
examples in the readings than on personal experience.    
Property rights are often described as a “bundle of sticks,” each 
one representing a separate property right.  Keep this metaphor 
in mind and look for an example in which a new property right is 
created by slicing one of the sticks in half or adding a new stick 
to the bunch.
