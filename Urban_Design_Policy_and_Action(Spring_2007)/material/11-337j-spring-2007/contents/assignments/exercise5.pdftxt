Exercise #5:  
 
 
Objectives: 

“Information: An Example” 

 
Assignment: 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

This exercise is intended to have you focus on the generation and 
distribution of information as a tool of government action.  It asks you 
to provide a concise account of examples of its use by government to 
achieve an urban design policy (or another policy of your choice). 

From the literature or your experience, select an example of 
government use of information as a tool to implement a policy.  
Describe this example in as much detail as possible. Try to avoid an 
example that provides only a trivial use of information—information 
has to be used to explain the use of any policy tool, e.g. a brochure that 
explains a tax incentive—and focus instead on an example where 
information is the content of the intervention. 

Be careful also about the difference between government requiring 
other parties to provide information (a coupling of information and 
regulation) with the government developing and disseminating 
information on its own.  You might want to try to find an example of 
each. 

As you do this exercise, please keep in mind the ideas presented in the 
readings about information strategies. 

Be very brief in your description; our emphasis is to build a wide a 
dossier of good examples with appropriate commentary rather than to 
dig deeply.  Two pages would be sufficient; less would probably be 
insufficient.
