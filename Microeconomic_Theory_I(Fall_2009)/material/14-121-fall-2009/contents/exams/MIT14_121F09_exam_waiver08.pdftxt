14.121  Microeconomic  Theory  I:  Waiver  Exam 

Prof.  Parag  Pathak 

Fall  2008 

Instructions.  Your  grade  on  this  exam  does  not  matter  for  anything  except  the  decision 
about  whether  you  need  to  take  (or  re-take)  the  class,  so  do  not  panic.  You  have  90  minutes 
to  complete  the  exam. 
In  the  following,  you  are  asked  to  “prove”  certain  statements.  In  doing  so,  you may  rely  on 
any results from mathematics you wish, but you should clearly state the steps of your argument 
and the theorems you reference, if appropriate.  Results from economics should be proven unless 
noted.  Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  clear  logic  and  careful  reasoning. 

1)  Consumer  Theory 
a)  A  consumer  has  a  preference  relation  �  that  is  transitive  (�  stands  for  “at  least  as 
good  as”).  Deﬁne  the  strict  preference  relation  �  and  prove  that �  is  transitive. 
b)  Deﬁne  the  indirect  utility  function  v(p, w)  for  a  consumer.  Show  that  i)  v  is  ho­
mogenous  of  degree  0,  ii)  strictly  increasing  in  w,  iii)  nonincreasing  in  pl  for  any  l, 
iv)  quasi-convex  (that  is,  the  set  {(p, w)|v(p, w) ≤ v¯}  is  convex  for  any  ¯v .  [You may 
assume  that  the  consumer’s  direct  utility  function  u  is  suitably well  behaved.]  Why 
is  v  nonincreasing  rather  than  strictly  decreasing  in  pl ? 

2)  Demand  Aggregation 
√
√
Suppose  there  are  two  consumers  with  utility  functions  u1 (x1 , x2 ) =  x1  + 4
x2  and 
x1  + x2 .  The  consumers  have  identical  wealth  levels  w1  = w2  = w/2. 
u2 (x1 , x2 ) = 4

a)  Calculate  the  individual  demand  functions  and  the  aggregate  demand  function. 
b)  Compute  the  individual  Slutsky  matrices  Si (p, wi )  for  i  = 1, 2  and  the  aggregate 
Slutsky  matrix  S (p, w).  Does  aggregate  demand  satisfy  the  weak  axiom?  Justify 
your  answer. 
� 
c)  Let  p1  = p2  = 1.  Compute  the matrix  that  is  the  diﬀerence  between  the  sum  of  the 
individual  Slutsky matrices  and  the  aggregate  Slutsky matrix: 
Si (p, wi ) − S (p, w). 
i 

C (p, w) = 

What  is  a  suﬃcient  condition  on  C (p, w)  for  aggregate  demand  to  satisfy  the  weak 
axiom?  Is  this  condition  necessary? 

3)  Consider  a  pure  exchange  economy  with  consumers  i  = 1, ..., I ,  where  consumer  i  has 
= RL 
endowment  ei  >  0  and  locally  non-satiated  preferences  on  consumption  set  X i 
+ . A
�
�
coalition  C  is a nonempty subset of consumers {1, ..., I }.  It blocks an allocation {x∗
i }i=1,... 
if  there  exists  xj  ∈  RL  j  ∈  C  such  that  every  j  ∈  C  strictly  prefers  xj  to 
x∗
+ , 
j ,  and
j∈C  = 
ej .
xj 
j∈C 

a)  Prove  that  a  competitive  equilibrium  allocation  cannot  be  blocked  by  any  coalition, 
and  hence  is  a  core  allocation. 
b)  Is  every  core  allocation  a  competitive  equilibrium?  Justify  your  answer  with  either 
a  proof  or  counter-example. 

4)  Consider  a  pure  exchange  economy with  two  goods,  h = 1, 2  and  two  consumers,  i = 1, 2 
with  utility  functions  u1  and  u2  respectively.  The  total  endowment  is  e = (e1 , e2 )  where 
e1 , e2  � 0. 
For  each of  the  following  cases, determine which of  the Pareto-eﬃcient allocations  can be 
decentralized  as  competitive  equilibria  with  lump  sum  transfers. 
Brieﬂy  describe  the  equilibrium  prices  and  transfers  for  each  Pareto-eﬃcient  allocation. 
a)  u1 (x, y) = α ln(x) + (1 − α) ln(y)  and  u2 (x, y) = β ln(x) + (1 − β ) ln y ,  where  α < β 
and  ln x  is  the  natural  logarithm  of  x. 
b)  u1  = u2  is  strictly  concave,  smooth,  and  homothetic. 
c)  For  i  = 1, 2,  ui (x, y) =  x +  g(y),  where  g  is  an  increasing  and  strictly  concave 
function. 
d)  u1 (x, y) = max{x, 2y},  u2 (x, y) = max{2x, y}  and  e1  = e2 .
