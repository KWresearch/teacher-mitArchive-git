Name: 

Instructions: 

•	 This is a closed-book examination.  Put away your books, handouts, notes, calculators, 
laptops,  cellular  phones,  etc. 

•	 Print  your  name  clearly  on  the  front  cover  of  the  answer  booklet.  Write your 
answers  clearly.  We  won’t  grade  unreadable  answers. 
•	 The  examination  is  for  90  minutes.  If  you  run  out  of  time,  do  not  panic.  Answer  the 
questions  you  are  able  to  get  to  as  thoroughly  as  possible. 
•	 There  are  ﬁve  questions  and  a  total  of  100  points. 
•	 In  the  exam,  you  are  asked  to  “prove”  certain  statements.  In  doing  so,  you  may  rely 
on  any  results  from  mathematics  you  wish,  but  you  should  clearly  state  the  steps  of 
your argument and the theorems you reference,  if appropriate.  Results from economics 
should  be  proven  unless  noted.  When  in  doubt,  state  all  assumptions  and  pro­
ceed.  Partial  credit  will  be  given  for  clear  logic  and  careful  reasoning. 

1)  [20  points]  Consumer  theory 
The  n-good  Cobb-Douglas  utility  function  is: 
u(x) = A ! 
n
αi , 
xi
i=1

where  A > 0  and "n
i=1 αi  = 1.

a)  Derive  the Marshallian  demand  functions.

b)  Derive  the  indirect  utility  function. 

c)  Compute  the  expenditure  function.

d)  Compute  the  Hicksian  demands.


2)  [15  points]  Consumer  theory 
a)  Suppose  that  u  :  Rn  × Rk  is  a  continuously  diﬀerentiable  function,  and  consider 
the  problem: 
max  u(z ,α ) 
z∈Rn 
where  α  ∈  Rk .  Think  of  Rk  as  the  space  of  parameters  and  Rn  as  the  space  of 
choice  variables.  State  and prove  the  envelope  theorem.  Give  an  intuition  for  the 
theorem. 
b)  Now  suppose  we  are  given  g  : Rn  Rm  and  suppose  that  our  problem  is 
→ 
max  u(z ,α ) 
z∈Rn 

sub ject  to  g(z ) = 0. 

State  the  envelope  theorem  for  this  constrained  maximization  problem.  (Note: 
you  do  not  need  to  prove  it) 
c)  State  and  prove  Roy’s  identity. 

3)  [25  points]  Producer  theory 
Consider  the  proﬁt maximization  problem: 

max pF (k , l) − rk − wl 
k,l 
where  F (k , l)  is  the  production  function,  r  is  the  rental  rate  of  capital,  w  is  the  wage 
rate  of  labor. 

a)  Suppose  that  F  is  not  diﬀerentiable.  When  are  k  and  l  are  substitutes  in  pro­
duction?  Provide  an  example  of  a  production  function  with  this  property  (note: 
example  can  be  diﬀerentiable). 
b)  Demonstrate  that  if  k  and  l  are  substitutes,  then  the  optimal  capital  choice  as  a 
function of exogenous parameters, k∗ (r, w),  is weakly  increasing  in w  and  likewise 
l∗ (r, w)  is  weakly  increasing  in  r .  Show  this  without  assuming  F  is  diﬀerentiable 
if  you  can. 

c)  Suppose  that  the  initial  wage  is  w0 .  When  wages  change  to  w,  write  the  opti­
mization  problems  that  the  short-run  demand  for  labor  solves  and  the  long-run 
demand  for  labor  solves. 
d)  How  the  short-run  demand  compare  to  the  long-run  demand  when  k  and  l  are 
substitutes?  Provide  a  proof  and  give  economic  intuition. 
e)  Explain  how  the  results  of  part  d)  changes  if  k  and  l  are  complements?  What 
if  k  and  l  are  complements  when  both  are  small,  and  substitutes  when  both  are 
large? 

4)  [25  points] General  equilibrium 
Suppose  there  are  I  consumers,  and  xi  denotes  the  demand  of  consumer  i  at  prices  p 
and  wealth  wi  (obtained  by  utility  maximization).  Let  x¯ = "i∈I  xi  be  the  aggregate 
demand.  All  consumers  face  the  same  prices  p,  although  their  wealth  and  preferences 
could  diﬀer. 
A  benevolent  planner  has  the  power  to  re-allocate  x¯ among  the  consumers  but  does 
not  have  additional  resources.  That  is,  he  can  change  the  original  allocation,  (xi )i∈I , 
to  some  re-allocation  (xi# )i∈I  provided  that  "i xi# = ¯x.  His  aim  is  to  ﬁnd  a  feasible 
re-allocation  (x#i )  such  that  "i∈I  xi# = ¯x  and  ui (x#i )  > ui (xi )  for  all  i  ∈  I , a  weak 
Pareto  improvement. 
a)  Prove  that  there  does  not  exist  a  weak  Pareto  improvement.  Please  highlight 
clearly  what  assumptions  on  preferences  you  use  in  the  argument. 
A  feasible  re-allocation,  (x#i )  with  "i x#i  = ¯x,  is  said  to  be  a  Pareto  improvement  if 
ui (xi# ) ≥ ui (xi )  for  all  i ∈ I  and  uj (xj# ) > uj (xj )  for  at  least  one  j  ∈ I . 
b)  Prove  that  there  does  not  exist  a  Pareto  improvement  over  (xi )i∈I .  Please  high­
light  what  assumptions  on  preferences  you  use  in  the  argument. 
c)  Do  there  exist  preferences  where  there  exists  a  Pareto  improvement,  but  there 
does  not  exist  a  weak  Pareto  improvement?  If  so,  provide  an  example.  If  not, 
explain  your  reasoning. 

5)  [15  points]  Externalities 
Assume  the  cost  of  commuting  to work  for  an  individual with wage w  is wf (n)  by  car 
and  wx + t  by  subway  where  n  is  the  number  of  cars  on  the  road,  and  x  and  t  are 
constants.  Let  there be a total of N  commuters.  Assume  that f (0) = 0 and f # , f ##  > 0. 

a)  Assume  everyone makes  the  same wage.  What will  be  the  equilibrium  number  of 
drivers?  How  will  the  equilibrium  number  change  with  the  wage? 
b)  What  is  the  socially  eﬃcient  number  of  drivers?  How  does  this  number  change 
with  wage? 
c)  What  are  three  ways  to  enforce  the  social  optimum?  Make  a  case  for  the  most 
plausible  one.
