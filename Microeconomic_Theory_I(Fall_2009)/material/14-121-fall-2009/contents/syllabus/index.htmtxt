Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Description *****
This half-semester course provides an introduction to microeconomic theory
designed to meet the needs of students in the economics Ph.D. program. Some
parts of the course are designed to teach material that all graduate students
should know. Others are used to introduce methodologies. Topics include
consumer and producer theory, markets and competition, general equilibrium, and
tools of comparative statics and their application to price theory. Some topics
of recent interest may also be covered.
***** Prerequisites *****
Prerequisites for this course include 14.04 Intermediate Microeconomic Theory,
18.02 Multivariable Calculus, and 18.06 Linear Algebra.
Enrollment in this course is limited and permission of the instructor is
required. Permission can be obtained by attending the first class meeting and
providing information about previous coursework in mathematics and economics.
The course assumes that students have taken undergraduate intermediate
microeconomics classes. It also assumes that students are comfortable with
multivariable calculus and linear algebra and have had some exposure to real
analysis. Historically, many students from outside the economics department
have had difficulty with the course. The enrollment limit may result in well-
qualified students being turned away.

***** Grading *****
The course will be graded on the basis of six problem sets and a final exam.
Problem sets will be due in class on assigned lecture dates. They will be
graded on a check-, check, check+ basis. The grades are intended primarily to
give you an idea of how you are doing in the course and will affect course
grades only for students with borderline scores on the exam. You may work in
groups, but please do the write-ups individually. We do not expect to see
identical answers from different students. An optional seventh problem set will
be distributed.
The final exam will be held two days after the last lecture.
