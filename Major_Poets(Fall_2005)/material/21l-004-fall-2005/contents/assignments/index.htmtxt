***** Assignment 1 *****
Reading: Shakespeare, William. Romeo and Juliet. Act III-V.
Consider the ending of the play, does the calamitous endings, with its
consequences from earlier acts, owe more to destiny, to the effects of human
love, or to human choice? Be certain to ground your considerations in the
language and imagery and psychology of the play. You might want to help me with
my own wonderment that Shakespeare wrote this play during his "comedy" period.
In what sense is this play a "comedy"? How does it relate to the lyric themes
and forms we've been considering in class? (5 pages).
***** Assignment 2 *****
Reading: Milton, John. Paradise Lost. (Statan's speeches).
Write a "missing" monologue for Milton's Statan. Try not to make the scene or
speech a comic parody of Milton and/or of his character Satan, but try to make
the speech a credible utterance for Satan to say, on the basis of your
understanding of this character, and make your style a feasible imitation of
Milton's as you understand Milton's style. We should be able to infer your
interpretation of each on the basis of the monologue you write. (5 pages).
***** Assignment 3 *****
Revision Option 1: Revision of the Shakespeare paper.
***** Assignment 4 *****
Reading: Shelley, Mary. Frankenstein (Any edition will do).
What is a monster? Define what is "monstrous" about Mary Shelley's monster; or
consider how the Creature "reads" literary texts to develop a sense of self. Is
he essentially "human"? Or monstrous? (Define the difference and consider his
"literacy"; is he more like Satan or Adam? Adam or Eve? Romeo or Juliet?
Shepherd or shepherdess?) Draw comparisons, if they help, among other works.
(6-7 pages).
***** Assignment 5 *****
Revision Option 2: Revision of Frankenstein paper.
***** Assignment 6 *****
Readings: Robert Frost and W. B. Yeats poems.
Do a good "close reading" of a short poem (e.g. a sonnet, or a poem by Frost or
Yeats) that we didn't discuss in class. I'll give you a paradigm of the
questions that a "close reading" ought to address. (5-6 pages).
