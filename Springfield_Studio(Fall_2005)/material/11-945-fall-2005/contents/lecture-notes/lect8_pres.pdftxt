Economic Structure 

Analysis 

  Two Purposes 
  Understand local economic structure 
  Assess development opportunities, needs, & assets 
  Key Questions to Address 
  Composition of employment by sector and industry 
  Largest sources of jobs and their wage levels

  How composition and growth compares to region/other 
areas 
  Occupational composition of largest and growing sectors

Industry Classification System 

  Establishment based data is organized by numerically coded 
industry categories 
  Data is aggregated and reported in a nested system where
industry specialty increases with number of digits in code 
  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system developed in
1930s and used through 1990s 
  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) replaced 
SIC 
  Two-digit denotes broad sector: 
  31 to 33 are manufacturing sectors 
  Three-digit denotes industries within broad sector: 
  316 is leather and allied products 
  Four to six-digit denotes narrower industry segment:  

  3162  is footwear mfg; 

  316211 is rubber and plastic footwear


Economic Structure Analysis: 

Key Steps 

  Determine cross-sectional composition of economy by sector and
compare to region, state and nation 
identifies major economic sectors and how they compare with other 
 
areas 
  Compare local growth in broad sectors to region, state and nation 
identifies which local sectors are growing faster and slower than other 
 
areas 
  Cross-sectional composition and wage levels of largest sectors at
two-digit Industry level  

identifies most important industries within key sectors 

 
  shows how industry mix varies with that of region 

  determines relative wages of locality’s major industries  

  Recent trends for two-digit industries at local & regional level 
  determines which industries are fastest growing

Retail and Real Estate Market 

Analysis 
Purposes:
  Assess market feasibility for uses and type of development at specific sites  
  Define target businesses to attract to a community or project 
  Determine market potential/recruitment targets for commercial districts 
  Improve understanding of customer markets for existing businesses 
  Four Parts: 
  Demand side analysis 
  Supply side analysis 
  Analysis of special conditions, opportunities and market segments 
  Integrate analysis to define target markets, feasible development type, and 
level of unmet demand 
  Critical goal is to identify market gaps to fill 
  Demand generators (and analysis) varies by use: 
  Retail demand is driven by local income and spending 
  Office and industrial demand is driven by business and employment growth 

Retail Market Analysis: 

Demand Side 

  Define market or trade area 
	 Determine number of households and total household 
income (US Census Data, BEA Population & Income
Estimates) 
	 Estimate spending for different product and store
categories (Consumer Expenditure Survey) 
	 Can build more complex spending model tailored to
different income and demographic groups 
	 Adjust for likely market share/capture rate based on
competitive differentials (site locations, size and quality of
competing centers, and normal leakage). 
	 Estimate square feet of retail space supportable by
resulting sales (Dollars and Cents of Shopping Centers) 

Retail Market Analysis:  

Supply Side 

	 Identify competing stores in and near trade area 
	 Assess competitive differences between site and
competing stores.  Consider store location, access, size, 
and quality in defining competitiveness. 
	 Consider planned or potential stores that may enter the
market area—national and regional retail trends are
important 
	 Based on this data, estimate the market share of trade 
area sales that a planned type of store at the site could
achieve 
	 Calculate the dollar value of this market share 
	 Translate this sales level into supportable square footage.
Use industry data on average sales per square foot for

comparable stores (Dollars & Cents of Shopping Centers)


Brockton Supermarket 

Example 

  1.5 mile primary trade area 
  17,585 households with income of $619.3 mm 
  $71.2 mm in supermarket spending (11.5% of income) 
  80% capture rate supports 114,000 to 164,000 square feet 
  Competition from 5 stores with 244,000 sq feet 
  New store would capture 10 to 15% of market to support 
11,000 to 24,000 sq ft-too small for chain 
  Independent store 7% capture can support 11,350 sq. ft 
  Higher ethnic capture rate could add 2,000 to 2,750 sq. ft. 

Community Or District-level  

Sales Gap Analysis 

	 Analogous method for an entire community or commercial 
district 
	 Help identify expansion/recruitment opportunities for 
overall community, neighborhood or business district 
	 Collect total retail sales for store types for entire 
community (US Economic Census) or 
	 Estimate from an inventory of store square footage and 
sales/per square foot 
	 Compare to spending potential to estimate sales gap 
	 What are potential pitfalls and limitations of this method?

Retail Market Analysis for 

Commercial District Planning 

  Complex set of factors influence market position and
potential for commercial districts: 
  Agglomerations and interactions among stores and uses affect
who shops and how people shop 
  District may focus on specific customer/demographic niches 
  Consumer image/perceptions of the district affect its market 
  Developed buildings affect size and type of potential tenants 
  More complex competition for diverse stores, uses and roles 
  Tools to Deepen Analysis and Address These Issues 
  Inventory and comparative analysis of retail strengths, niches 
  Link vacant land & building space to requirements by store type 
  Business surveys 
  Customer surveys 
  Focus groups and interviews 



Tailoring Analysis to Urban 

Neighborhoods 
Is there a need to adjust total households for census undercount or 
recent population changes?
	 Total income may need be adjusted by informal economic activity and 
remittances 
Informal enterprises may alter achievable market share for some
businesses 
	 Special market niches or demographic groups can increase sales by
expanding the market area or market share achieved 
  Spending potential may be larger from additional market segments: 
  “Comparison goods” stores, agglomerations (e.g., many restaurants) or 
destination businesses that attract shoppers from a greater distance 
  “Visitor” component to demand: employees, students, tourism, or other 
non-residents 
  Avoid double counting employees and students who live in market area 
  Define size and spending potential in “visitor” markets segments for 
relevant store types: e.g., bookstores, restaurants 

Office/Industrial Market 

Analysis: Demand Side 

 

 

  Analyze job growth by major sectors and industries to identify 
where strongest growth and real estate demand exists 
  Review data on absorption of space by type of use 
(Private real estate industry reports, e.g. Spaulding & Syle Report) 
Interview real estate brokers and firms in key industries to identify 
unique local conditions and location factors 
Interview non-traditional or specialized users that are not covered 
by conventional secondary data sources and brokers 
  Local goals and concerns, site issues and surrounding use are 
factors in deciding on potential uses and industries to target 
  Generate findings on feasible types of space, target industries, and 
property types/characteristic 
  Expected absorption of new space based on historic demand, 
economic trends, site and community location advantages 
  Specialized needs or non-traditional users that can be served 

Office/Industrial Market  

Analysis: Supply Side 



type of use (office, industrial, R&D) from private real estate
industry report, directories, and key property owners/brokers 
	 Collect data from planning officials on projects under 
construction and proposed projects that will expand supply 
Interview brokers, developers and economic developers to
identify recent trends, large blocks of sub-lease space, market
supply gaps, and perceived local strengths and weaknesses.  
	 Compare existing and planned supply to expected demand for 
each use 
Identify under-served markets and supply gaps that market is
not serving 
Integrate supply and demand analysis to assess overall market 
potential for different uses, target industries or users,
property/project characteristics
