Two Approaches to the Current Workplan for Springfield: 
a.  	 Population-based Business Corridor Approach 
i.  Investigate: 
1.  Who are the technical assistance providers? (1) 
2.  Who are the business owners? What are their 
views/goals? (1) 
3.  What are the city strategies, funds, and resources? 
Licenses? (Pioneer) (1,2) 
4.  Home-Based Businesses (1) 
5.  Organizational Landscape (1,2) 
6.  What are the business recruitment/leasing objectives 
of the program and what are the strategies to 
police/promote that? (2) 
a.  	 Property owners have a lot of influence over 
what happens 
7.  Vacancy (2) 

ii.  Goals: 
1.  Link Main Street and local business owners 
2.  Outline how the community controls the corridor? 
iii.	  Competing Visions: 
1.  NNCC 
2.  City 
3.  Baystate 
4.  Gerena School 
5.  Community 
iv.  Community Demographics 
1.  It is a very young community. 
a.  	 During the last Springfield Practicum, youth 
were concerned that there weren’t enough 
businesses and opportunities in the community 
for them 
v.  What is the work of building a commercial corridor? 
1.  community organizing 
2.  reconciling competing visions 
vi.  Working backwards: 
1.  What do we want this report to do and look like? 
2.  What do we need to do to accomplish that? 
3.  Work backward to the work plan 
4.  Run by the Steering Committee the elements that you 
think you want to focus on? 
b.  Workforce Development Approach 
i.  Investigate: 
1.  Spatial disconnect: where residents are versus where 
training is – barriers (1) 
2.  What have the elementary/middle school have done 
to improve high school outcomes? 
3.  How do we reach different population groups? What 
are the “splits”? 
4.  Resident survey and formal discussion with frontline 
workers 
5.  Research/summarize different models (Framingham). 
ii.  Goals: 
1.  Connect North End residents to existing training 
programs (ESOL, ABE, youth, job specific) 
2.  Increase resources for local training programs 
3.  Bring employers into the discussion 
4.  Identify job ladders (poverty alleviation, living wage) 

For Tuesday:
