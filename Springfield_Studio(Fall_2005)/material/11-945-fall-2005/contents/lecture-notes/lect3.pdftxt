Economic Development Theories: Neighborhoods as Economic Units 

Overview 
To provide a theoretical foundation for our work, this class will review literature 
on regions as economic units, the relationship between regional and 
neighborhood economic development and theories that seek to explain why and 
how economies develop. 

Introduction 
This class should be more of a discussion/exploration than a full lecture. The 
issue of what is regional economic development is and what are the forces that 
drive it is a huge subject. We are not going to do the issue justice here, but it is 
valuable to think about some of these theories and how they might be helpful to 
us as we try to understand what it means to do neighborhood economic 
development. It is also important to think about how these ideas might help us 
accomplish some of the goals in Springfield more specifically. One of the 
advantages we are bringing to the neighborhood through this course is the 
opportunity to consider more theoretical content. They have good ideas that are 
rooted to the neighborhood context and a theoretical perspective can help them 
develop those thoughts. We want to get to the core ideas of these theories and 
think about what they imply about economic development strategies. Ultimately 
we will come back to these issues again.

Geography of Economic Development (Larry Ledebur’s book The New 
Regional Economies) 
a.  	 The book is a polemic against national economic development 
policy. 
b.  Current economists’ thinking is that metropolitan areas are the 
primary basis for economic regions. 
i.  	 95% of economic activity is organized around metropolitan 
areas, typically around a central city (though its role is 
getting smaller). 
ii.  	 Looking at economic performance, metropolitan areas differ, 
i.e. they are distinct economic units.  
iii.	 Whatever we do in the North End, Springfield is in the 
context of this metropolitan economy. 
Springfield, MA Economic Geography 
a.  	 Massachusetts Metropolitan Area Map 
i.  	 Map of metro areas in MA. 

ii.  	 Different federal bureaucracies define them differently. This 
once comes out of NECMA. 
iii.	 The Springfield Metro Area is geographically the second-
largest in the state. 
iv.  	 Springfield is the central city of a large metropolitan area that 
extends far. 
b.  Map of Labor Market Areas 
i.  	 Focused on commuting patterns, primary metropolitan areas 
where residents get jobs. 
ii.  Almost the entire state is broken into labor market areas.  
iii.	 The Springfield metropolitan area and labor market areas 
are pretty much the same. 
c.  Census Map 
i.  	 Springfield is at the southern end of the region.  
ii.  	 The Connecticut River Valley is the defining geographic 
feature of area. 
1.  The first major industry that developed was firearms, 
and you see that all along the River Valley.  
2.  That river as a transportation corridor has been 
replaced by I-91, which is the major regional 
transportation route. 
iii.	 Even though this is a large area, most of the economic 
activity is centered in Springfield and surrounding areas.  
1.  The only other centers are Amherst – center of 
UMass, educational institutions – and Northampton, 
which has become a regional destination around 
entertainment, dining, and has sort of displaced 
Springfield as the place to go. 

III. 

Employment 
a.  Springfield had 254,000 jobs in 2004. 
b.  The largest sectors are Health Care, Education (UMass is probably 
included), Retail, and Manufacturing. 
IV.  Major Economic Theories: 
a.  	 Economic Base Theory 
i.  	 2 Major Ideas: 
1.  That neighborhoods have “export” (base) industry is 
an underlying assumption of many economic 
development practitioners. 
2.  The Multiplier Process: 
a.  	 Income flows through and supports economic 
development in the region through supplier 
relationships; 
b.  People in local industries are earning/spending 
income that can either be invested back into 
the local economy or go outside of it. 

iii.	

ii.  	 Is Economic Base Theory relevant to thinking about the 
North End? 
1.  Depends on the base industry and the demand for 
that product. Is there an external market in the North 
End? If people can sell products to people outside the 
North End, that will bring people into the community, 
2.  What is the neighborhood’s competitive position?  
In the way the neighborhood is thinking about economic 
development, how much are they integrating economic base 
theory into their thinking? 
1.  They are thinking that because there is so much flow 
of people at the edge of the neighborhood, there is an 
opportunity to capture spending through tourism. 
They want to become a destination that attracts 
people into the neighborhood. 
a.  	 These are non-basic activities, however, from 
the regional point of view. 
2.  How does the North End fit into the regional multiplier 
process? 
a.  	 That will probably be a bigger set of economic 
issues for the neighborhood. 
b.  Is the neighborhood capturing as much of the 
multiplier impact from its own residents as 
possible? 
c.  	 You do have a large institution in Bay State 
with components that are export-oriented.  
d.  It is worth exploring what are the major base-
industries in and around the neighborhood in 
which the residents could participate as 
suppliers. 
b.  Regional Growth Theory  
i.  	 This theory is much more supply-side oriented. It 
emphasizes thinking about growth being driven by the 
nascent inequality of regional resources. 
ii.  	 Major issues: 
1.  What are the quality and productivity of regional 
assets? 
a.  	 Improving the quality and productivity of the 
labor force. 
b.  Improving access of the labor force to labor 
markets. 
2.  Regional spillover and externalities: if a region is 
successful in becoming a major center for some 
industry, it will get increasing returns to scale, able to 
expand, increase productivity to get sustainable 
competitive advantage: 

a.  	 Develop a specialized workforce 
b.  Exchange of knowledge among workers, 
owners, l 
c.  	 Local institutions develop to support the 
industry 
iii.	 Benefiting from base industries: 
1.  Locate them in the neighborhood  
2.  Ensure residents have access to employment 
opportunities in regionally located industries. 
iv.  	 Relevance to Springfield, MA: 
1.  Massachusetts is the only state that lost population in 
the last census; 
2.  The growth in labor was entirely due to immigration, 
so 
3.  There are labor force constraints. 
4.  Human development should be more focused on the 
labor market than on the residents.  
v.  	 Relevance to the North End? 
1.  You might be more successful at filling gaps at supply 
chain by working collectively with firms rather than by 
looking at individual firms. Might be able to bid 
collectively, share knowledge,  
a.  	 North End has focused on getting businesses 
to work together – form an association – not 
from a supply-chain perspective, but rather in 
terms of serving the local market.  
2.  Organizational implications: 
a.  	 There is important organizing work in getting 
firms to understand and invest in that strategy.  
3.  Opportunities relate to: do the businesses have the 
skills, resources, access to credit to take advantage of 
these opportunities. 
4.  Challenge: Theories assume that businesses can 
respond to the market. 
c.  	 Product Life Cycle 
i.  	 Basic notion: 
1.  Economic activity follows the process of development 
of new products through a life cycle: 
a.  Innovation 
b.  Product diffusion and maturity 
c.  	 Standardization – relocation to low-cost 
regions 
d.  Decline/Obsolescence – loss of 
production/employment 

ii.  	 Raises 2 issues:  
1.  Where the North End should be trying to place itself in 
the product life cycle: innovator vs. producer, etc. 
2.  Should we be thinking about a set of industries that 
diversify the income of the neighborhood since every 
product will eventually move toward obsolescence?  
a.  	 Right now the area is overly dependent on 
government support 
b.  Healthcare may be an obvious sector to focus 
on, but are there any others? 

d.  Entrepreneurship 
i.  	 Someone who sees opportunities where others don’t and 
has the drive to act on it. 
1.  Is it something that can be learned? 
2.  Entrepreneurs don’t just succeed from their own 
efforts: 
a.  	 It is a social process supported by social 
relationships:  
i.  	 Access to lawyers to help form the firm,  
ii.  	 Access to consultants to help develop it, 
etc. 
ii.  	 Innovation: growth is a creative/destructive process and 
entrepreneurs are driving that process.  
iii.	 Entrepreneurship is a developmental strategy: 
1.  How can we develop business opportunities and 
manage business opportunities? 
a.  	 This aspect of economic development is lost in 
supply-side theory. 
2.  Although only about 5% of people developed through 
an entrepreneurship strategy might become business 
owners, that 5% might become very important to the 
economic development and sustainability of a 
community. 
3.  Lyons: Entrepreneurship can be taught: If you invest 
in the skill set over time, you would come out with a 
set of entrepreneurs. 
iv.  	 Relevance to the North End: 
1.  Even if some of what we do is to identify gaps, it is 
important to identify people in the North End who are 
willing to act on that information as entrepreneurs 
2.  It takes skill to develop and sustain a firm.  
3.  Is this a useful way to think about the North End? 
a.  What skills/infrastructure exists to help people 
develop into entrepreneurs? 

i.  	 Government and policy 
supports/impedes development of 
entrepreneurs 
ii.  	 There might not be a strong enough 
environment so that it would be a fruitful 
strategy 
b.  Do small businesses in the North End have the 
ability to employ enough people to expand? 
i.  	 Small business aggregated employment 
is not an insignificant number 
ii.  	 Might need to look at the quality of the 
jobs – many in retail/service industries. 
c.  	 Is there a potential set of entrepreneurs?  
d.  What is the nature of their businesses, what 
opportunities do they represent?  
e.  	 Are there people with ideas/skills that they 
could convert into a larger business? 
i.  	 Yankee Candle (Western Mass), 
ii.  	 Stacy’s Pita Chips (Jamaica Plain 
incubator) 
4.  Tara Kumar found in her thesis that there is some 
interest in formalizing immigrant businesses 
e.  Flexible Production 

Discussion 
V.  What is Economic Development (and how do we measure it)?  
a.  	 Measure by poverty alleviation. 
b.  Measure by distribution of income and assets 
c.  	 Measure by productivity (output/capital investment).  
d.  Distinction between growth vs. development: 
i.  	 Expansion of output/expansion of input.  
ii.  	 If the North End attracted a major new employer to the North 
End and gave everyone who was poor in the North End a 
new job and we eliminated poverty in the neighborhood, is 
that economic development? 
1.  It achieved the poverty alleviation goal, it redistributed 
income and assets, BUT 
2.  Economic development should also increase the well(cid:173)
being of the individuals. 
a.  	 If that industry was heavily polluting and 
increasing incomes but decreasing health-
outcomes, the residents might not be better off.  
b.  What is another limitation of that scenario? 
i.  Sustainability: that is a one-time 
solution/improvement. That company 
may be gone in the future. 

VI. 

ii.  	 Are you on a growth path? 
3.  Economic development encompasses the conditions 
that produce economic and social well-being.  
a.  	 How does the strategy enhance developmental 
resources of the neighborhood? 
b.  Income: improving immediate economic well 
being; vs. 
c.  	 Assets: improving long term ability to improve 
community economic and social well-being 
over time. 
i.  Physical assets 
ii.  	 Human assets 
iii.	  Capital assets 
Linking Neighborhoods to Regions: Practice 
a.  Novak, “Neighborhood Initiative and the Regional Economy”: 
i.  	 The North End is very close to the economic/employment 
center of the region 
1.  You could draw a 5 mile radius circle around the 
North End, and that would encompass almost the 
entire employment center. 
ii.  Issues: 
1.  Who are the employers being targeted? (by 
industry/occupation) 
2.  Which of those are accessible? 
a.  	 An important task of the class will be to get a 
good picture of the demand side.  
3.  What skill sets to people need to access the jobs in 
the region? 
4.  How do you get people to the jobs? 
5.  What institutional connections allow you to develop 
that type of relationship? 
a.  	 A big piece of implementing this type of 
practice is those institutional relationships. 
i.  	 Who is out there now? 
ii.  	 How can we connect them to the North 
End? 
b.  The assumption of normal operations of the 
market might not always hold true in lower-
income neighborhoods. 
b.  Economic Roles of Urban Neighborhoods 
i.  	 Labor market connections 
ii.  	 Neighborhood as a location for businesses 
1.  Community-oriented retail/services 
2.  Is the neighborhood part of a regional center 
destination? 

a.  	 Much of what is going on in Springfield is 
regional tourism rather than a regional center 
destination. 
b.  The health center is the biggest anchor. 
3.  Producers and suppliers in key export industries. 
iii.	 Source of developmental assets 
1.  What are the capacities and needs of the 
neighborhood? 
c.  	 We will be prioritizing which strategies/set of economic  

relationships that we want to focus on.  

VII.  Public Safety: 
a.  	 Matter of perception and reality – there is a high perception of crime, 
but not a lot of crime in the neighborhood. The public safety issue 
may apply to the neighborhood as a retail district for the region 
because there is that negative perception of the neighborhood.  
i.  	 Drag-racing. Can get up to 1,000 – 1,500 people watching 
drag racing on the street. 
1.  Vendors present, 
ii.  	 The North End is comparatively safer than other 
neighborhoods in Springfield.
