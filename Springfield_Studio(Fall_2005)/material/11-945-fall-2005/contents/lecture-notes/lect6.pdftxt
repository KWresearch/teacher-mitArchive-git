1. Harry Spence HCED Lunch 2005 
2. News articles TBA

Questions from the Readings 
a.  	 What cautions came up from reading these materials?  
b.  Was anything revealed about the legitimacy of people we need to talk to? 
c.  	 What is the role of the relationship between the neighborhood trying to do 
this economic development plan and the control board?  
d.  How would you advise the Campus Committee on how to interact with the 
control board? 

Springfield Control Board 
a.  	 Headed by Doug Foy and Eric Kriss; both have connections to the MIT 
Department of Urban Studies and Planning 
a.  	 Ceasar and Karl invited by Doug Foy to meet with the Control 
Board strategy session 
b.  The main focus is around cost-saving and new economic activity 
i.  	 City contracts rewritten 
1.  Reduce government inefficiencies 
2.  Spur private investment 
ii.  	 Need to attract middle-class residents back to the city 
c.  	 Karl and Ceasar point out that the low-income neighborhoods in the 
city are well-organized and an important resource 
i.  	 Need to develop an economic development strategy with the 
people in the community 
d.  A neighborhood-based approach was agreed on. 
i.  The city mayor is not in favor of this strategy 
b.  Neighborhood-based Strategy 
a.  	 Jim Sturgiss headed research and data collection to choose 
neighborhoods 
i.  	 Local organizations worked to provide the data they were 
looking for. 
b.  Neighborhoods: 
i.  	 Mason Square 
1.  The state worked closely with the Mason Square 
neighborhood when they were putting together the 
control board. They have organizations that state and 

regional agencies know how to work with (e.g. the 
Urban League) 
ii.  North End 
1.  Herbie Flores and the New North Citizens Council 
were the primary contacts 
iii.	 South End (not the main focus) 
c.  Strategy announced by Doug Foy at June press conference 
i.  	 no specifics laid out 
d.  Remaining question: 
i.  	 How much of the money targeted will be part of reallocations 
across city departments and how much is available for 
neighborhood development? 
c.  Insider/outsider perspective of the control board.  
a.  	 The challenge for control board members is that because they are 
not community members, they don’t fully understand the issues, 
people don’t trust them 
b.  In a way this class faces the same types of challenges as outsiders 
d.  Relationship between control board and the course 
a.  	 The control board has been instructed to work with this class in 
developing their economic development plan for the North End. 
i.  	 Will start attending Campus Committee meetings and 
become part of that Committee in some sense. 
b.  They are not seeing the structures of the North End, they don’t 
understand it, but 
i.  	 They have a set of resources, and 
ii.  	 They will allocate them with or without the help of the class. 
c.  Class Task: 
i.  	 Minimum: create a dialogue with the Control Board 
ii.  	 Broader: engage with the Board more actively to get it to 
think about something more comprehensive. 
1.  Inform the process of restructuring so that the 
neighborhood benefits (or at least is not hurt by the 
decisions) 
iii.	 Help the Campus Committee 
1.  Determining who is responsible for what 
2.  Thinking about what kinds of opportunities will come 
out of the restructuring process 
3.  The neighborhood has lots of one-on-one connections 
that don’t get built into structural relationships 
between organizations. The people you talk to will 
probably know everyone but will not have built a 
structural relationship that connects how that board is 
going to work with what the neighborhood is trying to 
do. 

School System Issues 
Article:  

“3 schools targeted for state takeover” Boston Globe. Sept. 27, 2005.   

a.  	 The state may take over some schools in Springfield, Holyoke, Fall River.  
b.  There is an increasing sense of the community not having any viable 
institutions that someone else doesn’t control.  
c.  	 One idea that has been floated at the state level was to create a self-
contained K-12 educational system in the North End neighborhood 
(Charter System).  
a.  	 One of the appealing things about a city-wide project is that you 
can get some big conceptual ideas going, but they worry that at the 
neighborhood level it would not be possible to do that. There is a 
feeling that things really need to be shaken up in order for things 
not to go right back where they were.  

Questions for Moving Forward 
a.  	 Who do you think is in charge in the neighborhood? 
b.  Who do you need to convince?
