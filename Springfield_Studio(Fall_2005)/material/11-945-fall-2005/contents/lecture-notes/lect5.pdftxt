Developing an Economic Development Plan 

The first task is to put together an agenda for the economic development plan. 
There are three steps to go through in dealing with this: 

1)  What are the options to consider (in framing this agenda)? 
a.  	 We have a set of ideas that the community has developed both 
formally and informally 
b.  Do we feel that is the right list? Is there anything missing? Do we 
want to modify by editing down or adding to those options?  
c.  How do we organize and think about those options?  

2)  What factors should we consider to propose an agenda?  

a.  How do we move from those options to an agenda?  

3)  How do we get to a recommended agenda?  

a.  	 The work side: how do we actually get this done within the time and 
resource constraints we have? 

Step 1: Considering the Options 

How complete is the set of ideas in the list we have compiled? Do we think 
collectively that we have a good set of ideas and options? 
Bottom-up perspective: local community 
Top-down perspective: regional economy 

Important Gaps: 
a.  	 Partnerships with Community Colleges: STCC 
a.  	 Small Business Development (incubator space) 
b.  Resident Employment: Internships with local employers 
c.  Retaining Skills 
b.  Situating the North End regionally 
a.  	 Comparative advantage in attracting business, employment 
growth local and within the region 
i.  	 There has been some discussion of this in terms of 
software jobs, healthcare, manufacturing 
ii.  	 Current thinking around two themes: 
1.  Health care (Bay State) 
2.  Retail/hospitality 
iii.	 Are there other sectors that might be an agenda for them 
to look at? 
1.  Manufacturing 

a.  Yes: 
i.  	 There might be local trade 
professions that might never leave. 
ii.  	 Manufacturing jobs are higher-
paying 
iii.	 The neighborhood may have a 
skilled workforce for manufacturing 
positions 

b.  No: 
i.  	 There is a long-term trend that 
manufacturing has been leaving the 
neighborhood, the region, and the 
U.S. 
c.  	 How much of the population we are 
concerned about are women vs. men? 
2.  Call center - Technology 
3.  Tourism 
4.  Financial Services 
a.  	 Prominent and proximate industry 
b.  Mass Mutual in Springfield 
b.  Affirmative action 
c.  	 Public sector employment 
d.  Political strategy 
i.  Where does the North End sit politically? 
e.  	 Day Care strategy 
f. 
	Occupational opportunities 
i.  	 Might be possible to get at this by looking at employers or 
industries. 
c.  Community Capacity 

Organizing Framework 
a.  	 How would we move from situating the North End into an actual 
agenda? 
a.  	 Are there sectors that might be more important regionally in the 
future that the North End should consider? 
b.  How do we propose an employment agenda? Should we link it to 
particular industries or link it to occupation? Keep in mind that there is 
no fundamental shift in our thinking here. We are just broadening our 
range slightly. 
a.  	 Broad Goal of the Campus Committee: Make it not the poorest 
census tract. 
i.  	 In meeting that goal, would it make a difference in the 
way they would be thinking about this if the goal was to 
increase wealth of the neighborhood? 

ii.  	 We should be thinking about poverty alleviation not just 
as raising income but also as increasing community 
assets so community can sustain its economic 
development outcomes over time. 
c.  	 What is the pathway of expanded economic development that people 
are thinking about? 
a.  	 Employment and Labor Market Approach/Strategy (How do we 
better equip residents for employment? How do we connect 
them to jobs in the area?) 
i.  Business Development Approach 
1.  Business Attraction: Bringing more businesses 
into neighborhood 
2.  Develop resident-owned small businesses 
ii.  	 Market Development Approach 
1.  Consumers regionally can support businesses in 
community 
iii.	 Real Estate Approach 
1.  Vacant building reuse 
2.  Incubator 
3.  School as a resource 
4.  Housing 
iv.  Institutional Approach 
1.  Leveraging possibilities of Bay State 
v.  Political Capacity Building Approach 
b.  Overarching frameworks: 
i.  Place-based approach 
1.  Economic opportunities in the North End 
2.  Connects to market development/Bay State/business 
development 
ii.  Population-based approach 
1.  Resident development: 
a.  Employment/capacity/resident-owned business 
development 
b.  Is one framework more compelling? 
i.  	 What do we decide to focus on? 
1.  Do we want to/have capacity to make a difference 
across both of the frameworks? 
ii.  	 If we use the Approach Framework, do we want to cover all 
six categories or just one or two? 
b.  Short Term/Long Term 
a.  	 What will have the most impact? 
b.  What can the community take action on? 

Step Two: Parameters / Considerations 

Goals and the relationship of the approach/idea to the outcomes 
a.  	 What is the relationship between effort and resources and what the  

outcome will be?  

b.  Do any approaches drop out because they are less compelling as a way 
to get us to the outcomes? 
a.  	 Market Development. How would it trickle down to improved 
outcomes for the residents? 
i.  	 Leads to business expansion, leads to employment of 
residents 
ii.  	 Business expansion of resident-owned businesses 
iii.	 Goes through business development pathway 
iv.  	 Perhaps a more long-term strategy – need stronger business 
capacity in neighborhood to take advantage of  
v.  	 Lots of potential for leakage at all areas 
c.  	 Are any of the approaches too important to the outcomes to leave behind? 
a.  	 Employment / Labor Market Approach: Improve outcomes generally 
i.  	 Difficult to see significant poverty alleviation without 
improving labor market outcomes and resources 
1.  Do we focus on one institution? 
2.  Focus on an industry? 
3.  Create a community-based employment opportunity? 
b.  Capacity Building 
i.  	 Important to deal with this. 
ii.  	 Getting better understanding of existing capacity/existing 
resources 
iii.	 Should this be the center of what we work on? 
d.  What is the set of opportunities and resources available? 
a.  Regional 
b.  Local: Community assets 
c.  	 Resources and institutional capacity 
i.  	 Need partners, funding 
e.  	 Community support and engagement 
a.  Multiple levels: 
i.  	 What is the client most willing to engage in? 
ii.  Community leadership 
iii.	  Residents 
f.  	 Capacity to take action at the North End Level 
a.  Starting with almost no economic development capacity 

Step 3: Moving Forward 

Gathering more information 
a.  	 How might we do that in the next month? 
b.  Everything we do is about preparing ourselves for a conversation, 
not a final decision 
c.  Additional client meetings 

i.  	 Will we be prepared to have the type of conversation we 
want with them? 
ii.  	 What more do we need to learn to prepare for a 
conversation? 
d.  More stakeholder meetings 
i.  Take two or three ideas as the issues we look at 
ii.  Look at issues in terms of the questions raised 
1.  What goals would we set? 
2.  What are the opportunities there? 
iii.	 Group has not yet gotten the spectrum of view from the 
client 
e.  	 Sit down and think through the 5 approaches 
i.  	 What activities would achieve goals 
ii.  	 Learn about community commitment to it 
iii.	 What is the capacity 
f.  	 Look at funding available for various types of activities 
g.  Asset mapping – update of previous work 
h.  Two ways of attacking work: 
i.  Approach perspective – testing in more depth 
1.  Would give useful information for the client meeting 
2.  Resources will come in to it later 
3.  Resource perspective will limit to something that 
might not be the most effective approach 
4.  We could take a resource-based approach to the 5 
approach categories. 
5.  May give more time for research, keeps information 
organized, may allow for faster decisions. 
ii.  	 Cross-cutting issues / resource perspective (e.g. 
funding/asset mapping) 
1.  Within the time-frame, might make more sense to be 
conscious of the resources available. 
2.  Initially, letting interviews with stakeholders around 
cross-cutting issues might yield more surprising 
results 
3.  Might require more time for interpretation and how it 
maps onto different approach options 
4.  Might ensure that we look at some things like the 
residents that might otherwise fall out if we only focus 
on the approaches. 

Staffing the Approaches 
The class should split up into four groups of two with 1 person acting as a client 
manager/project manager who manages the organization of the teams and 
communication with the client.
