As a practicum course, the class developed over the course of the semester in
response to student analysis and client feedback. The following schedule
captures the original scaffolding on which the course was built, and includes
all of the elements that students had an opportunity to pursue over the course
of the semester. As studnets learned more about the North End community, they
chose to emphasize some of the economic development techniques over others, and
they usedÂ some of the lecture sessionsÂ as work time, consulting with faculty
when they had specific questions aboutÂ the models presented at the beginning
of the semester.Â Most of the students also scheduledÂ site visits on a more
regular basis than the once-a-monthÂ required trips.
This course is broken down into regularly numbered sessions andÂ 4 scheduled
field trips (FT), designated FT1, FT2, FT3, FT4.
                               Course calendar.

       Course Introduction

       This class introduces the North End
       Neighborhood, the Campus Committee
1      client and the course project and   Â 
       approach. The issues facing the
       North End of Springfield are
       introduced and discussed. A video
       offering background on Springfield
       will be viewed.
       Background on North End Community

       This class will provide a more in-
       depth introduction to the North End
       Community through reading and
       discussing background reports and
2      materials from a variety of         Written assignment due.
       sources. Class discussion will
       focus on what was learned about the
       North End and its economic
       development from this "paper"
       review, how it might be biased
       based on the source and the
       limitations of what we learned.
       Economic Development Theories:
       Neighborhoods as Economic Units

       To provide a theoretical foundation
       for our work, this class will
3      review literature on regions as     Â 
       economic units, the relationship
       between regional and neighborhood
       economic development and theories
       that seek to explain why and how
       economies develop.
       Field Trip to the North End,
       Springfield, Massachusetts

       The class will leave Friday for an
       all-day field trip (8 am - 6 pm) to

       class will visit with the client,
       take a walking tour of the
FT1    community, meet with selected       Â 
       stakeholders, and record first
       impressions. Time will be reserved
       toward the end of the day on Friday
       for the class to discuss first

       including photos, lists of first
       impressions, and the preliminary
       list of economic development
       issues, challenges and
       opportunities. Class discussion
       will focus on any differences
       between what was observed during
       the field visit versus the
4      impressions taken from the          Â 
       background reports. We will also
       discuss what information is needed
       for the first phase of the project,
       how our existing information
       matches these needs, information
       gaps and how to address them. A
       review will also be made of the
       resources available to the class
       and protocols established for
       working with and sharing digital
       files. Class time will also be
