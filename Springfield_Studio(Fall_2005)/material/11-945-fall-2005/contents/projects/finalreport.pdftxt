Abstract

This Economic Development Plan for the North End in Springfield, MA 
has been produced by a team of  students (the Project Team) from the 
Department of  Urban Studies & Planning at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of  Technology (M.I.T.) for the North End Campus Committee and 
North End Outreach Network (NEON). The Project Team focused on 
creating a population-based approach to economic development and 
utilized multiple methods for gathering information and understanding 
the economic development needs of  the community, including site visits, 
quantitative analyses, stakeholder interviews, focus groups, a survey, and 
client working sessions. Based on its findings and analysis, the Project 
Team has developed a set of  institutional capacity-building and program-
matic recommendations:

With the suggested name “El Puente/The Bridge,” this organization’s 
mission would be to improve the economic well-being of  every North 
End resident by coordinating programs, assembling resources, and ad-
dressing the needs of  other community institutions. Specific functions 
would include:

»

»
»
»

Coordinate outreach and case management network for economic 
development
Generate financial resources for existing agencies and services
Collaborate extensively with NEON
Implement economic development goals and vision of  Campus 
Committee

Institutional Development

The North End requires strengthened institutional capacity for eco-
nomic development within a coherent system that coordinates the myriad 
services available to residents, responds continually to community needs, 
and focuses solely on the North End’s economic development goals. The 
Project Team recommends a capacity-building strategy that leverages the 
community’s strengths: collaboration, as exhibited by the Campus Com-
mittee, and the case management approach exemplified by NEON. The 
Project Team thus recommends a new, independent 501(c)3 organization 
located on the Campus, with a core staff  of  professionals solely dedi-
cated to North End-based economic development.

Executive Report

This Economic Development Plan for the North End in Springfield, 
MA has been produced by a team of  nine graduate students (the Proj-
ect Team) from the Department of  Urban Studies & Planning at the 
Massachusetts Institute of  Technology (M.I.T.) as part of  an ongoing, 
multi-year collaboration between M.I.T. and the North End commu-
nity. The North End Campus Committee and North End Outreach 
Network (NEON) retained the Project Team to create a plan based on 
economic development principles established in its own 2003 strategic 
plan, as well as the work of  previous collaborations between M.I.T. and 
the community. The Project Team’s work has been completed as part 
of  the “Springfield Studio” practicum course, co-taught by Professors 
Ceasar McDowell and Karl Seidman, during the period from September 
to December 2005.

Process

The client charged the Project Team with creating a plan for the North 
End that applies a population-based approach to economic develop-
ment. In response, the Project Team utilized an analytical framework 
consisting of  three main economic development pillars: workforce, 
business, and real estate development. The Project Team investigated 
these areas by striving to understand the client and community in as 
nuanced a manner as possible, given time and resource limitations. The 
research process included the following activities:

»
»

Site Visits: nearly weekly on-site meetings and interviews
Quantitative Analysis: labor, property, and local retail markets

»

»

»

»

Stakeholder Interviews: more than 40 interviews with stakehold-
ers from the city, local agencies, schools, Baystate Medical System, 
and regional workforce and economic development agencies
Focus Groups: 4 focus groups on employment and business devel-
opment issues, involving NEON staff, North End residents, store-
front business owners, and informal business owners
Survey: more than 100 residents on workforce and business devel-
opment needs
Client Working Sessions: 3 presentation and working sessions 
with Campus Committee members

Findings

From this process, several findings on economic development in the 
North End became readily apparent. In general, the North End has 
numerous assets that can be utilized towards promoting equitable 
economic development. First, the neighborhood is home to a host of  
dedicated service providers working on an array of  workforce and busi-
ness development issues. Several neighborhood and City stakeholders 
specifically remarked on the unique human capital that resides in the 
North End. Second, as evidenced by the Campus Committee, stake-
holders are committed to collaboration, networking, and information 
sharing. Impressively, the Campus Committee convenes stakeholders 
both across program areas as well as levels of  jurisdiction. Third, the 
case management approach utilized by NEON offers an impressive suc-
cess in the neighborhood and an excellent model for application beyond 
healthcare services. This approach, in fact, can form the backbone for a 
comprehensive economic development program.

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

In addition, the Project Team found several specific programmatic 
needs required for the North End to build momentum towards over-
arching economic development goals. In the area of  business develop-
ment, these needs include creating opportunities for new and existing 
North End businesses, strengthening connections among business own-
ers and between business owners and service providers, building coop-
eration among Main Street businesses, and targeting community control 
of  vacant and occupied property (refer, Resource Section I). In the area 
of  workforce development, needs include involving employers in plan-
ning training curriculum, integrating the basic skill needs and training 
opportunities for individual participants, and improving outreach to 
adult populations (refer, Resource Section II).

Institutional Recommendations

In considering these programmatic needs, the Project Team paid spe-
cial attention to implementation requirements, and it became clear that 
institutional capacity represents the major challenge facing economic 
development in the North End. The myriad services available to neigh-
borhood residents are offered in a fragmented manner that lacks coordi-
nation across providers and scales, such that providers cannot lead users 
from one program to another or provide tailored support throughout 
a structured process. For example, specific job placement services that 
a participant receives may not be coordinated with his/her ESL train-
ing, so the participant does not follow a coordinated series of  services, 
thereby resulting in inefficiencies and mismatching. In addition, eco-
nomic development in the North End is challenged by political factions 
at both the neighborhood and city level, stunting some opportunities 
for collaboration and creating an atmosphere in which some residents 
have lost faith in their community. 

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

Conversely, the case management approach utilized by NEON for the 
coordination of  healthcare services is a major asset that can be applied 
to economic development needs. This model allows for a continuous 
feedback loop that informs key providers in a timely manner to respond 
to the ever-changing needs of  participants. Furthermore, by planning 
across providers, the community’s resources can be leveraged most ef-
fectively. The programmatic recommendations in this report, though 
separated into workforce and business development areas for the sake 
of  clarity, can best be realized through this case management, out-
reach-based approach, applied to economic development services in a 
coordinated and integrated manner. The Project Team thus focused on 
crafting an institutional arrangement that meets this vision with a core 
professional capacity dedicated to economic development in the North 
End.

The Project Team believes that this added North End economic de-
velopment capacity needs to be housed within a new 501(c)3 organiza-
tion, with the suggested name “El Puente/The Bridge” (refer, Resource 
Section III). There are several advantages to the formation of  a new 
organization, in comparison to embedding this staff  within an existing 
institution. First, El Puente can have a specific North End, economic 
development-focused mission. Although existing organizations address 
a number of  economic development needs, no single entity is tackling 
the challenge in the holistic manner that is required. Second, El Puente 
would fill the institutional void of  a coordinating entity. Rather than 
duplicate existing services, the organization would function through a 
case management approach and thus support existing providers. Third, 
El Puente would be uniquely positioned to implement the goals of  the 
Campus Committee, a strong, established organization, but one which 
cannot presently act on its ideas. Finally, as the economic development 
engine for the North End, El Puente would be poised to receive fund-
ing from corporate community investment programs and city, state, and 
foundation grant programs. In this way, it would leverage existing com-

munity resources to attract additional funding in support of  the efforts 
of  service providers.

El Puente would function within the existing institutional fabric of  the 
North End. Its relationship with the Campus Committee would involve 
receiving vision and guidance in return for providing implementation 
capacity for community needs. With existing service providers and em-
ployers, El Puente would provide information and human and financial 
resources in return for support for its North End focused mission. In 
addition, El Puente would hold a unique relationship with NEON by 
providing support and resources, while NEON would offer its outreach 
networks and case management expertise.

The Project Team has imagined a sequential process through which El 
Puente can initially work. First, staff  would convene service providers 
to identify community resources and needs, followed by concentrated 
outreach efforts to increase participation and identify reasons for non-
participation. With this information, staff  would collaborate with other 
institutions to adapt program areas, accessibility, and effectiveness to 
better respond to the needs of  North End residents. Furthermore, at 
this point, staff  could seek additional funding for community-wide 
economic development initiatives, thereby increasing resources for all 
organizations.

A possible mission statement for El Puente is “to improve the eco-
nomic well-being of  every Nor th End resident by coordinating 
programs, assembling resources, and addressing the needs of  
other community institutions.”

major assets, pushcart food vending can certainly be explored for the 
future. Two locations have been identified for situating the pushcarts: at 
the Campus’ outdoor open public space and in front of  Baystate satel-
lite locations at the northern end of  Main Street and Birnie Avenue. 
The program’s public nature can provide a highly visible success for the 
community, upon which future business development efforts can be 
built, as well as promote street life and vibrancy.

Property Control & Development
Property control and development represents a long-term goal for the 
North End that is critical to commercial and overall economic devel-
opment. Though this program area is largely beyond the scope of  the 
Project Team’s mandate, initial steps are required to lay the foundation 
for future work that addresses the disinvestment and poor conditions 
of  the neighborhood’s physical assets. Only through local property 
ownership can the neighborhood truly contribute to land use planning. 
The development of  Main Street as a thriving commercial corridor, 
a goal mentioned by numerous stakeholders, also requires coordina-
tion in streetscape, security, and signage, all of  which are facilitated by 
local control of  commercial property. In addition, the neighborhood 
needs a strategy for working with the City to consider rezoning parcels 
to facilitate commercial development. The Project Team recommends 
conducting a rigorous property analysis, perhaps utilizing students from 
M.I.T., and forming a working group among North End business and 
community leaders to develop a formalized strategy.

Program Recommendations

The Project Team has developed a set of  recommended programs that 
follow its institutional strategy and represent the beginnings of  a popu-
lation-based approach to economic development in the North End. 
These programs have been designed to complement and support, rather 
than duplicate, existing initiatives.

Business Development Programs      
(refer, Resource Section I)
Technical Assistance Hub
A central coordinating office is critical to connecting North End busi-
ness owners to technical assistance resources. A number of  service pro-
viders exist at the city and state level that businesses can access, includ-
ing the Springfield Technical Community College, Latino Chamber of  
Commerce, Western Massachusetts Enterprise Fund, Springfield Busi-
ness Development Corporation, and the Massachusetts Small Business 
Development Center Network. Rather than duplicate efforts of  existing 
service providers, this hub would function as an information gatherer 
and referral service for the business community. In addition, staff  can 
conduct targeted outreach to connect business owners to one another, 
and can continually evaluate the needs of  businesses and the services 
offered, thereby providing critical feedback to providers. 

Pushcart Retail Program
A pushcart retail program supports market expansion efforts for exist-
ing and potential storefront and informal business owners by providing 
opportunities to sell products through a low-risk venture that requires 
minimal upfront capital investment. Due to difficulties in obtaining 
required health certifications and the higher cost of  carts equipped for 
heating food, retail can initially focus on non-food items, such as crafts, 
jewelry, flowers and plants, CDs and tapes, clothes, health and beauty 
aids, and candy. However, given that food is one of  the North End’s

Workforce Development Programs    
(refer, Resource Section II)
“Healthy Beginnings” Workforce Training Program
A healthcare job training program seeks to connect North End resi-
dents to job opportunities in healthcare, the community’s largest em-
ployment sector. The program initially focuses on outreach to residents 
to assess strengths and weaknesses, and then developing a targeted 
sequential training curriculum with the collaboration of  employers. In 
addition, a strategy for moving residents through different levels of  
training is required, as is providing support to participants during initial 
years of  work. In the long-term, this program can be integrated into a 
comprehensive workforce delivery training program. Its impact can be 
quite significant, by providing North End residents with entry to stable, 
living wage employment that is enhanced by job ladders into long-term 
career paths.

Comprehensive Vocational English Training Program 
This program addresses several key objectives, including the need to re-
focus ESL courses to vocational preparedness, integrate language train-
ing into a lifelong learning process, and advocate for a comprehensive 
ESL strategy for the North End. In response, the Project Team rec-
ommends a program that adapts Campus-based ESL courses to better 
serve North End residents through a case management approach. This 
program would integrate “everyday” and “occupational” ESL training 
such that course content is coordinated across providers and partici-
pants can graduate from one level of  ESL to another in a sequential 
order. Critical first steps in this program include reorganizing Campus-
based ESL courses to accommodate students’ purpose of  study (every-
day vs. occupational language skills) and skill level, as well as targeting 
residents already in the workforce for continuing training.

Youth/School to Work Program
This program recommends an integrated, comprehensive system to 
assist North End youth in the transition from education to career-ori-
ented activities. It combines school retention, career exploration, and 
access to entry-level work opportunities to engage student interest, 
enhance skill acquisition, develop positive work attitudes, and prepare 
youth for high-skill and living wage careers. The goal is to encourage 
young people to think beyond the often limiting conditions of  poor 
minority communities by building the confidence, education, resources, 
skills, and relationships required to reach their full potential. This pro-
gram works to combat the realities of  high rates of  school drop-outs, 
teenage pregnancy, truancy, and juvenile delinquency. Most generally, 
such a program provides a support system for youth in desperate need 
of  assistance to meet educational and professional potential.

Using this Plan

This Executive Report is intended to serve as an overview and gate-
way to the resources included in the remainder of  the plan. Given that 
community members will have different interests in and uses for this 
document, it has been structured such that components can be utilized 
separately and also as chapters in an integrated plan.

data, and (2) households are buying only a portion of  what is being sold 
in their neighborhood and the excess amount is being sold to non-resi-
dents.  Available data are not sufficient to determine which possibility is 
the cause for the difference.  The implication, however, is that, overall, 
the North End’s internal demand is well captured by its internal supply. 

Expenditure Allocation Analysis

Our data indicate that $13.5 billion was earned by Springfield residents 
in 2003 while $13.2 billion was earned by those who work in Springfield 
(not necessarily residents). These figures suggest that overall there is not 
a substantial leakage of  earnings from Springfield to outside regions.

Sales Gap Analysis
As shown in Figure 2, in 2003, North End residents were estimated to 
have spent $179.9 million.1 Based on these calculated income levels, 
North End households had an estimated purchasing power of  $179.9 
million in 2003.  In reality, however, the data shows that $227.7 million 
was sold in the North End in the same year. These figures suggest two 
possibilities: (1) households are spending more than estimated by the 
This estimate was made by applying the average expenditure pattern of  dif ferent income groups of  the U.S . to the North 
End, then weight-averaging the national data so that the data reflects the North End’s income composition.

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

In absolute terms, the North End’s expenditure per household is less 
than that of  the Northeast, due to lower income levels. Therefore, basic 
items that are necessary for living tend to represent a higher proportion 
of  total expenditures of  the North End (Figure 3). Basic items would 
include housing, groceries, restaurant/fast food, healthcare, and ap-
parel. This suggests that a higher proportion of  North End household 
resources need to be allocated to these items when compared with the 
Northeastern average. 

Retail Space Gap Analysis
We selected the top retail categories and analyzed how much retail space 
could be supported by the North End’s internal demand and compared 
that to how much retail space exists currently. The result was that 
supermarkets, auto repair, retail, and bodywork shops and healthcare 
services had retail space (square footage) exceeding internal demand, 
implying that these businesses are selling their goods and services 
to non-residents of  the North End (Figure 4). On the other hand, 
restaurants’ current amount of  retail space is lower than what could 
be supported, indicating that this sector is not taking advantage of  all 
of  the North End’s internal demand.  The analysis suggests that the 
retail space of  restaurants in the North End could be increased by half, 
thereby fulfilling the internal demand.

Real Estate and Housing Analysis
Land use
The North End is a predominantly residential area by zoning. It has a 
solid residential core, consisting of  multifamily residential space in the 
southern portion of  Brightwood and most of  Memorial Square, with 
single family residential units in the northern part of  Brightwood. The 
North End also has an industrial area in the northeastern portion of  
Brightwood, in addition to a commercial strip along Main Street. Table 
1 shows the different zones in the North End by area.

Housing stock
In 2000, there were 3,482 housing units in the North End, 6.4% 
of  which were vacant, compared to the 1.44% state average. The 
North End also had an extremely low homeownership rate of  13.5%, 
compared to 63.8% for Massachusetts2 (Table 2). A significant number 
of  the North End’s housing units are subsidized through Section 8 
vouchers, representing a major portion of  the 3,400 housing units in 
Springfield. Edgewater Apartments and Pynchon Terrace are major 
housing developments that accommodate 616 units of  Section 8 
rentals. Both developments, which are run by a private management 
company, receive HUD funds through the city and are in the process of  
rehabilitation.

From the residential and commercial property market perspective, the 
North End needs to be considered as two separate areas, Brightwood 
and Memorial Square. Brightwood consists predominantly of  hous-
ing, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there is an unmet demand 
for additional housing. However, Brightwood does not demonstrate a 
good balance of  owner-occupied and rented units, as evidenced by its 
extremely low homeownership rate. Meanwhile, Memorial Square has a 
mix of  commercial and residential space, and interviewees have noted 
a better balance of  rented and owner-occupied space (although the of-
ficial data contradicts this claim).

Substandard structures
The North End’s real estate market is plagued by substandard condi-
tions and overcrowded housing. Poor conditions are due to many 
reasons, including graffiti, broken windows, vacant properties, poor 
landscaping in public and private spaces, trash, lack of  adequate lighting, 
and poor streetscapes. The problems may also include poor structural 
conditions, a situation that is hard to assess. Absentee landlordism con-
tributes significantly to the problem and seems to contribute to a lack 
of  caretaking in many residential blocks. 

Property ownership and developable land
Property ownership in the North End is dominated by a few major 
landlords. Of  the 343.14 acres in the neighborhood, 28% is owned by 
three major entities: the City of  Springfield (14%), Pynchon Partners 
(8%), and the Springfield Housing Authority (6%). Furthermore, the 
top 11 landlords control 36% of  all property (Table 3).

Vacant property in the North End is an asset and a challenge. There are 
131 parcels of  developable land in the North End (Table 4, Figure 5), 

The significant number of  absentee landlords poses a serious problem 
to maintaining residential and commercial areas, as well as coordinating 
development in a cohesive manner. Many properties have been put up 
for bid by the city. Finally, additional analysis is required of  any brown-
fields and general environmental hazards on the vacant properties.

of  which 68% are zoned as residential. The vacant parcels are  scat-
tered throughout the North End, which means limited opportunities for 
consolidating parcels into larger, perhaps more attractive spaces; on the 
other hand, the small parcels may be a benefit to increasing use by low-
moderate income populations. 24% of  these parcels are owned by seven 
landlords (Table 5). Of  the total developable lands, Park View South 
owns 8.9%.

Approach

The above analyses suggest that while the North End’s internal demand 
has been well captured by the area, further business development 
opportunities might lie in basic item retail—particularly in restaurants.  
However, in reality there is relatively little growth in restaurant 
businesses in the North End, primarily due to the lack of  capital, space 
and managerial skills, and the complex administrative processes required 
to start businesses. Given the high demand yet insufficient supply of  
businesses, there is a need to create a mechanism through which basic 
item retail businesses, particularly restaurant businesses, can be nurtured 
by the residents of  the North End. 

This business development mechanism would create opportunities 
for new and existing North End businesses, strengthen cooperation 
between business owners both on Main Street and off, and build 
connections with technical assistance providers.  Strategies developed 
should also target community control of  vacant and occupied property.

The Project Team recommends a set of  programs focused on Main 
Street that represent the beginnings of  a population-based approach to 
economic development in the North End.  Revitalizing Main Street will 
provide stability to existing businesses, allow new businesses to enter the 
market, and could trigger development throughout the neighborhood. 
In order to address these needs, this report suggests implementing three 
programs: a technical assistance hub, the pushcart program, and real 
estate development and control. These programs have been designed 
to complement and support, rather than duplicate, existing initiatives.  
These programs will be discussed in detail in the coming section. We 
suggest that these programs are crucial to ensuring the success of  a 
population-based, sustainable economic development plan. 

North End Technical            
Assistance Hub Program

Objective
To provide easier access to the existing technical assistance programs 
to business owners through a decentralized model, promoting business 
development in the North End. 

Description
A technical assistance hub program (The Hub Program) is intended 
to help those who are interested in starting new businesses or expand-
ing their existing businesses by creating easier access to the technical 
assistance programs that a variety of  agencies provide, disseminating 
information on programs and referring those who are interested to ap-
propriate agencies. The Hub Program will pursue a decentralized model, 
in which the agencies that are providing technical assistance programs 
will stay independent, though cooperation and coordination amongst 
one another will be encouraged, and the Hub Program will function as a 
focal point/referral point of  the different technical assistance programs. 
Initially, El Puente’s Program Director should act as a coordinator that 
business owners and potential entrepreneurs could visit easily. The 
coordination could expand into a full-time position should the demand 
rise in the future. In the course of  the implementation, thorough evalu-
ation should be conducted on a regular basis in order to assure effective 
use of  the Hub Program and make necessary improvements.

Rationale
There are a great number of  businesses in the North End, both formal 
and informal businesses. While there are some extremely successful cas-

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

es, many are facing difficulties due to lack of  financial resources and 
technical capabilities. Formalizing informal businesses entails daunting 
tasks such as getting licenses and going through accounting processes, 
etc. As a result, despite the fact that there is high demand for certain 
goods/services and there are people who are willing to provide these 
goods/services, many business owners are not able to expand their 
businesses simply because of  the lack of  capital and know-how to do 
so. 
“I am a manicurist, and I moved to Springfield last year. I provide manicure 
ser vice in my sister’s apartment. I know that on the Main Street there is 
only an English-speaking nail salon and people would like a Spanish-
speaking one. I would be interested, but I don’t know how things work here. 
I don’t have money. I don’t know how to start a business, I don’t know 
anything .”  (Manicurist, home-based)
As a matter of  fact, however, there are a number of  technical assis-
tance programs in the North End that are intended to help business 
expansion in the North End, including those in the table below.

However, these programs are not known to many business owners in 
the North. Consequently, the usage rate of  these programs in the North 
End is significantly lower than in the other parts of  Springfield. 

“They don’t know how to grow their businesses with of fered programs”  
(Springfield business development professional)

“The North End’s usage level of  the assistance program is low”  (Springfield 
business development professional)

“It has always been my dream to have my own store, but it seems so 
complicated to start a business. Registration, license, property management, 
etc. would be so tough. Plus I don’t have money. I don’t know any assistance 
program. I have never though about taking out a loan.”  (Craft-making 
business owner, home-based)

“I already have loans for my children and I wouldn’t be qualified for another 
loan to expand my business. If  there is any loan available for starting a new 
business, I would jump on it. But I don’t know any.”  (Translator, home-
based)

Providing sufficient information about the assistance programs to 
business owners would be essential to grow their businesses. These 
assistance programs are currently provided by different and independent 
agencies, and this decentralized model should be continued; however, 

there should be a function to bridge the gap between business owners 
and the programs. The Hub Program should assign a coordinator 
who will help business owners in the North End understand what 
kind of  assistance they could receive and refer them to appropriate 
programs. The existing programs do not appear accessible and having 
a coordinator in a place that is accessible physically and psychologically 
for the community, such as the campus, would be a key for success. 

“If  I could fine someone who would help me, I would love it. If  there is an 
assistance person at NEON or elsewhere, I would even pay for this kind of  
ser vice.”  (Manicurist, home-based)

“It would be great if  someone could help us gather information. Otherwise the 
whole process of  starting a business seems so complex and impossible.”  (Craft-
making business, home-based)

Implementation
Short-term (3-6 months)
Conduct outreach to assistance providers. Though the Hub Pro-
»
gram will pursue a decentralized model in which assistance provid-
ers will maintain their independent activities, El Puente will need to 
involve them to ensure a smooth and efficient referral system. 
Conduct needs assessment. Though basic needs have been 
identified in this report, more detailed assessment will be required 
to design the Hub Program structure. The assessment will explore 
such needs as information required, qualification of  the coordinator, 
hours of  operation, site preference, etc.

Mid-term (6 months-2 years)
Adver tise coordination initiative. The Hub Program must be

effectively advertised to make sure people are informed. Communi-

cation tools such as flyers and posters should be used, but words-
of-the-mouth effect plays an important role in the information dis-
semination processes in the North End, particularly in the Hispanic 
Community, and leveraging this channel should also be considered.

Long-term (2-5 years)
Conduct evaluation of  services. Thorough evaluation should be

conducted on a regular basis to consider areas for improvement. 
Hiring a full-time person should be considered should the demand 
be proven high in the long run.

Funding
Staff  costs for coordination is the main expense for the Hub Program. 
Other than staffing, the program will have no costs except for 
miscellaneous office overhead, all of  which should be funded by El 
Puente. 

Staffing
A key to the success of  the Hub Program is its implementation by a 
strong coordinator who has good rapport with North End businesses. 
In the beginning when El Puente is staffed solely by an Executive 
Director, the coordination of  the Hub could be a part-time role for him 
or her. Later, a full-time Program Director should be hired to expand 
the program, as well as work on the pushcart program and other 
economic development functions.

North End Pushcart Retail 
Program

Objective
To implement a retail pushcart program in the North End that provides 
low-cost, low-risk opportunities for local storefront and informal 
business owners to expand their market presence.

Description
A pushcart program allows existing and potential storefront and 
informal business owners to sell their products through a low-risk 
venture that requires minimal upfront capital investment. Due to 
difficulties in obtaining required health certifications and the higher 
cost of  carts equipped for heating food, retail should initially focuses 
on non-food items, such as crafts, jewelry, flowers and plants, CDs and 
tapes, clothes, health and beauty aids, and candy. Given that food is one 
of  the North End’s major assets, however, food vending from pushcarts 
can certainly be explored for the future. Two locations have been 
identified for situating the pushcarts: at the Campus’ open public space 
and in front of  Baystate satellite locations at the north end of  Main 
Street and Birnie Avenue. 

Initially, the program can operate from late spring to early fall, 
when weather allows outdoor retailing; in the future, there are also 
opportunities for locating carts indoors at the Campus. Permitting 
considerations need to be raised with the city; anecdotal evidence 
suggests that such permits are not unnecessarily difficult to attain with 
the proper guidance and support. Finally, the program will need to be 
coordinated by a lead organization, which purchases pushcarts to be 
leased out to business owners on a monthly basis.

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

Rationale
The North End is home to a range of  informal and storefront 
businesses on and around Main Street. While some of  these businesses 
are stable, many face a difficult business climate—safety concerns, a 
disjointed commercial strip, abandoned properties, and uncoordinated 
signage make Main Street a challenging commercial corridor in which 
to operate a business. Business owners often struggle to make rent 
payments, do not have guaranteed leases, and exist without security for 
their future. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that they do not 
feel supported by community resources and leadership.  

The process of  starting and expanding a business is extremely 
challenging to both storefront and informal business owners. Raising 
sufficient funds, obtaining required permits and licenses from the 
city, securing selling space, purchasing goods, hiring employees, and 
marketing products and services can be so daunting as to discourage 
entrepreneurial aspirations. A retail pushcart program responds to 
these challenges by providing a low-cost, low-risk mechanism through 
which business owners can sell goods in a supported, coordinated 
environment. The program targets those in the community with 
ambition who might not otherwise be able to start or grow a business.

Though the actual number of  people who participate in a retail 
pushcart program is limited, the benefits can spread community-wide. 
The program’s public nature can provide a highly visible success for 
the community upon which future business development efforts can be 
built, as well as promote vibrancy in the neighborhood’s street life. In 
addition, there are numerous opportunities to expand the program if  
successful, such as developing a community kitchen or a school-based 
business start-up program with neighborhood youth.

“We would like to have some good food from Main Street in the North End, 
but we do not know of  many places. We end up ordering for deliver y from 
places outside the North End”  (Baystate resident)

Implementation
Short-term (3-6 months)
Identify lead organization. A Campus Committee working group 
»
focused on business development will need to determine the lead 
organization to manage and implement the pushcart program. Pos-
sibilities include El Puente or the Latino Chamber of  Commerce.
Conduct outreach efforts. In cooperation with NEON workers, the 
lead organization will identify storefront and informal businesses 
interested in selling goods through pushcarts at the Campus. In 
addition, outreach efforts will need to work with existing business 
owners to assuage potential fears that pushcarts represent competi-
tion to their businesses.
Conduct survey of  Baystate residents and employees. In order to 
determine the types of  goods of  potential interest for sale at the 
Baystate satellite facilities, the lead organization will implement a 
brief  survey, and also explore both food and other goods targeted at 
visitors to the facility, such as flowers, cards, and balloons.

Mid-term (6 months-2 years)
Purchase pushcarts. The lead organization will buy the equipment, 
»
the costs of  which range from $3,000-$5,000 per cart and can be 
purchased from online and traditional sources. Insurance will also 
be required for the equipment.
Develop leasing structure. The lead organization will determine an 
appropriate structure for leasing the pushcarts to business owners. 
Comparable programs have set fees at $250-$500 per month per 
cart, plus an initial deposit for participation.
Determine program timing. The lead organization will consider 
timing of  pushcarts to coincide with lunch-time and after-school 
and work activity, as well as exploring possibilities for locating carts 
indoors at the Campus in the winter.
Identify technical assistance. The lead organization, in cooperation 
with other Springfield providers, will evaluate the assistance needed 
by push-cart businesses, including navigating the permitting process 
with the City, pricing goods, and marketing.
Streamline permitting process. The lead organization will work with 
the relevant City agencies to explore developing a streamlined per-
mitting process for push-cart users. In addition, health requirements 
applicable to food vending will need to be determined.
Identify storage location. The lead organization will identify a 
central location for storing the pushcarts overnight and in the off-
season. A space within the Campus or an underutilized City-owned 
building on Main Street are strong possibilities, as the carts should 
be stored near selling locations to minimize transportation.
Host a community-wide event. The lead organization will launch 
the pushcart program through a community-building event at the 
Campus to build interest and attract local shoppers. Following the 
launch at the Campus, and pending the survey results, the lead or-
ganization will explore setting up carts outside the Baystate satellite 
facilities, near Main Street and Birnie Avenue.

Explore spin-off  programs. The lead organization will explore 
establishing new initiatives that complement the pushcart program, 
such as setting up food preparation sites and/or a community 
kitchen at the Campus.

»

Funding
Comparable pushcart programs have cost approximately $50,000 per 
year to operate, including equipment purchase, storage and maintenance 
costs, and staff  time for coordination. Pushcarts cost between $3,000 
and $5,000 each, and comparable programs have charged $250 to $500 
per month for leasing. Business owners must also purchase general 
liability insurance and required permits.

Fundraising for the pushcart program can be targeted at several sources. 
Community institutions such as Baystate Health System, MassMutual, 
and other banks could be approached as sponsors of  pushcarts, in 
return for banners or other promotional materials placed on the 
pushcarts. Baystate has expressed preliminary interest in this possibility 
through its Community Benefits Fund. The City is another potential 
source for institutional capacity funding through business development 
resources.

Staffing
A key to the success of  the pushcart program is its implementation by 
a strong institution focused on North End business development. The 
lead organization will also need to coordinate the provision of  technical 
assistance and/or referrals to other service providers with the Technical 
Assistance Hub, especially for new participants in the program.

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

The pushcart program will likely require a part-time staff  position to 
coordinate and maintain ongoing logistics. Initially, however, a full-time 
position will be required to conduct outreach, establish protocols, liaise 
with the city, and launch the program.

Property Control &               
Development

Objective
To establish the basis for a real estate development approach that meets 
the community’s need for business development and ensures its control 
over properties. 

Description
Real estate development and control is a long-term vision. Real estate 
analysis needs a rigorous study that is beyond the scope and capacity 
of  this report. Therefore, our plan for the real estate development and 
control will be a generic one that looks into the long-term vision and 
highlights possible future approaches, programs, and funding sources.

There is a focus in this implementation plan on Main Street, which is 
a hub for local retailers and service providers and could act as a trigger 
for the development of  the whole neighborhood. Revitalizing Main 
Street will guarantee stability of  the existing businesses and will enable 
new businesses to enter the market.

Real estate development on Main Street faces many challenges, 
including deteriorated physical conditions, development constraints 
relating to property ownership, zoning, land use, vacancy, and the lack 
of  a community-based real estate and housing entity.3 
  The area of  analysis is between Dover Street in the north (Campus) and Church Street in the south (the church). The area contains 75 land lots of  
which 58 have built structures of  different sizes. 

Poor and deteriorated physical conditions
Of  the 58 structures surveyed on Main Street, only 13 are in good 
condition, 17 are in fair condition, and 28 are in poor condition 
(Appendix H). Poor physical conditions lead to an alarming 
disinvestment in Main Street, and create an extremely negative image 
that causes a feel of  insecurity among residents. Empirical evidence 
shows that spaces that suffer from low standards of  maintenance are 
less able to “defend themselves,” and are more vulnerable to vandalism 
and illegal activities than well-maintained spaces. Many interviewees 
expressed feelings of  insecurity while they are in the street, especially at 
night. Two interviewees asked for a stronger police presence. 

Feelings of  insecurity have serious consequences on businesses on Main 
Street including a decline in the number of  customers, threatening the 
stability of  existing businesses and discouraging new businesses from 
entry, and depreciation of  property values, including housing values. 

“I used to take care of  children at home in the North End. Now I am 
applying for a formal license but it was denied because they came to check 
the property condition, and my apartment was too hot (10F). So now I am 
waiting for the landlord to fix it and I rarely do day care ser vice. I will not do 
it until I get a license.”  (North End resident, informal business owner)

Zoning and land use
The corridor needs rezoning to ensure conversion of  undesirable land 
uses to meet the community’s current business needs (Appendix H). 
Many residents expressed their dissatisfaction with the liquor store 
in Main Street and its negative effects on the neighborhood. Others 
expressed their wish to have a pharmacy. There is a need to convert 
industrial properties into office or retail space, to build on vacant parcels 
of  lands that were cleared after the Urban Renewal Plan of  1958, and 
to take stronger measures towards violation of  city ordinances.  This 

will meet the need for more retail space, especially restaurant space, and 
facilitate the entry of  new businesses or the expansion of  established 
ones. 

“I would like to move to a big ger space, but I’m not sure where I would go, 
there aren’t places to build.”  (North End resident, formal business owner)

“I would love to have a store on Main Street and sell b-day gifts, little crafts, 
and things.”  (North End resident, informal business owner)

Ownership and vacancy
Just like the rest of  the neighborhood, Main Street suffers from 
residential vacancy and absentee landlordism. Many business owners 
expressed their dissatisfaction with their landlords due to their 
unwillingness to improve the standards of  the structures or to sell 
their properties. This tension in these relationships causes a feeling 
of  insecurity and instability among business owners. Moreover, 36% 
of  land parcels are owned by six public and private institutions. 
Community control over land should ensure that any future 
development meets the community’s current needs for different asset 
types, eliminates barriers for local businesses, and deepens the feeling 
of  stability among existing businesses. 

Lack of  a specialized real estate and housing entity that can 
channel resources
Massachusetts is a state with many opportunities for community-
based real estate development. There are nine major state agencies 
that act as vehicles towards increasing homeownership in healthy 
communities. However, the North End has not been able to benefit 
much from such resources due to the lack of  a specialized, operational, 
community-based entity. Such an entity can locate funding resources, 
offer counseling and assistance to homebuyers and property owners, 

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

and facilitate loans through agreements with financial institutions, and 
exert pressure or partner with property owners or other institutions at a 
later stage. This agency might be a non-profit developer that ensures the 
development of  new structures or the renovation of  the old ones in a 
way that meets the community’s needs. 

Rationale 
Real estate development and control in the North End should meet the 
community’s demand for commercial properties and housing through 
a broad vision for rezoning that encourages investment in vacant lands 
and substandard structures while ensuring community control over its 
physical assets. The development should also meet the community’s 
need for a safe and secure place that reflects the vibrancy of  the 
community to both outsiders and insiders. 

This implementation plan focuses on Main Street, which is a hub 
for local retailers and service providers, and could act as a trigger for 
the development of  the whole neighborhood. Community-based 
revitalization of  Main Street will guarantee stability of  the existing 
businesses and will enable new businesses to enter the market.

analysis.

estate control and development. Possibilities include assigning the 
task to El Puente or to one of  the existing institutions, or creat-
ing a new CDC. The assigned institution should hire a real estate 
and housing development expert and it should benefit from the 
expertise of  other CDCs and non-profit real estate developers in 
the region. Appendix G includes a list of  CDCs in the region with 
contact information. 
Conduct a supply and demand study of  different asset types. The 
Campus Committee Working Group on Property Development and 
Control should hire a consultant to conduct a thorough assessment 
that determines the existing uses, square footage, prices, conditions, 
etc. There is also a need to match these spaces to potential business 
recruitment opportunities through meetings with community mem-
bers, residents of  Main Street, service provides, property owners, 
and business owners (formal and informal). 

Mid -term (6 months-2 years)
The development of  real estate will depend highly on the entity that 
the Campus Committee names to carry out the responsibility. While 
it is beyond the scope of  this study to give specific implementation 
processes, we emphasize taking the following issues in consideration in 
the long-term:
Create a broad vision for rezoning, conversion of  spaces, and de-
»
molition of  old properties to meet the community’s current needs. 
Create an open public space. Such a space will deepen the sense of  
ownership among the community members and will ensure to the 
outsiders the vibrancy of  the community. The Plan for the North 
End Campus, recommended by the MIT Department of  Urban 
Studies and Planning studio in 2004, created designs to connect 
the North End residents through reclaiming Thomas Street Park, 
the Gerena School, and Chestnut School areas and creating a pubic 
spaces for the community.

Enforce existing city ordinances. Initially, there is a need to enforce 
ordinances that do not cause permanent changes in structures and 
do not require many resources. These ordinances lack substantial 
immediate impact on the Main Street, but will result in incremental 
transformation over time. An example on this is removing trash and 
keeping the residential yards on a good shape. The City may name 
a staff  member to implement this strategy. At a later stage though, 
stronger measures should be taken towards substandard buildings, 
vacant properties, and all other violations of  city ordinances.  
Create best property practices program. This program will address 
business owners, tenants, property owners, and homebuyers to edu-
cate them about their legal rights and obligations, financial resources 
and strategies, and assistance programs available to them. This could 
be through workshops or one-to-one consultations. Consultation 
may also include improving designs, marketing and advertising for 
business owners. The program may be interconnected with the 
Technical Assistance Hub. At a later stage the program may be ex-
panded to offer the participants financial resources through match-
ing funds from the City. 

 
Long -term (2 years-5 years)
Create Façade, Lighting, and Signage Design Guidelines. The 
»
program will enhance the physical appearance of  storefronts and 
increase safety through additional storefront lighting. The restora-
tion of  an historic storefront’s signage and lighting should also be 
included in the guidelines. The program should provide matching 
funds, possibly from the City, to be used for the new signage and 
lighting. Applicants will be responsible to hire qualified profession-
als to implement the City-approved designs, including installation. 
The Best Property Practices Program should be able to offer con-
sultation about conceptual design ideas. 
Develop designs for the streetscape, lighting, sidewalks, and pedes-
trian lines. The City may be able to use Community Development 
Block Grants (CDBG) and other state sources for implementation. 

»

»

»

Evaluate the need for land trust to ensure community control over 
the land. 
Assess the need and possibility of  nominating buildings for the 
National Register for Historic Places. Main Street has old structures 
with an average age of  77 years. Many of  the structures were built 
before 1920, around 35 of  them were built before 1955, and 5-7 
only were built after 1990 (Figure 8). Many of  these structures have 
their historic significance and still maintain their integrity. Possible 
nominations include the bus depot. 

Funding
Funding for the proposed implementation initiatives may come from 
different sources. There are numerous real estate development and 
housing rehabilitation programs that are available at the city, state, and 
federal levels. Those include CEDAC, HAP, MACDC, Healthy Homes 
Demonstration Program, Lead Based Paint Hazard Control Grant 
Program, CDBG, and Section 108 loan guarantee program. Appendix 
G highlights some of  the possible funding sources. 

Staffing
A key to the success of  real estate development and control is its 
implementation by a strong institution. In the short run, the Campus 
Committee Working Group on Property Development and Control 
may hire a consultant. Tasks include visioning, rezoning and conversion 
of  space based on demand and supply assessment. In the long term, 
however, there is a need for a full-time real estate development 
and housing specialist. Tasks will include negotiating with other 
stakeholders, building alliances with CDCs and non-profit development 
agencies, writing grants and applying for different programs, and 
proposing new programs to the city and New North Citizens’ Council. 
There might be a need for the New North Citizens’ Council to hire 
another staff  member to help enforce city ordinances, formalizing 
proposals for rezoning, developing street designs, and creating new

Analysis

Overview

The North End in Springfield suffers from poverty and unemployment, 
yet the greater Springfield-regional economy in which it is situated offers 
a large number of  well-paying, entry-level jobs that have potential for 
career advancement. We believe that the reasons for North End residents’ 
inability to access this vast arena of  potential employment include low 
educational attainment, insufficient comfort with or proficiency using 
English, and lack of  social or institutional connections to the labor mar-
ket and workforce development resources. 

The region is well-served by a variety of  successful programs address-
ing issues of  workforce development including ESL, career counseling, 
retraining, and job placement programs. However, the number of  North 
End residents that have enrolled in these programs is very small. This is 
due to the lack of  outreach on the part of  existing programs to people in 
the North End, inappropriate curricula to meet existing needs, and a lack 
of  knowledge on the part of  North End social service agencies of  exist-
ing programs.

To remove these barriers and place more North End residents into 
gainful employment, we propose a case-based management approach 
to workforce development. This approach is distinguished by a primary 
focus on the needs of  North End residents, and builds on the well-es-
tablished population-based strategy with which NEON has successfully 
addressed healthcare issues. This strategy also seeks to create horizontal 
and vertical integration between the needs for basic skills and training by 
North End residents and workforce training and institutions, with the 

0 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

goal of  tailoring pathways to employment to the specific needs of  North 
End residents. 

This document lays out concrete ways to increase employment opportu-
nities for North End residents. It includes background information on 
employment needs, opportunities, and ongoing challenges, and concludes 
with a menu of  strategy recommendations and a proposed plan for 
implementing priority initiatives.  

Barriers to Workforce Entry

The barriers for North End resident participation in the workforce are 
numerous. In this section, we lay out several of  the key barriers to work-
force development in the North End. These include: a lack of  connec-
tion between residents and institutions and among institutions, a discour-
aged labor force, low educational attainment, and a lack of  capacity to 
implement systemic change. Simultaneously, there are a large number of  
significant employment opportunities in the region. 

A lack of  connection between residents and institutions and 
among institutions
The North End is linguistically, socially, and institutionally isolated.  Resi-
dents are not well connected to the labor market or to service providers 
outside the North End. Social service providers within the North End 
have limited connections to opportunities outside the neighborhood, 
and regional and citywide initiatives do not perform outreach addressed 
specifically to the North End.  

Additionally, workforce development agencies are insufficiently con-
nected to each other.  Neither curricula nor resource gathering are 
planned for in a collaborative way among service providers. Lack of  co-
ordination between social service agencies and workforce development 
programs limits the efficacy of  existing programmatic solutions. North 
End agencies lack institutional connections that would allow them to di-
rect residents to existing programs outside the community, and because 
of  a language barrier, residents are unwilling to seek outside resources 
on their own.

A discouraged labor force
In the North End, only 56% of  men and 46% of  women over 16 
worked at all in 1999. More than 44% of  single-parent families and 33% 
of  two-parent families had no one in the workforce. However, unem-
ployment in the North End, as measured by the US Census, was virtu-
ally 0%.  Unemployment measures only those who have actively sought 
work within the four weeks prior to the census.  Thus, more than half  
the adults in the North End were neither employed nor seeking employ-
ment.  Some of  these people are no doubt retired, disabled, or other-
wise out of  the labor force by unavoidable circumstance or by choice, 
but some percentage was – and is today – a discouraged labor force. 
This indicates that a vast majority of  residents needing jobs would need 
significant training, and significant encouragement, to re-enter the work-
force. 

Low educational attainment
Low educational attainment is a significant obstacle to most North End 
residents seeking (or who might be discouraged from seeking) gainful 
employment. With a high school dropout rate of  more than 50%, the 
North End has the lowest educational attainment in the city of  Spring-
field, where citywide educational statistics are already poor. Youth in the 
community are not effectively prepared to enter the job market of  the 
future. The MCAS failure rate in Springfield is nearly 75%. 

Significant employment opportunities exist in the fields of  
healthcare and insurance
There are many jobs in the Springfield area that offer relatively high 
wages and do not require a college degree. A number of  high-growth 
areas present meaningful opportunities in which North End residents 
could seek employment.  Customer Service jobs in Springfield are grow-
ing by 20% annually, and for bill collectors, the employment growth 
rate is nearly 12%.  In the medical sector, for example, there are at least 
2,663 jobs paying $12.00/hour. In all, there are more than 3,600 high-
paying, career-oriented jobs requiring minimal skills.  Local employers, 
including Baystate, are looking to fill hundreds of  positions a year and 
are interested in partnerships to provide training and education. 

The Case-Based Approach

Our approach to workforce development focuses on two primary 
concerns: reaching the largest possible number of  North End residents, 
and maximizing employment outcomes for participants in workforce 
development programs – that is, making sure that people who go 
through training can expect to be rewarded with a good job at a good 
wage. We offer the case-based management approach as the best strat-
egy. 

Rationale 
There are several reasons why a long-term case-based approach is the 
most appropriate for this program. First, this approach has been the 
basis of  success for many workforce intermediaries across the nations 
in sectors with large employers. A case-based approach reduces the 
transaction costs of  employers’ own recruitment efforts by building, 
through caseworker data-gathering, a sophisticated base of  informa-
tion that intricately links employers’ needs to the training of  workers. 
NEON already has achieved success in this area by creating a power-

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

ful knowledge base of  community demographics and health needs. An 
expanded NEON model can track participants through a training and 
development progression that will involve multiple steps. Not only is 
this information-building a powerful incentive for employers to come to 
the table, it can be a source of  bargaining leverage that will create closer 
ties between employers and the community itself. 

Also, a case-based approach is absolutely crucial to understanding the 
necessities of  curriculum development and resource structuring (e.g. 
times, locations, costs, lengths of  classes), not just in terms of  ensuring 
the appropriateness of  the classes offered, but in terms of  mediating 
participants’ transition into what for them is a very new and perhaps 
intimidating institutional environment. The process of  gaining basic 
skills, then job skills, then seeking employment, then is a process that 
could take many years, and can be an incredibly difficult and frustrating 
experience. Having a person help the job seeker along the way can make 
a major difference in achieving success.

In addition, this particular approach is key to the consideration of  the 
very specific needs of  the North End. Many service and training pro-
viders interviewed by this class noted that there is a “service provider 
learning curve” that forced providers of  assistance to tailor their pro-
grams to certain traits of  the North End. These traits include:

With the success brought about by pursuing a case-based approach, El 
Puente can establish itself  as a model workforce intermediary and com-
pete in an arena of  private funding unavailable to most social service 
agencies in the North End. 

Models
In a typical case-based program, an outreach worker is assigned a group 
of  job seekers. The caseworker assesses the needs of  a job seeker, and 
helps him or her access resources that can be of  assistance, such as 
childcare resources, an ESL or GED course, or information about how 
his or her benefits will be affected by income earned. The case worker 
then regularly follows up with the job seeker, making sure that he or 
she continues progressing through the available training programs and 
services to a job. 

This model has been shown to be both necessary and a significant 
source of  success for other workforce programs. One well-known 
example is Project QUEST in San Antonio, Texas (www.questsa.com), 
in which participants receive support from case managers for a full 
two years. Evaluation has shown that program length is a key part of  
QUEST’s high success rate. Federal programs such as the Job Training 
Partnership Act (JTPA), which only provides casework assistance for 
four months, have enjoyed less success. Especially when learning a new 
language or basic skills, having the assistance and encouragement of  a 
caseworker for at least two years is key.

Strategic Recommendations

On the following pages, we present an overview of  three strtagies which 
we believe have the potential to transform workforce development in 
the North End.

Approach

Workforce Training Program: 
Healthy Beginnings

Objective
To establish a model program of  case-managed worker training and 
placement in healthcare, the largest growth sector in Springfield.

Description
The healthcare workforce development program will have three phases: 
first, the harmonization and coordination of  existing training programs 
for youth and adults. Second, the establishment of  a labor market inter-
mediary capable of  shepherding workers through a multi-tiered process 
on a case-by-case basis into initial living wage-level employment in the 
sector. Third, the program should eventually be expanded to include 
follow-up of  workers who have secured employment to help them gain 
further skills and certifications to move farther up their job ladders.

For the second and third phases to work at all, this program will require 
very close collaboration with employers in the healthcare sector. This is 
partly because training needs across jobs in this sector vary widely, and 
so the allocation of  limited training resources will only be made efficient 
if  employers are communicating clearly where the openings in their or-
ganizational structures are, as well as their specific interests in skills and 
training. Therefore, in the first phase of  this program, a coalition will be 
built that can effectively approach employers as the one relevant entity 
with whom to communicate about the local workforce supply for local 
healthcare employment. The building of  this coalition, along with a 
subsequent agreement to set formal terms of  cooperation with employ-

ers in the sector, will be the basis for eventually seeking funding to make 
this a program with its own dedicated administrative staff.

Rationale
Across Massachusetts, the aging of  the workforce creates two important 
opportunities for immigrants: first, the chance to replace older workers 
as they retire; and second, new jobs are created in healthcare to ac-
commodate the needs of  the growing elderly population. Already, the 
healthcare sector provides 8,000 full-time positions in Springfield alone, 
over 1,000 of  which require an associate’s degree or less while paying at 
least $12 per hour. The amount of  capital investment already operating 
in this sector cannot be matched by any publicly-supported job cre-
ation efforts, and the aggregate job compensation and mobility offered 
by this sector are on a scale far greater than anything possible through 
micro-enterprise efforts. Therefore, if  the alleviation of  poverty and the 
capacitation of  North End residents to take control of  and transform 
their neighborhood is a goal of  the Campus Committee, then training 
for work in the healthcare sector is a necessary topic for concerted ef-
fort.

Implementation
Short-term (1-2 years)
Convene workforce-development service providers and employ-
»
ers: The Executive and Program Directors of  El Puente create a 
healthcare-sector training coalition in the North End much like 
the original design of  NEON: an outreach and coordination effort 
that reduces duplication of  effort between agencies with similar 
programs and goals. Employers will discuss with training agenicies 
how to make programs more effective conduits to jobs, and ideally 
would develop formal relations between the training coalition and 
employers’ hiring departments. For example, they might collaborate 

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

»

to provide guaranteed in-person job interviews for all students who 
reach a certain level in the training programs. Equally as important, 
the group will work to consider workforce training in health care as 
a North End-specific goal.
Train NEON staff: The information gained from employers and 
training providers will have to be communicated to NEON staff, 
whether through their participation in the initial meetings or 
through separate trainings conducted by El Puente staff. In either 
case, the goal will be to build outreach workers’ knowledge of  the 
skills needs of  these jobs, which programs address which gaps, and 
how residents can participate in a long-term training process to 
reach basic literacy and requisite skill levels on job-specific skills.
Perform outreach/begin case management: Once service provid-
ers and employers have been brought together to build consensus 
on how best to cooperate on outreach to North End residents, 
the staff  of  El Puente will coordinate with staff  from NEON to 
increase program attendance with door-to-door outreach. In this 
phase, case management will begin in a somewhat simple form, in 
which return visits to residents will be to check up on their progress 
and see how other programs/support may be appropriate to help 
them in their job training and search paths.
Tailor programs based on outreach and case management results: 
Based on anecdotal feedback and initial surveying efforts on the 
part of  NEON, information on bottlenecks and limitations in pro-
gram design and location will be brought back to the employer/ser-
vice provider coalition for further discussion. From this discussion 
will come plans on how to alter the design and logistics of  these 
classes to facilitate increased participation and success on the part 
of  North End residents.

Mid-term (3-4 years)
Evaluate impact: Once the coalition’s outreach methods have been 
»
established and its members have taken North End-specific needs 

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

»

»

»

»

»

»
»

into account for at least one year, the program can be evaluated 
with a formal mechanism. Some important impacts to measure 
include: 
The increase in job training program enrollment for each coali-
»
tion member
The increase in North End residents as proportion of  overall 
enrollment change
Number of  job placements for North End residents through 
participating programs
The placement percentage rate for North End residents vs. pro-
gram average overall
The average wage of  new placement job
The average number of  separate training programs to which 
NEON workers refer each resident
Generate partnership agreements with employers: After establish-
ing multi-year partnerships that brings to employers local workers 
that fully meet their training needs, an important part of  the agenda 
should be to deepen the partnership with guaranteed positions for 
graduates of  the coalition’s sequence of  training programs. What 
makes this a reasonable commitment will be the previous two years 
of  activity that show how cooperative effort on the part of  service 
providers can lower employers’ costs and improve relations with the 
local community. 
Apply for funding as a workforce intermediary: With proven, mea-
surable results stemming from concerted effort on the part of  local 
training providers and employers (not to mention the dedicated 
efforts of  El Puente staff  in cooperation with NEON), a North 
End-wide “Healthy Beginnings” coalition can be prepared to com-
pete for major private foundation resources. These resources will be 
key to expanding the number of  outreach workers and case manag-
ers, as well as administrative support in El Puente to coordinate all 
of  these efforts. This funding would both add staff  in these orga-

nizations and contribute to the resources of  the individual training 
providers who would be collaborative partners in the grant.

Long-term (4-5 years)
Increase job ladder support: Although movement through job 
»
ladders should be part of  the coalition’s dialogue all through its 
process, this aspect of  the workforce intermediary’s activities will 
require more attention once the groundwork of  the program has 
been laid. Improvement through job ladders would include helping 
workers develop three-year plans for their promotional ambitions 
after initial hiring. 

Funding & Staff 
The funding structure of  this workforce intermediary is intended to  
ratchet up as the program builds its own competence. At the beginning, 
it will act as one of  the several responsibilities of  El Puente staff  to 
handle the coalition-building and coordination. Any shortfall in capacity 
on NEON’s part to carry out the necessary outreach for the program 
must be met either through grant writing from El Puente staff, contri-
butions from coalition members, or both. Once the program reaches its 
second phase (Years 3-4), a separate El Puente employee will be needed 
to carry out the impact evaluation; based on the overall El Puente plan, 
this should come as a direct result of  the overall organization’s growth 
path to hire dedicated employees for workforce development efforts. 
If  this is not accomplished before the healthcare workforce coalition 
is prepared to move forward, then an independent evaluator will need 
to be contracted. The funding application approach as described in 
this phase will also be the source of  the increase in administrative and 
outreach staff  (the latter of  which will remain under NEON) over the 
long-term continuation. 

ESL Program: Comprehensive 
Vocational English

Objective
To focus existing English as a Second Language (ESL) classes on work-
force readiness issues, help residents approach gaining language skills as 
part of  a life-long learning process. and more effectively lobby for fund-
ing of  a comprehensive ESL strategy for the North End.

Description
We recommend that the campus:
1. Make changes to existing language courses taught at the campus to 
better serve particular groups of  residents.
2. Integrate ESL into a case-based workforce development strategy.
3. Start building a case for El Puente to argue for the resources needed 
to combat illiteracy and language barriers in the North End on a large 
scale.

Rationale
There are two main types of  English classes – “survival” classes and 
occupational classes. Survival classes focus on helping residents to get 
around, help their children with their homework, and access services. 
Because most adults in the North End come in with very low levels of  
English and overall literacy, most of  the classes offered through the 
campus or other local social service organizations are of  this type, while 
most of  the classes taught at the local community colleges are occu-
pational in nature. Most of  these occupational courses require some 
existing English skills, and relate specifically to particular occupations. 
Although the classes taught at the campus are usually at or over capacity, 
many of  the classes offered in other areas of  the community are not at 
capacity, especially those connected more directly to job training. 

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

Although there is a need for greater ESL classes at all levels, workforce 
development may best be served in the short term by reaching into this 
gap between “survival” ESL and workforce ESL, to make sure that 
students who start out in classes offered by the social service agen-
cies progress to the more technical courses offered through the train-
ing institutions. This indicates a need for English courses taught at the 
“survival” level that provide a greater focus on job skills, and in provid-
ing students the resources needed to move from one level of  ESL to 
another. 

Implementation 
Short-term (1-2 years) 
Make changes to existing language courses taught at the campus 
to better serve par ticular groups of  residents.

»

»

Organize classes by students’ purpose, not just their skill levels. Sur-
vival English classes should be separated into Job Skills sections that 
include only students who are learning English specifically to help 
with their job search or to access workforce training, and sections 
that include those learning English to address daily tasks and needs. 
Even beginner lessons in these Skills classes can include role playing 
interviews or workplace situations. Often, beginning classes are not 
as effective as they could be because they are focused on “survival” 
English. These classes are not very useful for students who need a 
more concentrated focus on reading skills or vocabularly to build 
readiness for workforce development programs, and make it harder 
for students to see the progression from language acquisition to job 
acquisition.  
Invite recruitment staff  from other programs to visit job readiness 
ESL classes. Job Skills ESL classes should be tied to other existing 
classes and resources outside the North End. Bilingual services and 
recruitment staff  from MCDI, STCC, and FutureWorks should be 
invited to these classes to speak about their programs, and should 

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

»

»

be consulted in the skills that students should have when they enter 
these classes. In focus groups, many residents reported that they 
believe that there is no one at these training centers who speaks 
Spanish, even though there are many Spanish-speaking staff  and 
Spanish-language resources available at these centers. Introducing 
someone from these programs directly to students can make them 
more comfortable when accessing these options.  
Focus some ESL resources on those already in the workforce. Gain-
ing English fluency is not a matter of  taking one class, it is a set of  
skills learned over time. Focusing some resources on those already 
in the workforce who want to increase their skills can be a very ef-
fective use of  scarce resources in increasing incomes as students are 
able to access further training and job opportunities.
Encourage men to participate in ESL classes. Fewer men than wom-
en are currently participating in ESL classes throughout the spec-
trum of  courses offered. This problem is not unique to the North 
End. Many ESL and basic literacy programs in Western cultures 
attract many more women than men. Often this can be countered 
by marketing and creating classes specifically for men. Sometimes, 
stereotypes of  language skills being “feminine” skills can be over-
come by providing courses on computer training, job skills classes, 
or other types of  issues, but starting the class with language acquisi-
tion at its core. Creating a men-only English class may make men 
feel more comfortable and encourage their participation as well. 

Mid-term (3-4 years)
Integrate ESL into the case-based workforce development strat-
egy described above).
The case-based method will seamlessly integrate ESL with the over-
»
all workforce development strategy. Workers uncomfortable with 
English would be advised by their caseworker to start with an ESL 
class before entering a job skills class, and case workers can help 
students identify classes at their level throughout their progress. In 

addition, caseworkers can help people currently working to improve 
their English enough to access job ladders. 

Long-term (4-5 years)
Star t building a case for El Puente to argue for the resources 
needed to combat illiteracy and language barriers in the Nor th 
End on a large scale. 

»

The North End needs to prove its demand for ESL resources not 
only by holding classes on the Campus, but by sending students 
through training programs in other parts of  Springfield as well. Al-
though beginning ESL classes at the Campus, the Gray House, and 
other social agencies are often oversubscribed and have long waiting 
lists, there is often excess capacity at the community colleges, which 
makes it difficult to argue for more workforce development resourc-
es to be allocated at the city or regional level, which is the scope 
at which most of  the resources are allocated. Increasing student 
participation from the North End in ESL classes outside the North 
End will strengthen arguments for more resources in the future to 
be allocated to the North End. Right now, the community colleges 
often do not know how many of  their students are from the North 
End community.
To start building a case, NEON needs to keep good records of  who 
is interested in training classes, what attendance is at classes that are 
offered at the Campus, and how many North End residents’ access 
ESL training courses outside the North End. When there is demon-
strable demand for ESL, based on resident surveys and increased 
participation in other programs, the workforce development work-
ing group of  El Puente can attempt to develop and fund a compre-
hensive ESL program. 

Funding & Staffing
To implement a case-based approach, NEON would need to increase 

its capacity in terms of  knowledge about ESL training programs, and 
in terms of  sheer staff  time. NEON could do this by having one 
dedicated person who would be in charge of  knowing all about the 
different ESL resources offered in Springfield, and who would be an 
access point for information between the North End residents and the 
Springfield ESL community. This staff  member could also be charged 
with reporting to El Puente about progress made in ESL training, and 
about ESL needs that El Puente may want to advocate for in the larger 
Springfield community. 

This may not start out as a full-time position, but would become one 
as more and more clients were added into the program. In addition, all 
NEON case workers should be trained in basic ESL methodologies. 
Many Springfield organizations, such as the United Way and Lutheran 
Social Services, offer such basic training for free. In this way, the case 
workers will better understand the methodologies used in ESL classes, 
challenges and frustrations faced by their clients, and how to encourage 
them along the way.  

Other Considerations
Learning English in a totally Spanish-speaking environment 
creates an additional barrier
Although residents feel more comfortable in the North End, the cam-
pus may not be the best place to study English. Anyone who has gone 
through a high-school language course knows how hard it is to learn 
any language when there is little chance for interaction with “real” 
speakers who force one to speak and practice. Much ESL research 
points to the benefit of  mixing students of  different language groups, 
encouraging communication in English. Also, having residents interact 
with others outside the North End can increase their comfort level with 
English speakers overall. Perhaps the North End could collaborate with 

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

the services offered new Somali residents to create blended classes that 
will require Spanish speakers to communicate in English. 

ESL is an area in which volunteer and youth participation is 
particularly effective
ESL, as opposed to many other community needs, is an area in which 
volunteers from inside and outside the community can be of  great 
assistance. Although classes need trained teachers, tutors providing indi-
vidual instruction can help as well. When the North End is approached 
by local colleges with offers of  collaboration, ESL tutoring can be one 
of  the main “asks.” Volunteers should be trained in ESL and literacy 
methodologies. In addition, youth are a great resource here. Young 
people who have grown up in Springfield speak English well, and with 
some training, North End youth can be effective English tutors, increas-
ing their confidence as well as the language skills of  adults. 

ESL should be a component of  any job training or workforce 
readiness proposal 
When evaluating any proposal for job training program collaboration at 
any level, El Puente should consider whether the proposal includes ad-
dressing English language instruction.

Youth Training Program:     
Focus on Youth, School-to- 
Work Program

Objective
To increase school retention for a majority of  North End youths, support 
career exploration at an early age, an  increase access  to entry  level work 
by North End youths.

Description
The Youth/School-to-Work Program is a comprehensive system that 
helps youths in the North End make an effective transition from school 
to career-oriented work or to further education and training. When it 
is fully in operation, the Youth/School -to-Work program will provide 
intervention and prevention services to young people in the North End. 
The goal is to encourage young people to dream beyond the often-
limiting conditions of  poor minority communities by giving them the 
confidence, education, resources, skills, and relationship they need to 
reach their potential. It will combine School Retention, Career Explora-
tion and Access to Entry-level Work to engage student interest, enhance 
skill acquisition, develop positive work attitudes, and prepare youths for 
high-skill, high-wage careers.

Rationale
In today’s world of  increasing knowledge, new technology, and intense 
competition, the path to a living wage job starts with the attainment of  
a good high school education at a minimum. But the many youths in 

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

the North End dropping out of  school leave a frightening expectation 
of  the future direction of  the community. 

In order to stem this tide, it is imperative to encourage young people in 
the North End not only to remain in school but also to gain essential 
skills that will give them a better future. It is against this background 
that we are proposing that the Campus Committee considers a Youth/
School-to-Work Program. We envisage that the Program will have three 
key strategies: The first strategy includes an initiative to increase K-12 
completion and ensure a corresponding increase in the percentage of  
post-secondary enrollments into colleges. The second strategy is career 
exploration, and the third is providing entry-level work opportunities 
for qualified North End youths.  These strategies are designed to give 
new perspectives and new meaning to the lives of  many North End 
youths. By giving them access to education, resources, skills, and rela-
tionship, we believe that young people in the North End can transform 
their community into a better place to live. 

Programs
School retention
To pursue this goal, the community needs to provide essential support 
to young people. We propose that under the school retention initiatives. 
One example of  a typical activity could be youth mentoring and tutor-
ing by college students, especially in math, reading and science.  We 
understand that a similar program of  this kind is being implemented 
between at the Gerena School with Smith College. We believe this effort 
should be expanded to include all youth living in the neighborhood. A 
partnership between North End youths and college students will spark 
the flame of  inspiration that may encourage many of  them to pursue 
further education.

Examples of  School Retention Programs
Establish a mentoring program involving community leaders and 
»
residents and professionals working within and around the North 
End.  Many of  the older people in the community already function 
in mentoring capacities for young people as they seek to keep youth 
out of  trouble and on the right track.  These individuals could be 
supported in their role through training and information that will 
help them direct youths into productive learning activities.  
Youth mentoring and tutoring by college students, especially in 
math, reading and science.  We understand that a similar program 
of  this kind is being implemented between the Gerena School 
and Smith College. We believe this effort should be expanded to 
include other area colleges, particularly the ones in Springfield. A 
partnership between the North End students and college students 
will spark the flame of  inspiration that may encourage many young 
people to pursue further education. 
College promotion and incentives.  This is an initiative in which the 
Campus Committee could negotiate with area colleges to promote 
interest in completing high school and attending college. Through 
activities such as college weekends or camps, area colleges can give 
young people an opportunity to sample the college experience, and 
a small number of  merit scholarships for North End neighborhood 
youths who excel in academics and community service.  
Parental support and involvement. Parental involvement can take 
the form of  coaching for parents on supporting their children’s 
education and keeping them in school.  Other ideas include joint 
learning activities by parents and children that help parents create 
a learning environment within the home. An example of  this is the 
“Technology Goes Home” program model that many Community 
Development Corporations used. It involves parents and children 
learning to use computers together, and receiving a free computer 
to take home at the end of  the program.

Technology in Youth Programs. Various models of  Technology in 
Youth Programs are possible. Some are examples are as follows: 
After-School  Tech  Time  –  This  model  integrates  computers  with  other 
activities  in  the After-School  program, where  there  are  regular  times 
for technology
Walk-In  Computer  Center  –  Youth  can  come  at  anytime  during  open 
hours to use the computer.
Computer Club – This model provides a once a week activity particularly 
targeting children who are interested in technology.
Computer Classes for Youth – Classes provide computer classes with top-
ics  of   interest  to  youth  such  as  video  production,  web  design,  and 
digital music mixing.
Teen Tech Entrepreneurship – This program helps teens start a youth-run 
business in, for example, web design, T-shirt business, graphic design 
while using technology to teach technical and business skills.
Career exploration 
Education experts have observed that young people are more likely to 
stay engaged in education if  they develop career interests. Career camps, 
for example, could be organized by local areas colleges such as Smith, 
University of  Massachusetts, or Springfield Technical College. Ohio 
State University College of  Medicine holds a day camp for high school 
students who want to become doctors, with medical students as their 
supervisors/mentors.  Activities include a range of  classes and labs that 
help students identify their strengths and interests. A career camp in the 
health professions in collaboration with the Baystate Health System is 
another example of  how the community could undertake a career explo-
ration activity. 

Examples of  Career Exploration Programs
Set up a Community Youth Center in the North End, which provides 
»
a range of  services for at-risk youths.  These may include creative 
enterprises that design, produce, and market products such as t-

0 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

»

shirts, tiles, and greeting cards, performing arts programs (including 
dance, music, and theater), and CD production.  These programs 
are designed to build self-esteem, discipline, and academic, creative, 
business, communication, and leadership skills.
Summer camps that concentrate literacy classes and tutoring for 
neighborhood youth, volunteer opportunity for students and tu-
tors, math and science clubs that are held once a month or summer 
camps that focus on career exploration in science and technology 
fields, remedial education and early college programs.

Implementation
Short-term (1-2 years)
Form a Youth/School-to-Work Implementation Subcommittee in the Campus Com-
mittee.  The subcommittee will refine and detail the early-stage institu-
tional and programmatic priorities and organize the handoff  of  imple-
mentation responsibilities of  the program to a lead implementing entity.

Designate a lead Implementing entity.  Once a lead implementing entity is 
identified, the subcommittee on Youth-to-Work should begin discus-
sion with the entity to confirm if  they would want to play this role and 
to develop an organizational plan to achieve this transition.  This might 
likely involve the following:
Identifying additional organizations to participate in this group and 
»
contacting these organizations
Developing an initial work plan
Obtaining professional capacity.  This may initially involve using 
“loaned staff ” from participating organizations (i.e., staff  who 
devote a proportion of  their work time to the activities of  the lead 
entity), but will eventually require putting in place dedicated profes-
sional staffing.

Develop initial work plan for lead implementer.  Working with its constituent 
organizations, the lead implementer should develop an initial work plan.  
The work plan should include the following:  
An organizing campaign to engage more neighborhood residents in 
»
the process of  skill-building and employment for young people
A plan to expand and coordinate outreach, information, and referral 
capacity
Identification of  high-priority youth development programs and 
services

Plan for longer-term initiatives to address youth needs.  While addressing the im-
mediate task of  beginning an effective Youth/School-to-Work program, 
the lead implementing entity should begin to put in place a long-term 
strategy to focus on youth education and career development. These 
might include mentoring, tutoring and internships, professional devel-
opment classes, job search assistance, technology training, GED, ESL, 
and other preparatory courses for college and for the workforce.

Institutional 
Recommendation

El Puente: A New Organization for Economic 
Development Planning in the North End

Introduction

The North End Campus Committee is uniquely capable of  taking the 
lead in bringing together diverse neighborhood organizations, and playing 
a leadership role in local economic development planning.  The purpose 
of  this section is to highlight the opportunities and implications for creat-
ing a stronger, more centralized economic development mechanism in 
the North End.

»

In order to fulfill the vision of  a population-based approach to economic 
development:
NEON’s household-level outreach and case management capacity 
»
must be strengthened.
Private and public sector agencies must collaborate to assist North 
End residents.
A core group of  professionals must be hired to lead economic devel-
opment efforts.
The North End Campus Committee should initiate this new capacity, 
recognizing that inter-agency cooperation always benefits community 
residents. 

»

Rationale

The North End community has benefited tremendously from the work-
ing relationship between the Campus Committee and many institutions 
including the City of  Springfield, Baystate Health System, Western Mas-
sachusetts Economic Development Council, the Regional Employment 

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

Board, and many other regional and state level economic development 
agencies.   

The community has also benefited from inter-agency cooperation 
through the creation of  NEON by five human and health service agen-
cies that recognized the importance of  household-level outreach in the 
neighborhood.  In spite of  severe resource constraints, NEON has been 
able to reach over 6,000 residents in the North End.  The organization’s 
commitment to a case-based approach to healthcare serves as a useful 
model for community and economic development activities in the North 
End. 

Creating a New Organization

Despite all the successes achieved by the Campus Committee and its 
status as an invaluable forum for debate between different stakeholders, it 
is our belief  that there is a need for a new organization. This new organi-
zation will be able to reach a larger community of  service providers, local 
government, and donors. It will also have an explicit focus on economic 
development in the North End, and as a 501c(3), it will be poised to re-
ceive funding from many organizations.  These goals are hard to reach by 
the Campus Committee given its large size and lack of  legal status. 

Therefore, we recommend that the Campus Committee takes steps to 
create a new organization explicitly focused on economic development 
in the North End. We tentatively call this organization El Puente (The 
Bridge) because it will be a bridge between the community in the North 
End and the resources available to it. 

Connecting Organiztions   
Committed to a Better North 
End 

El Puente’s primary responsibility will be to manage the partnerships already 
built by the North End Campus Committee.  One way in which El Puente 
will succeed in this mission is to identify and secure city, state and federal 

El Puente Executive Director and its Program Manager are ultimately 
responsible to a governing Board of  Directors.  Members of  this Board 
of  Directors would be nominated and elected by members of  the 
North End Campus Committee for a three-year term.  The El Puente 
Executive Director would formally present a financial report and a 
statement of  activities to the El Puente Board of  Directors on a half-
yearly basis.  

The North End Campus Committee would continue to meet once a 
month, and would act as an advisory group to El Puente.  The Chair of  
the Campus Committee and the NEON Program Director will serve 
on the Campus Committee and they will finalize the agenda for the 
monthly meetings.

resources that can support the existing organizations in the North End. 
The by-laws and articles of  incorporation of  El Puente should reflect 
this mandate, and explicitly direct El Puente to only fundraise for col-
laborative economic development programs. 
El Puente will be an engine for fundraising and organizational growth. 
Therefore, it is important to clarify its composition, reporting proce-
dure and accountability structure.  In its first couple of  years, El Pu-
ente would be staffed by two economic development professionals: an 
Executive Director and a Program Manager (Appendix E).  Both the

Next Steps

Over the course of  the next four months, the Chair of  the North End 
Campus Committee should report to the Campus Committee on the 
the following issues:

Incorporation of El Puente
The Committee Chair should engage a non-profit consultant, a regional 
or national organization that provides consulting and infrastructure ser-
vices to non-profits, or a law firm to provide professional counsel.  Such 
counsel can provide guidance on how to go about creating and structur-
ing El Puente. Particular emphasis should be paid to determining the 
governance and reporting structure of  El Puente.  A lawyer should also 
draw up statutes for the Campus Committee which will remain an in-
formal coalition of  stakeholders.  These statutes, at a minimum, should 
provide for the tenure as well as voting rights and responsibilities of  
Campus Committee members, and the designation of  an honorary Om-
budsman.  Membership to the Campus Committee should be expanded 
to include the El Puente Executive Director along with representatives 
from MassMutual and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission.
Advising Baystate’s Community Ben-
efits Program
The North End Campus Committee Chair should submit a formal 
proposal to Baystate Health System to appoint the El Puente Executive 
Director to the Baystate Medical Center’s Community Benefits Advisory 
Council.  
Seed Funding for El Puente
The Committee Chair should report on progress made in discussions 
with Baystate and other institutions on funding salaries for the El Pu-
ente Executive Director and Program Manager.   

 | Plan for Economic Development in the North End

Over the course of  the next four months, the NEON Program Direc-
tor should report to the NEON Governing Board on on the following 
issues:
Legal Status of NEON
NEON remains a program of  five different entities as it had been origi-
nally conceived.  NEON enjoys a distinct identity within the North End 
and strong relations with the residents through its Community Health 
Workers. While it may choose to remain a program under the umbrella 
of  five human and health service agencies, NEON must consult with its  
legal counsel on the implications of  providing voter education services 
in the neighborhood.  Depending on the specific nature of  a voter 
outreach or education drive, the provider must be incorporated as either 
a 501 c(3), 501 c(4), or a Political Action Committee (PAC).  Failure to 
comply with campaign finance regulations could be very damaging for 
NEON.  

NEON Staff Development
In order for NEON to provide effective case-based assistance to North 
End residents, its outreach staff  must be expanded to at least its original 
planned capacity of  ten staff  members.  The NEON staff  should be 
trained on data collection and outreach that is specifically useful for eco-
nomic development planning.  The El Puente Executive Director could 
provide this training directly and assist the NEON Program Director 
with fundraising for additional Community Health Workers.

Community Profile

The North End is one of  17 neighborhoods in Springfield, Massachu-
setts, the third largest urban center in Massachusetts.  Many well known 
companies make this city an important base for their operations. These 
companies include Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, 
Friendly’s Ice Cream Corporation, Milton Bradley, Peter Pan Bus Com-
pany, and Smith & Wesson. In addition, the Baystate Health System, 
today a recognized major teaching and research facility, has a significant 
history in the Springfield area.

However, Springfield is also known for several public health crises and 
low educational attainment figures.  The city has the state’s highest 
mortality rate and the second highest diabetes rate. Over 10% of  the 
population has less than a 9th grade education, almost double the state 
average. In addition, the failure rate in Springfield for Massachusetts 
Standardized Tests is approaching 75%. Poverty is an increasing crisis 
with almost 20% of  Springfield families living below the federal pov-
erty level. Consistent with national trends, poverty rates are higher for 
children and people of  color in Springfield.

The North End consists of  two Springfield neighborhoods separated 
in 1961 by the construction of  Interstate 91: Brightwood and Memo-
rial Square. These two neighborhoods are home to approximately 5,000 
residents each. This area has a long and proud working-class, ethnic his-
tory.  The first Puerto Ricans arriving here were attracted to Springfield 
and the North End community in particular because of  job opportuni-
ties. Originally, migrant laborers came from Puerto Rico to work in the 
farms of  the Connecticut River Valley. Eventually, some decided to stay 
year-round in the closest urban area – Springfield. With this commu-

Appendix A

nity established in the North End, increasing numbers of  Puerto Ricans 
moved to Springfield to reunite with friends and family. The thriving 
manufacturing sector of  Springfield also provided economic opportunity 
for this newly arrived group.

The North End is mostly residential and is bordered by the Connecticut 
River, downtown Springfield, and a nearby industrial area. The neighbor-
hood is dominated by youth, yet has a significant elderly presence.  Since 
the early 1960’s, the North End community has been a safe haven for the 
rapidly expanding Puerto Rican population: over 75% of  the residents 
in the North End are of  Puerto Rican heritage.  Commercial activity is 
centered on Main Street in the Memorial Square neighborhood, and on 
Plainfield Street in Brightwood.  Main Street contains many retail and 
service businesses.  Most storefronts are occupied, although some lots 
along Main Street are vacant.  Plainfield’s commercial activity is predomi-
nantly industrial and manufacturing-related, with some industrial sites less 
than a block from residential properties.  Many of  the sites are vacant or 
in disrepair. 

The community is known as the poorest in Springfield and contains the 
poorest census tract in the Commonwealth of  Massachusetts (according 
to the 2000 census). With a 50% high school completion rate (a statistic 
which is even lower for males alone), the North End also has the lowest 
educational attainment in the city. Incarceration rates are high with 10% 
of  the community population passing through the Hampden County 
Correctional Center each year. The community also exhibits high rates 
of  environmentally related diseases such as asthma and diabetes. Twenty 
percent of  families report that at least one member of  the household 

 Plan for Economic Development in the North End  | 

Appendix A

suffers from asthma. In addition, as of  1999, Springfield had the 11th-
highest new HIV case rate in the country. Other health related chal-
lenges include a high teen birth rate and infant mortality rate, as well as 
low child immunization rates.

Although the community faces many challenges, the population of  the 
North End is relatively stable. The family structures are strong with 
many extended families supporting each other through good and bad 
times. The Puerto Rican culture, particularly through music, food and 
dance, maintains its prominence within the community and is seen as a 
source of  pride for the neighborhoods. There is also wonderful spirit 
and community involvement throughout the North End with voter par-
ticipation rates reaching 40% for board elections of  the local citizen’s 
council.

Methodology & Data Sources

Project Timeline

Data Collection

Appendix B

We began with a project kick-off  meeting with NEON and leaders of  
the Campus Committee in Springfield.  The team left this initial meet-
ing with impressions, preliminary information, and a charge: to develop 
a population-based economic development plan for the North End. 
We followed-up with stakeholders individually and began an analysis of  
constraints and opportunities for workforce development, small busi-
ness development, and real estate in the North End, based on both 
qualitative and quantitative data.  

Our analysis of  opportunities and constraints was then presented to the 
Campus Committee and interested parties through an interim review 
with a small group of  Campus Committee members.  We recommended 
an economic development plan with two inter-related tracks: workforce 
development and real estate development.  The Committee asked that 
we continue our efforts with workforce development, but that we pur-
sue business development as the second track.  

After considering the Committee feedback, we revisited our charge.  We 
undertook new analyses and began developing a plan based on follow-
up conversations, group interviews, a survey of  residents, a physical 
survey of  properties on Main Street, and additional quantitative data 
analysis. In-depth interviews were conducted with both formal and in-
formal business owners in the North End. In our third and final review 
with the Campus Committee, we presented a summary of  our work, 
recommendations, and next steps. 

Our quantitative assessment consisted of  analysis of  data collected 
from a variety of  sources including the U.S. Census (2000), Bureau of  
Labor Statistics, Springfield Redevelopment Authority, Springfield As-
sessors Department, and the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission. 

Qualitative data were collected primarily through stakeholder and resi-
dent interviews and focus groups. Approximately 40 interviews were 
conducted with stakeholders, and three focus groups were held with 
residents and local business owners. A survey of  103 residents was also 
conducted by NEON. A summary of  findings from focus group inter-
views is attached below, as well as a list of  interviewees. 

Focus Group Summaries

Informal Business Focus Group
Four North End residents with informal businesses run out of  their 
residences participated in this focus group.  All four were women, pro-
viding child care, beauty services, handicrafts, and professional services.  
Half  started their own businesses by choice after or while pursuing 
other jobs.  None of  the four supported themselves or families solely 
on the money generated by their business.  All expressed an interest in 
growing their businesses and sought information on what they needed 
to do and what funding might be available.  The women requested 
information on permitting and licensing procedures, small business 
loans, and office space. The women reinforced the idea that there is a

disconnection between existing services and entrepreneurs and a need 
for greater outreach.

ingly thought that not knowing English was their biggest barrier to get-
ting a job, confirming the community’s need for more language services.

Formal Business Focus Group
Five formal business owners were interviewed in this focus group.  All 
were men, and four were located on Main Street.  Concerns about 
property management, availability of  community support and funding, 
and accountability were shared by most.  The need for engagement with 
and investment in the community and their neighbors was expressed 
by all.  All mentioned limited resources and a lack of  property control 
as hurdles to growing their businesses.  Two expressed interest in some 
sort of  merchant or business owner group on Main St. to address issues 
such as safety.  All places of  business had customer activity during the 
time of  interviews. These business owners generally supported the need 
for new retailing opportunities in the North End, as this would create a 
broader market for their goods and services. Furthermore, they felt that 
for long-term, coordinated business development to take root in the 
North End, the property control issue must be addressed.

Non-Working Resident Focus Group
Twelve non-working North End residents participated in this focus 
group.  Ten women and two men discussed applying for jobs, the type 
of  work they pursued, and the barriers to employment they experience.  
Two central themes emerged from the discussion:  a lack of  knowledge 
of  services (although there is some dissemination of  information by 
word-of-moth), and the urgent need for English language skills. In ad-
dition, all were committed to the neighborhood and not, as some other 
Springfield stakeholders had indicated, transitory residents interested in 
making money and returning to Puerto Rico.  Participants overwhelm-
