Observer Comments
 
anti-BDC (cited many 
examples, made a good case). 
Initially unwilling to share 
feelings. 
Customers came in asking for 
advice, demonstrating owner’s 
depth of knowledge/expertise.

Comments
 
Very active in community, with 
youth and cultural matters.  Feels 
that others (business owners?) do 
not help the community. 
Has worked to bring things to the 
neighborhood/community, feels 
that in many instances efforts 
have been thwarted or 
commandeered by the 
Council/similar. 
Feels landlord is trying to get him 
out of his Main St. space.  Building 
used to be owned by a different 
landlord, felt he was better.  Feels 
landlord is not trustworthy, 
actively destroying neighborhood. 
Has not received help from the 
community, has done everything

17 years in the 
North End  (split 
between 2 
locations) 

General sense that the primary 
neighborhood organization 
does not give much actual 
assistance to businesses.   
Distrustful of neighborhood 
powers-that-be, sense that 
people have to make it on 
their own. 

on his own.  Could use help (TA), 
but is distrustful of any help due 
to previous experiences. 
Moved to this site from other site 
as a result of local politicians’ 
efforts to move business type out 
of the inner neighborhood.  Still 
leases old space, though it is 
empty.   
Current landlord owns business 
across street, feels he is trying to 
get this business out so that 
landlord can use the space for 
storage. 
Commented that only two similar 
businesses are left in the North 
End, probably needs more and 
that there used to be more before.
Has gone to the Council (New 
North) for help, but he didn’t get 
any.  People say they will help, but 
rarely follow through, follow-up. 
Would like to move back to the

old space. 
Does well, is the only business of 
its kind on this side of the North 
End.  Would like to move, there 
are no lights outside the shop at 
night.  But there is nowhere to 
build nearby, not sure where to 
go. 
Would not be interested in a cart 
because it would require an 
additional employee, and owner 
cannot support one. 
Owner unavailable 

First shop, had start-up help from 
family.  Likes location, lives in 
neighborhood.   
Would be interested in some sort 
of merchant group that would 

Tiny location, very busy, lots 
of kids (after school time), felt 
lively and positive—a 
community gathering spot.  
Many other folks came in and 
out. 

Large, clean, bright space.  
Had areas with sofas, 
television, toys for young 
children, tables, video games. 
Appears to be well-developed 
business. 
Non-Latino owner 
(Vietnamese).  Had one 
employee, young Latino.   
When he spoke of break-ins 
there was no anger or surprise 

work together on safety issues.  
Says that other owners just aren’t 
interested, don’t work that way. 
Had three break-ins and one 
hold-up in three months—
apparently these were “initiation 
to the neighborhood” to be 
expected for an outsider. 
Speaks of at least 10 other similar 
shops in the Springfield area, so 
there is strong competition.  But 
he offers low prices, good 
selection, and buys old products, 
so should be competitive in 
market. Most customers have 
been local. 

Received permit from city to sell 
non-food goods at a table near 
entrance to another business.  
Also has sold outdoors during 
neighborhood street fairs. 
Would be interested in selling 

in his voice, told them rather 
as anecdotes.  Made no 
suggestion that they were 
surprising or a reason to 
move/close.  Only suggested 
that a merchant group that 
worked toward safety would 
be helpful.   
Busy, youth/teens coming in 
and out, greeting both owner 
and employee. 
Local class contact spoke of 
how much he liked this store, 
how it was different than other 
similar little shops.  Had lots 
of new stock and was charging 
reasonable/fair prices. 
Noted that receiving permit 
from city was not very 
difficult. 
Great example of 
neighborhood cooperation 
among entrepreneurs through
