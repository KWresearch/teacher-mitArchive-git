Assignment for Session 2 

The four backgrounds reports on the North End provide both an introduction to the North 
End neighborhood and background on past planning initiatives and improvement 
agendas. For next week read the three reports that are currently available on the MIT 
server site. For each report and prepare a brief summary (2 to 3 pages) of your initial 
impressions of the North End and its most important economic development issues.  The 
summary should address the following questions: 

•	 How would you describe the neighborhoods? What are its major characteristics? 
•	 How would you describe its economic conditions? 
•	 What are the most important economic development needs and issues for the 
neighborhood? 
•	 What are key neighborhood assets or resources to help address these economic 
development needs? 
•	 What did you not learn from these reports that you believe might be vital to your 
understanding the North End and its economic development agenda? 

In addition to the summary, consider the following issues for class discussion:  

Whose voice or perspectives are reflected in these reports? Are there important 
perspectives that are absent? 

What gaps or biases exist in the information and how the North End is presented in these 
reports.  How might these gaps and biases have influenced your understanding of the 
North End? 

What do you want to learn from the field trip to enhance your knowledge and 
understanding of the neighborhood? What do you want to see, who do you want to hear 
from and what questions would you ask to gain this understanding?
