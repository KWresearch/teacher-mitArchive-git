Name:  Hodge factory visit  
Date:  Early September 
Description: 
It was during our first class trip to Springfield. One of our local contacts led a group of us 
on  a  tour  of  Brightwood,  which  included  a  walk  down  Plainfield.   Whenever  any  of  us 
would  ask  our  guide  about  one  of  the  factories  on  Plainfield,  he  would  say  something 
along the following lines:  
‘I  don’t  really  know  what  that  factory  makes  /  made.    I  don’t  know  how  many 
people work  / worked  there.    I don’t know anyone  from  the North End who works 
/ worked there.’   
We  stopped  in  the  driveway  of  the  Hodge  factory.  We  found  out  that  the  factory 
employed  over  40  workers,  and  that  a  larger  manufacturing  firm  had  recently  acquired 
the  Hodge  factory.    One  of  the  employees  went  in  to  the  factory  and  brought  us  a 
catalogue  of  the  products  assembled  on-site.    The  products  did  not  seem  remarkable  in 
terms  of  quality  of  design;  milled  stainless  steel  from  the  Northeastern  United  States 
hammered  into  shape  at  this  facility  in  Springfield.    It  was  then  that  the  factory’s  steel 
supplier said: ‘you’ve gotta keep manufacturing in the Northeast.’     
 

Why this moment: 
This incident gave me a sense of the expectations people had for us.  What on earth was I 
doing  in  Springfield?    I  could  not  keep  manufacturing  in  the  Northeast.    I  don’t  even 
know what manufacturing wages are in the Southeast, or in China!  But contrast what the 
steel  supplier’s  representative  said with what  our  guide  had  been  saying  all morning.    If 
our  class  were  to  improve  community  economic  opportunities  for  North  End  residents, 
then didn’t we have an obligation  to  find  them paths  into manufacturing  jobs?   Wouldn’t 
that mean  joining a  larger  struggle  to  strengthen employee power  in  the Northeast?   Was 
our  class  equipped  to  work  with  North  End  residents  with  that  objective  in  mind?    The 
one  thing  I  was  sure  of:  this  class  would  help  me  better  understand  the  extent  to  which 
local  economic  development  can  be  linked  to  larger  regional  or  national  political 
organizing.   

Community Economic Development 
 
Name:  Affirmative Action and Employee Power 
Date:  First / Second Class Meeting 
Description: 
In  the  course  of  our  overview  of  the  client,  neighborhood,  city,  region  and  field  at  the 
very  beginning  of  the  semester,  I  suggested  that  it  might  be  interesting  to  investigate 
affirmative  action  compliance  and  union  membership  as  ways  to  develop  programmatic 
and  institutional  recommendations  that  could  assist  North  End  residents.    I  found  the 
conversations that ensued, not all of which were direct responses to my suggestions, very 
interesting:    one  professor  said  that  the  neighborhood  had  a  relatively  high  proportion  of 
skilled  workers  who  could  not  find  permanent  employment  in  the  trades.    The  other 
professor said  that union membership was often a barrier  to workforce entry, particularly 
for  minorities.    None  of  us  were  quite  sure  if  the  city  of  Springfield  was  a  significant 
(public  sector)  employer,  or  how  an  investigation  into  affirmative  action  compliance 
would help our client.    

Why this moment: 
This  discussion  left  me  worried  that  our  community  economic  development  strategy 
would literally be too focused on the ‘community’.  In other words, I was worried that we 
might  only  end  up  pursuing  very  insular  strategies  aimed  at  improving  business, 
workforce,  and  /  or  real  estate  opportunities  within  the  community  itself,  as  opposed  to 
finding  ways  to  connect  North  End  residents  to  residents  in  other  majority-minority 
neighborhoods.    It  strikes  me,  in  retrospect,  that  we  did  not  push  the  envelope  in  our 
institutional  approach  to  community  economic  development.    For  a  city  that  is  often 
colloquially  thought  of  as  a majority-minority  city  (the  census  figures  suggest  this  is  not 
strictly  true),  it  is  striking  that  Springfield  still  has  an  Anglo  mayor.    Having  met  Juan 
Gerena  and  tried  to  dig  up  a  little  on  his  career  history,  I  cannot  help  but  think  that  the 
city  of  Springfield  is  governed  by  a  system  in which  neighborhoods  are  played  off  each 
other.    Development  is  located  at  the  level  of  individual  neighborhoods,  and  each 
neighborhood  has  its  own  citizen’s  council  that  provides  turf  for  local  political  bosses  to 
exert  sectional  interests while  not  disturbing  the  peace  at  the mayoral,  gubernatorial  and 
congressional  level.    One  consequence  of  this  system  has  been  the  designation  of  the 

North  End  as  the  neighborhood  for  the  poor,  disabled  and  unemployable  Puerto  Rican 
population. Enterprising and successful Puerto Ricans leave the North End.   

Low-Income and Minority Neighborhood 
 
Name:  Client Focus Group 
Date:  Early November 
Description: 
Our  conversation,  which  turned  out  to  be  our  first  and  only  intimate  group  conversation 
with the client staff, covered a wide spectrum of subjects. I was particularly struck by the 
way  in  which  one  staff  member’s  monologue,  in  English,  about  welfare  /  public 
assistance dependence in the North End crowded out everyone else’s comments.  Another 
student  and  I  then  engineered  a  way  to  bring  other  staff  members  back  into  the 
conversation  in  Spanish.    It  worked,  and  a  very  different  portrait  of  the  neighborhood 
tumbled out of one of the staff members’ mouths.  

 
Why this moment: 
I  had  read  articles  critiquing  conservative  narratives  on  ‘welfare  dependence’  in  Paul 
Osterman’s  class,  but  this  diatribe  was  the  first  time  I  was  treated  to  such  talk  at  close 
quarters.    I have  always maintained  that  some of  the  client  staff understand English very 
well,  but  are  hesitant  to  speak  in  English  (to  students  from  MIT).    Whether  those  staff 
were partly  responding  to  the  initial comments or simply expressing a  seldom  listened-to 
opinion  on  poverty  in  the  North  End,  I  cannot  be  sure.  What  I  am  sure  of  is  that  the 
different  staff  members  were  operating  with  the  resources  of  two  very  different 
discourses,  and  were  defining  poverty  in  two  very  different  ways.    The  first  discourse 
more closely mirrored conventional explanations for poverty, according to which poverty 
is  behavioral  and  public  assistance  gives  the  poor  perverse  incentives  to  stay  poor.    The 
second  discouse  more  closely  resembled  the  human-capability  perspective  that  has  won 
Amartya  Sen  the  Nobel  Prize  for  Economics.    The  second  opinion  spoke  of  a  very 
different  kind  of  poverty,  which  was  not  exclusively  tied  to  income  deprivation  but 
thoughtfully engaged with the effects of health disabilities and incarceration.  I was raised 
speaking  two  languages  and  I  am  always  fascinated  by  the  different  discursive 
possibilities and outcomes of talking in two languages.  From this conversation I not only 

developed  a  deeper  understanding  of  how  the  welfare  dependence  narrative  hurts  low-
income and minority communities, but  it also  reminded me  that outside  the  conventional 
discursive  framework—which  seems  obsessed with  the  relative merits  of  ‘public’  versus 
‘private’  solutions  to  the  behavioral  problem  referred  to  as  poverty—other  narratives  on 
poverty do exist and do inform community-level action. 

Low-Income and Minority Neighborhood 
 
Name:  Brightwood Clinic visit 
Date:  Early November 
Description: 
I  went  out  to  Springfield  to  interview  Campus  Committee  members  with  the  hope  of 
finding out more on  the community’s history and  relationship with Baystate.    I waited  in 
the Brightwood Clinic patient waiting area for no more than two minutes.  It was perhaps 
the most  informative  two minutes  I spent  in Springfield.   For  the  first  time  I was  literally 
surrounded  by  North  End  residents…the  people  who  were  not  our  clients  but  certainly 
the reason why we had come out to Springfield on that and other days.  It was only 10:30 
in  the  morning,  but  there  was  no  standing  room  in  the  patient  waiting  area.    It  was 
relatively easy  to distinguish patients  from  their  family caregivers who had brought  them 
to  the clinic.   Patients were  typically disabled,  in need of assistance with  their movement 
or  breathing, while  family members  usually waited  beside  patients,  often  standing  rather 
than sitting.    

Why this moment: 
I can scarcely remember seeing neighborhood residents during that first tour of 
Brightwood.  Of course there were people on Main Street and elsewhere that I saw, but I 
never noticed any of them.  Two minutes in the Brightwood Clinic changed that…for two 
minutes.  It was the only time I caught a glimpse of the health problems that were so 
common in the North End, and the resources that had been deployed to combat them.  
Our clients were NEON and the North End Campus Committee – not the North End’s 
residential population.  The commitment to a population-based approach to economic 
development was an emotionally charged and important one, but ultimately we sought to 
assist our client, not directly the people whom I saw for two minutes in the patient 
waiting area of the Brightwood Clinic.

Low-Income and Minority Neighborhood 
 
Name:  ‘Employed’ Persons Focus Group 
Date:  Mid November 
Description: 
A  couple  of  students  and  I  went  out  to  Springfield  to  meet  with  the  two  focus  groups.  
Two of us ended up with a focus group of one or maybe it was zero.  The person who had 
turned up as the lone ‘employed’ North End resident was in fact a self-employed informal 
sector  entrepreneur.    He  ran  a  door-to-door  sales  business  in  Springfield,  Hartford  and 
New York.   He was not a man of much means but plenty of chutzpah.   Out of politeness, 
perhaps,  because  his  background  did  not  fit  the  profile  of  our  intended  focus  group,  my 
partner  and  I  asked  him  a  battery  of  questions,  mostly  about  his  education.    Our  line  of 
questioning  at  one  point  worried  him:  were  we  with  a  law  enforcement  agency?    Is  that 
why we were so curious about his unincorporated business? 

Why this moment: 
When  our  focus-group  attendee  got  up  to  ask  our  client  representative  if we were with  a 
US  government  agency,  it  struck  me  how  poorly  we  had  understood  our  client,  and  the 
residents  and  entrepreneurs  of  the North End.   Our  client  barely  understood  the  value  of 
the  focus group method, and God alone knows what  this resident  thought he was coming 
to when  he  agreed  to  turn  up  at  the NEON  office  one Friday  evening.   The  conversation 
between  planning  students,  community  health  workers  and  small  sector  entrepreneurs  is 
never symmetrical.  I’ll try and keep that in mind the next time I am assigned to work in a 
low-income or majority-minority neighborhood. 

Reflections as a Wannabe Planning Professional 
 
Name:  The Threat of Gentrification 
Date:  Early September 
Description: 
The  desire  to  change  the  external  perception  of  the  North  End  was  a  recurring  theme  of 
several  of  the  conversations  we  had  during  our  first  visit  to  Springfield.    A  Campus 
Committee representative spoke about the need to get as many of the Baystate employees 
as  possible  to  spend  their  disposable  cash  in  the  neighborhood.    Some  of  them  talked 
about developing land for mixed-income as well as single-family ownership housing.  All 
this  seemed  to  amount  to  ‘gentrification’—the  dirtiest  of  all  dirty  words  in  the  planning 
lexicon.  

Why this moment: 
At  the  end of Gateway  in our  first  semester at DUSP, our professor  required us  to  take a 
final, which  included  a  section  on  Planning  Ethics.   One  of  the more  irritating  questions 
on  the  final concerned what  I  (as a planner) would do  if my client wished  to undertake  a 
project  or  initiative  that was  against my  own  ethics.    I  dismissed  the  questions  as  absurd 
in  the  way  it  was  framed,  and  answered  accordingly.    Cut  to  September  2005,  and  I 
recognized  the  similarity  of  the  ‘dilemma’  our  class  faced  to  the  one  posed  by  that 
professor.   The  reason  I  think  of  this moment  as  critical  is  that  I  realized  then more  than 
in any other moment how ill-prepared I was to function as a private consultant.  I am still 
not convinced that a less argumentative approach to that question would have helped me, 
but I have been humbled by this early experience in Springfield.   

Reflections as a Wannabe Planning Professional 
 
Name:  Management Consulting Style Report 
Date:  Early December 
Description: 
When  assembling  our  research  and  recommendations  into  a  final  report,  I  suggested  that 
it  was  not  essential  that  our  report  look  like  a  management  consulting  report.   We  were 
students  and  there  were  components  of  our  work  that  more  closely  resembled  applied 
research  than  cookie-cutter  produced  management  solutions  (or  at  least  I  would  like  to 
think so).  My suggestion, which was not one I was married to at all, was met with a good 
deal of hostility.   I was  told  that  this would portray an  inaccurate picture; we had worked 
together  throughout  the  semester  and  delivering  a  report  that  consisted  of  distinctive 
chapters  bound  together  by  an  introduction  (stage  setting  +  summary  recommendations) 
and  a  conclusions  (summary  recommendations  +  next  steps) was  not  appropriate.    I was 
not wedded to my suggestion, and I said nothing in response.  

Why this moment: 
I  have  very  little  respect  for  certain  top-tier  management  consulting  firms,  particularly 
after I spent some time looking at the final work products on urban development in India.  
It  did  not  seem  essential  to  me  that  we  flattened  the  research  and  intellectual  content  of 
our  semester-long  engagement  with  the  client  staff  and  other  stakeholders  just  for  the 
sake  of  producing what would  look  like  a  neat  *professional*  report.   What  the moment 
taught  was  that  I  was  comfortable  with  coming  across  as  tentative;  I  still  wonder  if  it 
really  helps  clients  for  a  planner  to  be  authoritative  in  all  his  or  her  recommendations.  
That  approach  seems  to  deny  the  fact  that  recommendations  are  arrived  at  after 
considerable  deliberation.    If  cookie-cutter  responses  worked,  then  why  even  hire 
planners.  Hire cookie-cutters. 

Reflections as a Wannabe Planning Professional 
 
Name:  Baystate Medical Center Community Benefits Report 
Date:  Early December 
Description: 
One of  the  last significant pieces of research  that I undertook was on  the Baystate Health 
System’s  Community  Benefits  program.    This  included  reading  Baystate  Medical 
Center’s Community Benefits  reports  for  2002,  2003,  and  2004.   What  I  found  out  from 
reading  these  documents  gave  me  more  insight  on  the  politics  of  planning  in  a  low-
income  community  than  any  other  single  article  I  had  read  previously.    Baystate  ran  a 
multitude  of  programs 
through  different  North  End,  Springfield  and  Western 
Massachusetts  agencies,  quietly  addressing  the  needs  and  aspirations  of  these  different 
organizations.  

Why this moment: 
What I was most struck by was the extent to which Baystate was a successful planner.  It 
met  its  productivity  and  profit  margins,  precisely  by  building  local  support,  cooperation 
and  even  dependence  into  its  strategic  business  plan.    Its  senior  executive  management 
had come to understand the political system that governed Springfield and leveraged it to 
the hilt.    It confirmed  for me  that  successful planners needed  to hone  in on  their political 
analysis  skills;  it  encouraged me  to  be more  of  bloodhound,  than  a  consensus-builder  or 
an activist-planner.   

Reflection Response 2 
Springfield Reflection Exercise 
 
Moments that shaped my understanding of community economic development 
 
1. Seeing how a community leader defines “economic development” 
First site visit - Early September 
After seeing the community, I had some ideas of what some perceived community needs 
might be (housing, concern about  drug abuse, youth programs, jobs), and I was confused 
when one community leader asked us first off, “What are you going to do about these 
vacant lots?” I was surprised at the limitation of his definition of economic development 
to physical redevelopment of property. 
 
2. Learning how little of the story numbers can tell.  
In class, Late September 
As part-time work, I do lots of number crunching to create baseline data for the creation 
of economic development strategies – for middle-income communities or whole cities – I  
am always pretty surprised by the stories that numbers can tell (who is unemployed, who 
is not, where pockets of poverty are, where the jobs are, what businesses would do well, 
etc.). When we all showed up in class with our data about this community, however, it 
didn’t seem to come together well. This is partially because of the small size of the area, 
but the data gave us little clue as to, for example, when so many jobs existed nearby, why 
even young people were not employed. We really had to talk to people to figure out what 
the major issues were.  
 
3. What is a neighborhood? 
Interview, Early November 
When talking to one teacher, when I asked if she knew if any of her students were from 
the North End, she said she didn’t know, but then asked if I really wanted to know 
whether any of her students were Puerto Rican or not. This came up a few times – 
especially because some community workers didn’t live in the community but were 
clearly part of it. Is the North End a geographic distinction? Or, were we really planning 
for the Puerto Rican community, and what’s the difference? I still haven’t answered these 
questions for myself.  
 
 
Moments that shaped my understanding of working with a low-income and 
minority neighborhood. 
 
1. Déjà vu of my Peace Corps experience 
First site visit – Early September  
I was a Peace Corps volunteer for two years in the Caribbean, and my first trip to the 
community was almost just like my first trip to the middle-class community in a 
developing country where we were trained at the beginning of our services. I was 
surprised that I had the same feelings of strangeness and of hospitality that I found in 
another country in my own country.   

 
2. Recognizing the issue of dependence on public assistance. 
Focus Group, Mid October 
From one of our focus groups, several comments came about a perception that many 
members of the community were not interested in a job because of their dependence upon 
public assistance. Some people in the community seem to be living on disability or social 
security not because of any clear medical issue, but because it was the best way for them 
to get by and take care of their family. It also seemed that in the community, people were 
actually encouraged sometimes to utilize these programs when they were not sick. 
Because I support these types of programs, thinking of them as possibly creating 
dependence makes me uncomfortable – who am I to say who should or should not get 
certain benefits, if they quality for them?  However, I personally believe that being able 
to support one’s family is an important source of personal pride for a lot of people, and I 
did wonder whether the social service agency focus on getting people signed up for such 
programs was kind of sabotaging the next generation in the community.  
 
3. Thinking through how hard it is to learn a new language.  
Writing the final report, Late November 
When reflecting on my notes from my interviews with several workforce development 
practitioners, especially those teaching ESL, I started thinking about what it would be 
like to be in your 30s, have no English, two kids, and be trying to learn English well 
enough to function in a job. I did a few thought experiments based on seeing students 
progress during my own past as an ESL teacher, as to how long it would take, what your 
options would be, and it made me realize how amazingly hard it would be to start with 
almost no English and get a meaningful job in the North End.    
 
 
Moments that shaped my view of myself as a planning professional 
 
1. Interviewing a local practitioner 
Mid-October 
When interviewing, we of course always had to explain the class we were taking and 
what “urban planning” is. I always have a hard time with this question, but, by about the 
fourth or fifth time, I felt better able to represent my what I’m doing at school then I’ve 
ever been able to before.  
 
2. Team Meltdown 
Team Meting, Mid-November 
Our team had a lot of problems settling on particular economic development strategies 
because we all had different ideas on what that would look like. Whenever I had worked 
in a team before, either the problem was so straightforward that it was easy to frame, or, 
as it was in my previous workplace, people approached the problem from such a similar 
stance that there was general agreement on how to proceed. This was extremely 
frustrating. Also, I was realizing I was making decisions not based on the merits of 
people’s ideas, but on how much work they had done to get to them, and how engaged 

they were as people in the process at all. Looking back, we should have come up with 
some clear goals early in the process, and then always gone back to them as a guide.  
 
1. Final Presentation 
Early December 
I usually hate public speaking, especially in class presentations, because I often don’t feel 
confident that I know what I’m talking about – especially when working on a 
hypothetical case that I don’t have all the information about. However, having 
communicated with many people in the community both through my own interviews and 
those of teammates, I felt confident that, at least for a few small issues, I did know 
something. It made me realize that this type of confidence comes from talking to so many 
people that you feel that you know the community.  
 
 

Reflection Response 3  
Community Economic Development 
1. Name of Critical Moment: Resources are enormous  
Date (timeframe): Early November 
Short Description: I was talking to a representative from a CDC outside of the North 
End when she started telling me about possible sources of funding for CDCs. It was 
only then that I thought for a moment and realized how numerous resources could 
be and how diversified they should be. You have to knock on many doors, they are 
there. But you have to discover them first.  
Why this moment was critical for you: I always understood unconsciously that there are 
many funding resources, but I never connected them together to realize the 
momentum they could create in the economic development for any community.  
 
2. Name of Critical Moment: Love-hate relation with Baystate 
Date (timeframe): Late November (meeting with the Steering Committee)  
Short Description: One steering-committee member from Baystate was very 
supportive of a population-based approach to community development. He talked 
utopian. It was in conflict with what I expected from a Baystate representative.  
Why this moment was critical for you: Large companies are not necessarily bad as 
neighbors even though they are usually perceived negatively.  
 
3. Name of Critical Moment: The restaurant menu 
Date (timeframe): Early November 
Short Description: Client staff reproducing a hand-written menu for one of the 
restaurants in Main Street 
Why this moment was critical for you: God is in detail. Such a small detail had a great 
effect on the performance of this business in particular, and on the incremental 
success of Main Street in general. However, detail alone does not work. 
 
4. Name of Critical Moment: The NE has 131 vacant land parcels  
Date (timeframe): Early October  
Short Description: When categorizing the GIS database, I realized that the 
neighborhood has that huge number of vacant parcels, but they are not all assets. 
Why this moment was critical for you: Many “assets” could act as a challenge for 
economic development if not used wisely. 
 
5. Name of Critical Moment: 50% high school completion rate in the NE 
Date (timeframe): Late September  
Short Description: We were discussing in class the NE characteristics when we 
discussed this fact 
Why this moment was critical for you: How can we do population-based development 
without having the human infrastructure?  
 
Low-income Minorities  
1. Name of Critical Moment: Minority majority is hard  
Date (timeframe): Early November  

Short Description: Meeting with community members. A lady has been living in the 
US for more than 17 years, and she is hardly able to communicate in English 
Why this moment was critical for you: How should we deal with racial comfort zones?  
They are segregating.  
 
2. Name of Critical Moment: Alienated in every moment, even when the meeting is 
about solving alienation  
Date (timeframe): Late October and again in December 8th  
Short Description: Client staff sits either in the back row of the Campus Committee 
meeting, or they are totally absent 
Why this moment was critical for you: They should have asked: can we even be given a 
credit for our ability to manage ourselves (especially with all the amazing and hard 
work that we do)? 
 
3. Name of Critical Moment: Fake employment  
Date (timeframe): October  
Short Description: Census saying that unemployment is 0% in the NE, while it is 
more than 33% for two-parent families, and 44% for single-parent families 
Why this moment was critical for you: Read statistics actively  
 
4. Name of Critical Moment: Primay resources really count  
Date (timeframe): Late November  
Short Description: Focus group with informal businesses. There was a flood of 
information gained from them 
Why this moment was critical for you: Basic research is essential, but it is only one step. 
We need to go further and rely on data from the community in the second step  
 
Planning Profession 
1. Name of Critical Moment: Client representative’s skepticism of our work  
Date (timeframe): Late November (committee with steering committee)  
Short Description: Rep said: we don’t need more meetings, we need an action plan 
Why this moment was critical for you: Meetings are great, but they are useless for 
development if action does not follow 
 
2. Name of Critical Moment: Lunch for our interim meeting with the Campus 
Committee  
Date (timeframe): October 18th  
Short Description: Interaction between our team and the Campus Committee 
Why this moment was critical for you: It was my first meeting with a client. I realized it 
is a real project 
 
3. Name of Critical Moment: Silence among the Campus Committee 
Date (timeframe): December 8th  
Short Description: Campus Committee  members were relatively silent after the 
presentation 
Why this moment was critical for you: The client is convinced and our argument was 
well narrated, he does not care, or he does not understand. We need follow up 
questions to understand the real situation.  

 
4. Name of Critical Moment: Meeting with one of the stakeholders that never 
happened  
Date (timeframe): October and November  
Short Description: Many attempts to get hold of one of the stakeholders with no 
success  
Why this moment was critical for you: You have to insist on getting what you want from 
stakeholders and other parties. If you don’t, you are missing something 
 
5. Name of Critical Moment: Believe your eyes, not those of others 
Date (timeframe): October and first half of November 
Short Description: A Campus Committee member insisted that the Main Street is very 
safe. We saw a police raid ourselves. Whom should we believe? 
Why this moment was critical for you: Be critical of whatever you hear, no matter what 
the resource is

Community Economic Development 
1)   Moment: Anger of business owner 
  Date: 12/2/05 
  Description: During an interview with the owner of a Main Street store, I felt for the 
first time what we had been talking about for a while—a palpable anger against those 
in the North End working against community interests. 
  Meaning: It is one thing to say you understand a community’s dynamics, but until 
talking to the real people affected, I didn’t have a full appreciation of what that meant. 

 
2)   Moment: Impact of property vacancies 
  Date: 9/16/05 
  Description: During our first walk through the North End, I was struck by the impact 
that all of the property vacancies had on the feeling of the neighborhood. 
  Meaning: Community control of property is crucial to development; otherwise, 
absentee landlordism can have such a damaging effect. 

 
3)   Moment: Discussion of pushcart program 
  Date: 11/17/05 
  Description: After an hour-long discussion with a CDC program manager who had 
implemented a “model” pushcart program, I asked him whether he thought it had a 
real impact on economic development in his neighborhood—and he answered “not 
really.” 
  Meaning: Though our team and client still thought the pushcart program was a good 
idea, it was a reality check to hear that a fully developed, successful program still 
only managed to have a minimal impact. 

 
4)   Moment: Realization of institutional needs 
  Date: 11/10/05 
  Description: Following a meeting with client staff, the students were talking about 
neighborhood challenges and we realized, more completely than previously, that the 
success of all programs depends on a new institutional capacity in the community. 
  Meaning: Though I appreciated how integral capacity building was to our project, the 
realization that an entirely new organization was probably required was definitely 
daunting. 

 
Low-Income and Minority Neighborhood 
1)   Moment: First night visit 
  Date: 9/15/05 
  Description: My home-stay our first night in Springfield was with a family member of 
one of the client staff, and I walked into her home as a complete outsider and stranger, 
and it felt more unfamiliar that many experiences I’ve had in foreign countries. 
  Meaning: The home was a stereotypical scene, but our conversation really cut through 
preconceptions and was incredibly interesting and helpful in understanding how 
people live in Springfield. 

 

2)   Moment: Campus Committee Representative and Colleague 
  Date: 11/3/05 
  Description: During our second meeting with this representative she introduced us to 
a colleague working on economic development in the North End, but her 
pronunciation Anglicized his name. 
  Meaning: Previously, this representative had come across as a relatively enlightened, 
progressive figure, but the fact that she Anglicized her colleague’s name suggested to 
me that perhaps he was a “token” Puerto Rican in the office who gave legitimacy for 
their work in the neighborhood—this was very disappointing and frustrating. 

 
3)   Moment: Story of a Main Street store owner 
  Date: 12/2/05 
  Description: During an interview with the owner of a new store on Main Street, we 
learned about his “initiation” to the North End, which involved his store being robbed 
twice and him being held at knife-point. 
  Meaning: The matter-of-fact manner in which he told the story was really striking—
he basically accepted that this is how things work in the North End. 

 
4)   Moment: Failed attempts to reach neighborhood stakeholder 
  Date: 9-11/05 

 
4)   Moment: Visit to bodega  
  Date: 12/2/05 
  Description: We were trying to interview the owner of a bodega, but couldn’t get to 
him because his store was too full of children buying after-school snacks. 
  Meaning: We had spent a lot of time looking at the Campus as a community center, 
when in reality, the bodega was a locus of activity as much as anywhere. 

 
Planning 
1)   Moment: Client staff excluded from final presentation 
  Date: 12/8/05 
  Description: Before leaving the Client’s staff office to give our final presentation, 
several of the staff members were there saying goodbye, and not coming with us. 
  Meaning: It was very unfortunate and striking that the very people around which we 
had built our plan were excluded from our presentation—and emblematic of the North 
End hierarchy that maybe we could have done a better job of cutting through. 

 
2)   Moment: Meeting with Client staff 
  Date: 11/3/05 
  Description: We held a small meeting with 3 staff members to discuss our initial ideas 
for business development, and I got a much better understanding of them as 
employees and people than previously. 
  Meaning: I think I started to understand the dynamics within our client organization at 
this point, and that our earlier work definitely would have benefited from this 
understanding. 

  Description: Approximately 7-8 times during the semester I tried to reach an 
important neighborhood politician and stakeholder, but my voicemails all went 
unreturned. 
  Meaning: I was really hoping to form my own opinion on this stakeholder’s influence 
on the North End by talking to him directly, but unfortunately he wouldn’t respond, 
so all we had to go on were other people’s accounts. 

 
5)   Moment: Silence following final presentation 
  Date: 12/8/05 
  Description: During the question and answer section of our final presentation, there 
were long periods of silence that were difficult to interpret—confusion, displeasure, 
weariness about forming a new organization, etc. 
  Meaning: Silence really can be as important as words, and though I don’t think we 
fully knew how to interpret it, the unresponsiveness definitely seemed to mean that 
people were processing what we’d said.

Critical Moments 
Reflection Response 5 
 
1. Those moments that shaped your understanding of 
community economic development 
 
Name of Critical Moment:  
Dynamic leader doesn’t have all the answers. 
Date (timeframe): 
Dec. 1 (Pre-presentation meeting with community 
leaders) 
Short Description: 
At the meeting with the community leaders before our 
final presentation, one of them began to talk about his 
idea for a PCA co-op. I remembered the first team I had 
heard this speech, it sounded off-the-cuff, like the 
idea had just come to him.  This was the third time 
that I had heard this speech, however, and so it became 
clear that it was a stock item, not off-the-cuff at 
all.  
Why this moment was critical for you: 
It made me realize that, although this leader was 
dynamic with a million truly great ideas, he didn’t 
have all the answers. No one does. 
 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
I wished for a structure to plan. 
Date (timeframe): 
October 
Short Description: 
At some point, it seemed like no one knew how to move 
forward.  I wished that we had had a structure in place 
to report progress, note problems, and resolves 
disputes. 
Why this moment was critical for you: 
When I worked for a developer over the summer, weekly 
meetings were held in which the architects always had 
an agenda for each meeting with unresolved items from 
last week and specific people to check in with. I think 
that sort of thing is really necessary in planning, as 
well. 
 
 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
The approach may determine the result 
Date (timeframe): 

Sept. 
Short Description: 
In doing the readings for class, I was struck by how 
different methods of analyzing economic problems seemed 
to reflect different assumptions about what constitutes 
economic development.  
Why this moment was critical for you: 
It seemed to me that how you choose to analyze the 
problem may very well determine how you will choose a 
solution. 
 
2. Those moments that shaped your understanding of 
working with a low-income and minority neighborhood• 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
Planners’ assumptions are not all the same. 
Date (timeframe): 
First Campus Committee meeting 
Short Description: 
A city planner for the city discussed some ideas for 
revitalizing the community, one of which was brining in 
a bigger developer to build large tracts of single-
family homes.  I found myself shocked that this would 
come from a city planner. 
Why this moment was critical for you: 
The idea of building higher-income, single-family 
housing to spur economic development seemed not just 
counter to my instincts, but in total opposition to 
what I have learned in planning school makes equitable—
or even effective—policy. That the idea came from a 
fellow planner, someone whom I would have imagined 
would have had a similar education to my own, made me 
realize that I shouldn’t assume that I know someone 
else’s assumptions, and that I should be explicit—at 
least to myself—about my own. 
 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
Negotiations take place among planners as well as among 
stakeholders. 
Date (timeframe): 
October (midway through process) 
Short Description: 
At some point, our workgroup reached almost a 
standstill as differences of opinion as to how to move 
forward could not be resolved. 
Why this moment was critical for you: 
Going into the project, it seemed like the hardest 
thing to do would be to get the various stakeholders on 

board to one plan, but it turned out to be just as 
hard—maybe harder—to get the team on board with one 
recommendation. I think that in the future it would be 
helpful to have some sort of mechanism in place to 
resolve disputes and check on progress ahead of time. 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
Reflection is valuable. 
Date (timeframe): 
Dec 21 (post presentation) 
Short Description: 
During our last class, we took time to reflect on 
critical moments of the planning process. 
Why this moment was critical for you: 
I had thought it was going to be a waste of time, but 
was surprised to find that the time to reflect allowed 
me to really take in some lessons I didn’t know I had 
learned along the way.  I almost wish the practicum had 
a journal requirement. 
 
3. Those moments that shaped your view of yourself as a 
planning professional 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
I felt comfortable. 
Date (timeframe): 
Sept. 15 (first trip out) 
Short Description: 
I met with the client staff, spoke Spanish with one of 
them, and had normal-type conversations with people.  
Why this moment was critical for you: 
I was surprised to find that I felt very comfortable in 
this neighborhood. I don’t know that I would feel as 
comfortable in all low-income, minority neighborhoods. 
I am, after all, pretty wealthy and white, but I had a 
strong cultural connection with these people, and I 
found that it made it very easy to communicate with 
them. 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
All the leaders were white men. 
Date (timeframe): 
Sept 16, first trip out 
Short Description: 
After meeting with several community leaders, I noticed 
that all the most vocal community leaders seemed to be 
white men, including the head of the Spanish American 
Union! 
Why this moment was critical for you: 

It seemed a little odd. It made me wonder how deep a 
revitalization scheme would need to go to bring our 
leadership from within the community. 
 
 
Name of Critical Moment: 
Who’s being represented here? 
Date (timeframe): 
First Campus Committee meeting 
Short Description: 
At the first meeting, exactly one member of the 
community who was not representing an institution was 
present. Client staff, who mostly lived in the 
community, were literally not at the table. 
Why this moment was critical for you: 
I thought that it was proof that you have to always be 
aware of who you are serving, who you are involving in 
the planning process. 
 

Critical Reflection Response 6  
Springfield Studio 
 
Reflections: 
 

1.  Those moments that shaped my understanding of community economic 
development. 

 

 
 
 

 

Critical Moment # 1: Analysis of the secondary data on sales gap 

Time Line: Early October 

Short description: The initial analysis of the secondary research showed that there 
was a demand in the restaurant business. I felt that people in the North End 
needed real help, and it seems apparent a restaurant business could not really meet 
the needs of the people in the North End.  
 
Importance: It was important for me because I felt we sometimes depend too 
much on statistics than we actually should. Our plan could only have more 
meaning for people if we stepped beyond secondary data and really engaged 
people in the community perhaps much earlier than we did. 
 
           Critical Moment # 2: Lectures by Karl on economic development 
 
 
 

Timeline: Late September-Early October 
 
Short description: the concept of economic development that I had been 
accustomed to in Africa involved mainly setting up businesses or providing loans. 
It never really crossed my mind that things like real estate development and 
workforce development could get into the mix as well 
 
It was important for me because it broadened my understanding of the issues we 
were grappling with in Springfield. 
 
Critical Moment # 3: First client meeting 
 
Time line:  October 21, 2005 
 
Description: Listening to the various stakeholders and their ideas, it occurred to 
be that Economic development can become a contested arena for big ideas, some 
of which may have little to do with the people we are trying to help. 
 
This was important for me because it helped to remind me that the goal of 
working in a community is to impact the lives of people.  
 
 

2.  Those moments that shaped your understanding of working with a low-income 
and minority neighborhood. 
 
Critical Moment: #1:  Meeting with client staff  
Time line: Mid-to late November- 

Description: In our meeting with the client staff, it occurred to me that staff 
members, who work in their communities, sometimes have their own vision of 
what they perceived the actual needs in community to be.  
 
This is important because I think it makes sense to give room to the expression of 
such ideas and to evaluate if those ideas can be implemented. 

 
    Critical Moment # 2 Collecting data working staff member 
        
Time: Early October  
 
Description: It was a rainy Saturday but the staff member was willing to work 
through the rain to help me with the task of collecting information. This person 
came across as someone who was deeply excited about the role she was playing 
and how she loves doing GIS stuff.  
 
This was important for me because it convinced me that people, particularly 
passionate people, are one of the key ingredients in working with low-income 
community,  
 
 
Critical Moment # 3: Little representation from the neighborhood  
         
 
Time line: First and Second client meetings, October 21, 2005 & December 8, 
2005 
 

Description: During our meetings with the campus committee, I noticed that there 
has been so little representation of the neighborhood residents on the Campus 
Committee and that even the client staff seem to be hanging at the margin. 

 
 

 

I think this is important because if we claim to work on behalf of people but do 
not include them or those who work with them daily in dialogues and 
conversations that affect their lives, then something must be wrong somewhere.  

 
3.  Those moments that shaped my view of myself as a planning professional 

 

Critical Moment # 1: What to recommend  
 
Time: Late November 
  

Description: we had a lot of struggle in coming up with what to recommend in my 
group. The struggles we had represented for me what professional planners face, 
when there is disagreement in what advice to give. The important lessons there for 
me was learning to make wise comprises.   
 
Critical Moment # 2: Conflicting agenda among stakeholders 
 
Time: December 8, Last meeting with the clients 
 
Description: Conflicting agenda among stakeholders was one of the big issues we 
faced at the last client meeting. In a sense this is to be expected, but I think the 
lesson it provides is one that says when stakeholders’ interests are at risk, the 
ultimate losers are beneficiaries, who get short change or nothing at all.  
 
Critical Moment # 3: Implementation is very critical  
 
Time: Last meeting, December 8, 2005 
 
Description: I felt discouraged about the response we got at the end of the 
presentation and I have the feeling that other people did have similar same 
feelings as well. What we really wanted to see in the end were big smiling faces 
and an enthusiastic campus committee that would be fired up to start 
implementation the next day. That didn’t happen. What it taught me was that 
planning is never really an apolitical process as much as planners may want to 
believe it should be.   I think we could have gotten our intended response had we 
been a bit more aggressive with our political game plan that probably should have 
included every member of the campus committee. Implementation is a key part to 
any plan and it involves managing the political temperature.
