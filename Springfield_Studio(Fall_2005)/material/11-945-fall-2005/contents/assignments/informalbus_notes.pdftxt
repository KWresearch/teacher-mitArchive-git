What is your 
business? 

Child care. Is trying to get a 
license. 

Manicure/Nail care. 

Crafts. 

How did you start your 
business? 

I was pregnant when I came to the 
U.S. and could not go out to work. 
That's how I started. And I like 
kids. Clients were mostly Mexican. 
A Puerto Rican lady that I knew 
connected me to them. I did no 
advertisement. I didn't receive any 
kind of assistance. I received CDR 
training(certified). I am not taking 
care of children now. 

I used to get my manicure done in 
a salon but I got tired of payments 
and decided to go to school 
myself. I came to the U.S., 
thinking that I would do this 
manicure work. 

I enjoyed making crafts when I 
was raising the kids. I never took 
a course, I just taught myself. My 
friends started buying my products 
and that's how I started. 

Informal Business #4 
Translator. Certified by 
LINGUA. Neighborhood clients 
include NEON and Spanish 
American Union. Applying for a 
state lincense, which requires 
taking an exam. Does not think 
it will be difficult to obtain. 

I was born in Puerto Rico and 
moved to the U.S. when I was 6. 
So I grew up to be bilingual. I 
worked in the welfare department 
for 25 years, and there I was 
doing translation. I recently retired 
from this work, and started 
working as a free-lancer.

Vision for the future 

My husband and I are trying to 
buy a house where we can use 
the basement for day care 
services. We found a house at 
one point but my husband got laid 
off so we are now starting from 
scratch again. I would be excited 
to start day care business in the 
new house, but I'd not like to have 
more than 5 children. I'm fine with 
a few. If I want to make it bigger, I 
would need to hire someone, 
which I would not like to do. 

I would like to have my own salon. 
In Puerto Rico, my friend was 
providing manicure service in her 
own house. That was nice. Now I 
have to do it in my sister's 
apartment and it's inconvenient. I 
saw people distributing flyers in 
Puerto Rico and I'd like to do that 
too. I know that there is already a 
nail salon on the main street but 
it's owned by Koreans and they 
don't speak Spanish. 

I would love to have a store on the 
main street and sell b-day gifts, 
little crafts, and things. I don't 
think competition would be that 
fierce because crafts are creative 
and always different from one 
another. 

I would like to set up my own 
office and expand the business. 
Having the office on the main 
street would be nice but it's so 
difficult (expensive & limited 
space) and it can be elsewhere.

What is making it 
difficult to achieve 
yhour vision? 

We need to buy a house first, 
which we are doing now. 

Because I just moved to the U.S. 
and Springfield, I don't know how 
things work here. I don't have 
money, don't know how to start a 
business, I don't know anything. If 
I had contacts, I would like to have 
assitance and find out how to start 
a formal business but I don't 
know. If I could fine someone who 
would help me, I would love it. If 
there is an assitance person at 
NEON or elsewehere, I would 
come for help. I would even pay 
for this kind of service. 

It seems so complicated to start a 
business. Registration, license, 
property management, etc. would 
be so tough. Plus I don't have 
money. I don't know any 
assistance program. I have never 
thought about taking out a loan. 
The spaces seem to be limited on 
the main street. It would be great 
if someone could help us gather 
information. Otherwise the whole 
process of starting business 
seems so complex and 
impossible. 

What do you think 
about the push-cart 
program? 

I would like to open my little craft 
shop there. 

It's simply that I don't have money. 
I already have loans for my 
children and I wouldn't be qualified 
for another loan. If there is any 
loan available for starting a new 
business, I would jump on it. But I 
don't know any. If there is support 
to help rent office space, I would 
definitely use it. 

I think we need a market where 
people gather and sell those 
things. I have seen a market like 
that in New Mexico, and it seemed 
great. Puerto Rican women make 
excellent pastries that they would 
make great business out of.

Do you know other 
home-based 
businesses that are 
doing well? 

Many women do catering 
(pastries, party food, etc.) 

Informal Business #4 
Many people go to NY to buy 
jewelry and/or clothes and sell 
them in the North End. I know they 
make good money. Both men and 
women. There are home-based 
small businesses that can't be 
expanded because of the lack of 
financial resources.
