1.  The Return of Martin Guerre 

 
                In many instances history can be funny. Capturing 10 
                scientists and holding them hostage can be viewed, in 
                some light, as hysterical, and so is the story of the 
                fake Martin Guerre. This book doesn't exactly present it 
                as the funniest thing that ever was, but the basic 
                outlines of the story are nonetheless present. Who 
                wouldn't want to take on a fake identity from time to 
                time? 
 
                What I liked most about this narrative is that it was 
                obvious from the very beginning that the writer is a 
                woman. The voice with which she described the characters 
                seemed in some ways maternal. In addition, she was 
                (perhaps overly) kind to the female characters. 
                Bertrande de Rols did deserve our sympathy, but she was 
                also just as misleading as everyone else involved. Yet 
                Davis says of her that ´the obstinate and honorable 
                Bertrande does not seem a woman so easily fooled, not 
                even by a charmer like Pansette. By the time she 
                received him in her bed, she must have realized the 
                difference; as any wife of Artigat would have agreed, 
                there is no mistaking 'the touch of the man on the 
                woman'¡ (44). Bertrande is described very kindly. We 
                don't know for certain all these elements of her 
                character, Davis herself states in the introduction that 
                painting peasant's lives and personalities is difficult 
                for lack of written texts, but regardless, she gives the 
                wife the benefit of the doubt and assumes that because 
                we, today, would all know, then she must have been able 
                to tell the difference. It is interesting that Davis 
                mentions Pansette's charm in this phrase, to further 
                emphasize just how smart Bertrande was (in looking past 
                his charms). The word ´honorable¡ seems a bit odd to add 
                here, since her doubting his identity, yet accepting him 
                as her husband does not seem to fit that times' 
                definition of ´honorable¡. Regardless, Davis describes 
                this woman of the house as an intelligent and courageous 
                one, who deserves not only our sympathy but our 
                admiration. I wonder if a male writer would have given 
                the same description.
