A Brief History of Extinction 
 
I count myself among those who like to regard Native Americans as protectors of 

 

Nature.  In my mind, living their lives utterly at the mercy of the environment, the earliest 

settlers of this continent enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the natural world.  When the 

Indian hunted, he did so not for pleasure, but simply out of the necessity of requiring food, 

clothing, and household utensils.  Naturally, being human beings with tempers, it cannot be 

denied that occasionally the Natives overestimated their need for food, and massacred far too 

many animals, or perhaps only used a limited amount of the resources made available by their 

kills (such as buffalo tongues and humps).  However, never was there any wanton killing by 

Indians in pre-Columbian times comparable to that of the damage white recreational hunters 

and poachers inflicted when they overran the American continent beginning in the 18th 

century. 

 

Along comes The Ecological Indian, which seeks to carefully eradicate these 

misconceptions from my mind.  Indians, claims the author, were just as prone to waste meat 

and natural resources as the White Man.  Far from taking only what they needed, Indians 

enjoyed the hunt, and wantonly decimated the stock of buffalo, deer and beaver.  He does 

admit that Indians made efforts, however, at conserving animal herds in face of increasing 

decimation.  What Kreech seeks to analyze is whether it was the influence of white men 

which first caused the Indians to change their approach of taking only what they needed 

(rather than poaching large numbers of beavers to trade their furs for alcohol and guns, 

leaving the meat to rot, for example), and consequently also inspired the Native attempts at 

conservation. 

 

After reading his account, I am still partial to my view of the Indian.  I simply cannot, 

on the basis of the evidence presented, ever believe that the Indian abused his environment as 

much as the European settlers and adventurers did.  What I can fathom, however, is a causal 

link between emerging European trade and the commodification of natural resources, which 

encouraged Natives to increasingly abuse the stock of wildlife to meet an ever growing 

European demand for furs.  But simply because the White Man inflicted his attitudes toward 

the Environment on the Indian does not to me imply that it was also from the Europeans that 

the Natives learned conservation.  While perhaps the Native American was not an ideal 

ecologist or conservationist, he was still far more understanding of the natural world around 

him, and I thus continue to chose to place him on a pedestal of environmental exemplarity. 

 

The book itself was rather odd.  It was a fun read, but it read more like a story of the 

history of certain animals of the North American continent, than like a genuine attempt to 

understand Native American approaches to the environment.  The most fascinating chapters 

were not the “animal chapters”, but rather the early chapters of the book, stories of ancient 

settlements, Indian civilizations, and canals.  Having traveled to Indian country a fair amount, 

I was familiar with most of the sites mentioned, and it was interesting to read a historical 

analysis on this subject.  The extinction chapter was the only chapter from which I actually 

gleaned any new information.  Who knew that there used to be giant beavers in the United 

States?  I am sure it was a conspiracy by Harvard students to eliminate those…
