CS Lewis & J.J.R. Tolkien 

I really love C.S. Lewis’s style of writing and though I am not religious at all I 

have found his study and push of religion (especially in the Great Divorce) to be really 

compelling. I had always heard of C.S. Lewis as a born again Christian, so it was 

interesting to here another point from the article, yet I disagree with it in his work being 

pessimistic. There is a strong feeling of darkness and human corruption and true evil, yet 

I don’t see that as a pessimistic view of the world. The impression I got from the great 

divorce was the feeling that salvation was all up to men; there was no reason people had 

to live in hell but by choice. It was sort of depressing that people would chose to be in 

hell but that they had the chance to keep changing their minds and go to heaven was what 

got to me and how it was just accepting Gods love for you and the wish to better yourself 

that got you there. 

 I like how penetrating he is in some of his chapters to make you feel silly for 

your own beliefs and so are better prepared to take on others. I found this especially in 

the beginning of the Heavens chapter in The Discarded Image he tell how scientists then 

talked about things having a liking to other things which we first would think as silly 

because they are not sentient. But then he goes on to make us feel silly for ascribing to 

our objects the ability to obey laws as if they had thought.  

I really liked how the article really tied their writing styles and thoughts the 

English disenchantment and World Wars. The depression of the little man at the end of 

Rings I feel really fits with the feelings of soldier depression when they were pushed 

away and not cared after instead of being heroes a lot more than any medieval 

connections.  

I was wondering why you had us read the Discarded Image over one of Lewis’s 

other books, especially after reading how the article believes it to be one of his worst. 

Lewis and Tolkien seem to be described as dinosaurs holding on to the old 

traditions but also as pioneers and breakers of traditions in many ways, breaking them to 

try to get back to the old.
