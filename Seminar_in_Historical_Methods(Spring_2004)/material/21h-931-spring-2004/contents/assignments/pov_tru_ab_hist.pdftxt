Telling the Truth About History 
 
I quite enjoyed the book Telling the Truth About History.  The content of the book

was quite interesting and enjoyable to read, but more importantly, the book inspired me 

to think more about what I think of history.  After reading the book, I sat for a while 

thinking about my thoughts on history.  A couple of sections that I identified with came 

from the chapter on “Competing Histories of America.”  The first quote that I found to be 

quite interesting, and mirrors some of my own thinking was Historians fashion the 

nation’s collective self-understanding.  I believe that this statement has a great deal of 

truth to it, which is one reason for my desire to be a history teacher.  There is a possibility 

that this is simply something that historians think to make themselves feel important, but 

I feel that historians do play a large part in how people view their country, they certainly 

have shaped how I feel about it. 

 

Another statement that came from the same chapter was a quote “’Tis  all in 

pieces, all coherence is lost.”  This statement is quite similar to part of the discussion 

from last week when we were talking about Plato to NATO versus specialization.  I find 

that sometimes in my history classes, so much of the time is focused on specialization, 

that the big picture gets lost along the way.  There is no doubt that specialization allows a 

historian to see what people were like, what an average person’s life was like.  To me, 

though, this information is useless as history if I do not have a very good understanding 

of the times in general, and the big events.  If all I want to know are the details, then I am 

a sociologist, because if I don’t have a clear view of the big picture, what I’m studying 

could very well be happening now, not in the past.   Another part of the book that has 

been a recurring topic in our class is whether things are relative to a certain time, like 

pain.  This is very similar to Herder’s argument that each culture and every historical 

epoch has to be understood on its own terms.   

The last part that I found interesting, and had to mention was the little bit about 

Leopold von Ranke.  I found it interesting that at the University level, history is taught in 

the same fashion as in the 1830’s.  Ranke invented the “seminar” in which students were 

taught how to read and dissect historical documents.  To me, that sounds very much like 

this class.
