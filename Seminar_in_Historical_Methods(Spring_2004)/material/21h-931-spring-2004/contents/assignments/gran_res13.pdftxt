One Quarter of Humanity 
 
China, in my mind, has for some reason always been the land of draconian child 

 

policy and female infanticide.  Perhaps remnants of that World Cultures Class which I took 

my freshman year of High School have selectively been retained in my mind.  So perhaps I 

am the ideal “Malthusian” observer whose myths needed to be shaken up. 

 

I gleaned several interesting facts from Lee’s and Wang’ study on Chinese population 

growth.  While I am quite familiar with basic assumptions, such that natural resources limit 

population growth, I found the discussion on preventive vs. positive checks quite 

enlightening.  The in depth discussions of Chinese marriage behavior, and the importance of 

the Chinese family in shaping population growth were both new ideas to me.  I also thought 

that the authors provided a convincing argument for the Chinese demographic transition from 

regulated fertility, to population explosion, and now to being the only industrialized nation 

which is actually dramatically reducing its population growth rate. 

 

The book itself was excellently structured around the central argument; the authors 

were clear to lay out their contentions early on and proceeded to prove each of their points in 

a thoroughly convincing analytical manner.  However, I am not sure how far I can trust their 

analysis.  I am especially concerned regarding the nature of their data.  What exactly are their 

sources for the varieties of the graphs they present?  What is the sample size they are using in 

calculating percentages?  Often, only data from about 13,000 Qing Nobles is available, surely 

this tiny fraction of people cannot be taken as representative of the entire Chinese population?  

Similarly, often only select data from certain periods and provinces can be found.  Do the 

authors really have enough ground to make the sweeping generalizations they propose about 

the entire Chinese population and demographic transition?  While often the authors do qualify 

their conclusions to be applied only to certain geographic regions and social classes, their 

final conclusions are applied universally to China.  Is this justifiable?
