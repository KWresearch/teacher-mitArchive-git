The Coachman’s Bare Rump and other Works from the MIT Faculty 
 
I don’t claim to be full-blown historian (not yet at least) so there is a chance that I

missed some grand chain that connect the works of some of the history faculty together.  

Because if there was one, I did miss it.  As far as I’m concerned the only ties between the 

pieces that I read were that they were written by MIT faculty.  It was, however, very 

interesting to read the works of the very people who have read mine, and graded mine.  I 

have had classes with Professor Dower, (who’s paper I did not get a chance to read, there 

were none left, but I have read a paper by him for a different class) Professor Ravel, 

Professor Jacobs, and I am currently in your class.  I must admit, though, that the pieces I 

read were quite intimidating.  I, one day, want to be a high school history teacher, and 

also attend graduate school for history.  One of the things that struck me while reading 

the papers was the tremendous amount of research and knowledge that it took to write 

those twenty or thirty pages.  When compared with anything that I have written so far, 

there is such an extreme gap. 

 

I was also a little bit shocked by how bored I was with some of the papers.  

(Sorry, yes, your’s too).  Many of them, with the exclusion of Professor Ravel’s (which 

can be understood since it was originally a lecture), simply seemed too specific (not the 

right word, but my vocabulary is failing me right now) for me to enjoy.  Maybe as a 

history student I should care more about the White Cattle of Britain, or the fertility of 

Swedish immigrants, but I really had a hard time refraining from just skipping to the end 

and reading the very last bits of these papers.
