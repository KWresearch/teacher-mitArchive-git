21H.931 Response Paper 5 
Prof. Anne McCants 
 
 

Just as I complained about the wording of the title of Bynum’s work last week, I will 

open my response with a grumbling about C.S. Lewis’ choice of title for his book.  This book is 

hardly “an introduction to Medieval and Renaissance literature.”  I must admit that I only 

skimmed the “evidence” chapters of the book, but even those do not seem to provide a solid 

foundation regarding the works he cites in his explanation of the Medieval Model.  This is not to 

say that the reader cannot understand his later arguments without this knowledge, as he 

elucidates them in great detail.  However, Lewis assumes certain knowledge of the reader of this 

work.  This is exemplified by his use of phrases such as “the reader should already be familiar 

with…” that assume the reader can put some of the evidence into context without Lewis’ help.  

For a reader such as myself whose only exposure to the works that Lewis cites the most is having 

read five or six of The Canterbury Tales, this was rather unsatisfactory.  Yes, I understood his 

arguments, but felt that it would have been more rewarding had I been able to better appreciate 

his literary examples and been able to see his connections and arguments more clearly.  Of 

course this book was compiled from many lectures he gave at Oxford where his audience would 

be expected to have some familiarity with the field, much like scientific lectures at our institution 

assume certain knowledge of physics, math and chemistry. 

For that reason I feel this book is no introduction to the literature, but to the Model 

argued for by Lewis.  My above complaint aside, I felt this was a wonderful work that clearly 

explained the origins of the Medieval Model of the universe and how they applied to certain 

writings of the period.  In fact I think that the usefulness of such a work is the exact opposite of 

what I stated above.  While frustrated by not understanding many of his references, Lewis gives 

me the confidence to dive into a Medieval work in the future and better understand and 

appreciate it.  He does this by explaining both the structure of a typical Medieval work 

(including the structure and reasoning behind Descriptio, Apostropha and Exemplum which are 

typically not seen in modern writing) as well as the meaning of many of the typical metaphors 

invoked by Medieval authors.  The best example I remember is his discussion of the planets and 

the types of people who are associated with each due to the planet’s characteristics. 

Of course, though, we are in a history class, so the question that struck my mind was 

what does Lewis’ work tell us about medieval history?  As a historical reader who has mainly 

focused on post-Renaissance history, this book helped to debunk some of the stereotypes about 

the Middle Ages that I had inherited from my general education.  For example, we are taught in a 

general, middle school level history course that the Middle Ages are the Dark Ages; that the 

genius of the ancients (such as Herodotus, Aristotle and Pliny to name a few) was lost upon these 

people.  Naturally, the rediscovery of these great works lead to a cultural explosion that would be 

called the Renaissance.  I was lead to believe that the Middle Ages were a time of Catholicism; 

the age of the Crusades and Inquisition.  Lewis has elegantly demonstrated that the Medieval 

Model was a fusion of both Christian and Classical ideals.  There was a place for both the 

Catholic God and for old man Saturn.  One was not a heretic for calling upon Venus for 

inspiration.  Thus to the relatively uninformed reader (me, at least in regards to the Middle 

Ages), Lewis’ work provides a different and more complete view of medieval society than I 

could have obtained from my traditional sources.  And so, though I struggled with this material 

more than the previously assigned works, I am grateful for Lewis for an introduction into 

medieval society through his Medieval Model, even if I may have missed a few of his points 

regarding the literature of the era.
