The Discarded Image 
 
After having read C.S.Lewis’ handy little book, I kept struggling to find a word with 

 

which to describe it.  After some rumination, Literature Review came to mind.  Although this 

term hardly does much justice to Lewis’ attempts to lay out a Model of Medieval cosmology, 

thought and belief, I think it does have some applicability, especially in Chapters 3 and 4, 

where Lewis extensively reviews the evidence. 

 

For quite some time, while I was reading the book, I was actually a bit lost as to what 

Lewis was writing about.  In the first two chapters, he--in typical Oxford Don Style--rambles 

on about the medieval conscience, savagery, religion, and the omnipresent Model, but 

unfortunately he is never very explicit about what this mysterious model actually is.  What is 

it that he seeks model?  Or said in another way, what Model is he seeking to establish?  Only 

upon reading Chapters 3 and 4, which examines the evidence from the classical and seminal 

period, did I slowly grasp his intentions.  However, the examination of his evidence was 

highly abstract and philosophical, and I was thankful for his more rudimentary, and 

sometimes highly entertaining, description of the actual components of the model in Chapters 

5 through 8.  

 

What really allowed me to appreciate the Discarded Image however, and encouraged 

me not to discard it from my mind immediately upon having read it, was Tolkien’s The 

Silmarillion.  In this book, which is the precursor to the epic ring trilogy, Tolkien sets out to 

describe the history of Middle Earth, beginning from its very creation.  In fact what he is 

really doing is conceiving a myth, a model of cosmology and belief for Middle Earth, 

precisely what Lewis does in a more directly scholarly fashion in The Discarded Image.  An 

omniscient being is imagined, from it derive the lesser ‘gods’, and there is a classic tale of ‘sin 

and fall.’  The creation of the world, and the character and nature of all its inhabitants are 

described.  Upon first reading The Silmarillion, which Tolkien considered to be his most 

important work, I did not quite understand exactly what he sought to achieve with it.  Now, 

however, my amazement is manifold.  While C.S.Lewis simply examines a model which the 

collective human conscience conceived of in a millennium, Tolkien entirely by himself 

creates a world of equal complexity in his mind, creates the necessary evidence, and models it 

just as eloquently. 

 

A final word about Lewis’ final words needs to be said.  Personally I am fan of 

conclusions, especially those that leave me confused, moved, inspired.  I would thus quite like 

to understand exactly what C.S.Lewis means with those simple words “Having eaten up 

everything else, he eats himself up too.”  Is this a reflection of man’s voracious desire for 

knowledge?  Is it a poetic eulogy for the death of the Model itself?  Is it simply a quip from a 

jocular fellow intended to puzzle his readership, or should I say dazzle?  I feel that this is a 

concluding paragraph that cannot be discarded, but rather deserves much closer examination.
