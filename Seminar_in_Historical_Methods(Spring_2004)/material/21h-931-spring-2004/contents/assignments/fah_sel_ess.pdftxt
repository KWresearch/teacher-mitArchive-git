 
Fertility, Marriage and Culture: 
 
 

This paper takes an interesting look at stereotypes people have about immigrant 

families and birthrates.  It makes the argument that the open lands in the west influenced 

those regions demographics.  Using data about marriage ages and birthrates the essay is 

able to show how there was an explosion in the fertility rates of settlers that slowly 

normalized during the 19th Century.  I felt the paper was extremely well grounded in 

facts, as its numerous tables were extremely useful and helped back up the arguments 

made in the writing.  The paper does an excellent job of remaining concise as it takes just 

three Norwegian communities in the Midwest and carefully analyzes the data collected 

from those groups.  The conclusion does a nice job convincing the reader that it is logical 

to extrapolate these results to the majority of the settlements in the Midwest during the 

19th Century.   

 

Japan in War and Peace 

 

 

This essay was extremely interesting.  Currently I am also enrolled in John 

Dower’s class, History of World War II in Asia: Film, Fantasy, Fact, and just heard his 

lecture on the undercurrents of racism felt toward the Japanese during World War II and 

found it fascinating.  What I feel is so interesting about the subject is that it has been 

forgotten or overlooked.  Today Americans tend to remember the Nazis with contempt or 

at least as being evil, but the hatred toward the Japanese is overlooked.  I think that a 

couple of graphics could have really improved the article.  Prof. Dower showed the class 

several such graphics and they are extremely powerful and really enhance the point of the 

article, especially when showing Hitler, Mussolini, and ‘the Jap’.  I found the final part of 

the article extremely interesting as well.  I was really interested in his explanation of why 

we seemed to forget our hatred of Japan during the postwar period.  His line that we just 

transferred our hate from the Japanese to the communists was an extremely interesting 

conclusion.
