***** Course Highlights *****
This course features examples of student_work and videos from two class
sessions: one featuring a discussion of "The Middle Ages as Fantasy," and
another on "The MIT Mix - or How Does a History Department Work?" This course
also features archived_syllabi_from_various_semesters.
***** Course Description *****
This course is designed to acquaint students with a variety of approaches to
the past used by historians writing in the twentieth century. The books we read
have all made significant contributions to their respective sub-fields and have
been selected to give as wide a coverage in both field and methodology as
possible in one semester's worth of reading. We examine how historians conceive
of their object of study, how they use primary sources as a basis for their
accounts, how they structure the narrative and analytic discussion of their
topic, and what are the advantages and drawbacks of their various approaches.
