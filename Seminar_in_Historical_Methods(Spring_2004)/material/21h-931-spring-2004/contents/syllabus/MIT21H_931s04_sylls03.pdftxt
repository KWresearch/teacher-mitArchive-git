SEMINAR IN HISTORICAL METHODS 

Instructor: Jeff Ravel 
T 2-4 PM 

 

 
Subject Description. This subject is designed to give 21H majors and minors an 
 
introduction to the methods that historians use to interpret the past.  We will focus on two areas: 
archives and interpretation.  In our work on archives, we will ask what constitutes an archive.  
We will visit one or two local archives, speak with archivists, and assemble our own archive 
related to life at MIT in 2003.  Once we have a better understanding of the possibilities and 
limitations of historical archives, we will turn to the task of interpreting archival findings.  We 
will discuss a series of readings organized around the theme of history and national identity in 
various parts of the world since the end of the eighteenth century.  Students will also be asked to 
write a 15-page research paper, and present their work orally to the class. 
 
 
Subject Requirements. Active class participation is central to our work together. 
Attendance is mandatory, and students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to 
discuss common readings.  A student who misses two or more class sessions will automatically 
fail the subject.  Students will write a five-page paper, due in its final version on 4/8, and a 
fifteen-page research paper due on 5/15, the final day of classes.  Students will make two oral 
presentations in class, on 2/25 and 5/13.  Before some class sessions, students will submit 
electronic responses to questions regarding the week’s readings; these questions will be 
distributed in advance.  There will be no exams and no final.  Each assignment will be weighted 
as follows in the calculation of the final grade, although these calculations will also take into 
account improved performance during the course of the semester:

Statement on Cheating and Plagiarism:   The web now hosts many sites which offer college-
level papers of varying quality on a variety of topics.  I am well acquainted with these sites, and 
with others that offer detection services to professors.  Buying a paper and submitting it as 
your own work is cheating. Copying sections from someone else’s print or online work into
