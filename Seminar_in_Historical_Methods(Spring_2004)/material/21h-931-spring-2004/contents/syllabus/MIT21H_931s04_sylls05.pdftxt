SEMINAR IN HISTORICAL METHODS 

This course is designed to engage students with the wide variety of recent approaches used to 
study the past.  The books and essays we will read have all made significant contributions to the 
field of history as a whole, and will cover as wide a methodological, geographical, and 
chronological field as possible in the span of a mere semester.  In our discussions over the next 
few months, we will explore how historians conceive of their object of study, how they use 
primary sources as a basis for their accounts, and how they structure the narrative and analytic 
discussion of their topic.  We will also discuss and debate the advantages and drawbacks of each 
of these various approaches, and ultimately, the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments. 

Readings 

The following books are available at the MIT Bookstore and on reserve in the Hayden Library: 

Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre(1983)

Requirements 
The main written assignment for this course is a substantial research paper, on any reasonable 
subject of interest to you.  These papers should be between 15-20 pages long, and should explore 
the given topic in substantial depth.  (History majors might use this paper to explore a possible 
thesis topic.)  The paper will be crafted in the following stages: 

February 23 
March 16 
April 20 
May  11 
May  12 

Statement of topic interest and research proposal 
Annotated Bibliography 
Draft 
Class presentation 
Final Paper Due 

You will also be expected to bring to class each week a brief (and informal) commentary of a page 
or so on the assigned reading.  (Also bring your copy of the reading with you to class so that you 
can participate fully.)  Each week one or more students will use their commentary as the basis for 
introducing the class discussion;  these student also think of several additional questions to 
circulate to the class via email the night before the discussion. 

Class participation is an essential component of this course, and therefore will comprise a 
significant portion of the final course grade.
