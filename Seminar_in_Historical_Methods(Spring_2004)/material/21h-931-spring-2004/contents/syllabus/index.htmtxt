***** Subject Description *****
This course is designed to acquaint you with a variety of approaches to the
past used by historians writing in the twentieth century. The books we will
read have all made significant contributions to their respective sub-fields and
have been selected to give as wide a coverage in both field and methodology as
possible in one semester's worth of reading. We will examine how historians
conceive of their object of study, how they use primary sources as a basis for
their accounts, how they structure the narrative and analytic discussion of
their topic, and what are the advantages and drawbacks of their various
approaches.
***** Assignments and Grading *****
The main written assignment for this course is a substantial research paper, on
any reasonable subject of interest to you.Â These papers should be between 15-
20 pages long, and should explore the given topic in substantial
depth.Â History majors may use this paper to explore a possible thesis
topic.Â The paper will be produced in the following stages:
