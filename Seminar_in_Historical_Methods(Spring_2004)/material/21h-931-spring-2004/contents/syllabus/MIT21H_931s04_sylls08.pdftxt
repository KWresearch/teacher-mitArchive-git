SEMINAR IN HISTORICAL METHODS   

This course is designed to engage students with the wide variety of recent approaches used to study 
the past.    The books and essays we will read have all made significant contributions to the field of 
history as a whole, and will cover as wide a methodological, geographical, and chronological field 
as possible in the span of a mere semester. In our discussions over the next few months, we will 
explore how historians conceive of their object of study, how they use primary sources as a basis 
for their accounts, and how they structure the narrative and analytic discussion of their topic. We 
will also discuss and debate the advantages and drawbacks of each of these various approaches, 
and ultimately, the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments.   

Readings   

The following books are available at the MIT Bookstore and on reserve in the Hayden Library: 

Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre (1983) 
Laurel Thatcher-Ulrich, A Midwife's Tale (1991) 
Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (1995 ed., orig. 1977) 
Richard White, The Organic Machine (Hill and Wang, 1996) 

All articles and book sections will be circulated via the course website. 

Requirements 
This is a research seminar: for half of the semester, we will discuss books that we have all read in 
common; for the other half, you will work on a paper of original research. 

The main written assignment for this course is a substantial research paper, on any reasonable 
subject of interest to you.    These papers should be around 15 pages long, and should explore the 
given topic in substantial depth.    (History majors might use this paper to explore a possible thesis 
topic.) The paper will be crafted in the following stages:   

February 20

Final Paper Due   

Class participation is an essential component of this course, and therefore will comprise a significant 
portion of the final course grade. Make sure to bring your copy of the reading with you to class so 
that you can participate fully. Each week, I will circulate some questions to think about before the 
discussion. Read through them, and think about them thoroughly before our discussion.    Also, you 
will be expected to bring to class each week a brief summary—no more than 50 words—of the 
essential aspects of the assigned reading. (I will go into more detail about this summary when I 
circulate the first week's questions.)   

Research paper 50%   

Seminar participation (including summaries) 50%   

Please note: plagiarism of any kind—that is taking another's words or ideas from a book, another 
student, or from the internet without full and complete citation—will not be tolerated regardless of 
the circumstances, and will result in an "F" for the assignment.
