SEMINAR IN HISTORICAL METHODS 

This course is designed to engage students with the wide variety of recent approaches used to 
study the past.  The books and essays we will read have all made significant contributions to the 
field of history as a whole, and will cover as wide a methodological, geographical, and 
chronological field as possible in the span of a mere semester.  In our discussions over the next 
few months, we will explore how historians conceive of their object of study, how they use 
primary sources as a basis for their accounts, and how they structure the narrative and analytic 
discussion of their topic.  We will also discuss and debate the advantages and drawbacks of each 
of these various approaches, and ultimately, the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments. 

Readings 

The following books are available at the MIT Bookstore and on reserve in the Hayden Library: 

Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre(1983) 
 
Laurel Thatcher-Ulrich, A Midwife's Tale(1991)
 
Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs, and Steel (1999)
 
John Dower, War Without Mercy(1986)
 
Timothy Burke  Lifebouy Men, Lux Women (1996) 
 
Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish (1995 ed., orig. 1977)
 

Requirements
 
This is a research seminar:  for half of the semester, we will discuss books that we have all read in
 
common;  for the other half, you will work on a paper of original research .
 

The main written assignment for this course is a substantial research paper, on any reasonable 
subject of interest to you.  These papers should be around 15 pages long, and should explore the 
given topic in substantial depth.  (History majors might use this paper to explore a possible 
thesis topic.)  The paper will be crafted in the following stages: 

February 21 
March 7 
April 4 
April 25 
May  2 
May 9 or 16 
May  16 

Statement of topic interest and research proposal

One Best Source Presentation 
Introduction and Outline 
Rough Drafts

Final Paper Due 

Class participation is an essential component of this course, and therefore will comprise a 
significant portion of the final course grade.  Make sure to bring your copy of the reading with 
you  to class so  that you can participate fully. 
Each week, I will circulate some questions to think about before the discussion.  Read through 
them, and think about them thoroughly before our discussion.  Also, you will be expected to 
bring to class each week a brief summary—no more than 50 words—of the essential aspects of 
the assigned reading.  (I will go into more detail about this summary when I circulate the first 
week's questions.)

Please note:  plagiarism of any kind—that is taking another's words or ideas from a book, 
another student, or from the internet without full and complete citation—will not be tolerated 
regardless of the circumstances, and will result in an "F" for the assignment.
