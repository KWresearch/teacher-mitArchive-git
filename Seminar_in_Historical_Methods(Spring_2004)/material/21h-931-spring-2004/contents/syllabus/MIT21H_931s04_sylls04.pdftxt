SEMINAR IN HISTORICAL METHODS 
21H.931 

 
 
 
 
Spring 2004 
 
 
 
Subject Description 
 
This course is designed to acquaint you with a variety of approaches to the past used by 
historians writing in the twentieth century.  The books we will read have all made significant 
contributions to their respective sub-fields and have been selected to give as wide a coverage in 
both field and methodology as possible in one semester’s worth of reading.  We will examine 
how historians conceive of their object of study, how they use primary sources as a basis for 
their accounts, how they structure the narrative and analytic discussion of their topic, and what 
are the advantages and drawbacks of their various approaches. 
 
Readings 
 
The following books are available at the MIT Bookstore and on reserve in the Hayden Library.   
 
Caroline Bynum, Holy Feast, Holy Fast 
Natalie Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre
