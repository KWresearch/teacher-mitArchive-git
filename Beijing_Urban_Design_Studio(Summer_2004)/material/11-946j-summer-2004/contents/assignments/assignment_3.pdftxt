Exercise #3 
"Section of Form" 
 
Each team now has an overall plan/design for the area. It will be adjusted with new information 
from last Friday’s review as well as future work and your new thoughts. 
This exercise is to develop a section of the plan in as much architectural detail as possible in order 
to illustrate how to design next to the light rail. The six sections can act as examples for not 
only our site but other similar conditions. 
Part 1 
Chose a section/slice through the light rail area that you think is important to explore in more 
detail. The section need not be wide but should represent an idea of the section. On Monday 
we will discuss areas for each team that might be useful. After selecting a section explore in 
more detail the following: 
1.  Architectural form of the section 
2.  Uses / program of area 
3.  Relationship to light rail line 
4.  Relationship to surrounding area 
5.  Texture of buildings and space 
6.  Circulation of all types 
Work at the following scales: 
1.  Plan at 1:500 (as many as needed to explain idea) 
2.  Sections at 1:200 
3.  Details as needed 
4.  Computer model/physical model or sketches to explain idea 
Part 2 
A revised sketch plan at 1:1000 to suggest changes (this can be a rough sketch over the 
last plan) 
 
A presentation of the form, idea and design of your section / form. 
 
Due on Friday at 2:00 PM for discussion. This is the last discussion before next week 
which will be for presentation of the team’s work.
