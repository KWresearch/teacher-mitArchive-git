Beijing Urban Design Workshop 
Tsinghua University-Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
 
Final Assignment
Presentation - Putting it all Together
 
 
Overview 
 
This it the last assignment and an opportunity to put into final form your ideas and designs 
to communicate to a larger audience.  All work on the project will be finished by Day 18, 
when there will be a final presentation and review at 10:00 am.  All  
people who have been involved in the studio will be invited, including faculty and students, 
officials of the Beijing Planning Institute, and hopefully press and TV. 
 
Your work will be presented in four boards of final drawings and text. The panels will be in 
A1 vertical size that can be reduced for A4 size for a magazine article.  The drawings on the 
boards should also be organized into a Powerpoint presentation to present your work 
succinctly on Friday.  These, then, are the final products of the workshop. 
 
The boards should include at least the following but can be added to, in order to clearly 
present the idea of your work. 
 
Products 
 
1.   Project name; group member names; and a brief statement of the idea behind your 
proposal. 
 
2.   Images from the site to support your concept (chose two or three that relate to your 
design). 
 
3.   Concept diagrams of the area-wide context in relationship to your design showing such 
issues as uses, transportation or open space. 
 
4.   Overall Illustrative Site Plan to clearly illustrate the form of your proposal and act as a 
key drawing for other sketches, sections, diagrams and other material.  This drawing 
should be on one board and placed vertically from top to bottom, as large as possible.   

 
5.   Land use, Transportation, and Public space framework plans. (These smaller scale 
plans are derived from the Illustrative Site Plan, colored to indicate topics.) 

 
6.  Focus area: detailed plans, digital models, or model photos.  This is equal in importance 
to the Illustrative plan. 
 
7.   Sections through site at the focus area and other key locations to show general 
relationships to the light rail line and adjacent city fabric. 
 
8.  Sketches, axons, digital model drawings, photo montages or other three dimensional 
representations to show features of your concept.

Presentation 
 
The four panels along with models will be exhibited in the lobby of the architecture building 
on Friday morning at 10:00AM.  Each team will have 10 minutes to present their 
design with a power point presentation. After the presentations there will be time to discuss 
your proposal with individual guests.   
 
The exhibition panels should be able to be reduced to A4 size for the magazine and still be 
legible.  See examples to be distributed for the size. The major text should be in Chinese 
without English translation (this could be added later for English speakers).  All panels will 
use the three column magazine format.  Your project/team name should appear at the top 
of the first (left) panel, with team member names underneath, followed by summary text 
describing your project.  Drawings and pictures may be in increments of 1/2 columns in 
width (ie: ½, 1, 1½ , 2, 3), any length; caption them.  The sequence and layout is up to you, 
however your large vertical illustrative site plan should appear on the second panel and 
include key numbers or text to locate other illustrations in the presentation.   
 
It is important that all work be completely finished so that on Friday the workshop is 
completely done, the work ready to be published.   
 
Good luck!
