This intensive five week studio in Beijing, China meets every day while it is
in session.Â The final publication of the studio, and the work of the
assignments leading up to it,Â are presented in the projectsÂ section.
***** Course Description *****
The Beijing Urban Design Studio is a joint program between the MIT and Tsinghua
University Schools of Architecture and Planning.Â The goal of the studio is to
foster international cooperation through the undertaking of a joint urban
design and planning initiative in the city of Beijing involving important,
often controversial, sites and projects.Â Since 1995, almost 250 MIT and
Tsinghua University students and faculty have participated in this annual
studio, making it one of the most successful and enduring international
academic programs between China and the US.Â It has received the Irwin Sizer
Award from MIT for outstanding innovation in education. The studio takes place
over five weeks in June and July including several weeks in residence at
Tsinghua University and two brief study tours to locations and projects that
inform the work.Â It will include 18-20 MIT and 10-15 Tsinghua Architecture and
Planning students. The Beijing City Planning Institute, responsible for
strategic planning in the city, participates in the studio as the client.
