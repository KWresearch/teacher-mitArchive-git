FUTURE

During 1958-1979 the development 
of this area remained relatively the
stable.

On one side of the railroad was 
agriculture, market, and universities. 
The other side was for industrial
and was a freight unloading yard with
some residential.

With the new open economic policy
of 1979 Beijing started to develop 
and the city began to relocate many
citizens living in the city center. 
Some of these residents
were moved onto our site.

FUTURE

Starting in 1988 citizens were able to 
lease land. This new policy caused an 
increase in development in Beijing that
caused the relocation of many from the
city center. New housing was 
developed on our site to house these 
residents.

During the second wave of land 
reform starting in 1992 the government
started demolishing the area around
the universities for new development.
