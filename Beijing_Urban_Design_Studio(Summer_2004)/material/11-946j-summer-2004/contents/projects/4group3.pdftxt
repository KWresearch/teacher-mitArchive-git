Whereas design process often develops as a fierce criticism of an existing condition, the 
thesis for this project grows out of the fascination by the incredible richness and mix of 
conditions already present on the site.
The melon vendor, the business man, the high end resident of Leisure Garden complex, 
students, peasants, all coexist on the site and utilize the space under and next to the light rail 
tracks. These wildly different people all find ways to appropriate the space around the 
elevated railway. 
Our aim in this project is twofold. Firstly, we aspire to capture as many of the activities that are 
already present on the site as possible and to build upon them. Secondly, we attempt to 
bridge the existing gap between the low income east and the higher income west sides of the 
tracks by designing a campus of activities and spaces which invite the two to mix.
The central notion that guides our design is to preserve – whether physically or experientially 
– what is there, and then carefully intervene to achieve the desired dynamic quality of space.
The set of interventions is drawn into the urban texture by attraction points that anchor the site 
to its context. Rather than being a negative space of what has been built, these created 
attraction nodes will connect the structure to the urban fabric. The focus of our intervention is 
the new library, situated halfway between Wudaokou and Zhichunlu stations, which is to serve 
both students from the surrounding universities and residents of the site as well as the 
broader surrounding area. 

Entertainment Complex builds on the existing entertainment opportunities in this area and 
begins to create a district for nightlife. The strategic location near Wudaokou Station  makes 
the complex easily accessible to visitors as well as students living nearby.
New Laboratory Space is located in an area that was historically used for laboratory purposes. 
Adjacent to Tsinghua University and the growing High Technology cluster in Haidian, this 
flexible space can be used by students, professionals or start-up biotech companies.
Smaller scale attempts to fit in with the low-rise character of this area: mixed income housing 
development ensures that both high tech workers as well as the lower income residents who 
provide services for them will be accommodated.
A mix of institutional and retail uses at a key intersection of our site attempts to bridge the 
east and west sides of the light rail and bring together the students from the surrounding 
universities, high tech workers and area residents of all income classes.
We place a new library under the light rail with extensions to the east and west, and create 
auxiliary uses in association with this such as book markets and stores, cafes, and publishing 
houses.  
We also include a large plaza, spaces for vendors, artist lofts and exhibition space in order to 
encourage the creation of a dynamic public space.  A new mall development directly to the 
east could serve as a larger retail anchor for other small shops and markets. 

The new library provides a venue for the 384,169 area university students and faculty as well 
as region residents and employees to study, relax, conference and intermingle. It is a 
permeable building which connects the east and west sides of the rail line, allows for 
pedestrian circulation to percolate around and through at the ground level and create 
internally a multiplicity of spatial experiences without rigid separations. We encourage 
maximum accessibility by maintaining an open stack system and minimizing inaccessible 
space by concentrating it in three cores. We reuse existing buildings where possible and tie 
the new building into existing forms and uses.
The Library would be realized as a municipal/public library, funded and otherwise supported 
through collaboration among the sixteen universities in the area. Some revenue would be 
generated through renting of cafes, conference rooms, and auditoria.
