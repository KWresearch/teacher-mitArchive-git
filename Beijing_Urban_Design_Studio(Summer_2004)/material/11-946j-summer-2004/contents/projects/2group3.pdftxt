Project Specifics

Entertainment Complex

•Builds on the existing 
entertainment opportunities in 
this area and begins to create a 
district for nightlife

•Strategic location near 
Wudaokou Station  makes the 
complex easily accessible to 
visitors as well as students 
living nearby

Exhibition Space

•Provides a space for 
universities or lab users to 
display current work

• Creates a landmark to draw 
people from universities and 
apartment complexes to the 
north down the corridor and 
across the highway overpass

New Laboratory Space

• Located in an area 
that was historically 
used for laboratory 
purposes

• Conveniently adjacent 
to Tsinghua University 
and the growing High 
Technology cluster in 
Haidian

•Flexible space can be 
used by students, 
professionals or start-
up biotech companies

Housing

•Smaller scale attempts to fit in 
with the low-rise character of this 
area

•Mixed income housing 
development ensures that both 
high tech workers as well as the 
lower income residents who 
provide services for them will be 
accommodated

High Tech Office Complex

•Develops mixed-use building clusters to allow 
for a mix of office, hotel and residential uses
-will ensure a lively, 24 hour a day district
-synergies between uses will be created 
-buildings will be easier to reuse

• Hugs the elevated structure and creates public 
sky gardens
-provides an exciting experience for light rail users 
and visitors to the elevated open spaces
-creates a gateway to the Haidian district and a 
landmark for the city

•Allows for connections between buildings and  
directly from the light rail station
-serves as an amenity and status symbol for high tech 
companies and hotels
-will help stem the flow of automobile traffic to the 
area

Market/Library Triangle
• A mix of institutional and retail uses at a key 
intersection of our site attempts to bridge the east 
and west sides of the light rail and bring together 
the students from the surrounding universities, 
high tech workers and area residents of all income 
classes

• We locate a new library under the light rail with 
extensions to the east and west, and imagine 
creating many auxiliary uses in association with 
this such as book markets and stores, cafes, and 
publishing houses.  

• We also include around a large plaza, spaces for 
vendors, artist lofts and exhibition space in order 
to encourage the creation of a dynamic and 
interesting public space.  

•A new mall development directly to the east could 
serve as a larger retail anchor for other small 
shops and markets.
