1. Provide a venue for the 384,169 area university students and faculty as well as 
region residents and employees to study, relax, conference and intermingle

2.  Create a permeable building (network of buildings?)
- connect the east and west sides of the rail line 
- allow for pedestrian circulation to percolate around and through at the ground level
- create internally a multiplicity of spatial experiences without rigid separations

3.  Provide a presence at the ground level that interacts with open space
- encourage meandering paths that enable pedestrians to actively interact with interstitial spaces

4.  Encourage maximum accessibility 
- create an environment that is open and inviting to the public yet still secure
- maintain an open stack system
- minimize inaccessible space by concentrating it in a core nucleus

5.  Fit carefully into the existing fabric
- reuse buildings where possible
- tie building into existing forms and uses

...although 
perceived by 
the visitor as 
a single entity, 
the Royal 
Academy 
consists of 
two 
buildings…
linked by a 
central grand 
staircase.

“… able to achieve 
functions by carefully 
removing some 
elements, restor[ing] 
others, and 
interspers[ing] new 
ones while setting up 
a dialogue between 
old and new…”
