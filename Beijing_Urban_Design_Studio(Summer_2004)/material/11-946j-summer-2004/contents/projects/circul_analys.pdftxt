FINDINGS 

CIRCULATION

 Five types of roads 
Rring road, arterial, secondary, destination, informal 

 Many modes of travel 
Regional rail, elevated rail, bus, taxi, private automobile, 2 and 3 wheels motorized, bicycles and jitneys, pedestrians, horse-drawn carts, and more 

 Connections between roads inconsistent 
This makes circulation difficult for all modes of travel, but affects bicyclists and pedestrians most severely 

 Cars becoming increasingly important in Chinese society 
Signs include increasing car ownership rates (11% in Beijing, 7% overall for China), strong presence on television news coverage, expansion of parking space (at the expense of open 
space, sidewalk and bike lanes), and traffic congestion, Private automobile infrastructure, including dealerships, mechanics and service stations, are a significant land use in study area. 

 Informal paths 
Connections are improvised where no formal road exists along the rail corridor to compensate for a lack of continuous passage. 
 Goods and Materials 
Circulate along the same routes as people, along each type of road, on trains, trucks, cars, scooters, bicycles and backs. 

 Railroad and elevated light rail both present barriers to circulation 
The light rail is actually elevated along only 1/3 of the study area, and can be safely crossed only infrequently: from above at two  stations, and from below at underpasses of major roads. 

 Regional transportation networks hinder local circulation 
The scale of planned highway expansions will present even greater barriers.

DESIGN CRITERIA 

CIRCULATION

 Be willing to embrace change 

Make connections 
Establish connections between different circulation types to facilitate circulation throughout the hierarchy. Connections are needed both along and across the corridor. 

 Embrace the multi-modal nature of transportation 
Accommodate all existing modes: trains, buses, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians. 

 Accommodate parking for bicycles and cars 
Provide bicycle parking at key nodes and transit stations. Accommodate car parking underground and behind buildings to preserve the streetscape for bicyclists and 
pedestrrians 

 Balance regional and local circulation needs 
Minimize adverse impacts of regional routes on local fabric. 

 New transportation infrastructure should be sensitive to local conditions 
Accommodate plans for the new subway and highway routes.
