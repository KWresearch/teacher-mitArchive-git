CLOSE-UPS: Work Space Typologies


Employment


Employment Activities 


high-tech employees


research and development (students and researchers)


service industries (banks, hotel, etc.)


small-retail business operators and employees


vendors


lower-end service activities (parking attendants, barbers, etc.)


Informal activities  (trash collection, etc.)


Commuting Patterns


some of the blue-collar workers live nearby (probably travel mostly by bicycle or 
walking) 

unclear where other workers are coming from (probably more car travel, long 
commutes typical) 

Office and Work Places


Typical Office 


for-rent commercial office space 

towers shared by multiple tenants 

under construction – will influence the character of the zone in the future 

Institutional Facilities 


independent and owner-occupied institutional facilities


characterized by campus-like urban form (surrounded by walls!)


long-standing institutions – unlikely to change in the near future


Speculative Office Construction  


high-tech development 

new construction 

Retail Typologies

East-West Connections 

Recommendations


1)  Reinforce the existing retail corridor under the electricity lines.

improve infrastructure 

provide spaces for vendors 

facilitate east-west access 

2)  Coordinate new high-tech development on west AND sustain residential 
and academic communities on east 

3)	 The node at the 4th  Ring Road should be improved and enhanced both 
as the center of the commercial area and as a node along an important 
east-west connection. 

Option 1 


One approach to the less utilized spaces along the rail tracks and 
the electric lines would be to extend the existing informal retail in 
the vicinity, creating a market area and space for itinerant vendors. 
This retail activity would strengthen East-West connections 
particularly along the 4th Ring Road, attracting both office workers 
who are situated mostly West of the tracks and the students and 
blue-collar workers and residents who are scattered throughout the 
neighborhood.  By designating this corridor for retail, we hope to 
preserve some of the existing types of small business from 
encroaching development. 

Option 2 


A second approach reverses the convention of using “leftover” 
spaces for leftover uses, by creating beneath the existing 
elevated rail a high-tech corridor that is porous, allowing 
people to pass beneath and through it at certain points.  As a 
counterpoint to the random proliferation of office towers now 
being developed throughout the site, this creation of a spine 
would allow other areas in the East and West to be preserved 
from office development.  Existing market and retail areas that 
are now threatened by rapid, unrestricted development could 
be preserved by clearly structuring office zones.
