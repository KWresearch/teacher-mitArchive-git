***** Course Description *****
In this class, you will read, think about, and (I hope) enjoy important
examples of what has become one of the most popular literary genres today, if
not the most popular: the novel. Some of the questions we will consider are:
Why did so many novels appear in the eighteenth century? Why were theyâand
are theyâcalled novels? Who wrote them? Who read them? Who narrates them?
What are they likely to be about? Do they have distinctive characteristics?
What is their relationship to the time and place in which they appeared? How
have they changed over the years? And, most of all, why do we like to read them
so much?

***** MIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism *****
Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available at the Writing_and_Communication_Center and the MIT_Web
site_on_Plagiarism.
