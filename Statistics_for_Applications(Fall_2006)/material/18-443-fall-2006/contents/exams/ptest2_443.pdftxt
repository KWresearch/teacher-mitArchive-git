18.443.  Practice  test  2. 

(1) Given a sample 5, 1, 4, 1, 2, 3 from Poisson distribution �(�), construct 
the most  powerful  test  for 

H0  : � = 1  vs.  H1  : � = 2, 

with  level  of  signiﬁcance  � = 0.05.  Test H0 . 
(2)  p.  561,  no.  1. 
(3)  p.  574,  no.  4. 
(4) Suppose that in the multiple  linear regression model Y  = X � + λ with 
20  observations,  we  have 

αˆ 2  = 1.5, �ˆ = (1, 2, 1)T ,  (X T X )−1  =

(6)  In  two-way  analysis  of  variance,  how  can  we  estimate  the  parameters 
µij  and  test  the  hypothesis 

H0  :  all  µij  are  equal? 

(7) In two-way analysis of variance, write parameters µ, �i , �j , βij  in terms 
of  parameters  µij .
