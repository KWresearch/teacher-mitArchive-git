Consider  the  family  of  distributions  with  p.d.f. 
1 , 

f (x|�) = �x�−

for  0 < x < 1,  and  � > 0. 

(1) 

Consider  an  i.i.d.  sample  X1 , . . . , Xn  from  this  distribution.  As  always,  the 
underlying  parameter  �  for  this  sample  is  unknown.  In  problems  (1)  and  (2) 
the  distribution  is  given  by  equation  (1)  above. 
(1)  Find  the MLE  �ˆ of  � . 
(2)  Compute  Fisher  information  I (�)  and  state  asymptotic  normality  of 
MLE  �ˆ.  If  n = 100,  ﬁnd  c  such  that 
Pr(−c � �ˆ − � � c) � 0.95.

(4) Suppose  that a  sample X1 , . . . , X15  � N (µx , αx
2 ), where  µx  and αx 
unknown,  has  sample  mean  and  sample  variance 
2  = X¯2  − X¯ 2  = 0.55. 
µˆx  = X¯ = 2.4, αˆx 
Find  95%  conﬁdence  intervals  for  µ  and  α 2 . 
(5) In addition to the  sample  from problem (4) suppose  that we are given 
a  sample  Y1 , . . . , Y10  � N (µy , αx
2 )  from  a  distribution  with  the  same  variance 
2  = αy 
2  ,  but  possibly  diﬀerent  mean  µy .  Suppose  that 
as  X s,  i.e.  αx 
2  = Y ¯2  − Y¯ 2  = 0.37. 
µˆy  = Y¯ = 2.8, αˆy 
Find  a  90%  conﬁdence  interval  for  µx  − µy . 
(6) For samples  in problems (4) and (5), perform the t-test of the hypoth­
esis  that µx  � µy  under  the  assumption  of equal  variances.  Test whether  the 
variances  are  equal  using  the  F-test.  In  both  tests,  ﬁnd  a  p-value  and  use 
level  of  signiﬁcance  � = 0.05. 
(7)  If  X1 , . . . , X5  are  i.i.d.  exponential  E (�),  what  is  the  distribution  of 
X1  + . . . + X5 .  If X  � �(�, � )  what  is  the  distribution  of  cX  where  c > 0  is 
a  constant.
