Testing  hypotheses  about  parameters

of  normal  distribution.

T-tests  and  F-tests.


We  will  postpone  a  more  systematic  approach  to  hypotheses  testing  until  the  following 
lectures  and  in  this  lecture  we  will  describe  in  an  ad  hoc  way  T-tests  and  F-tests  about  the 
parameters  of normal distribution,  since  they are based  on a very  similar  ideas  to conﬁdence 
intervals  for  parameters  of  normal  distribution  - the  topic  we  have  just  covered. 
Suppose  that we  are given  an  i.i.d.  sample  from normal distribution N (µ, ν 2 ) with  some 
unknown  parameters  µ  and  ν 2 . We  will  need  to  decide  between  two  hypotheses  about  these 
unknown  parameters  - nul l  hypothesis H0  and alternative  hypothesis H1 . Hypotheses H0  and 
H1  will  be  one  of  the  following: 

H0  : µ = µ0 , H1  : µ = µ0 ,
H0  : µ ∼ µ0 , H1  : µ < µ0 , 
H0  : µ ≈ µ0 , H1  : µ > µ0 , 
where µ0  is a given  ’hypothesized’ parameter. We will also consider  similar hypotheses about 
parameter  ν 2 . We  want  to  construct  a  decision  rule 
α  : X n  � {H0 , H1} 
n  either  accepts  H0  or  rejects  H0  (accepts  H1 ).
that  given  an  i.i.d.  sample  (X1 , . . . , Xn
) ≥ X 
Null  hypothesis  is  usually  a  ’main’  hypothesis  in  a  sense  that  it  is  expected  or  presumed  to 
be  true and we need  a  lot  of evidence  to  the  contrary  to  reject  it. To quantify  this, we  pick  a 
parameter  � ≥  [0, 1],  called  level  of  signiﬁcance, and make  sure  that  a decision  rule  α  rejects 
H0  when  it  is  actually  true  with  probability  ≈ �,  i.e. 
P(α = H1 |H0 ) ≈ �. 
The  probability  on  the  left  hand  side  is  understood  as  a  worse  case  scenario  given  that  the 
null  hypothesis  is  true,  i.e. 
P (α = H1 H0 ) =

Level  of  signiﬁcance  �  is  usually  small,  for  example,  � = 0.05. 
Example.  Let  us  consider  a  Matlab  example  about  normal  body  temperature  from 
the  lecture  about  conﬁdence  intervals.  If  a  vector  ’normtemp’  represents  body  temperature 
measurements  of  130  people  then  typing  the  following  command  in Matlab 

[H,P,CI,STATS]  =  ttest(normtemp,98.6,0.05,’both’) 

produces  the  following  output: 

H  =  1,  P  =  2.4106e-007,  CI  =  [98.1220,  98.3765] 
STATS  =  tstat:  -5.4548,  df:  129,  sd:  0.7332. 

Here  µ0  =  98.6, � = 0.05,  ’both’  means  that  we  consider  a  null  hypothesis  µ = µ0  in  which 
case  the  alternative  µ = µ0  is  a  two-sided hypothesis.  The  alternative  µ > µ0  corresponds  to 
parameter  ’right’,  and  µ < µ0  corresponds  to  parameter  ’left’.  H  =  1  means  that  we  reject 
null  hypothesis  and  accept H1 ,  P=2.4106e-007  is  a  p-value  that  we  will  discuss  below,  CI  is 
a  95%  conﬁdence  interval  for  µ0  that  we  constructed  in  the  previous  lecture.  If  we  want  to 
test  the  hypothesis  µ ∼ 98.6  then  typing 
[H,P,CI,STATS]  =  ttest(normtemp(1:130,1),98.6,0.05,’left’) 

outputs 

H  =  1,  P  =  1.2053e-007,  CI  =  [-Inf,  98.3558], 
STATS  =  tstat:  -5.4548,  df:  129,  sd:  0.7332. 

Notice  that CI  and P  are  diﬀerent  in  this  case.  The  fact  that  (in  both  cases)  we  rejected H0 
means  that  there  is  a  signiﬁcant  evidence  against  it.  In  fact, we will  see below  that a p-value 
quantiﬁes  in  some  sense  how  unlikely  it  is  to  observe  this  dataset  assuming  that  the  null 
hypothesis  is  true.  p-value  of  order  10−7  is  a  strong  evidence  against  the  hypothesis  that  a 
normal  body  temperature  is  µ0  = 98.6.

Let  us  explain  how  these  tests  are  constructed.  They  are  based  on  the  result  that  we

T  = ≤n − 1

This  statistic  behaves  diﬀerently  depending  on  whether  the  ’true’  unknown  mean  µ  =  µ0 , 
µ < µ0  or  µ > µ0 .  First  of  all,  if  µ = µ0  then  T  � tn−1 .  If  µ < µ0  then  we  can  rewrite

since the ﬁrst term has proper distribution tn−1  and the second term goes to inﬁnity. Similarly, 
when µ > µ0  then T  � + . Therefore, we  can make  a decision  about our hypotheses  based 
→
on  this  information  about  the  behavior  of  T . 
I.  (H0  : µ = µ0 .)  In  this  case,  the  indication  that H0  is not  true would be  if  T  becomes

too  large,  i.e.  T  � ±→.  Therefore,  we  consider  a  decision  rule

The  choice  of  the  threshold  c  depends  on  the  level  of  signiﬁcance  �. We  would  like  to  have 

P(α = H1 |H0 ) = P(|T | > c|H0 ) ≈ �. 
But  given  that  µ  =  µ0 ,  we  know  that  T  �  tn−1  and,  therefore,  we  can  choose  c  from  a 
condition 
P(|T | > c|H0 ) = tn−1 (|T | > c) = 2tn−1 ((c, →)) = � 
using  the  table  of  tn−1 -distribution.  Notice  that  this  decision  rule  is  equivalent  to  ﬁnding 
the  (1 − �)-conﬁdence  interval  for  unknown  parameter  µ  and  making  a  decision  based  on 
whether  µ0  falls  into  this  interval. 

II.  (H0  : µ ∼ µ0 .)  In  this  case,  the  indication  that H0  is  not  true,  i.e.  µ < µ0 ,  would  be 
if  T  � −→.  Therefore,  we  consider  a  decision  rule

The  choice  of  the  threshold  c  depends  on  the  condition

p-value. Figure  7.1  illustrates  the  deﬁnition  of  p-value  for all  three  cases  above.  p-value 
can  be  understood  as  a  probability,  given  that  the  null  hypothesis  H0  is  true,  to  observe  a 
value  of  T -statistic  equally  or  less  likely  than  the  one  that  was  observed.  Thus,  the  small 
p-value means  that  the  observed  T -statistic  is  very  unlikely  under  the  null  hypothesis  which 
provides  a  strong  evidence  against  H0 .  The  conﬁdence  level  �  deﬁnes  what  we  consider  as 
’unlikely  enough’  to  reject  the  null  hypothesis.

Comparing means of two normal samples. In the normal body temperature dataset

would  like  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  normal  body  temperature  of  men  and  women  is  the 
same.  There  are  several  way  to  do  this. 
Paired  t-test.  First,  we  can  perform  the  so  called  paired  t-test.  Since  the  number  of 
observations  is  the  same  in  both  groups,  we  can  pair  them  together  and  assume  that  their 
diﬀerences  Zi  =  Xi  −  Yi  will  also  be  normal.  This  sounds  like  a  reasonable  assumption 
since Xi  and Yi  should be  independent  if  the measurements  were  taken  independently.  Since 
µz  =  µx  − µy ,  hypothesis  µx  =  µy  is  equivalent  to  µz  =  0  which  means  that  we  can  do  the 
usual  t-test  for  one  sample  Z1 , . . . , Zn .  Running 

[H,P,CI,STATS]=ttest(men,women,0.05,’both’) 

outputs 

H  =  1,  P  =  3.9773e-019,  CI  =  [-0.3348,-0.2437] 
STATS  =  tstat:  -12.6858,  df:  64,  sd:  0.1838. 

We  reject  null  hypothesis  that  the  means  are  equal  and,  in  fact,  p-value  of  order  10−19  is  a 
strong  evidence  against  it.  However,  it  seems  rather  suspicious  that  there  is  such  a  strong 
evidence  against H0 , especially  after we perform a two  sample  t-test below which  also rejects 
H0  but  with  a  much  higher  p-value  of  0.0239.  When  we  examine  the  data  ﬁle  more  closely 
we  notice  that  the  body  temperatures  were  arranged  in  an  increasing  order  both  for  men 
and  women.  This  means  that  the  assumption  that  our  samples  are  i.i.d.  is  not  longer  true. 
To  restore  this,  we  randomly  permute  both  vectors  and  denote  their  diﬀerence  by  ’z’.  (To 
permute  ’men’  type  ’men(randperm(65))’,  the  same  for women.)  Then  performing  t-test  for 
the  diﬀerence  ’z’ 

[H,P,CI,STATS]=ttest(z,0,0.05,’both’) 

we  get 

H  =  1,  P  =0.0442,  CI  =  [0.0078,  0.5707] 
STATS  =  tstat:  2.0528,  df:  64,  sd:  1.1359 

which  is  a more  reasonable  (and  correct)  outcome. 

Two  sample  t-test  assuming  equal  variances.  If we  run  the  following  command  in 
Matlab: 

[H,P,CI,STATS]=ttest2(men,women,0.05,’both’,’equal’) 

we  get  the  following  output: 

H  =  1,  P  =  0.0239,  CI  =  [-0.5396,  -0.0388], 
STATS  =  tstat:  -2.2854,  df:  128,  sd:  0.7215.

We  again  reject  the  hypothesis  that  µx  =  µy  at  the  level  of  signiﬁcance  �  = 0.05  but  this 
time p-value is equal to 0.0239. Here ’both’ means that we test two-sided hypothesis µx  = µy , 
and  ’equal’  means  that  we  assume  that  the  ’true’  unknown  variances  of  the  distributions  of 
2  and  νy

t-test  with  unequal  variances.  Assuming  that  variances  are  equal  could  be  unjusti­
ﬁed.  There  is  a  version  of  t-test  which  does  not  make  this  assumption.  However,  we  can  no 
compute  exactly  the distribution  of t-statistic above  (since variances do not cancel out), and 
we  can  only  construct  ’approximate’  tests.  For  example,  running  in Matlab: 

[H,P,CI,STATS]=ttest2(men,women,0.05,’both’,’unequal’)

Therefore, we  obtain approximation  (7.0.1) which  is supposedly  better than a simple normal 
approximation. The  degrees  of  freedom df  : 127.5103  in  the Matlab  output  is precisely  given 
by  this  formula.

Comparing  the  variances  of  two  normal  distributions:  F -test.  Suppose  that we 
want  to  test  whether  the  variances  of  two  normal  distributions  are  equal.  For  example,  in 
2  = νy 
2 . We  can  test  this  in Matlab: 
the  ﬁrst  two  sample  t-test  we  assumed  that  νx 

[H,P,CI,STATS]=vartest2(men,women,0.05,’both’) 

and  we  get  the  following  output: 

H  =  0,  P  =  0.6211,  CI  =  [0.5388,  1.4481] 
STATS  =  fstat:  0.8833,  df1:  64,  df2:  64. 

We  accept  the  two-sided  null  hypothesis  H0  : νx  =  νy .  The  high  p-value  0.6211 means  that 
there  is  no  evidence  against  null  hypothesis.  This  test  is  constructed  as  follows.  Since  we 
know  that

When  ν 2  =  ν 2 ,  we  have  F  � Fn−1,m−1 ,  when  ν 2  > ν 2 , F  will  tend  to  be  above  the  ’typical

The  test  for H0  : νx  ∼ νy  is  similar.
