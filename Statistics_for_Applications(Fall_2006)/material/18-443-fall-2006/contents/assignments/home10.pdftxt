(1)  Consider  OECD  Economic  Development  dataset.  Take  logarithm  of 
per  capita  income  as  a  response  variable  Y  and  percent  of  labor  force  in 
agriculture  and  industry  as  two  explanatory  variables. 
log(income)  =  �1  +  �2  (%  in  agr.)  +  �3  (%  in  ind.)  +  �. 
(a)  Without  using  Matlab  ’regress’  function,  compute  estimates  of  pa­
rameters  �ˆ and  ˆα 2  and  test  the  hypothesis 

H0  : �2  = �3  = 0 

at  the  level  of  signiﬁcance  � = 0.05  and  compute  a  p-value. 
(b)  Construct  a  95%  conﬁdence  interval  for  parameter  �1 .

Write  all  steps  of  your  work,  formulas,  Matlab  commands  and  outputs.
