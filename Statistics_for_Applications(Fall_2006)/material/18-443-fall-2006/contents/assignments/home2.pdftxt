18.443.  Pset  2.  Due  Wednesday,  Sep  20. 

(1)  (Similar  to  example  in  lecture  2.)  Take  a  height  of  men  data  subset 
(second  column  in  body  men.mat  ﬁle  on  the  class  website).  Use  ’dﬁtool’  to 
ﬁt  normal  and  log-normal  distributions  (or,  if  necessary,  gamma).  If  you 
think  that  a  ﬁt  looks  good  (or  not)  perform  a  chi-squared  test  to  see  if  the 
test  agrees  with  you. 
(2)  Find  MLE  of  a  parameter  �  for  Poisson  distribution  �(�).  Compute 
Fisher  information  and  state  asymptotic  normality  property  of MLE. 
(3)  Prove  that  if  X1 , . . . , Xn  �  U [0, � ]  then  MLE  �ˆ =  max(X1 , . . . , Xn ) 
is  consistent,  i.e.  �ˆ �  �  in  probability.  Find  a  constant  c  such  that  c�ˆ is 
unbiased  estimate  of  � . 
(4) Consider  a parametric  family  of distributions with  the p.d.f.  given by 
 
�
and  where  −∼ < � < ∼.  Find MLE  � . ˆ
(6)  For  multivariate  parameter  �  = (�1 , . . . , �k )  prove  that  Fisher  infor­
mation matrix 

e�−x ,  when  x � � , 
0,  when  x < � , 

f (x|�) = 

I (�)  := Cov(→l(X |�)) = −EHess(l(X |�)).
