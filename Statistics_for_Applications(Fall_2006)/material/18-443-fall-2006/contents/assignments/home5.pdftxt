1.(50 points) Consider  the  third column  - heart rate - in  the normal body 
temperature  dataset  normtemp.mat.  Let  X1 , . . . , X65  be  a  sample  of  heart 
rate of men corresponding  to rows 1 through 65. Let Y1 , . . . , Y50  be a random 
subset  of  size  50  of  heart  rate  of  women  from  rows  66  through  130.  The 
reason  you  take  a  random  subset  is  because  the  values  are  arranged  in  an 
increasing  order  in  the  dataset.  In  other  words,  you  can  randomly  permute 
the  values  for  women  and  then  take  the  ﬁrst  ﬁfty.  For  both  samples,  ﬁnd 
a  normal  ﬁt  and  test  it  using  chi-squared  test.  Then,  perform  statistical 
analyses  of both  samples  assuming  that  their  distributions  are  normal.  Find 
conﬁdence  intervals  for  the  mean  and  variance  of  the  distributions  of  both 
samples.  Test  if  the  means  are  equal  using  paired  t-test,  and  t-tests  for  two 
samples  with  and without  the  assumption  that  the  variances  are  equal.  Test 
the  hypothesis  that  the  variances  are  equal  using  F-test.  Write  each  step 
of  your  work,  all  formulas,  threshold  constants,  p-values,  etc.  Use  textbook 
tables  to  ﬁnd  the  thresholds  and  p-values  in  each  test.
