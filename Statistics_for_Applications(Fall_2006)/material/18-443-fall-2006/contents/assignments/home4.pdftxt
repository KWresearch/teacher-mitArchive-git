18.443.  Pset  4.  Due  Wednesday,  Oct.  4. 

1.  In  the  conﬁdence  interval  for  variance  of  normal  distribution  we  ﬁnd 
the  constants  c1 , c2  such  that

4.  In  pset  3,  problem  3  (c),  a  random  variable  Y  has  what  density  on 
what  subspace? 
5.  Consider  positive  numbers  a1 , . . . , an  >  0  and  consider  a  nonnegative 
deﬁnite  covariance matrix  �  with  entries  �ij  = �aiaj ,  i.e.

Normal distribution N (0, �) has what density on what subspace?  Hint:  Find 
an  easy  obvious  choice  of  a matrix  A  such  that  � = AAT .  This  matrix  does 
not  have  to  be  square!
