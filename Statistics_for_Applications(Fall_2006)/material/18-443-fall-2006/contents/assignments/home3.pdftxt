2.  page  403,  no.  4. 
3.  (Solve this problem by hand without Matlab, but at each linear algebra 
step  write  a  Matlab  function  that  would  do  it,  like  ’sqrtm’,  ’eig’,  ’inv’,  etc.) 
Suppose  that  a  vector  X  has  normal  distribution  N (0, �)  with  covariance

. 
(a) Write  the  joint  density  f (x1 , x2 )  of X. 
(b)  Find  a  2 × 2 matrix  A  such  that  for  i.i.d.  standard  normal  vector  g , 
the  distribution  of  Ag  is  N (0, �). 
(c) What  is  the  distribution  of  Y  = M X  where

Does  Y  have  a  density  on R2 ? 
4.  page  415,  no.  7  (also  ﬁnd  the  conﬁdence  interval  for  � 2 .)  Do it by 
hand  and  then  use  ’normﬁt’  to  check  your  answers. 
5.  Given  a  sample  of  size  n  =  15  from  normal  distribution  what  is  the 
probability  that  the  interval
