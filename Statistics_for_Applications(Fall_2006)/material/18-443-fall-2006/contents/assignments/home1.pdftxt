(2) Compute EX, EX 2  and Var(X ) for N (µ, λ 2 ), B (p), E (�), �(�), U (0, �). 
(3)  Generate  a  sample  X  of  size  100  from  N (µ  = 5, λ 2  =  4).  Compute 
sample  mean  and  sample  standard  deviation  of  this  sample  using  Matlab 
functions  ’mean(X)’  and  ’std(X)’  or  ’std(X,1)’.  What  is  the  diﬀerence  be­
tween  ’std’  and  ’std(  ,1)’  (read  Matlab  help)?  Plot  on  the  same  graph  an 
empirical c.d.f.  of your data using  ’cdfplot’  function and a normal c.d.f.  with 
estimated  mean  and  standard  deviation.  Print  out  the  graph  and  write  a 
sequence  of  all Matlab  commands  in  this  exercise.
