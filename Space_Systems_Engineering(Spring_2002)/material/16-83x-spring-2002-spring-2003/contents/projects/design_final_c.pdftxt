C   Avionics Hardware Design (SS) 
C.1   Avionics Board Interfaces 
It is essential to identify the interfaces in order to ensure a complete and functioning 
Avionics/electronics subsystem.  The primary role of the Avionics subsystem is to 
integrate all hardware and software of the system; therefore, the Avionics hardware must 
interface with all other subsystems.   
 
Central to the Avionics subsystem is the Tattletale Model 8 computer.  The Avionics 
team has chosen to utilize the Tattletale Model 8 computer (TT8), with Motorola CPU 
(Central Processing Unit) and TPU (Time Processing Unit), because it both suits project 
processing needs and is readily available in the Space System Laboratory.  This computer 
interfaces directly with four other pieces of hardware: The Metrology computer, the 
voltage regulator, the Communications board, and a series of mosfets used for power 
amplification purposes.  This hardware conceptual layout is depicted in Figure C.1-A.

Each hardware interface is necessary and vital to each EMFFORCE vehicle.  The 
necessity for these interfaces is explained as follows: 
 

•  The Metrology computer is another Tattletale Model 8 computer.  The Avionics 
subsystem must allow for the sending of Primary Vehicle Array (PVA) updates 
through a serial channel from the Metrology TT8 to the main Avionics TT8 
computer.

•  The Power team is responsible for the voltage regulator. However, the Avionics 
team is responsible for the interfacing between the voltage regulator and the rest 
of the system.  The voltage regulator allows for a steady 5V power to come from 
the AA batteries to the Tattletale computers and the Avionics board.  The Power 
and Operations teams shall address any other power concerns and notify the 
Avionics team in a timely manner such that any new concerns can be addressed 
properly in the system design. 
•  The communications/operations hardware is the hardware that allows for the 
sending and receipt of all data being transmitted and received from the immediate 
vehicle system to the Avionics TT8 and vice versa.  The Communications board 
interfaces with the Avionics TT8 through a serial RS232 cable connection.  
•  A circuit design of mosfets, like the voltage regulator, is the responsibility of the 
Power team.  However, the intergration of the mosfets into the vehicle system is 
the responsibility of the Avionics team.  These mosfets shall ensure that the power 
derived from the D-cell main batteries supply the necessary level of current 
needed to drive the Reaction Wheel Assembly and the Electromagnets.

C.2   Avionics Board Wiring and Schematic 
The Metrology and Avionics Tattletale computers shall be attached to the Avionics board 
via one TSW-116-07-SS connector and one TSW-120-07-SS connector per Tattletale 
computer.  The two Tattletales communicate via one Tx line and one Rx line.  Four RS-
232 jacks, (corresponding to the Serial1 and Serial2 lines for each computer) shall be 
placed on the board, in a manner such that code loading can easily occur.  The Digital 
Ground (DGND), -MCLR, and –IRQ3 lines shall have male connectors such that a 
female connector can be used to load programs (DGND must be paired with either –
MCLR and –IRQ3 to load either FLASH or ROM).   
 
The Communications board shall be connected to the main Avionics board via another 
RS-232 cable.  This connection requires from Avionics a transmit, a receive, and a digital 
ground line.  Three Ultrasonic (US) signals shall all be inputs to the Metrology TT8 while 
the three Infrared (IR) signals shall converge through an OR gate before metrology 
computer processing.  This single IR signal shall also be sent to the Avionics TT8 for 
time synchronization purposes.

C.3   TT8/Avionics Board Pin Allocations 
The Avionics team established the following input/output pin allocations so that every 
subsystem can transmit and receive data when necessary.  The following pins have been 
allocated for the following functions on the Metrology and Avionics TT8 computers.  
The “TP” prefix refers to a TPU channel, and the “AD” pin and channel prefix refers to a 
pin connected to the TT8’s internal A/D converter.  A pin on the Avionics board or on the 
Metrology board is signified, respectively, by an “A” or an “M” appended to either the 
“TP” or “AD” prefix.  Table 0-A lists the Avionics computer TT8 pins, their functions, 
and whether it is for an input or an output signal from the Avionics computer while lists 
the same for the Metrology computer.  Loading of software code shall occur via serial 
port.  TT8-to-TT8 and TT8-to-Communications Board communication shall occur via 
serial lines made by the Avionics team.  Two TPU pins and the ground pin are necessary 
for each of these serial lines.

C.5   Avionics Hardware Testing 
Integration has been completed in a series of steps.  The following different tests and 
projects were performed to ensure proper avionics hardware design, integration, and 
compatibility with the vehicle as a whole.  The dates that these stages occurred are also 
noted. 
 

•  Dec2002 – May2003:  A prototype board and design concept for the actual 
Avionics board is designed and used.    At this point, tests shall be conducted to 
ensure proper coding and board design theory as well as to verify correct design 
of the various subsystems.  The prototype “ board” includes 2 IO-8 prototyping 
boards manufactured by Onset Computers, 1 prototyping breadboard with 
metrology OR gate chip for IR signal timing transmission, RS-232 cables used for 
both TT8-to-TT8 communication and TT8-to-Communication board 
communication, and all wiring of signals from each I/O channel.   This prototype 
system is currently still being used on Vehicle 1, and has allowed successful 
completion of tests 1A and 1B. 
•  Apr2003:  The manufactured boards were first compared to the OrCAD Layout 
and Capture drawings to ensure that they were manufactured to our specifications, 
and then tested with a scope to ensure proper connections.  These assurance tests 
were completed successfully. 
•  24Apr2003:  Two avionics electronics boards are populated according to to-date 
specifications.  Metrology software and hardware were integrated into the system 
without fault. 
•  29Apr2003:  It was determined that the current design of the avionics software 
needed 5 more digital channels for functionality.  The manufactured board design 
only included 5 excess A/D channels and no extra digital channels.  Therefore, the 
two boards were hardwired to meet the needs of the software. 
•  01May2003:  Software integration with the Avionics electronics board 
commenced.  The Metrology TT8 and the Avionics TT8 were not 
communicating; bypassing the OR-gate solved this issue. 
•  08May2003:  Hardware/electronics integration on Vehicle 2 begins.
