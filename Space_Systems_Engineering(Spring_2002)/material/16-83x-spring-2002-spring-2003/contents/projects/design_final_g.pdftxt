G  Metrology System Design (AA) 
G.1 Subsystem Outline 
The purpose of the metrology subsystem is to determine the separation distance and 
relative orientation of the craft.  The data will be used to control the system and stored for 
analysis of the system performance.  The primary purpose of the metrology system is to 
provide an input for the control algorithm.  The data will be used to maintain control of 
the cluster.  This purpose is the main source of the system requirements.

G.2 Requirements 
The metrology system is required to determine the position and orientation of the 
vehicles.  The metrology system is also required to determine the angular rate of each 
vehicle. This data will be used to control the system and recorded for analysis.  
Specifically the metrology system must: 
 

•  Determine the separation distance of the vehicles to within 1cm 
•  Determine the bearing angle between vehicles to within 5 degrees 
•  Work at a maximum separation distance of 4m 
•  Return data at a rate of 1 Hz.

G.3 Current System Design 
The current metrology system is legacy technology modified to suit our needs.  The 
current design for the metrology system is a hybrid of the system used for project 
SPHERES and the system utilized by the Electronic Ink Corp. in their Mimio Electronic 
whiteboard.  The design of the receivers is taken directly from SPHERES, since it had 
proven effective on that project and met our current system requirements.  The 
transmitter is based on the design of the Mimio pen (transmitter).   The Mimio transmitter 
proved to be more effective for location in 2D a plane (where as the SPHERES system 
was designed to work in 3D space).  The original designs have been modified to suit the 
specific needs of project EMFFORCE, however, it can be assumed that any part of the 
design which is not explicitly described below is based solely on legacy technology. 
 
The metrology system uses triangulation of emitted ultrasonic signals to determine the 
location of the vehicles.  Infrared emitters and receivers facilitate timing of the ultrasonic 
pulses.  Each vehicle will be equipped with three omni-directional ultrasonic receivers, 1 
omni-directional ultrasonic transmitter, and an array of infrared transmitters and receivers 
(to cover 360 degree line of sight).  In this document, omni directional is taken to mean 
that the transmitters emit signals of the same amplitude and phase in all directions in the 
horizontal plane (360 degrees) and the receivers can sense a signal from any direction in 
a plane.  This is not strictly “omni directional,” but since the test bed operates in 2D, the 
term is adequate.  
 
During one cycle of the sensing system, each vehicle will take turns emitting and 
receiving pulses and then calculate the position of the other vehicles by triangulation.  
The first vehicle will first emit an infrared pulse followed by an ultrasonic pulse at a 
known time later.  The other two vehicles will first receive the infrared pulse followed by 
the ultrasonic pulse at each of the three receivers.  The time difference between the 
reception time of the IR and Ultrasonic pulses will give time of flight for the ultrasonic 
pulse.  This will be used to determine the distance of the transmitter from each of the 
receivers.  A simple calculation will give the position of the transmitter.  After the 
vehicles have the position data for the first vehicle, the second will take its turn to emit 
followed by the third. 
 
There is an inherent delay in this system. The ultrasonic pulse must be allowed to leave 
the test area before another can be emitted otherwise the first pulse might interfere with 
measurement of the subsequent pulses.  Given the speed of sound at standard conditions 
and the current geometry of the system, the metrology team has calculated that it will 
require 23 milliseconds for a pulse to leave the test area before the next can be sent.  As a 
result, a three-vehicle system will require 69 milliseconds to determine the orientation of 
all three vehicles.  This is a delay inherent to the physics of the system and cannot be 
significantly changed.  From this approximation and added margin for known and 
unknown factors, it is currently approximated that the metrology system will operate at 1 
Hz.

G.4 Hardware Component Design 

G.4.1 Structural Support     
The Structural support is designed to keep the other components in the proper orientation.  
It is necessary to keep the relative positions of the receivers fixed in order to calculate the 
position and orientation of the vehicle.  Since the positioning of the receivers is so 
important, the metrology designed the structural support independently of the structure of 
the rest of the vehicle. 
 
The metrology system works by using differences in reception time at each of the 
receivers, thus it is important to keep them as far apart as possible.  If the receivers are 
close together the difference in reception times will be very small.  If the receivers are 
farther apart the average difference will be greater.  Since errors in reading the receivers 
should be independent of receiver location, the greater difference between the reception 
times will make the errors less significant.  The extent of this effect has not been 
calculated directly.  The general assumption during design was that the receivers should 
be as far from the center of the vehicle without overhanging the edge of the vehicle. 
 
The structural support is attached to the vehicle using Velcro.  For accurate position and 
angle measurement, the system needs to be aligned with the axis of rotation and center of 
mass of the vehicle (it was assumed that they would be in the same place, directly below 
the center of the support).   It was assumed that axis of rotation might be hard to find or 
might change due to design changes so adjustments might be necessary. Velcro was used 
to make small adjustments easy.   
 
The support structure of the metrology system is a large Y cut from a single sheet of 1/8-
inch thick aluminum stock (a diagram is shown in Figure G.4-A).  The structure was cut 
using the water jet.  The legs each extend 0.38m from the center and are offset from each 
other by 120 degrees.  The structure is attached to the top of the vehicle using Velcro.  
Specifically, the structure is attached to the lid of the cryogenic storage tank.  The 
receivers attach at the ends of the beams and the transmitters attach at the center using 
Velcro.  The Velcro is used for ease of adjustment.

Figure G.4-A:  Design of structural support to hold transmitter and receiver circuits. 

 

G.4.2 Receivers 
The ultrasonic and infrared receivers are mounted together on circuit boards at the ends 
of the support structure.  The receivers consist of an ultrasonic and 2 infrared receivers 
mounted on a circuit board and a reflective cone.  The board will amplify the ultrasonic 
signal, rectify it, and run it through a comparator to return a digital signal.  The reflective 
cone will reflect ultrasonic waves coming from any direction into the ultrasonic receiver.  
This is to make unidirectional receivers into omnidirectional receivers.  Reflecting the 
ultrasonic wave off the cone decreases the amplitude of the wave and thus will decrease 
the maximum range of the system.  However, at this time, the range of metrology system 
exceeds the requirements so the loss due to reflection is negligible. 
 
The receiver circuit consists mostly of amplifiers for the ultrasonic receiver.  The output 
of the ultrasonic emitter is limited so the range of the ultrasonic components must be 
accomplished at the receiver.  The opposite is true of the infrared system.  The receivers 
do have a high and low setting, however the high setting picks up the lights in the lab so 
the IR receivers must be used on low sensitivity.  Range of the IR system is determined 
by the output of the transmitter (see below). 
 
Initially, the boards were to be printed circuits (see Sections 0 and G.9), however when the 
project was scaled back from three vehicles to two vehicles, it became more time 
efficient to build the circuits by hand.  This has resulted in some variability in the boards 
but they all seem to work within requirements.  The only method of adjusting the 
receivers is a variable resistor built in to the comparator on the receiver circuit.  This 
resistor sets the sensitivity of the comparator and thus the sensitivity of the receiver.

The 10K pot sets the voltage to pin 13, which in turn determines the sensitivity of the 
comparator.  (See Figure 4-B below) If the voltage at pin 13 is set too low the receiver 
will never detect a signal (case 1 in Figure 4-B).  If the voltage is set too high, the 
receiver will stay on constantly due to background noise (case 4).  At the proper setting 
the output of the receiver (pin 14) will stay low, ground, until the receiver detects an 
ultrasonic pulse at which point the pin will change to high, 5 volts (case 2).  When the 
signal stops, pin the output will drop back to low.  If the voltage at 13 is set just over the 
correct value, the signal at 14 will be inverted, that is the voltage will stay high until it 
detects a falling signal which will make pin 14 drop to low before returning to high (case 
3). 

 

Figure G.4-B:  US receiver output calibration. 
Output of US receiver for a constant pulsing signal at various sensitivities. 

 
 
To calibrate a receiver, place the ultrasonic transmitter at the minimum operational range 
so that the signal will be the strongest signal encountered during operation.  Turn on the 
transmitter and leave it pulsing.  Measure the output of the receiver (pin 14 or the US 
output line) with an oscilloscope.  Adjust the 10K pot until the signal almost switches to 
the oversensitive (pin stays high) position.  For maximum range, set the sensitivity as 
high as possible without changing to the “always high” case.  If maximum range is not 
required, it is suggested that the receivers be set on lower sensitivity. There is no clear 
cutoff between the sensitivity regimes.  The appropriate voltage at pin 13 varies 
depending upon whether you are starting from a lower voltage or a higher voltage. 
 
The reflective cones used on the ultrasonic receivers are taken directly from parts donated 
by Mimio.  The metrology team had originally decided to construct cones since there 
were not enough of the Mimio cones to supply three vehicles. De-scoping of the project 
(from three vehicles to two vehicles) made possible to use the Mimio cones.  Section G.10 
includes the preliminary design for custom made cones. Section G.10 is included in case 
more than 6 receivers are needed, or in case the Mimio cones are broken or lost.  The 
cones are not currently attached to the boards (they are simply placed on top).  While this 
design is not ideal, it is sufficient.  A more permanent attachment should eventually be 
found. 
 
The receiver circuit boards have been mounted on pieces of Plexiglas to insulate the 
connections from the aluminum structural support.  The boards are tied to the Plexiglas

using small pieces of bare wire.  This is an inelegant but effective solution.  The boards 
are attached to the structure via strips of Velcro.  The Velcro is adhered to the bottom of 
the Plexiglas.  Velcro was chosen for ease of minor adjustments. 

G.4.3 Transmitters   
Each vehicle has a single transmitter unit placed at the center of the structural support.  
The transmitter emits both infrared and ultrasonic signals that can be detected by the 
receivers on the other vehicle(s).  The current design calls for an infrared pulse followed 
by an ultrasonic pulse but the transmitter is capable of sending either signal at any time.  
Both channels are designed to take pulse inputs.  Neither channel should ever receive a 
constant high signal or the circuit could overheat. 
 
The ultrasonic transmitters used for the metrology system were graciously donated by the 
Electronic Ink Corp (See Section G.9).  They are the omni directional units used on the pens 
of the Mimio Electronic Whiteboard System.  The top of a Mimio pen is used on each 
transmitter unit.  The pen contains both the ultrasonic emitter and an array of infrared 
emitters.  The emitters proved to be inadequate for our purposes so they are not used.  
The two extra wires coming from the Ultrasonic emitter are for the IR emitters.  They 
should be left disconnected.  Only the red and white leads are used and they are 
connected to the leads of the transformer. 
 
The design of the ultrasonic emitter circuit is taken directly from the designs provided by 
Mimio.  The mosfets controlling the emitters have been replaced with the ultrafetts, 
which were left over from the power subsystem.  The signal to the ultrasonic emitter 
should be a low signal that pulses to high.  The ultrasonic emitter is capable of sustaining 
a constant (oscillating 40kHz) signal, but not at the voltage used to power it.  The emitter 
currently runs at its max pulse voltage of 300 V.  To run continuously it must be scaled 
down to 150 V.  
 
The infrared transmitter consists of four arrays of PDI-E804 high-power infrared emitters 
(see Figure G.4-C). Each array contains six emitters.  The four arrays will ensure a 
detectable signal is sent in every direction in the horizontal plane.  The transmitter would 
probably meet the range requirements with as few as four emitters per array, but it was 
more time efficient to use more emitters to ensure the system would work.

G.4.4 Rate Gyros 
The metrology system utilizes rate gyros which were graciously donated by project 
SPHERES, specifically, the BEI Gyrochip II.  The axis of the gyro must be parallel to the 
axis of rotation of the vehicle and the gyro will connect to the power system and to the 
avionics tattletale.  Otherwise, the gyro can be placed anywhere on the vehicle.  A simple 
resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit has been added between the gyro and the tattletale to 
reduce high frequency noise.  The noise seems to come from the reaction wheel motor 
but it is difficult to determine exactly. 
 
The values of the RC circuit are a 16000-Ohm resistor and a 1-microfarad capacitor.  
These values were calculated assuming a sample rate of 10 Hz.  This gave a value of RC 
= 1/60.  The resistance was chosen to be well under the input resistance of the tattletale 
(which was unknown but assumed to be around 10^6 Ohms).  The exact values were 
chosen based on what was readily available in the lab.  The connector for the rate gyro 
board has four terminals.  There are two output leads; one is the direct output before 
going through the RC circuit.  The other is the corrected output, which is first filtered by 
the RC circuit.  
 
The planned stationary beacon will not be utilized.  Functionally, it would resemble the 
transmitters on each vehicle.  The beacon would consist of one transmitter unit mounted 
on a stand that is the same height as the vehicles.  The stationary beacon would provide 
data that could be used to determine the inertial position of the vehicles.  The current 
system design does not call for a stationary beacon as the vehicle does not have inertial 
control authority.  This requirement may change, but it is assumed that the stationary 
beacon will not be built.  This section has been retained for the sake of completeness.

G.5 Testing/Verification 

G.5.1 Hardware Testing 
The following hardware tests have been completed.  The results are summarized below.  
 
Range test 
A transmitter was placed near a receiver and slowly moved away until the signal was 
undetectable.  An oscilloscope was used to read outputs of infrared and ultrasonic 
receivers.  The range of the transmitter and receivers is roughly four meters. 
 
Time of flight measurement test 
An oscilloscope was used to read outputs of infrared and ultrasonic receivers.  The time 
difference between reception of infrared and ultrasonic signals was compared to the 
distance between receiver and transmitter.  The relation proved to be linear over the test 
range.  
 
Timing error due to angular offset 
This test consisted of two parts.  First the transmitter was rotated to verify that transmitter 
orientation caused no variation in signal reception.  Then the transmitter was placed one 
meter from receiver at various positions around the receiver.  The time of flight was 
compare for each position to determine if angular position caused any change in 
reception time.  The time of flight did not vary with angle.  Thus there seems to be no 
effect on range determination due to angles changes.   
 
The tests described above were preliminary tests to verify the functionality of the 
metrology hardware.  Similar tests were run with the full hardware setup running on the 
metrology software.  The data for these tests is included in the metrology software 
section. 

G.5.2 Interfaces 

G.5.2.1 Communications   
With the current design, each vehicle is only able to determine its own position and 
orientation relative to the other vehicles.  Therefore, the angular orientation of the other 
vehicles is transmitted over the communications system so the control algorithm will 
have all of the information required to control the vehicles.   
 

G.5.2.2 Avionics   
The hardware for the metrology system is connected to the avionics board.  The avionics 
board contains a tattletale board dedicated to the metrology system.  There are two output 
pins on the avionics board to the transmitter.  The outputs include one ultrasonic out and 
one IR out.  There are six inputs on the avionics board from the metrology subsystem.  
The inputs on the avionics board include three infrared inputs and three ultrasonic inputs.  

Massachusetts Institute of Technology                     9                        Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics 

EMFFORCE OPS MANUAL                              10         Space Systems Product Development-Spring 2003 

All of these pins are connected to ribbon cable, which connects to the metrology system.  
There is an OR-gate chip on the avionics board that was intended to combine the signals 
from the infrared receivers.  The gate proved unnecessary and may have been the cause 
of some of the noise in the system.  The chip has been removed and replaced by wire that 
connects all of the Infrared inputs.  The IR input pin stays high normally and a signal 
received by any one IR receiver will set the IR input pin low. 
 

G.5.2.3 Structures 
The metrology subsystem must be mounted on the vehicles in such a way that it has an 
unobstructed 360-degree view so that it can locate the other vehicles.  Obstructions will 
make “blind spots” where the other vehicles will be undetectable.  To prevent blind spots, 
the metrology system is mounted on top of the vehicle.  The support structure is attached 
to the top of the liquid nitrogen tank using Velcro.  Again, Velcro was used for ease of 
adjustment. 
  

G.5.2.4 Power   
The metrology system requires five-volt DC power and a ground line.  The current draw 
should be minimal.  The metrology system is connected to the power system via ribbon 
cable.  All of the power and ground leads to each component of the metrology system 
have been soldered together so that only one power and one ground pin are required.  The 
power leads are part of the same cable as the signal leads.

only a few grams.

G.10 Reflective Cone Design 
The current metrology system utilizes reflective cones (see Figure G.10-A) taken directly 
from a Mimio Electronic whiteboard system.  The cones were graciously donated by The 
Electronic Ink Corporation.  We currently have enough cones for 2 metrology systems 
with one backup.  However, we originally planned to construct our own cones.  This 
section gives information on how to construct such a cone in case more metrology 
systems are required or replacement parts are needed.  Alternately, it might be more 
efficient to purchase a Mimio system and use it for parts (though this seems wasteful).  
The cones come from the receiver (base unit) of the Mimio system.

The shape of the cone is defined by rotating a portion of a parabola about the y-axis.  The 
constants of the equation were determined using measurements of the reflective cones
