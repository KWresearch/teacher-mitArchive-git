DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORT 
 
The Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (SSL)  and  the  Lockheed 
Martin  Advanced  Technology  Center  (ATC)  are  collaborating  to  explore  the  potential  for  a 
Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites  flying 
in close formation.   
 
PROGRESS OVERVIEW 
 
 
Work  at  the  MIT  SSL  is  continuing  on  two  fronts:  the  CDIO  class,  and  the  MIT  SSL 
graduate  research  group.    The  CDIO  class  is  currently  in  the  process  of  designing  an 
electromagnetic  test  bed  called  EMFFORCE.    One  requirement  of  this  testbed  is  the  ability  to 
determine  each  satellites  relative  position  to  one  another.    This  month’s  report  will  discuss  the 
analysis  and  trades  used  to  determine  the  preliminary  design  of  the  EMFFORCE  test  bed 
metrology subsystem.

Extracted from the requirements of the overall project, the goal of the metrology system is to 
accurately calculate relative distance and attitude.  Per the requirements document, accurately 
is defined as 1/10 of the control tolerance for both distance and angular readings.  In addition, 
the  metrology  system  needs  to  have  a  field  of  view  of  360º  in  a  2-D  plane.    Finally,  the 
system  needs  a  detection  range  compatible  with  test  facilities.    These  test  facilities  include 
the test facility at MIT and the Lockheed flat floor facility in Denver, CO.

2.  System Trade Analysis 
 
The initial trade analysis for the metrology subsystem was to compare sonic ranging systems, 
indoor GPS,  and  inertial  navigation.    Sonic  ranging may  be  implemented  in many ways.    In 
the  current  incarnation,  the  sonic  system  uses  time  differences  between  transmitted  sonic 
signals  to  triangulate  the  position  of  a vehicle  (this  is  explained  in much greater detail  in  the 
design  section  below).    Inertial  navigation  uses  velocity  and  acceleration  information  from 
rate gyros and accelerometers to calculate the position of a vehicle.  The second derivative of 
acceleration  gives  linear  position  and  the  first  derivative  of  angular  rate  gives  angular 
orientation.  The indoor GPS system is very similar to the current design for the sonic system 
except  that  it  uses  radio  frequency.  Indoor  GPS  relies  on  several  radio  frequency  antennas.  
The  system  measures  the  time  difference  between  incoming  RF  signals  to  triangulate 
position.  
 
The  metrology  team  could  not  find  substantial  technical  information  on  the  indoor  GPS 
system.    It was  also  assumed  that  the  system would  require more  computational  cycles  than 
the  other  systems  since  it  was  assumed  that  the  RF  interface  would  be  more  complicated.  
Additionally,  the  RF  signals  are  prone  to  interference  from  the  electromagnet.    For  these 
reasons  the  indoor  GPS  system  was  deemed  infeasible.    The  inertial  navigation  system 
seemed  well  suited  to  our  purposes;  however,  it  also  seemed  to  require  excessive 
computational  power.    Also,  inertial  navigation  systems  may  experience  unacceptable  drift.  
Each  experiment  is  expected  to  run  for  approximately  5  minutes.      Accelerometers  with 
sufficiently  low drift rate  to meet  this  time requirement are prohibitively expensive.   A sonic 
system  is  very  desirable  because  there  are  many  people  within  the  department  who  have 
experience with  sonic  ranging.   SPHERES has demonstrated and documented one  functional 
system  for  sonic  ranging.    Also  the  Virtual  Ink  Corporation  has  developed  an  electronic 
whiteboard system (Mimio) based on sonic ranging which seems to demonstrate performance 
that meets  our  requirements.   These  design  considerations  lead  us  to  choose  the  third  option 
of sonic ranging.  
 
The  SPHERES  metrology  system  has  several  mounted  ground  units  that  emit  ultrasonic 
pulses, which  are  received  by  the  vehicles.   The Mimio whiteboard  system  also uses  a  fixed 
unit  to  track  a  moving  unit.    The  original  designs  for  the  EMFFORCE  metrology  system 
utilized  similar  ground  units  to  give  position  of  the  vehicles  relative  to  the  fixed  ground 
coordinates.    This  design  is  desirable  since  it  has  already  been  tested  and  proven  to  be 
effective.   However,  the  system architecture dictates  that  the actuation system will have only 
relative  control  authority.    The  electromagnets  will  allow  only  for  control  of  the  vehicles 
relative  to  each  other  and not  relative  to  the ground,  therefore  ground  referenced positioning 
is unnecessary.  The best option is to eliminate the ground units and put both the emitters and 
receivers  on  the  vehicles.    The  sensors  will  determine  the  position  of  the  other  vehicles  just 
as it would have determined the position of the ground units.  This is the current design of the 
metrology system.

3.  Design Overview 
 

The  current  design  of  the  system  relies  only  on  distance  readings.    Previous  designs  used 
distance  readings  and  the  time  difference  between  each  ultrasonic  receiver  on  board  (in 
addition  to  the  time difference between  the  IR and ultrasonic signals)  to determine  the angle.  
It was decided  that  this  data might not be precise  enough.   SPHERES uses  a  similar  system, 
but  cannot  get  good  accuracy  on  distance  using  the  time  difference  between  the  signals.  
However,  the  Virtual  Ink  Corporation  has  achieved  millimeter  accuracy  with  the  Mimio 
system, and has shown interest in helping the EMFFORCE Team.  
 
The  current  design  uses  data  from  all  three  sensors, while  a  few  previous  designs  used  only 
data  from  two  sensors.    The  third  sensor  served  only  to  determine  a  positive  of  negative 
reading.    This  design  was  flawed  since  there  was  a  range  where  the  sensor  wasn’t  able  to 
determine if the signal had a positive or negative orientation.  
 
Finally, the design calculates the angles and distances directly to the center of the vehicle.  In 
all previous designs, the algorithm would calculate the relative position to the sensor and a 
coordinate transformation was needed to go from an orientation around the sensor to the 
center of the vehicle.  The current design eliminates these calculations and decreases the 
number of calculations for the processor.  
 
3.1. Algorithm 
 

The  algorithm  of  the  system  uses  the  distance  readings  from  the  sensors.    Because  it 
knows  the distance,  it knows an  infinite number of points  the signal can be coming from, 
all  lying  on  a  circle. Using  the  information  from  the  three  sensors, one  can overlay  these 
three circles to determine the exact location (within a tolerance) of the vehicle.  Using the 
following  three  equations,  one  can  determine  the  two  unknowns.    It  is  possible  to  use 
only two sensor readings, however, there are times when there will be two solutions.  The 
third equation removes  this second solution.   However,  if a sensor  fails, previously know 
information can be used with the two solutions to determine which is the correct solution.

4.  Ultrasonic Transmitter 
 
4.1. Purpose of Part 
 
The  ultrasonic  transmitter  transmits  an  ultrasonic  signal  to  aid  in  the  calculation  of 
distance.   To keep the number of transmitters on board to a minimum, the system utilizes 
an  omni-directional  transmitter.   This  transmitter  has  been  implemented  on  an  electronic 
whiteboard  system  that  tracks  whiteboard  erasers  and  pens.    The  Metrology  Team  has 
contacted  the  company  (Virtual  Ink  Corporation,  maker  of  the  Mimio  electronic 
whiteboard system) to inquire about the sensor, in addition to the overall technology they 
implement in their system.  
 
4.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
Drawing  from  the design of  the Mimio whiteboard  system,  the Metrology Team  decided 
to  use  omni-directional  sonic  emitters.   One  option  for  omni-directional  sonic  units  is  to 
purchase  them off  them  shelf.   The units  are  inexpensive  and  readily  available.   Another 
alternative is to use directional sonic units, which are currently available, and affix a cone 
to  reflect  sound  waves  in  all  directions  (in  a  plane).    The  available  off-the-shelf 
transmitters  have  very  even  output  profiles  and  are  probably  superior  to  those  that  could 
be  manufactured  by  the  metrology  team.    Based  on  current  information  the  metrology 
team has decided to use off-the-shelf transmitters.  
 
 
5.  Ultrasonic Receiver 
 
5.1. Purpose of Part 
 
The ultrasonic receivers on board are to receive the signal from the ultrasonic transmitters 
emitted  by  the  other  vehicles.    The  configuration  of  the  receivers  is  critical  to  the 
calculation of distance and position.  To minimize the complexity of the algorithm, omni-
directional receivers will be used.  
 
After doing  some  searching,  it was determined  that  the best way  to obtain  these  types of 
receivers  is  just  to build  them  in  lab  from directional  receivers.   The  following picture  is 
from  a  concept  design  test of  our  setup.   A  cone has been  added  to  a directional  receiver 
to direct  the sound wave  to  the microphone of  the receiver.   Further  testing  is required  to 
confirm the quality of the design.  This testing will be executed over the next stage of the 
program.

5.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
The current options for omni-directional receivers are off-the-shelf receivers and the cone 
receivers  mentioned  above.    The  available  off-the-shelf  receivers  only  have  effective 
receiving  angle  of  150  degrees.    It  is  believed  that  the  proposed  cones  will  provide  a 
receiving  angle  of  360  degrees,  though  this  will  need  to  be  verified  through 
experimentation.    If  the  cones  can  be  manufactured  accurately  enough  to  provide  even 
360-degree  reception  they  will  be  superior  to  the  available  off-the-shelf  receivers.  
Pending further test results the metrology team has decided to use the conic receivers.  

 
6.  Infrared Transmitter 
 
6.1. Purpose of Part 
 
The infrared transmitter is needed to determine the time difference between the emissions 
and  the reception of  the ultrasonic signal.   The ultrasonic and  infrared signals are emitted 
at  the  same  time.   Since  the  signal  is  traveling  at  the  speed  of  light,  it’s  assumed  that  the 
other  vehicles  receive  the  signal  instantaneously.    This  gives  a  reference  start  time  to 
determine  the  time  of  flight  of  the  sound wave.    The  time  of  flight  along  with  the  know 
value  for  the  speed  of  sound  is  used  calculate  the  separation  distance.    Although  omni-
directional  transmitters  are  being  used,  two  have  been  implemented  in  the  design  to 
reduce the shadowing effects. 
 
6.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
The  current  options  for  infrared  emitters  are  either  to  use  one  omni  directional  emitter 
(similar  to  the  ultrasonic  system),  or  to  array  several  directional  emitters.    The  infrared

NRO-000-02-C0387-CLIN0001 

transmitters are very  low  in both mass and power consumption.   As a  result  there  is very 
little  difference  between  the  two  options.    The  choice  to  use  omni  directional  emitters 
comes  mostly  from  the  fact  that  the  emitters  will  come  as  part  of  the  Mimio  electronic 
whiteboard  eraser.    The  metrology  team  is  currently  planning  on  obtaining  both  the 
ultrasonic  and  infrared  emitters  from  the  same  erasers.    The  choice  of  infrared  sensors 
will most likely be determined by what types of emitters are readily available. 
 
 
7.  Infrared Receiver 
 
7.1. Purpose of Part 
 
Infrared  receivers  are  used  to  receive  the  IR  signal  emitted  by  the  vehicles.    Since  the 
field of view is 180º for the sensor, we use an array of three to cover the required 360º set 
forth by the requirements document.  
 
7.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
As  with  the  infrared  emitters,  there  are  various  receivers  available.    Again  there  is  no 
fundamentally  important  difference  between  the  various  receivers,  thus  the  metrology 
team will most likely use whichever receivers are readily available. 
 
8.  Rate Gyro 
 
8.1. Purpose of Part 
 
The  data  from  the  ultrasonic  and  IR  sensors  provide  enough  data  to  determine  relative 
angle  and  position,  however  the  data  is  not  obtained  fast  enough.    Integrating  the  data 
from the rate gyro will provide the current angle at a higher rate than is available from the 
sonic/IR  system.    Since  the  data  from  the  rate  gyro  can  be  polled  at  50  Hz,  the  control 
system can use accurate data.  
 
8.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
It was  initially believed  that  the ultrasonic positioning system would provide  information 
quickly enough  to maintain control of  the system.   At  this point  the  limiting factor on  the 
metrology  system  is  determined  by  the  speed  of  sound.    Thus  in  order  to  increase  the 
refresh rate it was necessary to add additional hardware.  The rate gyros are expensive but 
they  have  proved  successful  when  used  on  SPHERES.    The  rate  gyro  is  also  important 
because the control team requested rate data.

9.  Accelerometer 
 
9.1. Purpose of Part 
 
The  accelerometer  is  added  for  the  same  reason  as  the  rate  gyro.    Integrating  the  data 
twice can give us a position reading to satisfy the need from the control subsystem of data 
readings at 50 Hz.  
 
9.2. Discussion of Trade Analysis 
 
As  with  the  rate  gyro,  accelerometers  will  provide  data  in  order  to  increase  the  refresh 
rate  of  the  position  information.    The  accelerometers  are  also  expensive  but  they  have 
proved  successful  when  used  on  SPHERES.    The  accelerometers  are  also  important 
because the control team requested rate data.  

 

 
10. Metrology Design Issues 
 

The  system  still  needs  testing.    The  first  test  Metrology  Team  needs  to  conduct  is  the  best 
design  for  the  cones  for  the hand made omni-directional  sensor.   We will have  to  investigate 
and  research  acoustic  documents  to  determine  what  design  (parabolic,  angle,  etc.)  will  give 
us the strongest signal from a transmitter.  
 
Another  test we wish  to  conduct  is  the  effects  of  the Electromagnetic  on  the  sensors.    Since 
there will a be significant B field around  the sensors, we want  to  test  to see how much effect 
the magnetic fields have to the readings of our sensors.   
 
Next,  we  hope  to  test  our  accuracy  based  on  range.    We  know  as  we  start  increasing  the 
separation  on  the  vehicles  we  start  getting  less  precise  on  the  distance  and  angle  data.   We 
hope  to  keep  this  error  as  minimal  as  possible.    We  hope  to  come  up  with  a  graph  of 
Accuracy vs. Range so that we know where our systems starts to “fail.”  
 
Finally, we need to look at the refresh rate.  Because we use Ultrasonic transmitters, we have 
to  wait  for  the  sound  to  leave  the  testing  area  so  that  we  don’t  get  “bad”  data.    Based  on 
initial  numbers,  we  need  23  ms  between  each  vehicle  saying  “I’m  here.”    Rate  gyros  and 
accelerometers can lower that refresh rate.  
 
 
11. External Interfacing Needs 
 

The metrology  subsystem  interfaces with  the  avionics,  communications,  control,  power,  and 
structure  subsystems.    The  following  are  descriptions  of  the  interface  requirements  for  each 
vehicle.

11.1. 

Avionics Interfaces 
 
The metrology  subsystem will  interface  physically with  the  avionics  subsystem.   The  IR 
emitters  will  require  one  digital  output  from  the  avionics  board  (TT8).    Regardless  of 
how many  emitters  are  used  (to  get  full  360  degree  coverage),  all  of  the  emitters will  be 
wired  in  series  and  transmit  the  same  signal.    Thus  they  will  only  require  one  output.  
Likewise  the  IR  receivers  will  require  one  digital  input  on  the  avionics  board.    It  is 
unknown  at  this  time  exactly  what  form  of  signal  conditioning  or  support  hardware will 
be  required  between  the  IR  units  and  the  avionics  system.    This  hardware  is  the 
responsibility of the Metrology Team and will be determined after more experimentation.  
The  ultrasonic  emitter will  also  require  one  digital  output.    The  ultrasonic  receivers will 
require  three  digital  inputs.    The  rate  gyro  will  require  one  analog  input  to  the  avionics 
board.  The accelerometers will require two analog inputs to the avionics board, one input 
for each direction of motion (X and Y).

Communications Interface 
11.2. 
The  metrology  system  will  interface  with  the  communications  system  through  the 
avionics  system.    Using  the  current  design  for  the  metrology  system,  each  vehicle  will 
determine  the  separation distance  to each other vehicle and  the  angular orientation of  the 
vehicle.    The  angular  orientation  of  the  other  vehicles  is  also  necessary  to  control  the 
formation. 
  This  information  will  be  relayed  to  the  control  software  via  the 
communications  system.    Exactly  what  information  needs  to  be  transmitted  and  the 
required bandwidth will depend greatly upon the design of the control software.  
 
 
11.3. 
 
The metrology  system will  interface with  the  control  subsystem  via  the  avionics  system.  
The  metrology  software  will  take  all  inputs  from  sensors.    The  metrology  software  will 
then calculate the separation distance between each vehicle as well as the relative angular 
orientation  of  each  vehicle.   This  information will  be  provided  in  polar  coordinates with 
the  origin  at  the  center  of  each  vehicle.    Specifically,  the metrology  software will  return 
values  for  sAB,  sBC,  sAC,
α C,  β
β C,  γ
   and, 
Β .  (see  figure  4  below)    The metrology 
software will  also  return  linear  velocity  data  (by  taking  the  derivate  of  the  data  from  the 
accelerometers) and angular velocity data  from  the  rate gyros.   The  form of  this data and 
the refresh rate will be determined by the control team and has not yet been determined.

11.4. 
Power Interface 
The  metrology  system  will  interface  with  the  power  subsystem  physically.    The 
metrology  subsystem will most  likely  require  a  low  voltage  power  bus  (5-12  volts) with 
low  current  draw  (less  than  one  amp).    These  are  the  exact  voltage  requirements  for  the 
metrology system has not yet been determined.  The exact nature of the physical interface 
between the power and metrology subsystems has not yet been determined.  
 
11.5. 

Structural Interface 
 
The  metrology  system  will  interface  with  the  structures  subsystem  physically.    The 
metrology subsystem will be attached  to  the  top surface of  the vehicle so  that  the sensors 
and emitters will have an unobstructed 360-degree view.  Signal conditioning and support 
hardware will  fit  on  one  of  the  racks  allotted  for  circuit  boards.    The  exact  nature  of  the 
physical attachment for the metrology subsystem has not yet been determined.

The  cost  estimates  are  taken  from  various  sources  including,  but  not  limited  to, 
documentation  from  project  SPHERES,  discussions  with  SPHERES  metrology  team,  retail 
prices  and  specifications  sheets  from  the  Mimio  website,  and  estimations  from  experience 
with related systems.  
 
The cost for the sonic and IR components is estimated from the retail price of a Mimio brand 
whiteboard  eraser.    The  erasers  contain  two  omni  directional  sonic  emitters  and  four  omni 
directional  IR  emitters.    Two  such  erasers  will  provide  all  of  the  IR  and  ultrasonic  emitters 
required for the current design of the metrology system.  The Mimio whiteboard erasers retail 
for  $60  from  the  Mimio  online  store.    Based  on  information  from  the  SPHERES  team,  the 
ultrasonic  receivers  will  cost  around  $5  each.    It  is  estimated  that  the  IR  receivers  will  be 
similarly priced.  
 
All  weight  and  power  consumption  estimates  are  estimated  from 
the  SPHERES 
documentation.    Similar  equipment  will  be  used.    It  was  assumed  that  any  differences 
between  the equipment would be negligible.   Requirements for signal conditioning and other 
interfacing  hardware  have  not  been  directly  addressed  at  this  time  due  to  lack  of  available 
information.  
 
 
13. Conclusion 
 
The  current  design  of  the  metrology  system  is  based  on  the  designs  for  the  SPHERES 
metrology system and the Mimio electronic whiteboard system.  There are still several details 
that need to be sorted out however the basic design of the system is set.  Various components 
will  need  to  be  tested  before  implementation  of  the  current  design  of  the  system.    Most 
significantly,  the  reflective  cones  for  the  receivers will  need  to  be  tested  extensively.    Also, 
the  entire  system will  be  tested  for  variations  due  to  range,  input  power,  and magnetic  field 
effects.   The  algorithm will  need  to be more precisely  determined  and  coded  as well.   There 
is  a  significant  amount  of  work  left  to  do,  however  it  should  be  possible  to  complete  the 
project in the allotted time and with the requested budget.
