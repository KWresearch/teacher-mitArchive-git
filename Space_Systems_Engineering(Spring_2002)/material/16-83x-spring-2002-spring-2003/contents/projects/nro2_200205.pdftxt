DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORT

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Space Systems Lab (SSL) and the Lockheed
Martin Advanced Technology Center (ATC) are collaborating to explore the potential for a
Electro-Magnetic Formation Flight (EMFF) system applicable to Earth-orbiting satellites flying
in close formation.

PROGRESS OVERVIEW

At MIT, work on electro-magnetic formation flight (EMFF) has been pursued on two
fronts: the MIT conceive, design, implement and operate (CDIO) class, and the MIT Space
Systems Lab research group, as described in the April 2002 progress report.

The CDIO class has just completed its first semester performing trades on and
preliminary design of a six-degree-of-freedom electromagnetic formation flight testbed, called
“ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight of Rotating Clustered Entities, ” or
“EMFFORCE. ”
EMFFORCE will utilize electromagnets to control the size and attitude of a cluster of bodies.
The MIT Space Systems Lab research staff is supporting the CDIO class with both hardware and
software analysis and design.

Recent work has focused on the design and analysis of a control system for the
EMFFORCE testbed. Specifically, three testbed modes have been considered:

•  Spin-up of multiple bodies from rest
•  Steady-state spin of multiple bodies, ensuring:
- Operation at a fixed cluster radius
- Disturbance rejection
•  Spin-down of multiple bodies from steady-state spin.

Analysis shows the steady-state spin mode to be unstable, yet controllable with either
simple PID control or more optimal state-space control methods. Further, a one-degree-of-
freedom air-track system is identified to have unstable dynamics almost
identical
to the
dynamics of a spinning cluster; hence demonstrating control on the air track system will be
considered a positive step toward demonstrating control on the spinning system.

The following report summarizes recent progress on the control analysis and design
for the first two configurations. The third configuration will be treated similarly to the first,
but with a “reversed” algorithm.

The control subsystem, a computer program located within the avionics processor, takes state inputs
from the metrology subsystem and compares the current state with the desired state. It then outputs
commands, in the form of an output voltage, to the actuators to adjust the current state to match the
desired one. The output voltages are fed through the power system, which powers the actuators.

There are two different actuators to control the system, the electromagnets and the reaction wheels. The
electromagnets can provide forces and torques along the three degrees of freedom in which the vehicles
operate (x, y, and θ). Unfortunately, since the forces produced by the electromagnet cannot be
independently controlled, there is also need for a reaction wheel. The reaction wheel produces a torque

about the θ axis and it provides the opportunity to place the electromagnet’s magnetic poles. It is with
these two actuators that all controlling forces will be produced.

The requirements for the controller are derived from the requirements document. The main requirement
is to create a robust controller. This implies both rejecting any disturbance force that the formation may
encounter and having enough control authority to reposition satellites within the formation.

To demonstrate a robust controller, the system must execute three maneuvers: spin-up, steady state spin,
and spin-down. The spin-up maneuver consists of controlling three vehicles initially at rest in a straight
line with perpendicular magnetic fields (See Figure 1.3) to follow a specified trajectory to the steady
state configuration. In steady state spin the cluster is spinning about the center vehicle with an angular
rotation rate of at least 1 RPM. This configuration has all three magnetic fields lined up along a
common axis. Spin-down follows the same trajectory as spin-up in reverse. From the steady state the
system will gradually cause its magnetic fields to be perpendicular so as to stop the clusters motion.
These maneuvers are further developed in Sections 2 and 3.

Figure 1.3 Three Vehicle Spin-Up

Figure 1.4 Three Vehicle Steady State

The last requirement determines the control tolerance. Derived from the accuracy of our analysis, the
maximum displacement error allowed is one tenth of the separation distance between two adjacent
vehicles. For the specified maneuver, the maximum displacement error should not exceed 20 cm.

2 Steady State Mode

2.1 Definition of Steady State Mode

After the vehicles have completed the spin-up maneuver, they should complete three revolutions in
steady state mode. The steady state mode defines the control algorithm for this system maneuver. The
steady state mode will seek to decrease the error between the desired separation distance and the actual
separation distance. Since the purpose of the steady state mode is to keep the vehicles in configuration,
this controller will mostly reject disturbances. To design a controller, the system must first be analyzed.
Since the force from the electromagnets is axial then it is necessary to analyze the axial dynamics of the
system.

First, a system model must be developed. Force balance and perturbation analyses are used to find the
dominant poles of the system. In this mode, the forces acting on the system are the electromagnetic
forces from each electromagnet, and the centripetal force due to rotation. For a configuration with three
vehicles where the magnetic moments are µA = µB = µC = µavg, the forces are:

Taking the Laplace transform of the equation of motion, the homogeneous solution indicates the poles
are at plus and minus Ω on the real axis. With this analysis, carried out in great detail in Appendix A, it
is determined that steady state spin is unstable with a pole in the right half plane. A controller can,
however, be designed to stabilize the system based on this model.

2.2 Discussion of Trades Analysis

Different approaches can be used to design the controller to stabilize the steady state mode. Two
different control approaches were explored, phase lead and state space.

2.2.1 Phase Lead Controller

One approach is a phase lead control. A pair of students, Farmey Joseph and Richard Cross, in
MIT ’s Aeronautical and Astronautical department ’s junior design project class, 16.62x, explored
a system with a similar model as the steady state mode model found above, and implemented a
phase lead controller to stabilize the system. Their work was performed under the guidance of
Professor David W. Miller in the MIT Space Systems Laboratory.

Their setup consisted of a linear air track and two magnets. Originally, both magnets were to be
electromagnets that would glide on the air track and be controlled through current regulation.
Due to a miscalculation, the electromagnetic forces produced were not strong enough to
demonstrate control. Therefore, the free magnet was replaced with a permanent magnet.

With the 16.62x system, there are two different possible setups, one stable and one unstable. The
16.62x students examined the stable setup, in which the air track is raised on one end and the
electromagnet is fixed at the other end. The electromagnet must repel the permanent magnet to
maintain a fixed separation distance. The arrows indicate the direction of the magnets ’ north
poles.

by taking a step response of the system, which depicts the lack of damping in the uncontrolled
system.

Figure 2.4 Uncontrolled Step Response

The actual poles were found to be at plus and minus 1.5i. A phase lead controller was
implemented with a pole at -20, a zero at -2, and a gain of 0.5. This effectively reduced the
oscillations of the system when a step was introduced. The controller provided a damping ratio
of 0.11. There was some error, however, which was due to sensor noise.

Another possible setup with the linear air track demonstrates the unstable case. To create this
setup, the air track is raised on the same side as the fixed electromagnet. To maintain a fixed
separation distance, the fixed electromagnet must attract the free permanent magnet to maintain a
fixed separation distance.

, but on the real axis instead of the imaginary axis. This

Figure 2.7 Root Locus of Unstable System

The 16.62x students did not implement a controller for the unstable system, so the EMMFORCE
controls team designed a controller in SISOTOOL in MATLAB. A phase lead controller, similar
to the one used in the stable setup, was used, with a pole at –20, a zero at –3, and a gain of 30.
This gives a damping ratio of about 0.68. The step response shows a small steady state error, but

the system stabilizes quickly, within about 1 second. The overshoot is small, with no
oscillations. When this controller is implemented on the unstable setup, it should demonstrate
control.

Using modern control techniques the closed loop poles for cost efficient controllers can be
found. The following derivation is performed in more detail in Appendix A.3. To develop this
controller, a cost function is created to weigh the importance of different parameters. Rxx is
defined as a two by two matrix that allows one to penalize differences in separation or velocity
of the vehicles. Ruu is a scalar that describes the cost of using control. Because the controller
commands power to be supplied to the actuators, controlling the system has a cost of power. The
cost function weighs the importance of accuracy in positioning the satellites with the limited
resource of power.

the ratio λ/ρ is evaluated from

When the ratio is zero, use of control is infinitely expensive and the poles are both located at – Ω.
When the ratio is infinity, use of control is infinitely cheap. The location of the closed loop poles
move out to infinity along the 45° asymptote, where the damping ratio is 0.707.

2.3 Summary Of Options/Selection Criteria

Both methods of developing a controller provide beneficial information. The phase lead approach will
most likely be simpler to calculate and easier to analyze with the current knowledge of the EMFORCE
controls team. Though it is more complicated, the state space approach allows greater focus on the
important factors of cost and accuracy. For a preliminary control design, the classic control technique of
phase lead controllers will be implemented. For a final control design, the state space approach may be
used.

3 Spin-up/Spin-down Mode

3.1 Definition of Spin-up/Spin-down

When starting from rest, the vehicles must perform a spin-up maneuver to reach steady state spin. After
three steady state revolutions, the vehicles must perform a spin-down maneuver to return to rest. These
maneuvers are similar and will be modeled and controlled by similar means. The spin-up/spin-down
mode defines the control algorithm for these system maneuvers. This controller will try to move the
vehicles, initially at rest, along some pre-defined trajectory to the steady state spin configuration (See
Figure 3.1). To design a controller, the system must first be analyzed. Since this mode involves mostly
electromagnetic torques and translational forces, these system dynamics must be analyzed.

Initially the three vehicles will be positioned on the test bed at the appropriate separation distances with
the magnetic fields perpendicular to each other. The effects of this configuration are that the magnets
experience a shearing force, shown in the following figure by straight arrows, and a torque, shown by
the curved arrows.

Figure 3.1 Spin-up Force Balance

This figure depicts two vehicles, but the same forces apply with three or more vehicles. When these
forces and torques are controlled to follow a specified trajectory, the electromagnets can be caused to
move from rest to orbiting about a midpoint. This trajectory, for three vehicles, is depicted below:

Figure 3.2 Three Vehicle Spin-up Trajectory

When spinning up, the vehicles will experience disturbances. Any number of disturbances can cause
one or more vehicles to translate. Therefore it is important to take into account the translational forces
of two electromagnets with perpendicular magnetic fields. As shown below, the translated vehicles
motion will be governed by a translational force that changes depending on the translated distance. This
line of motion is broken into three regimes. If a magnet is disturbed past a critical distance in either
direction, then the translational force will change direction.

Figure 3.3 Three Regimes of Motion for Spin-up

At the critical points, where the translational forces change direction, the magnitude of the force is zero,
making them equilibrium points. To locate the points, the translational force must be calculated for a
given displaced distance. The translational force is a function of the angles of each electromagnet ’s
magnetic field to the axis that runs between them. As one magnet becomes more and more displaced
these angles change. The angles are defined as follows:

At the equilibrium points, sin(αΒ + βΑ) = 0. From the geometry, the equilibrium points occur when the
translated distance, d, is equal to the separation distance, sAB. Shown below is a phase plane plot of the
movement of the vehicle. This analysis defines the movement of the vehicles in any regime, as shown

below. If near the equilibrium point on the left, the vehicle will oscillate forever. In any other location,
the vehicle will move towards infinity.

Figure 3.5 Travel Paths for Given Translated Distances

A controller must be designed to follow the given trajectories without leaving the stable regimes.

3.2 Discussion of Trades Analysis

There is a trade between the two possible spin-up configurations.

Figure 3.6 Spin-up Configuration 1

Figure 3.7 Spin-up Configuration 2

The basis for this trade lies in the fact that the forces and moments on each magnet are not equal. As
shown in the following figure, due to the geometry of the configuration -- mainly that the separation
distance, s, significantly larger than the half length of the electromagnetic core -- the torques are
different on each vehicle.

Electromagnetic Formation Flight

NRO-000-02-C0387-CLIN0001

Figure 3.8 Unequal Torques on Vehicles

In this configuration, the torque felt by magnet B is greater than the force felt on magnet A. If a
straight-line force between the poles is assumed, it is seen that the angle at which the force reaches the
poles on magnet B approaches 90° and the angle at which the force reaches the poles on magnet A is
closer to zero. Since torque is the product of the force and the sine of the angle, the torque on magnet B
is much greater than the torque on magnet A.

More analytically, the torques on each magnet can be calculated.

Because the torques are not equal on each vehicle, there is a trade between the two configurations in
figures 3.6 and 3.7.

3.3 Summary of Options/Selection Criteria

Since the torque on the vertically aligned magnets is greater than the torque on the horizontally aligned
magnets, it follows that the initial positions of the magnets is important. In the configuration of figure
3.7, the center magnet feels half the torque of the outer one; its torque is then doubled due to the other
outer vehicle producing an even distribution of moments among the three vehicles. In figure 3.6, the
center magnet feels twice the torque of the outer one, which is then doubled due to the existence of the

MIT Space Systems Laboratory

15

Electromagnetic Formation Flight

NRO-000-02-C0387-CLIN0001

other outer vehicle. Therefore, the center magnet feels four times the amount of torque as compared to
the outer ones.

The amount of torque on a vehicle determines the amount of counter-torque the reaction wheel will have
to exert for control.
If the torque is concentrated in one vehicle then this vehicle will have to have a
larger reaction for adequate control. On the other hand, a large center vehicle means that more of the
system mass is concentrated at the center leading to less cluster angular momentum thus less total
reaction wheel angular momentum. Less reaction wheel angular momentum means that the reaction
wheels can be smaller, which affects the electromagnet size. A larger center vehicle also allows for a
larger central magnet, therefore a stronger central magnetic field. The result of a larger central magnetic
field is that the system can operate with lighter outer vehicles, at greater separation distance, and/or at
greater angular velocity. A large center vehicle with smaller outer vehicles, unfortunately violates our
interchangeability requirement. This requirement stipulates that all three vehicles must be the same.
The interchangeability requirement favors the configuration of figure 3.7, since this configuration more
evenly distributes the angular momentum among the three vehicles, leading to the smallest possible
reaction wheels, thus lighter-weight vehicles.

Because the requirements must be met, the configuration of figure 3.7 is the feasible configuration.
However, if the requirements change, the configuration may change to that of figure 3.6.

4 Control Architecture

4.1 Definition of Control Architecture

The control subsystem must know what mode to control, steady state or spin-up/spin-down. It then must
know how to implement the correct control for the determined mode. There are different methods of
processing the sensor data and issuing response commands. The control architecture determines the
desired trajectory and implements the appropriate controller.
It also determines the manner of
communicating the control instructions.

4.2 Discussion of Trades Analysis

The main trade for control architecture is the location of the controller within the entire system. Three
options were analyzed. These were independent, centralized control, and hybrid control.

With independent control, the vehicles each collect and process data to derive a control solution for each
separate vehicle. Because each vehicle will be processing and responding to its own data, the response
time will be very quick. The main disadvantage, however, of independent control is conflict with
multiple vehicles controlling the same disturbance. The system is coupled, therefore, when one vehicle
moves, it affects the others. It will be very difficult to implement independent control with each vehicle
impacting the state of the others.

MIT Space Systems Laboratory

16

Electromagnetic Formation Flight

NRO-000-02-C0387-CLIN0001

In centralized control, all of the information from metrology will be sent to a hub vehicle. The hub
would calculate the control solution and send the commands to the other vehicles. This is a good
solution to the problem of a coupled system. With only one vehicle making decisions, there is no
conflict with vehicles responding to other vehicles. However, there is a significant time delay associated
with a centralized controller. Having a hub run calculations and then send commands to other vehicles
slows down the response time.

The last form of control is hybrid control. In this case, all three vehicles will possess the ability to
control independently. In times when a quick response is needed, independent control will be
implemented. The system will also be capable of controlling through a hub vehicle in cases where
timing is not as crucial or the coupled effects of using electromagnetic actuation jeopardize adequate
control.

4.3 Summary Of Options/Selection Criteria

Neither independent control nor centralized control is very feasible to use separately. The effects of
being a coupled system are too large to use only independent control, and response time will most likely
not be quick enough if a hub did all of the calculations. Therefore, the best option is to implement a
hybrid control system. When timing is crucial, independent control will be implemented. At all other
times, a centralized controller will process the data and issue the commands to the other vehicles.

5 External Interfacing Needs

The control subsystem is located within the avionics subsystem. It is programmed onto the avionics
processor. In this way, it interfaces with avionics.

The controller will need inputs from metrology of the current state. This will include at least the
separation distance, the vehicles relative bearing, and the relative angles of the electromagnets ’ poles.
Other inputs that will not be required, but helpful in implementing control are the velocity and acceleration
of the vehicles.

After calculating the control algorithms, the control subsystem will output commands to the power
subsystem. These commands will indicate how much power needs to be supplied to the actuators.

6 Conclusions

The control design is central to building a successful system; indeed, it is what this testbed is attempting to
show is feasible. Unfortunately the controller design is not straightforward. As has been mentioned, the
control problem is unstable and the main actuator, the electromagnet, produces forces and torques that are
coupled. Through careful analysis the system’s dynamics can become well understood and certain trades
can be made leading to possible control designs.
