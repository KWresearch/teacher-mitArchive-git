E   Reaction Wheel Design (LW, WF) 
E.1   Role of RWA (LW) 
The spin-up process requires equating the centripetal force on a vehicle with the 
electromagnetic force generated by the magnets.  This process is depicted in Figure E.1-A 
and in Figure E.1-B. Figure E.1-A shows the initial configuration of the dipoles.  Although 
the finalized design of the system uses two large, coreless electromagnets, the 
electromagnets are represented here as effective dipoles.  The dipoles begin perpendicular 
to each other.   

Figure E.1-A: Initial Dipole Configuration 

 

 
Figure E.1-B depicts the two dipoles as they begin to spin up.  As soon as a current is 
applied to the electromagnets, forces and moments are induced in the dipoles.  The 
moments are due to the perpendicular geometry of the system at this point.  These 
moments must be counteracted by applied torque from the RWA.  The dipoles initially 
move in the directions of their respective net forces.  As they begin to move, the applied 
torque from the RWA is decreased to induce centripetal motion of the system.  As 
centripetal force increases, the applied torque continuously decreases, allowing the 
rotating dipoles to slowly align along the same axis.  At the point where the dipoles are 
perfectly aligned and the centripetal force is equal to the total magnetic force, no more 
applied torque is necessary.  At this point, the system is in steady-state rotation Figure E.1
-B shows the process of spin-up.

Figure E.1-B: Spin-up Configuration 

 

 
The RWA consists of a flywheel and a motor.  The motor powers the flywheel and must 
provide the necessary torque to balance the moments that are produced by the 
electromagnets.  The spinning wheel stores the system’s angular momentum, balancing 
the system and guiding the system through spin-up to steady-state rotation.  The RWA 
functions on the principle of the conservation of angular momentum.  Angular 
momentum is conserved because the spin-up maneuver is performed entirely using 
torques and forces that are internal to the system.  Therefore, the sum of the angular 
momentum that accumulates in the wheels on the (in this case) two vehicles is equal and 
opposite to the angular momentum associated with the spinning of the system about its 
own center of mass.

E.2   Requirements 
•  Wheel 
o  As a minimum, the flywheel must store the angular momentum necessary 
to operate a two-vehicle system in a steady state maneuver. The vehicles 
will perform the maneuver at a separation distance (between vehicle 
centers) of two meters and a rotation rate of one rotation per minute. 
o  The flywheel may not be made from an electrically conducting material. 
The electromagnetic field in which the wheel must operate would induce 
eddy currents in any wheel made from conducting material. Eddy currents 
would act as a retarding force against the motion of the wheel and this 
would hurt the performance of the reaction wheel assembly.  
o  The maximum wheel diameter is limited by the total vehicle size to less 
than half of a meter. 
o  Due to the material properties of the flywheel the wheel must be capable 
of storing the necessary angular momentum while operating at a speed 
below seven thousand rotations per minute. 

 
•  Motor 
o  The motor in the RWA must provide sufficient torque to accelerate the 
flywheel in either direction in order to counter moments induced by the 
electromagnets.

E.3   Wheel Design (WF) 

E.3.1   Material Selection 
The design of the reaction wheel assembly was complicated with the decision from the 
Electro-magnet team to use hoops of super conducting wire to generate the necessary 
magnet forces to operate the vehicles. The reaction wheel assembly will be placed inside 
these hoops and therefore will be operating inside of a magnetic field. Due to problems 
with eddy currents, which act as strong resisting force to spinning metal wheels inside of 
a magnetic field, the flywheel cannot be made from any metallic materials. This forced 
the search for non-metallic materials with a sufficient density and structural rigidity to 
provide for the angular momentum storage of the vehicles. High-density urethanes appear 
to be the best solution. These materials provide the density and structural properties 
necessary to perform as needed and can also be molded into any shape for a relatively 
low cost. The reaction wheel assembly team has decided to use urethane wheels to be 
manufactured by Advanced Urethane Solutions because of their ability to meet all of our 
specifications at a low cost and with a reasonable delivery time. 
 
E.3.2 Basic Geometry 
The flywheel consists of a thick outer ring and thin inner disk. Moment of inertia is 
dependent on the total mass of material used and the distance of that material from the 
axis of rotation. The most efficient flywheel design places a majority of the flywheel 
mass far from the axis of  Rotation - the center of the flywheel.
 Figure E.3-A depicts the basic geometry used as the starting point in the flywheel design.

E.3.3 Governing Model 
The flywheel on each vehicle must be capable of storing one half of the total angular 
momentum of the entire system. This is necessary to allow the system to spin up from a 
static equilibrium into a steady-state rotation, which is a maneuver that will be conducted 
for this project. The total angular momentum that must be stored in the reaction wheels 
must be equal to the angular momentum generated during the spin up of the vehicles.

Where Iveh is the mass moment of inertia of an individual vehicle, mveh is the mass of a

time to get an exact value for the mass moment of inertia for each vehicle (Iveh). 
However, it is possible to make estimates from the contributions of each of the vehicle 
components and sum those contributions. The mass moment of inertia for each of the 
major vehicle components can be found in Table E.3-A below.

Using the results from Table E.3-A and adding a margin of error of 4.5%, the mass moment 
of inertia for each vehicle, about its center of mass, is approximately 0.9 kg m2. The 
current test plan calls for the two vehicles to separated by a distance of 2 m and rotate at 
one RPM with a vehicle mass of 18 kg. Using this information in Equation E.3-2 gives 
the total angular momentum of the vehicle as 3.96 kg m2/s.

The maximum velocity of the wheel is limited by the structural integrity of the material 
when spun at high angular velocities. For the current wheel design and material 
properties, the maximum speed of the wheel before structural failure is 15,000 RPM (see 
section 3.4 below) and before structural deformation is 7,000 RPM. In order to ensure the 
safety of the wheel and those operating the vehicle, we have set the design operating 
velocity for the flywheel to be 2000 RPM. For an operating velocity of 2000 RPM and 
the total angular momentum of 3.96 kg m2/s calculated above, Equations E.3-1 and E.3-2 
yield a necessary mass moment of inertia for the flywheel of 0.01 kg m2. 
 
The mass moment of inertia of the flywheel is dependent on the specific geometry of the 
wheel and can be found by treating the disk and ring separately and superimposing the 
results. From Figure E.1-B, the mass moment inertia of the disk is given by:

E.3.4 Structural Integrity 
Disks spinning at high angular velocities can experience incredibly large stresses. In 
order to ensure the safety of our system, the flywheel must be capable of withstanding the 
stresses that it will experience during operation. The stresses for the flywheel are greatest 
in the lip of the ring. The maximum stress for a spinning ring is given by

where ω is the spin rate of the system, RO is 0.124m and RI is 0.1m and ν is the Poisson

and the yield stress is 9 MPa. Thus, the angular velocity at which the wheel will fail is 
15,000 RPM and the rate at which the material will begin to yield is 7,000 RPM. In order 
to prevent failure, the system is designed to operate at 2,000 RPM and voltage limits will 
be placed on the power supplying the motor to prevent it from spinning faster than 5,000 
RPM.

E.4 Motor Selection (LW) 

E.4.1 Determination of Required Torque 
The torque required by the motor is that necessary to provide an acceleration of the 
flywheel in either direction that will counter the moments induced by the electromagnets.  
Due to the principle of the conservation of angular momentum, the torque required by the 
motor is equal to the torque resulting from the spin-up of two electromagnet dipoles.  The 
greatest torque is the initial torque, the torque required to initiate the spin-up process.  
 
The relationship for the magnetic moments of the (in this case) two dipoles is given in

The boundary conditions applied to the system are given in Equation E.4-5.  
These conditions are derived from the requirements of the spin-up process.  The dipoles 
begin spin-up from rest; therefore there should be no angular momentum in the initial 
state.  The requirement for spin-up stipulates that the vehicle will be spinning at a rate of 
one revolution per minute at the conclusion of spin-up.  This requirement drives the end 
boundary condition.

motors (for airplanes, boats or cars).  The industrial brushless motors easily provide the

torque required by the system.  However, they are much more massive than the model 
motors and also more expensive by a factor of four.  Most of the model motors are not 
capable of providing the necessary torque (and were therefore eliminated from the 
search).  However, a certain class of model airplane motors is capable of providing 
sufficient torque for spin-up. 
 
Both the brushless and model motors run from variable voltage supplies, but the 
brushless motors require a much higher range of voltage, ranging up to a high of 50 
required volts.  Such high required voltages place a large burden on the power system, 
also adding significant mass to the system through batteries.  The voltage ranges for the 
smallest, most powerful model motors have high-end voltages of 18-24 volts, which is a 
more reasonable parameter for the EMFFORCE system. 

 
E.4.3 Motor Selection 
The selected motor is the Cobalt 625 Airplane Motor, provided by Astroflight, Inc.  The 
motor requires a variable voltage of 6-18 volts.  It is capable of providing a torque of 0.25 
Nm with an applied current of 25 amps.  This torque capability is more than sufficient for 
the EMFFORCE operational requirements.  Noteworthy motor specifications are listed

system.  The torque requirement for the motor drives the required current, while the 
voltage required is determined by operational speed of the motor.  Equation E.4-9 gives 
the relationship for the motor’s torque, where k is the torque constant.
