•  What we hope to finish by PDR… 
– Model and Control the stable problem 
•  Using 62X Setup 
– Model and Control the unstable problem 
•  More like what our system will have to do 
– Look into rotation problem’s mechanics 
– Familiarity with control tools 
•  D-Space, Matlab, Simulink, and lab setup 
–  Will be good for future of project!!!

The purpose of the TARR is explicit in its name, Trade Analysis and Requirements 
Review.  Specifically, the class hopes to review the requirements that have been 
levied and the trade analyses that have been conducted.  The purpose of presenting 
this to an audience is twofold: 
1.  To require the class to polish their work by having to make it 
presentable to an outside audience. 
2.  To seek outside view of our work as it stands. 
The class realizes that we do not have all the answers and hopes that through this 
exercise we will gain further understanding and new insight into the project.

By PDR we hope to have… 
•  A final design for the metrology 
system including: 
– Number of each type of sensors 
– Estimated power requirements 
– Estimated processing requirements 
•  Algorithm to obtain distance and angle 
data from the sensor input
