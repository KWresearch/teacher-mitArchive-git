1  Introduction 

1.1  Description of the Effort 

The  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (MIT  SSL)  and  the 
Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center  (ATC) are  collaborating  to explore  the potential 
for  an  Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites 
flying in close formation. 

1.2  Progress Overview 

At  MIT,  work  on  EMFF  has  been  pursued  on  two  fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design, 
implement and operate (CDIO) class, and the MIT SSL research group, as described in the April 
2002 progress report. 

Recent work in the MIT SSL has focused on trade analyses for the sizing and design of 
the electromagnets that will be used as actuators in Earth-orbiting EMFF applications.  The first 
trade determines the benefits of using electromagnets with or without ferromagnetic cores.  The 
second analysis optimizes the mission efficiency of a three-spacecraft EMFF cluster configured 
collinearly.  The following report summarizes these trades and the progress made in the 
sizing and design of an electromagnetic actuation system for EMFF control. 

2  Coil vs. Core 

Before optimizing the system size for EMFF spacecraft, determining the effect of 
magnetizable cores is the first design step.  Spacecraft can be designed with either 
electromagnetic coils only, or coils wrapped around paramagnetic or ferromagnetic cores.  
Magnetizable cores can directly improve the electromagnetic attractive force; however, EMFF 
with cores must account for the additional core mass.   

To conduct the following trade analysis, the system masses of a coil-only system and a 
coil-with-core system are constrained to be equal.  The normalized force and acceleration 
between two axially aligned magnets are then determined.  The normalized force has direct 
impact on a mission baseline, while the acceleration determines spacecraft agility.  These aspects 
of EMFF spacecraft will also be explored later.  To model the coil-with-core configuration, the 
iron core system mass increased with increasing core dimensions while the copper wire length 
and thickness were held constant.  This is a necessary constraint since the wires in a coil have 
current density and temperature limitations.  For the coil-only system, mass was increased with 
the number of wire turns.  Wire length of the coil was increased to keep the system mass equal to 
that of the core system.   

Figures 1 and 2 compare the coil-with-core and the coil-only systems.  The trade models 
two axis-aligned electromagnets and calculates the normalized axial forces and accelerations as a 
function of core radius, and hence system mass.

There are two useful results from this trade study.  For systems with small core or coil 
radius, mainly testbed-sized vehicles, a core with relatively modest magnetic amplification 
factor, χ, will greatly improve the system baseline and agility.  However, flight-sized EMFF 
systems will be much larger and will require larger coil and core radii.  For these systems, a coil­

only configuration is more beneficial, since the normalized force and acceleration for the coil-
only system increase dramatically with increasing radius.   

3  Three-Spacecraft Sizing 

Now that spacecraft have been selected with coils only, we can determine the optimal 
distribution of EMFF system sizes according to mission efficiency.  The model considered 
consists of three collinear EMFF spacecraft: one center vehicle and two vehicles rotating about 
the center one.  The mission efficiency is measured by the productivity divided by the mission 
cost.  Productivity is proportional to array rotation rate; the faster the array can survey a region, 
the more data it can collect in a given amount of time.  Mission cost is defined as total spacecraft 
array mass. 

The MIT SSL has conducted similar mission efficiency trades for two identical 
spacecraft.  With three spacecraft, the constraint of identical spacecraft masses has been dropped 
because it will not yield the highest mission efficiency.  Since the center spacecraft does not 
change attitude during array rotation, increasing its mass will not affect the rotation rate.  
Therefore, the EMFF mass between the two outer spacecraft and the center spacecraft can be 
redistributed until optimal mission efficiency is achieved.  The number of coil turns and coil 
current can be traded to determine the mission efficiency, J. 

As a baseline J, three identical spacecraft with 2000 coil turns and 13 A was used.  Figure 
3 shows the effect of varying the current as the number of coil turns is kept fixed.  Maximum J 
occurs when the currents are 128 A for the center spacecraft and 68 A for the outer spacecraft.  
This new configuration yields a mission efficiency 3.8 times greater than the baseline case.  The 
coil currents exceed the limit that copper wires can conduct; however, there is a solution that will 
be discussed after this final step of system sizing. 

Figure 3. Mission efficiency with varying coil currents 

Using these optimal currents, the number of coil turns was varied and the result is shown 
in Figure 4.  The maximum J in this case is 5.4 times greater than before and almost twice as 
efficient as the baseline case. This final case yields a center spacecraft with 10000 coil turns and 
outer spacecraft with 8000 coil turns.  This point design demonstrates how mass can be 
redistributed to increase mission efficiency.  The MIT SSL is currently working on algorithms 
for a more generalized result for this multivariable problem.

4  Conclusions and Other Work 

Earlier, optimizing mission efficiency yielded a case with relatively high currents for 
normal copper coils.  However, these currents are in the range of superconducting coils.  The 
MIT SSL is examining the effects of integrating superconducting coils into EMFF.  High-
temperature superconducting coils will allow ten times more current and greatly increase the 
electromagnetic forces.  For testbed vehicles, superconducting coils must be cooled with liquid 
nitrogen, adding to system mass.  For flight EMFF systems, some other means of temperature 
regulation will be used.  Therefore superconducting coils have the ability to greatly increase 
mission efficiency without adding significant costs. 

Finally, the MIT SSL and the associated CDIO class are continuing to design and 
construct vehicles for an EMFF testbed.  The class is currently researching the use of 
superconducting coils and is developing the algorithms necessary to control the testbed.
