0   Program Overview  
  
0.1  Introduction  
  
Formation flight of satellites is the technology by which a cluster of satellites maintains a specified formation in  
orbit.  Although formation flight of satellites has yet to be used in practice, it is being discussed in the aerospace  
industry   as  a  way   to  provide  new  mission  capabilities   for   satellites.     The  MIT  SSL  SPHERES  project  
demonstrated  the  initial  feasibility  of  satellite  formation  flight.    The  CDIO3  class  aims  to  expand  on  the  
SPHERES research with the electromagnetic formation flight project.  
  

0.1.1  Background & Motivation  
  
Before  discussing  the  design  of  the  EMFFORCE  testbed  it  is  important  to  understand  the  background  and  
motivation  for  this  project.    To  accomplish  this,  a  definition  for  formation  flight  must  be  presented.   
Formation  flight  is  defined  as  a  cluster  of  satellites  maintaining  a  designated  formation  in  space  flight.  
<GG>  
  
Applications  of  formation  flight  include  surveillance  and  high-resolution  imaging  applications.    Formation  
flight  can  achieve  large  sensor  apertures  that  increase  resolution  without  large  physical  structures  that  are  
difficult  and  costly  to  launch,  deploy,  and maintain.    It  is  therefore  advantageous  to  use  formation  flight  in  
conjunction with interferometry for such purposes. <GG>  
  
Servicing  and  maintenance  can  also  be  done  on  individual  vehicles,  thereby  allowing  the  mission  to  
continue  during  these  processes.    Formation  flight  allows  the  integration  of  new  technologies  during  the  
mission  as  well.    Because  of  its  flexible  system  geometry,  the  system  can  also  react  to  evolving  mission  
requirements and/or address multiple missions at once.  <GG>  
  
Challenges  to  formation  flight  do  exist.    Because  current  systems  utilize  thrusters,  the  propulsion  system  
actuates  each  vehicle  with  absolute  degrees  of  freedom  (relative  to  an  inertial  point)  rather  than  relative  
degrees  of  freedom  (relative  to  the  other  vehicles).    However,  in  order  to  remain  in  the  desired  geometry,  
formation  flying  satellites  should  be  able  to  control  their  relative  position.   Thrusters  use  propellant, which  
limits   the   lifetime  of   the   spacecraft.     Propellants  also  create  exhaust,  which  can  cause  both  contact  
contamination   that   damages   sensitive   imaging   equipment,   and   radiative   contamination   that   creates   a  
blurring cloud through which the telescopes must look. <GG>  
  
Because  of  these  drawbacks  to  thruster-actuated  formation  flying  satellites,  the  EMFFORCE  Team  is  
investigating   the   use   of   electromagnetic   control   for   formation   flight.      Electromagnetic   control   uses  
electromagnetic  dipoles  along  with  reaction  wheels  to  provide  the  “thrusting”  
forces  and  torques  between  
vehicles.    Varying  the  amount  of  current  through  the  electromagnet  coil  can  control  the  strength  of  these  
dipoles.    Control  of  the  dipole  strength  and  magnet  direction  can  provide  maneuvering  forces  as  well  as  
small disturbance rejection for more precise control. <GG>  
  
The  use  of  electromagnetic  control  avoids  the  drawbacks  that  thrusters  and  their  propellants  pose  to  
formation flight.   Because electromagnetic forces interact with surrounding electromagnetic forces, this type  
of  control  operates with  respect  to  the  relative motion  and  position  of  each  vehicle.     However,  the  control  
problem  for  electromagnetic  formation  flight  (EMFF)  becomes  increasingly  complex  when  the  coupled  

15  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT

control of  relative  forces  is paired with  the already unstable control problem of  rotating vehicles.   There are  
also   many   drawbacks   to   the   electromagnet   itself.      Not   only   is   ferromagnetic   material   heavy,   but  
electromagnetic  forces  are weak,  dropping  off  as  the 4th power  of  the  separation distance between vehicles.    
The EM fields can also cause interference with other electronic subsystems.  <GG>  
  
  
0.2  Mission Statement  
  
The EMFFORCE mission statement reads:  
  
Demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic control for formation flying satellites.  
  
This  means  that  Project  EMFFORCE  aims  to  operate  a  formation  flying  testbed  that  represents  a  real-world  
system.    The  mission  statement  also  implies  that  a  2-D  operational  testbed  must  be  translatable  to  a  3-D  
operational  testbed.    Electromagnetic  control  suggests  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  controller  using  no  
thrusters but instead coupled electromagnetic forces with angular momentum storage. <GG>  
  
  
0.3  Requirements Overview  
  
This  section  provides  a  high-level  requirements  summary.    For  more  detailed  requirements  please  refer  to  the  
EMFFORCE Requirements Document.  
  

0.3.1 Customer Requirements  
  
The  customer  requirements  as  derived  from  the  Executive  Summary  EMFF  Proposal  by MIT  SSL  and  the  
Technical-Management Proposal by MIT SSL and Lockheed-Martin ATC are:  
  

(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must consist of multiple vehicles  
(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must be representative of formation flying vehicles used in real world space missions  
(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must use electromagnetic control to replace thrusters  
(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must control three degrees of freedom, traceable to six  
(cid:4)(cid:5) The system controller must reject disturbances as well as reposition vehicles  

  
This  project  must  show  representative  formation  flying  maneuvers  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  using  
electromagnetic  control  for  actual  space  missions.    More  specifically,  the  system  must  show  dynamically  
changing formation geometries and  the ability  to replace failed formation elements.   Because  the purpose of  
this project  is  to demonstrate an alternative  to  thruster control, no  thrusters may be used.  The vehicles must  
be  controlled  in  three  individual  degrees  of  freedom  (X,Y,  (cid:6)),  with  the  potential  for  translation  to  six  
individual  degrees  of  freedom.    Finally,  the  controller must  counteract  any disturbance  force  and be  able  to  
reposition satellites within the formation. <GG, LS>  
  
The EMFFORCE team must operate within specific constraints while trying to achieve these requirements:

(cid:4)(cid:5) Budget – $50,000 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Human resources limited to CDIO class and staff 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Tests must be conducted in a maximum area of ten by eight meters. 

(cid:4)(cid:5) The system cannot use umbilical resources for power, air supply, or communications. 

(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must record test data to ensure requirement satisfaction. 

(cid:4)(cid:5) The system must keep itself, the testing facility and human involved safe. 


  
0.3.2 Functional Requirements  
  
The  system  functional  requirements can be  separated by  requirements  that must be met versus  requirements  
that should be met:  
  
The system must:  
(cid:4)(cid:5) Demonstrate stability with at least three vehicles 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Control in each relative degree of freedom 

The system should: 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Complete a five-rotation test maneuver 

o  One rotation spin-up, three rotations steady state, and one rotation spin-down 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Operate in the far field 

o  Separation distance of at least ten times the length of the electromagnet 


The  system  must  demonstrate  stable  maneuverability  using  at  least  three  vehicles.    This  will  facilitate  
translation  to  more  vehicles.    The  system  must  also  control  each  relative  degree  of  freedom  in  two  
dimensions with  identifiable  transition  to  three dimensions.   The  system will not be able  to control absolute  
motion of the entire system center of mass. <GG, LS>  
  
A five-rotation maneuver will include one for spin-up, three steady-state, and one for spin-down.  The spin – 
up  maneuver  should  start  from  rest  and  finish  at  a  separation  distance  of  at  least  two  meters.    The  system  
should  perform  three  steady-state  rotations  at  a  constant  angular  rate  of  six  degrees  of  arc  per  second  for  a  
two-meter  separation  distance.    The  system  should  also  operate  in  the  far  field  of  electromagnetic  control.   
Far-field  currently  implies  a  separation  distance  of  at  least  ten  times  the  separation  distance.   However,  the  
Electromagnet Team is currently running tests to develop a more precise definition. <GG, LS>  

 

0.3.3 Operational Requirements    

 

The Requirements Team also derived the following operational requirements from customer requirements:  
 


  

  

(cid:4)(cid:5) Test time should equal five minutes 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles should be identical and interchangeable 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles must send and record test data 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles must respond to other satellites 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles must respond to user input 

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles must demonstrate autonomy  

(cid:4)(cid:5) Vehicles must maintain safety

The system shall operate without needing to recharge batteries for a period of time useful to perform several  
tests.    In  order  to  maintain  flexibility  among  vehicle  roles  in  the  overall  system,  to  keep  costs  low,  and  to  
replace parts with ease, each vehicle should be  identical  to  the others  in  the system.   Each vehicle also must  
record  test  data  including  position  and  health  for  in-flight  analysis  and  for  post-test  analysis.    The  system  
must  respond  to  other  satellites  in  real-time  at  a  distance  of  at  least  two meters.   This will  demonstrate  the  
far  field  assumption.    The  vehicles will  not  be  able  to  respond  to  each  other  at  distances  greater  than  eight  
meters  due  to  the  size  of  the  testing  facility.    The  system must  respond  to  user  input  from  a  ground  station  
within  0.1  seconds.    To  demonstrate  autonomy,  each  vehicle  must  be  able  to  complete  without  further  
instruction  commands  that  it  receives.    Finally,  the  system  must  not  harm  itself,  the  testing  facility  or  any  
humans.  <GG, LS>   
  
0.4 Purpose  
  
The Project EMFFORCE Design Document  is  a written  report of  the preliminary  testbed design.   Although  the  
design  may  not  be  complete,  the  EMFFORCE  Team  has  identified  and  designed  for  high-risk  elements  in  the  
testbed.  <GG>

1  System Overview  
  
  
1.1 Visualization  
  
The EMFFORCE mission  is  to demonstrate  the feasibility of EMFF.   As discussed  in section 0,  the system will  
operate  in  three  degrees  of  freedom  on  a  flat  floor  testing  facility.    The  three  vehicles  in  the  cluster  will  be  
induced  to  rotate  about  a  common  center  of  mass  using  solely  electromagnetic  forces  and  reaction  wheel  
torques.    The  following  describes  the  contribution  of  each  subsystem  to  the  complete  EMFFORCE  testbed.  
<ESS>  

1.1.1  Actuation  

The  electromagnet  drives  the  entire  design.    It  is  by  far  the  heaviest  functional  component,  and  its mass  is  
about  the  same  as  that  of  all  remaining  structural  pieces  combined.    Increasing  the  mass  of  the  EM  core  
increases  the  available  force,  but  also  increases  the  force  required  to make  the  vehicle move.     Because  the  
electromagnetic  forces  generated  are  so  weak  relative  to  the  mass  required,  all  other  components  must  be  
optimized  for  minimum  mass,  and  enter  the  mass  equation  as  constants.    The  electromagnet  is  what  
characterizes  the  project  as  EMFF;  however,  ultimately  it  is  a  large  mass  of  metal  that  converts  a  current  
flow  into  a  change  in  the  local  magnetic  field.    There  is  still  much  more  to  accomplishing  the  mission.  
<ESS>  

The  reaction wheel assembly  (RWA)  serves  to counteract  the  torques generated by  the electromagnet.   This  
makes  the  system  feasible  to  control.    As  the  magnets  generate  forces  from  each  pole,  they  also  generate  
unwanted torques in the host vehicle.  The RWA converts this torque to angular momentum. <ESS>  

1.1.2  Formation Flight  

Forces and moments generated by  the actuators must be combined  into a coherent, stable, automatic control  
algorithm  that  keeps  the  vehicles  flying  in  formation.    The  control  subsystem  is  the  brain  of  the  entire  
system,  planning  its  movement  from  operator  input  and  making  corrections  as  the  vehicles  deviate  off-
course.    The  control  subsystem  must  know  the  state  of  all  three  vehicles  to  make  its  calculations.    The  
relative  positions  and  orientations  of  the  vehicles  are  measured  by  the  metrology  subsystem  through  a  
combination  of  ultrasonic  and  infrared  transmitters  and  receivers.    This  data  provides  the  input  for  the  
control subsystem. <ESS>  

1.1.3  Electronics  

Information  gathered  by  each  vehicle  needs  to  be  shared with  all  the  other vehicles  to promote consistency,  
and the control calculation must be made by one vehicle to promote stability.  In this highly coupled system,  
it would be impractical for each vehicle to operate independently, trying to guess what the others were going  
to  do  next.    The  communications  subsystem  serves  this  function,  sharing  data  between  all  vehicles  and  the  
ground  station  and  providing  synchronization  among  all  units.    These  three  information-based  subsystems  
need a solid base to rest upon.  None can exist by itself.  The avionics subsystem provides the computational  
power   needed   by   the   control   subsystem   and   the   link   between   the   metrology   and   communications  
subsystems.  It is the electronic backbone of the system. <ESS>

1.1.4  Power and Structure  

All of  the electronic components  require power.   The electromagnet  requires  the most, but without constant  
uninterrupted  power  to  every  component,  the  unstable  system would  quickly  go  out  of  control.   The  power  
subsystem  provides  regulated  uninterrupted  power  to  each  system  from  a  common  battery  source.    Finally,  
the system needs something to hold all its parts together.  The structure subsystem holds each piece in place.   
The  structure’s  air  carriage  component  reduces  friction with  the  environment.   As  the  electromagnets  react  
to   the   changing   magnetic   field   created   by   their   counterparts,   the   structure   moves   along   the   floor,  
demonstrating electromagnetic formation flight. <ESS>

1.2.1  Information Flowdown  
  
The  interfaces  between  subsystems  and  thus  the  required  inputs  and  outputs  from  each  subsystem  are  
summarized in Figure 1.2.1. <ESS>

The  actuation  system  includes  the  electromagnet  and  reaction  wheel  subsystems.    The  electromagnet  is  
designed  to  provide  the  electromagnetic  force  used  to  induce  the  spin-up of  the vehicles  in  formation.   The  
reaction   wheel   assembly   is   designed   to   provide   torque   to   counteract   the   torque   induced   by   the  
electromagnet.  Figure 2.1.2 shows two dipoles in a perpendicular orientation at a separation distance s.  The  
arrows  represent  the  direction  of  the  induced  forces  and  torques  on  the  dipoles.    Figure  2.1.3  depicts  the  
spin-up of  two dipoles  from an  initially perpendicular orientation.   As current  is applied  to  the dipoles,  they  
begin  to move  in  the  direction  of  the  induced  forces  and  torques.   The  reaction wheel  is  then used  to  apply  
torque  to  counteract  the  induced  torque.    This  applied  torque  is  then  decreased  until  the  dipoles  are  in  
steady-state rotation, aligned along the same axis. <MSW>

2.1.2   Purpose of Part  
  
The  amount  of  force  induced  by  the  electromagnet,  made  up  of  a  solenoid  coil  and  core  material,  is  
dependant upon the strength of its magnetic field.  The solenoid coil produces a magnetic field when current  
is  applied  to  it.   When  the  solenoid  is wrapped  around  a  ferromagnetic material,  this  core  has  the  effect  of  
multiplying the strength of the magnetic field.  <MSW>  

2.1.3   Interfacing  
  
The solenoid coil will be wrapped n times along the length of the ferromagnetic core.  
 

2.1.4   Trade Analysis 

 


For the electromagnet, trade analyses were conducted to determine the core material, core  
configuration, and mass of the core, coil, and system.  <MSW>  
  
2.1.4.1  Core Material  
  
One  of  the  main  focuses  of  the  EMFFORCE  project  is  to  optimize  the  amount  of  force  generated  by  the  
electromagnet while minimizing  its mass.   This  force  depends  upon  the  strength  of  the  induced magnetic  
field.     Therefore,   the  core  material  will  be  selected  based  on  magnetic  properties  that  provide  the  
maximum induced magnetic field at a minimum mass.  <MSW>  
  
When current is applied to a solenoid wrapped around a ferromagnetic core, a magnetic field, or B-field, is  
induced  on  the  core.  As  the  current  is  increased,  the  strength  of  the  B-field  increases  until  it  reaches  a  
strength  that  cannot  be  exceeded  with  increasing  current.    This  value  is  known  as  Bsaturation  for  a  given  
material.    Table  2.1.1  compares  the  values  for  Bsaturation   and  density  for  several  magnetic  materials.

This table lists the Bsaturation values and density for several ferromagnetic materials.  (taken from Dorf )   <MSW>  
  

  
Iron and steel have the highest values for Bsaturation of 2.15 and 2.10 Tesla respectively.  Both iron and steel  
have  the  same  density,  7.88  g/cm3,  which  is  the  lowest  among  the  magnetic  materials  considered.    High  
Bsaturation values combined with  lower densities are both desirable properties  to  increase  the strength of  the  
induced magnetic field while keeping the mass as low as possible.  <MSW>

Figure 2.1.4:  Iron and Steel - Induced Field vs. Applied Field  
This figure shows the relationship between the induced field [Tesla] 
and the applied field [Amps/m] for iron and steel.  

  
  
  
  
Figure  2.1.4  is  a  plot  of  induced  field  vs.  applied  field  for  iron  and  steel.    For  higher  values  of  applied  
field, both  iron and  steel  reach a Bsaturation point at approximately 2.1 Tesla.   However,  for  lower values of  
applied  field,  this  plot  shows  that  iron  has  higher  values  for  induced  field  than  steel.    This  is  important  
because  it  indicates  that  iron will  induce  a  larger magnetic  field  and  therefore  higher  levels  of  force  than  
steel at lower current levels.  <MSW>  
  
Another magnetic property  consideration  that must be  taken  into  account  is  the hysteresis effect.   When a  
magnetic material  is magnetized by  an  applied  field,  it will  not  completely demagnetize when  the applied  
field  is  reduced  to  zero.    In  order  to  bring  the  induced  field  back  to  zero,  a  field  must  be  applied  in  the  
opposite  direction.    The  strength  of  this  applied  field  is  called  the  coercive  force.   The  coercive  force  for  
iron  and  steel  are 79.6  and 143.2 Amps/m  respectively.   Therefore, hysteresis  is  less of an  issue with  iron  
since  it  requires  less  of  an  applied  force  in  the  opposite  direction  to  drive  the  induced  field  back  to  zero.  
<MSW>  
  
Recently,  another  possibility  for  the  electromagnet  core  was  discovered.    Hiperco  50A,  a  magnetic  alloy  
made  up  of  48.9%  Fe  and  49.0%  Co,  exhibits  better magnetic  properties  than  iron which was  previously  
the  best  choice  for  core  material.    Table  2.1.2  shows  that  Hiperco  50A  has  a  higher  value  of  maximum  
induced field and requires the same amount of applied field to counter the hysteresis effect. <MSW>

Figure  2.1.5  shows  the  relationship  between  induced  field  and  applied  field  for  Hiperco  50A  and  iron.   
Hiperco  50A  has  significantly  higher  values  for  induced  field  for  a  given  applied  current  than  iron.  
<MSW>  

At  the  time  of  this  design  document  publication,  more  analysis  needs  to  be  done  to  determine  whether  
Hiperco 50A  is a better choice  than iron for the electromagnet core material.  Initial analysis indicates that  
while Hiperco  50A  exhibits  better magnetic  properties  than  iron,  it will be  extremely  costly  to  the project  
and may exceed the electromagnet budget allocation.  There are very few distributors of Hiperco 50A, and  
it will be considerably more expensive to purchase and machine this material than iron. <MSW>

2.1.4.2  Configuration  
  
Several  preliminary  options  for  the  electromagnet  configurations were  considered.  Included  in  those were  
the  basic  dipole,  Y-pole  (3  legs),  L-pole  (2  legs  connected  at  their  ends),  and  X-pole  (4  perpendicular  
legs). All shown in figure 2.1.6-2.1.9. <JB>  

Figure 2.1.6:  Dipole  

Figure 2.1.7:  L-Pole  

Figure 2.1.8:  X-Pole  

Figure 2.1.9:  Y-Pole  

Before going  into  the  details  about  each  configuration,  it  is  important  to point out  the  requirements of  the  
system. The  reasoning will come  in  the  following  sections, but  for now  it can be assumed  that our system  
is driven by its mass. Thus, for a given configuration, if two magnets are at distance between zero and two  
meters, the mass should be minimized for a given force. <JB>  
  
Also  the  selected  configuration  needs  to  produce  the  least  amount  of  torque  for  a  given  force,  since  this  
excess  torque must be  transferred  to  the reaction wheel. The reaction wheel ’s mass will be proportional to  
the  amount  of  torque  that  needs  to  be  stored  in  it,  so  any  unnecessary  torques  on  the  system  should  be  
minimized. <JB>  
  
Finally, there is a requirement that the design of the electromagnet should make it easy to transition from a  
system  that works only  in  two dimensions  to a system that works in three dimensions. This means that the  
direction of the poles in the magnet must be able to change for the selected configuration. <JB>  
  
In order  to determine which configuration will satisfy  these goals, preliminary calculations were run and a  
modeling   software   called   “MagNet ”   was   used.   From   these   calculations,   the   following   table   was  
constructed. <JB>

 For each configuration, assignment goes from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best and 1 the poorest poerformance  
  
In  addition  to  the  most  important  trades  summarized  in  the  table,  there  are  some  additional  arguments  
against using the L-pole and the X-pole. <JB>  
  
The  L-pole  has  a  center  of  mass  problem  and  would  produce  adverse  torque  that  would  have  to  be  
countered  by  the  reaction  wheel;  this  problem  is  caused  because  the  forces  on  the  system  would  not  be  
acting  through  the  system ’s   center  of  mass.    The  X-pole  was  eliminated  due  to  the  fact  that  the  mass  
would have to be distributed to 4 legs.  Energizing one of these legs would only be utilizing ¼ of the mass  
that would be used in the single dipole situation and would not produce a large enough force.  
  
As mentioned  before,  these  are  preliminary  calculations,  and  they must be  supported with more modeling  
and more testing. However, the choice is now between the Y-pole and the dipole. <JB>  
  
In  order  to  determine  whether  to  use  a  dipole  or  a  Y-pole,  it  will  be  necessary  to  compare  them  closely,  
with the help of the modeling software and some tests. <JB>  
  
Two  simulations  were  carried  out  on  the  modeling  software.  In  both  simulations  each  configuration  has  
the same volume and mass. The first simulation was with two Y-poles separated by a distance of 2 meters;  
one leg on each Y-pole was energized with a current of 6 amps and 1200 turns of wire. The energized legs  
were perpendicular to each other. See figure 2.1.10. <JB>

For  the dipole simulation,  two dipoles were used, separated by a distance of 2 meters and perpendicular to  
each other. Both were energized with a current of 6 amps and 1200 turns of wire. See figure 2.1.11. <JB>

From the results, the following conclusions could be made:   
  
It was originally believed that the dipole would generate a greater force for a given mass, because for a set  
core mass,  it utilizes  the entire core. Also,  the Y-pole would not energize  the entire core mass at one  time  
and thus it would  “waste” some mass. Since the force is what drives the satellites to spin up this was a key  
feature that needed to be checked. <JB>  
  
After  running  the  simulation,  it  turns  out  that  the  Y-pole  magnetizes  the  remaining  ends  that  are  not  
energized  and  the  amount  of  force  generated  is  greater. This  can  be  explained  through  figures  2.1.10  and  
2.1.11, which show that the legs on the first Y-pole (that are not energized) are closer to the second Y-pole  
legs (that are not energized) than are the two dipoles ’ main cores. <JB>

Figure 2.1.11: Dipole  
simulation from MagNet
  

  
For  the  transition  to  3D  requirement,  it was  determined  that  the  dipole  cannot  change  the  direction  of  its  
poles  in  any  direction.  The  Y-pole,  on  the  other  hand,  is  more  versatile  and  more  translatable  into  3D  
applications.    This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  Y-pole  magnetic  field  direction  can  vary  by  changing  the  
amount  of  current  energizing  each  of  its  legs.    This  would  decrease  the  time  it  would  take  to  rotate  the  
electromagnet  to  a  desired  alignment  using  the  reaction  wheel.  The  Y-pole  configuration,  however,  also  
generates  a  greater  adverse  torque  than  the  dipole,  which  would  have  to  be  counteracted  by  the  reaction  
wheel, making it bigger. <JB>  
  
Summarizing,  the Y-pole  simulation  showed  a greater  force  than  the dipole  configuration, yet  it produces  
more  unnecessary  torque.  The Y-pole  performs  better  in  transition  to  3D  and  has  a  less mass  for  a  given  
force  than  the  dipole  configuration. However,  the  torque  produced  by  the Y-pole  configuration  is  greater  
than the torque produced by the dipole configuration; in other words the dipole performs better in terms of  
minimizing the amount of torque for a given core mass. <JB>  
  
Although  it  seems  that  the  Y-pole  would  be  the  best  configuration,  this  cannot  be  determined  yet.  For  
example,  the  torque on  the  electromagnets  could be more  important  than  the  force on  the  electromagnets,

in  which  case  the  performance  of  the  Y-pole  and  the  dipole  could  change.  Since  this  is  unknown,  more  
tests must be run to find out what are the relations between these factors.  <JB>  
  
Another consideration  that would be worth considering  is an  improved dipole configuration, consisting of  
the dipole mounted on a rotating disk, so  that  the direction of  the poles could be changed  just as easy as it  
is  done  with  the  Y-pole.  The  only  disadvantage  of  doing  this  is  that  it  would  make  the  dynamics  of  the  
system more complicated, but this is something that is definitely worth considering, since it could turn out  
that this configuration is better than the other two.  

2.1.4.3  Core and System Mass 

 

The  driving  parameter  for  this  design  problem  is  mass.  Increases  in  total  system  mass  quickly  ripple  
through  the  system  causing  increases  in  the  size  of  the  electromagnet,  power  system,  and  structure.  
Therefore  the  design  of  the  electromagnet  was  conducted  with  the  intention  of  working  at  the  minimum  
system mass for a given system performance (i.e. separation distance and spin rate).   
  
In order  to design  the magnet  size,  a mathematical model of  the  system was developed. The  total mass of  
the system is given as:  
  

mtot  (cid:2)(cid:5)mcore  (cid:1)(cid:5)mcoil 
(cid:1)(cid:5)m
(cid:1)(cid:5)m 
o    
power 
Equation 2.1.1: Total Mass Equation  

  

  

where the terms are the total mass of the system, the mass of the magnetic core, the mass of the coil of the  
magnet, the mass of the power system, and the initial system mass respectively.   
  
For  the  time  being  the  system  has  only  been  analyzed  for  the  steady-state  spin  mode,  as  seen  in  Figure  
2.1.10.  In  this mode,  the  electromagnets must  provide  a  force  that  is  equal  and opposite  to  the  centripetal  
force of the system.

magnetic  field,  H.  The  relationship  for  the  mass  of  the  battery  is  defined  based  on  the  available  battery  
parameters  and  can  be  found  in  Appendix  B.  These  equations  define  the  necessary  parameters  to  model  
the  system.  The  only  effect  that  is  left  out  of  the  model  is  the  effect  of  system  mass  on  the  mass  of  the  
required  structure.  This  is  incorporated  into  mo, which  has  been  assumed  to  be  a  constant  for  the  current

This  model  has  been  incorporated  in  a  Mathematica  script,  which  can  be  run  to  find  the  optimum  
operating masses for  the system. This script is included as Appendix B at the end of the document. Before  
the  results of  this design are  finalized  there are a  few more  factors which must be  incorporated. First,  it  is  
important  to  get  detailed  material  properties  for  the  core  and  coil.  This  includes  B-H  curve  data  for  the  
core material. Also,  the model does not yet  include an accurate  trade between current and number of wire  
wraps. This  trade  essentially  is  a  trade  between  coil mass  and battery mass  for  a given  amount of  applied  
magnetic field. With a little more time it will not be difficult to adapt the script to incorporate this trade.   
  
Preliminary  calculations  have  the  mass  of  the  core  at  approximately  6.5  kg  and  the  total  mass  of  the  
system at 15 kg. The goal is to reduce the mass as the optimization of the system design continues.

2.1.5   External Interfacing Needs  
  
The  electromagnet  will  need  a  physical  interface  with  the  structure  system  where  it  can  mount  to  the  
vehicle.  The  system will  also  need  an  interface  from  the  power  subsystem where  the  necessary  current  can  
be  applied  to  the  magnet  coil.  The  power  interface  will  occur  on  some  type  of  voltage  switch,  which  is  
controlled  by  the  algorithm  of  the  control  group  through  the  required  avionics  systems  and  is  given  power  
from the vehicles power supply. This switch will then supply the desired current to the electromagnet coil.

2.1.6   Budgets Estimates  
 

These estimates come from the calculations and from the assumptions explained before.

2.1.7   Conclusion  
  
The electromagnet will be composed of a coil and a core. The coil configuration will depend directly on  the  
core  and  system  analysis.  The  core material  has  not  being  set  between Hiperco  50A  and  Iron.  For  the  core  
configuration  there  is  still  more  testing  and  simulations  to  be  completed.  Basically,  tests  for  these  two  
parameters need to be carried out in order to make a decision.  
  
The  most  important  conclusion  from  the  electromagnet  subsystem  design  is  that  the  success  of  the  system  
will depend on reducing mass while still fulfilling the necessary requirements.

2.2  Reaction Wheel Assembly  
  

2.2.1  Subsystem Overview  

 

Both  the electromagnet and  reaction wheel  teams are  responsible  for  the  spin-up of  the system  to  the steady  
state configuration.   The reaction wheel assembly (RWA)  is an  integral part of  the spin-up process.   Figures  
2.2.1 and 2.2.2, below, depict the process of spin-up.  <LLW>

Figure 2.2.2:  Spin-up Configuration  
Path of dipoles from initial configuration to steady state.  

  
Figure  2.2.1  shows  the  initial  configuration  of  the  dipoles.    The  dipoles  begin  perpendicular  to  each  other.   
Figure  2.2.2  depicts  the  two  dipoles  as  they  begin  to  spin  up.    As  soon  as  a  current  is  applied  to  the  
electromagnets,  forces  and moments  are  induced  in  the dipoles.   The moments  are due  to  the perpendicular  
geometry  of  the  system  at  this  point.    These  moments  must  be  counteracted  by  applied  torque  from  the  

33  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

reaction wheels.   The dipoles  initially move in the directions of their respective net forces.  As they begin to  
move,  the  applied  torque  from  the  reaction wheel  is  decreased  to  induce  centripetal motion.   As  centripetal  
force  increases,  the  applied  torque  continuously  decreases,  allowing  the  rotating  dipoles  to  slowly  align  
along  the  same  axis.    At  the  point  when  no  more  applied  torque  is  necessary,  the  dipoles  are  perfectly  
aligned  and  the  centripetal  force  is  equal  to  the magnetic  force.   At  this  point,  the  system  is  in  steady  state  
rotation.  Figure 2.2.2 shows the process of spin-up.  <LLW>  
  
The  RWA  must  provide  the  necessary  torque  to  balance  the  forces  and  moments  that  are  produced  by  the  
electromagnets.  The assembly is powered by a motor, which drives the reaction wheel.  The spinning wheel  
then  stores  the  system ’s  angular momentum,  balancing  the  system,  and  guiding  the  system  through  spin-up  
to steady state rotation.  <LLW>

The purpose of  the RWA  is  to use  stored angular momentum  to control  the  system.   The application of  this  
purpose  is  twofold.    First,  the  RWA  must  guide  the  system  to  a  steady  state  configuration  during  spin-up.   
Second,  it  must  keep  the  system  in  the  steady  state  configuration  during  the  remainder  of  operation  by  
making needed adjustments to account for frictional forces acting upon the vehicle.  <LLW>  
  
2.2.3   RWA Internal Interfacing  
  
As  shown  in  the  flow  chart  above,  the  RWA  is  composed  of  the  reaction wheel  and  a motor  that  provides  
power  to  drive  the  wheel.    The  reaction  wheel  consumes  power  mainly  when  it  is  providing  torque  to  
balance  the  system.    This  takes  place  during  the  spin-up  process.    For  the  remainder  of  operation,  the  
reaction  wheel   requires  only  small  amounts  of  power  from   the  motor   to  correct  for  friction  effects.   
Therefore,  once  the  system  has  reached  the  steady  state,  the  RWA  is  fairly  independent  with  respect  to  
inputs from the rest of the system.  <LLW>  
  
The  motor  for  the  RWA  is  not  yet  selected,  as  it  depends  on  the  final  design  of  the  reaction  wheel.    The  
analysis  in  this  document  provides  estimates  for  the  mass  of  the  reaction wheel  and  the  power  required  by  
the reaction wheel.   However,  the design of  the actuation subsystem  is not finalized at  this time.  The motor  
will be selected concurrently with the other parts comprising the actuation subsystem.  <LLW>

2.2.4   RWA Trade Analysis  

The  trade  analysis  for  the RWA  involves  four main  issues.   The  first  is  the  selection of  the material used  to  
manufacture the reaction wheel.  The second is the method of production for the reaction wheel  – building a  
wheel  versus  buying  a  pre-manufactured  wheel.    The  remaining  analysis  is  dedicated  first  to  deriving  
preliminary estimates for  the mass and size of the reaction wheel, and second to deriving an estimate for the  
power consumption of the motor in order to function under operational conditions.  <LLW>  
  
2.2.4.1   Reaction Wheel Material Selection  
  
The  material  selection  for  the  EMFFORCE  reaction  wheel  is  more  complicated  than  the  typical  material  
selection  process  for  a  reaction wheel.   Steel  is  the  standard material  used  for  reaction wheels.   However,  
due  to  the  specialized  nature  of  the  EMFFORCE  project,  the  RWA  team  has  selected  aluminum  as  the  
reaction  wheel  material.    The  use  of  a  non-magnetic  material  prevents  interaction  of  the  reaction  wheel  
with  the  magnetic  field.    Plastics  were  also  considered  as  a  possible  reaction  wheel  material.    However,  
the  higher  density  of  aluminum  makes  it  favorable  over  plastics.    A  higher  density  material  allows  for  a  
reaction  wheel  with  a  smaller  radius.    The  size  of  the  EMFFORCE  vehicles  depends  on  the  size  of  the  
electromagnet  and  the  size  of  the  reaction  wheel.    Since  these  sizes  are  codependent,  it  is  favorable  to  
minimize reaction wheel radius, thereby decreasing the minimum size of the vehicles.  <LLW>  
 
  
2.2.4.2   Reaction Wheel Manufacturing  

Commercial  suppliers  of  reaction  wheels  machine  wheels  for  full-scale  spaceflight  applications.    These  
reaction  wheels  are  machined  to  the  specifications  of  the  buyer  on  an  individual  basis,  and  are  therefore  
very  expensive.    In  addition,  these  reaction  wheels  are  sized  for  real  space  applications.    EMFFORCE  
needs reaction wheels on a much smaller scale.  The RWA team has chosen to machine reaction wheels to  
the EMFFORCE project specifications rather than buy a pre-made wheel.  <LLW>  
  
2.2.4.3   Reaction Wheel Mass and Size Estimates  
  
The role of the reaction wheel is to balance the system by providing a counter torque during the spin-up of  
the  system.   Therefore,  the  angular momentum  stored  in  the  reaction wheels  of  all  the vehicles  combined  
must be equal to the angular momentum of the system, but in the opposite direction.    
 


(cid:2) (cid:1)nH RW

Equation 2.2.1:  Angular Momentum Balance  

  
Equation 2.2.1 gives the angular momentum balance for the system, where Hcluster and HRW are the angular  
momentums of  the cluster and  reaction wheel,  respectively, and n  is  the number of vehicles present  in  the  
cluster.   For  this  analysis,  it  is  assumed  that  there  are only  two vehicles  in  the cluster.   This  is  to  simplify  
the  analysis,  allowing  the  derivation  of  preliminary  estimates.    Both  the  cluster  and  the  reaction  wheel  
obey the definition for angular momentum, where omega ((cid:3)) is the rate of rotation of the cluster:

The  moment  of  inertia  due  to  each  vehicle  in  the  cluster  is  a  sum  of  the  vehicle’s moment  of  inertia  (I 0)  
and the moment of inertia the vehicle contributes to the system.  The moment of inertia of the cluster (I) is  
this  vehicular  moment  of  inertia  multiplied  by  the  number  of  vehicles, which  is  here  assumed  to  be  two.   
For this analysis each vehicle is modeled as a cylinder of uniform density.

Equation 2.2.3:  Cluster Moment of Inertia  
  
For  the  purposes  of  modeling,  the  reaction  wheel  is  assumed  to  be  a  combination  of  a  flat  disk  and  a  
circular  ring.    It  is  optimal  to  have  as  much  of  the  reaction  wheel  mass  as  possible  at  the  radius  of  the  
wheel.   However,  this outside  “ring” must be connected with a thin plate so that the reaction wheel can be  
attached to a shaft.  A rough cross section of the reaction wheel is shown in Figure 2.2.4 below.

The reaction wheel team has selected a radius of 0.2 m for the reaction wheel.  This radius comes from the  
most  recent  estimates  for  the  electromagnet.    The  electromagnet  has  a  length  of  approximately  0.5  m.   
This  yields  a  vehicle  radius  of  approximately 0.25 m.   To  allow  the RWA  to  fit within  the dimensions of

the  vehicle,  the  reaction wheel  radius  is  set  at 0.2 m.   The  above  analysis yields  a  reaction wheel mass of  
approximately 0.16 kg.  This is a reasonable mass estimate for the EMFFORCE system.  <LLW>  
  
2.2.4.4   RWA Power Estimate  
  
The  reaction  wheel  requires  power  mainly  while  it  is  in  the  process  of  providing  torque  to  balance  the  
system.    For  the  remainder  of  the  operations  period,  it  requires  minimal  power  to  overcome  the  force  of  
friction while  spinning.   The  following  power  analysis  only  addresses  the  power  required  during  spin-up.   
This is a reasonable approximation for a required power estimate.  
  
The power required by the reaction wheel is proportional to the torque applied by the reaction wheel:  
  

PRW  (cid:2)(cid:15)mag (cid:3) RW    
Equation 2.2.8:  Reaction Wheel Required Power  
  
The  torque,  (cid:15)mag,  is  the  torque  induced  by  the  dipole.   This  torque  is  given  by  the  expression  in Equation  
2.2.9, where (cid:16)A is the magnetic moment of a given dipole and B is the magnetic field induced by a dipole.

here  as (cid:16)B.   The expression  for B  is given  in Equation 2.2.10.   x  is a distance parameter, which  is defined  
as the distance from the center of the dipole to a point in the field, B.

Using  the  parameters  given  in  Equation  2.2.13  yields  a  power  estimate  of  13  W.    This  is  a  worst-case  
estimate.    This  estimate  assumes  that  the  reaction wheel  is  already  spinning  before  it  provides  the  torque  
to  balance  spin-up.    This  case  requires  more  power  than  only  spinning  up  the  reaction  wheel  when  it  is  
needed.  <LLW>

The  reaction wheel  is  to be manufactured by project EMFFORCE and not by an outside manufacturer.   The  
current mass  estimate  for  the wheel  is 0.16 kg, with an estimated  radius of 0.2 m.   The RWA will  require a  
power supply of approximately 13 W.  <LLW>  

2.2.6   External Interfacing Needs  
  
The  RWA  requires  external  interfacing  with  the  Power  and  Structure  subsystems.    A  power  supply  is  
required  to  operate  the  motor  that  drives  the  reaction  wheel.    Interfacing  with  the  Structure  subsystem  is  
necessary to secure the RWA to the vehicle in a manner in which it may spin freely.  <LLW>

from the metrology subsystem and compares the current state with the desired state.  It then outputs  
commands, in the form of an output voltage, to the actuators to adjust the current state to match the  
desired one.  The output voltages are fed through the power system, which powers the actuators. <BAB>

There are two different actuators to control the system, the electromagnets and the reaction wheels.  The  
electromagnets can provide forces and torques along the three degrees of freedom in which the vehicles  
operate (x, y, and (cid:1)).  Unfortunately, since the forces produced by the electromagnet cannot be  
independently controlled, there is also need for a reaction wheel.  The reaction wheel produces a torque  
about the (cid:1) axis and it provides the opportunity to place the electromagnet ’s magnetic poles.  It is with  
these two actuators that all controlling forces will be produced. <BAB>

       5/16/2002  

The requirements for the controller are derived from the requirements document. The main requirement  
is to create a robust controller.  This implies both rejecting any disturbance force that the formation may  
encounter and having enough control authority to reposition satellites within the formation.  <LS>  
  
To demonstrate a robust controller, the system must execute three maneuvers:  spin-up, steady state spin,  
and spin-down.  The spin-up maneuver consists of controlling three vehicles initially at rest in a straight  
line with perpendicular magnetic fields (See Figure 2.3.3) to follow a specified trajectory to the steady  
state configuration.  In steady state spin the cluster is spinning about the center vehicle with an angular  
rotation rate of at least 1 RPM.  This configuration has all three magnetic fields lined up along a  
common axis. Spin-down follows the same trajectory as spin-up in reverse. From the steady state the  
system will gradually cause its magnetic fields to be perpendicular so as to stop the clusters motion.  
These maneuvers are further developed in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3. <LS>  
  

  

Figure 2.3.3 Three Vehicle Spin-Up  

Figure 2.3.4 Three Vehicle Steady State  

  

  

  

  

The last requirement determines the control tolerance.  Derived from the accuracy of our analysis, the  
maximum displacement error allowed is one tenth of the separation distance between two adjacent  
vehicles.  For the specified maneuver, the maximum displacement error should not exceed 20 cm. <LS>  
 
  
2.3.2  Steady State Mode  
  

2.3.2.1  Definition of Steady State Mode  
  
After the vehicles have completed the spin-up maneuver, they should complete three revolutions in  
steady state mode.  The steady state mode defines the control algorithm for this system maneuver.  The  
steady state mode will seek to decrease the error between the desired separation distance and the actual  
separation distance.  Since the purpose of the steady state mode is to keep the vehicles in configuration,  
this controller will mostly reject disturbances.  To design a controller, the system must first be analyzed.   
Since the force from the electromagnets is axial then it is necessary to analyze the axial dynamics of the  
system. <LS>  
  
First, a system model must be developed.  Force balance and perturbation analyses are used to find the  
dominant poles of the system.  In this mode, the forces acting on the system are the electromagnetic  
forces from each electromagnet, and the centripetal force due to rotation.  For a configuration with three  
vehicles where (cid:3)A = (cid:3)B = (cid:3)C = (cid:3)avg, the forces are:

 Discussion of Trades Analysis  

Different approaches can be used to design the controller to stabilize the steady state mode.  Two  
different control approaches were explored, phase lead and state space.

2.3.2.2.1 Phase Lead Controller  
  
One approach is a phase lead control.  A pair of students, Farmey Joseph and Richard Cross, in  
MIT’s Aeronautical and Astronautical department ’s junior design project class, 16.62x, explored  
a system with a similar model as the steady state mode model found above, and implemented a  
phase lead controller to stabilize the system.  <LS>  
  
Their setup consisted of a linear air track and two magnets.  Originally, both magnets were to be  
electromagnets that would glide on the air track and be controlled through current regulation.  
Due to a miscalculation, the electromagnetic forces produced were not strong enough to  
demonstrate control.  Therefore, the free magnet was replaced with a permanent magnet.   
<BAB>  
  
With the 16.62x system, there are two different possible setups, one stable and one unstable.  The  
16.62x students examined the stable setup, in which the air track is raised on one end and the  
electromagnet is fixed at the other end.  The electromagnet must repel the permanent magnet to  
maintain a fixed separation distance.  The arrows indicate the direction of the magnets ’ north  
poles.  

Figure 2.3.6 16.62x Stable Setup  
  
The stable system is modeled in Appendix C.2.1. The dominant system poles are found to be

The actual poles were found to be at plus and minus 1.5i.  A phase lead controller was  
implemented with a pole at -20, a zero at -2, and a gain of 0.5.  This effectively reduced the  
oscillations of the system when a step was introduced.  The controller provided a damping ratio  
of 0.11.  There was some error, however, which was due to sensor noise. <LS>  

  
Figure 2.3.9 Controlled Step Response of Stable Setup  

Another possible setup with the linear air track demonstrates the unstable case.  To create this  
setup, the air track is raised on the same side as the fixed electromagnet.  To maintain a fixed

separation distance, the fixed electromagnet must attract the free permanent magnet to maintain a  
fixed separation distance.

poles are found to be at  (cid:10)(cid:2)

 

  

  
Figure 2.3.11 Root Locus of Unstable System  

  

The 16.62x students did not implement a controller for the unstable system, so the EMMFORCE  
controls team designed a controller in SISOTOOL in MATLAB.  A phase lead controller, similar  
to the one used in the stable setup, was used, with a pole at  –20, a zero at –3, and a gain of 30.   
This gives a damping ratio of about 0.68.  The step response shows a small steady state error, but  
the system stabilizes quickly, within about 1 second.  The overshoot is small, with no

Using modern control techniques the closed loop poles for cost efficient controllers can be  
found.  The following derivation is performed in more detail in Appendix C.3.  To develop this  
controller, a cost function is created to weigh the importance of different parameters.  Rxx is  
defined as a two by two matrix that allows one to penalize differences in separation or velocity  
of the vehicles.  Ruu is a scalar that describes the cost of using control.  Because the controller  
commands power to be supplied to the actuators, controlling the system has a cost of power.  The  
cost function weighs the importance of accuracy in positioning the satellites with the limited  
resource of power.  <LS>

the ratio  (cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:2)(cid:20) is evaluated from  0 (cid:23) (cid:18)(cid:2), a graph of the closed loop poles for the most efficient

When the ratio is zero, use of control is infinitely expensive and the poles are both located at – (cid:5).   
When the ratio is infinity, use of control is infinitely cheap.  The location of the closed loop poles  
move out to infinity along the 45(cid:24) asymptote, where the damping ratio is 0.707. <LS>  

Summary Of Options/Selection Criteria   

Both methods of developing a controller provide beneficial information.  The phase lead approach will  
most likely be simpler to calculate and easier to analyze with the current knowledge of the EMFORCE  
controls team.  Though it is more complicated, the state space approach allows greater focus on the  
important factors of cost and accuracy.  For a preliminary control design, the classic control technique of  
phase lead controllers will be implemented.  For a final control design, the state space approach may be  
used. <LS>  
  
2.3.3  Spin-up/Spin-down Mode  

2.3.3.1  Definition of Spin-up/Spin-down  
  
When starting from rest, the vehicles must perform a spin-up maneuver to reach steady state spin.  After  
three steady state revolutions, the vehicles must perform a spin-down maneuver to return to rest.   These  
maneuvers are similar and will be modeled and controlled by similar means.  The spin-up/spin-down  
mode defines the control algorithm for these system maneuvers.  This controller will try to move the  
vehicles, initially at rest, along some pre-defined trajectory to the steady state spin configuration (See  
Figure 2.3.14).  To design a controller, the system must first be analyzed.  Since this mode involves  
mostly electromagnetic torques and translational forces, these system dynamics must be analyzed.  
<BAB>  
  
Initially the three vehicles will be positioned on the test bed at the appropriate separation distances with  
the magnetic fields perpendicular to each other.  The effects of this configuration are that the magnets  
experience a shearing force, shown in the following figure by straight arrows, and a torque, shown by  
the curved arrows. <BAB>

This figure depicts two vehicles, but the same forces apply with three or more vehicles.  When these  
forces and torques are controlled to follow a specified trajectory, the electromagnets can be caused to  
move from rest to orbiting about a midpoint.  This trajectory, for three vehicles, is depicted below:  

  

  
Figure 2.3.15 Three Vehicle Spin-up Trajectory  
  
When spinning up, the vehicles will experience disturbances.  Any number of disturbances can cause  
one or more vehicles to translate.  Therefore it is important to take into account the translational forces  
of two electromagnets with perpendicular magnetic fields.  As shown below, the translated vehicles  
motion will be governed by a translational force that changes depending on the translated distance.  This  
line of motion is broken into three regimes.  If a magnet is disturbed past a critical distance in either  
direction, then the translational force will change direction. <BAB>

       5/16/2002  

At the critical points, where the translational forces change direction, the magnitude of the force is zero,  
making them equilibrium points.  To locate the points, the translational force must be calculated for a  
given displaced distance.  The translational force is a function of the angles of each electromagnet ’s  
magnetic field to the axis that runs between them.  As one magnet becomes more and more displaced  
these angles change.  The angles are defined as follows:

movement of the vehicle.  This analysis defines the movement of the vehicles in any regime, as shown

There is a trade between the two possible spin-up configurations.  
  

Figure 2.3.19 Spin-up Configuration 1  

  
  

Figure 2.3.20 Spin-up Configuration 2  

  

The basis for this trade lies in the fact that the forces and moments on each magnet are not equal.  As  
shown in the following figure, due to the geometry of the configuration -- mainly that the separation  
distance, s, significantly larger than the half length of the electromagnetic core -- the torques are  
different on each vehicle. <BAB>  

Figure 2.3.21 Unequal Torques on Vehicles  

  

In this configuration, the torque felt by magnet B is greater than the force felt on magnet A.  If a  
straight-line force between the poles is assumed, it is seen that the angle at which the force reaches the  
poles on magnet B approaches 90(cid:24)(cid:2) and the angle at which the force reaches the poles on magnet A is  
closer to zero.  Since torque is the product of the force and the sine of the angle, the torque on magnet B  
is much greater than the torque on magnet A. <BAB>

Because the torques are not equal on each vehicle, there is a trade between the two configurations in  
figures 2.3.19 and 2.3.20.  
 

2.3.3.3  Summary of Options/Selection Criteria 

 

Since the torque on the vertically aligned magnets is greater than the torque on the horizontally aligned  
magnets, it follows that the initial positions of the magnets is important.  In the configuration of figure  
2.3.20, the center magnet feels half the torque of the outer one; its torque is then doubled due to the  
other outer vehicle producing an even distribution of moments among the three vehicles.  In figure  
2.3.19, the center magnet feels twice the torque of the outer one, which is then doubled due to the  
existence of the other outer vehicle.  Therefore, the center magnet feels four times the amount of torque  
as compared to the outer ones. <BAB>  
  
The amount of torque on a vehicle determines the amount of counter-torque the reaction wheel will have  
to exert for control.   If the torque is concentrated in one vehicle then this vehicle will have to have a  
larger reaction for adequate control.  On the other hand, a large center vehicle means that more of the  
system mass is concentrated at the center leading to less cluster angular momentum thus less total  
reaction wheel angular momentum.  Less reaction wheel angular momentum means that the reaction  
wheels can be smaller, which affects the electromagnet size.  A larger center vehicle also allows for a  
larger central magnet, therefore a stronger central magnetic field.  The result of a larger central magnetic  
field is that the system can operate with lighter outer vehicles, at greater separation distance, and/or at  
greater angular velocity.  A large center vehicle with smaller outer vehicles, unfortunately violates our  
interchangeability requirement.  This requirement stipulates that all three vehicles must be the same.   
The interchangeability requirement favors the configuration of figure 2.3.20, since this configuration  
more evenly distributes the angular momentum among the three vehicles, leading to the smallest  
possible reaction wheels, thus lighter-weight vehicles. <BAB>  
  
Because the requirements must be met, the configuration of figure 2.3.20 is the feasible configuration.   
However, if the requirements change, the configuration may change to that of figure 2.3.19. <LS>  

  
2.3.4  Control Architecture  
  
2.3.4.1  Definition of Control Architecture  
  
The control subsystem must know what mode to control, steady state or spin-up/spin-down.  It then must  
know how to implement the correct control for the determined mode.  There are different methods of  

53  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

processing the sensor data and issuing response commands.  The control architecture determines the  
desired trajectory and implements the appropriate controller.   It also determines the manner of  
communicating the control instructions. <LS>  
  
2.3.4.2  Discussion of Trades Analysis  
  
The main trade for control architecture is the location of the controller within the entire system.   Three  
options were analyzed. These were independent, centralized control, and hybrid control. <LS>  
  
With independent control, the vehicles each collect and process data to derive a control solution for each  
separate vehicle.  Because each vehicle will be processing and responding to its own data, the response  
time will be very quick.  The main disadvantage, however, of independent control is conflict with  
multiple vehicles controlling the same disturbance.  The system is coupled, therefore, when one vehicle  
moves, it affects the others.  It will be very difficult to implement independent control with each vehicle  
impacting the state of the others. <LS>  
  
In centralized control, all of the information from metrology will be sent to a hub vehicle.  The hub  
would calculate the control solution and send the commands to the other vehicles.  This is a good  
solution to the problem of a coupled system.  With only one vehicle making decisions, there is no  
conflict with vehicles responding to other vehicles.  However, there is a significant time delay associated  
with a centralized controller.  Having a hub run calculations and then send commands to other vehicles  
slows down the response time. <LS>  
  
The last form of control is hybrid control.  In this case, all three vehicles will possess the ability to  
control independently.  In times when a quick response is needed, independent control will be  
implemented.  The system will also be capable of controlling through a hub vehicle in cases where  
timing is not as crucial or the coupled effects of using electromagnetic actuation jeopardize adequate  
control.  <LS>  
  
2.3.4.3  Summary Of Options/Selection Criteria   
  
Neither independent control nor centralized control is very feasible to use separately. The effects of  
being a coupled system are too large to use only independent control, and response time will most likely  
not be quick enough if a hub did all of the calculations.  Therefore, the best option is to implement a  
hybrid control system.  When timing is crucial, independent control will be implemented.  At all other  
times, a centralized controller will process the data and issue the commands to the other vehicles.  <LS>  
  
  
2.3.5  External Interfacing Needs  
  
The control subsystem is located within the avionics subsystem.  It is programmed onto the avionics  
processor.  In this way, it interfaces with avionics.  
  
The controller will need inputs from metrology of the current state.  This will include at least the  
separation distance, the vehicles relative bearing, and the relative angles of the electromagnets ’ poles.

Other inputs that will not be required, but helpful in implementing control are the velocity and acceleration  
of the vehicles.  
  
After calculating the control algorithms, the control subsystem will output commands to the power  
subsystem.  These commands will indicate how much power needs to be supplied to the actuators. <LS>  
  
2.3.6  Budgets  
  
The control subsystem has no mass or power budget because it is only software on the avionics processor.   
A budget of $500 has been allocated to the control subsystem, however, to cover the cost of maintenance  
of lab equipment that will be used for preliminary testing. <LS>  
  
2.3.7  Conclusions  

The control design is central to building a successful system.  Indeed, as stated in the mission statement, it  
is what the system is attempting to show is feasible.  Unfortunately the controller design is not  
straightforward.  As has been mentioned, the control problem is unstable and the main actuator, the  
electromagnet, produces forces and torques that are coupled.  Through careful analysis the system ’s  
dynamics can become well understood and certain trades can be made leading to possible control designs.

2.4  Metrology  
  
  

Fig 2.4.1  Metrology Block Diagram  

  
Extracted  from  the  requirements  of  the  overall  project,  the  goal  of  the  metrology  system  is  to  accurately  
calculate  relative distance  and  attitude.   Per  the  requirements document, accurately  is defined as 1/10 of  the  
control  tolerance  for both  distance  and  angular  readings.    In addition,  the metrology  system needs  to have a  
field  of  view  of  360º  in  a  2-D  plane.    Finally,  the  system  needs  a  detection  range  compatible  with  test  
facilities.   These  test  facilities  include  the  test  facility at MIT and  the Lockheed flat floor facility  in Denver,  
CO. <OM>  

  

  
2.4.2  System Trade Analysis  
  
The  initial  trade  analysis  for  the metrology  subsystem was  to  compare  sonic  ranging  systems,  indoor GPS,  
and  inertial  navigation.    Sonic  ranging  may  be  implemented  in  many  ways.    In  the  current  incarnation,  the  
sonic  system uses  time differences between  transmitted  sonic  signals  to  triangulate  the position of a vehicle  
(this  is  explained  in much  greater  detail  in  the  design  section  below).    Inertial  navigation  uses  velocity  and  
acceleration  information  from  rate  gyros  and  accelerometers  to  calculate  the  position  of  a  vehicle.    The  
second  derivative  of  acceleration  gives  linear  position  and  the  first  derivative  of  angular  rate  gives  angular  
orientation.   The  indoor GPS  system  is very  similar  to  the  current design  for  the  sonic  system except  that  it  
uses radio frequency. Indoor GPS relies on several radio frequency antennas.  The system measures the time  
difference between incoming RF signals to triangulate position. <APA>  

56  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

  
The metrology  team could not  find substantial  technical  information on  the  indoor GPS system.   It was also  
assumed  that  the  system  would  require  more  computational  cycles  than  the  other  systems  since  it  was  
assumed  that  the  RF  interface  would  be  more  complicated.    Additionally,  the  RF  signals  are  prone  to  
interference  from  the electromagnet.   For  these reasons  the  indoor GPS system was deemed  infeasible.   The  
inertial  navigation  system  seemed well  suited  to our purposes; however,  it also  seemed  to  require excessive  
computational   power.      Also,   inertial   navigation   systems   may   experience   unacceptable   drift.      Each  
experiment  is expected  to  run  for approximately 5 minutes.     Accelerometers with sufficiently  low drift rate  
to  meet  this  time  requirement  are  prohibitively  expensive.    A  sonic  system  is  very  desirable  because  there  
are   many   people   within   the   department   who   have   experience   with   sonic   ranging.      SPHERES   has  
demonstrated  and  documented  one  functional  system  for  sonic  ranging.    Also  the  Virtual  Ink  Corporation  
has developed an electronic whiteboard system (Mimio) based on sonic ranging which seems to demonstrate  
performance  that meets our requirements.   These design considerations  lead us  to choose  the  third option of  
sonic ranging. <APA>  
  
The  SPHERES  metrology  system  has  several  mounted  ground  units  that  emit  ultrasonic  pulses,  which  are  
received  by  the  vehicles.   The Mimio whiteboard  system  also uses a  fixed unit  to  track a moving unit.   The  
original  designs  for  the EMFFORCE metrology  system  utilized  similar  ground  units  to give position of  the  
vehicles  relative  to  the  fixed  ground  coordinates.    This  design  is  desirable  since  it  has  already  been  tested  
and  proven  to  be  effective.    However,  the  system  architecture  dictates  that  the  actuation  system  will  have  
only  relative  control  authority.    The  electromagnets  will  allow  only  for  control  of  the  vehicles  relative  to  
each  other  and  not  relative  to  the  ground,  therefore ground  referenced positioning  is unnecessary.   The best  
option  is  to  eliminate  the ground units  and put both  the emitters and  receivers on  the vehicles.   The  sensors  
will determine  the position of  the other vehicles  just as  it would have determined  the position of  the ground  
units.  This is the current design of the metrology system. <APA>  
  
  
2.4.3   Design Overview  

The  current  design  of  the  system  relies  only  on  distance  readings.    Previous  designs  used  distance  readings  
and  the  time  difference  between  each  ultrasonic  receiver  on  board  (in  addition  to  the  time  difference  
between  the  IR  and  ultrasonic  signals)  to  determine  the  angle.    It  was  decided  that  this  data  might  not  be  
precise  enough.    SPHERES  uses  a  similar  system,  but  cannot  get good  accuracy on distance using  the  time  
difference  between  the  signals.    However,  the  Virtual  Ink  Corporation  has  achieved  millimeter  accuracy  
with the Mimio system, and has shown interest in helping the EMFFORCE Team. <OM>  
  
The  current  design  uses  data  from  all  three  sensors, while  a  few  previous  designs  used  only  data  from  two  
sensors.   The  third  sensor  served  only  to  determine  a  positive  of  negative  reading.   This design was  flawed  
since  there  was  a  range  where  the  sensor  wasn’t   able  to  determine  if  the  signal  had  a  positive  or  negative  
orientation. <OM>  
  
Finally, the design calculates the angles and distances directly to the center of the vehicle.  In all previous  
designs, the algorithm would calculate the relative position to the sensor and a coordinate transformation  
was needed to go from an orientation around the sensor to the center of the vehicle.  The current design  
eliminates these calculations and decreases the number of calculations for the processor. <OM>

2.4.3.1 Algorithm  

 


The algorithm of  the system uses the distance readings from the sensors.  Because it knows the distance,  
it  knows  an  infinite  number  of  points  the  signal  can  be  coming  from,  all  lying  on  a  circle.  Using  the  
information  from  the  three  sensors,  one  can  overlay  these  three  circles  to  determine  the  exact  location  
(within  a  tolerance)  of  the  vehicle.    Using  the  following  three  equations,  one  can  determine  the  two  
unknowns.    It  is  possible  to  use  only  two  sensor  readings,  however,  there  are  times when  there will  be  
two  solutions.    The  third  equation  removes  this  second  solution.   However,  if  a  sensor  fails,  previously  
know information can be used with the two solutions to determine which is the correct solution. <OM>

2.4.4 Ultrasonic Transmitter  

 


2.4.4.1 Purpose of Part  
  
The ultrasonic transmitter transmits an ultrasonic signal to aid in the calculation of distance.  To keep the  
number of transmitters on board to a minimum, the system utilizes an omni-directional transmitter.  This  
transmitter has been  implemented on an electronic whiteboard system that tracks whiteboard erasers and  
pens.    The  Metrology  Team  has  contacted  the  company  (Virtual  Ink  Corporation,  maker  of  the  Mimio  
electronic  whiteboard  system)  to  inquire  about  the  sensor,  in  addition  to  the  overall  technology  they  
implement in their system. <OM>

2.4.4.2 Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

Drawing  from  the  design  of  the  Mimio  whiteboard  system,  the  Metrology  Team  decided  to  use  omni-
directional  sonic  emitters.    One  option  for  omni-directional  sonic  units  is  to  purchase  them  off  them  
shelf.    The  units  are  inexpensive  and  readily  available.    Another  alternative  is  to  use  directional  sonic  
units, which are currently available, and affix a cone to reflect sound waves in all directions (in a plane).   
The available off-the-shelf transmitters have very even output profiles and are probably superior to those  
that  could  be  manufactured  by  the  metrology  team.    Based  on  current  information  the  metrology  team  
has decided to use off-the-shelf transmitters. <APA>  
  
  
2.4.5 Ultrasonic Receiver  
  

2.4.5.1 Purpose of Part  
  
The ultrasonic receivers on board are to receive the signal from the ultrasonic transmitters emitted by the  
other  vehicles.    The  configuration  of  the  receivers  is  critical  to  the  calculation  of  distance  and  position.   
To minimize the complexity of the algorithm, omni-directional receivers will be used. <OM>  
  
After doing some searching,  it was determined  that  the best way to obtain these types of receivers is just  
to  build  them  in  lab  from  directional  receivers.    The  following  picture  is  from  a  concept  design  test  of  
our  setup.   A  cone  has  been  added  to  a  directional  receiver  to  direct  the  sound wave  to  the microphone  
of  the  receiver.    Further  testing  is  required  to  confirm  the  quality  of  the  design.    This  testing  will  be  
executed over the next stage of the program. <OM>

2.4.5.2 Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

The  current  options  for  omni-directional  receivers  are  off-the-shelf  receivers  and  the  cone  receivers  
mentioned  above.    The  available  off-the-shelf  receivers  only  have  effective  receiving  angle  of  150  
degrees.  It is believed that the proposed cones will provide a receiving angle of 360 degrees, though this  
will need to be verified through experimentation.  If the cones can be manufactured accurately enough to  
provide even 360-degree reception they will be superior to the available off-the-shelf receivers.  Pending  
further test results the metrology team has decided to use the conic receivers. <APA>  

2.4.6  Infrared Transmitter 

 


2.4.6.1  Purpose of Part 

 

The  infrared  transmitter  is  needed  to  determine  the  time  difference  between  the  emissions  and  the  
reception  of  the  ultrasonic  signal.    The  ultrasonic  and  infrared  signals  are  emitted  at  the  same  time.   
Since  the  signal  is  traveling  at  the  speed  of  light,  it ’s  assumed  that  the  other  vehicles  receive  the  signal  
instantaneously.  This gives a reference start time to determine the time of flight of the sound wave.  The  
time of flight along with the know value for the speed of sound is used calculate the separation distance.   
Although  omni-directional  transmitters  are  being  used,  two  have  been  implemented  in  the  design  to  
reduce the shadowing effects. <OM> <APA>  
  
2.4.6.2  Discussion of Trade Analysis  
  
The  current  options  for  infrared  emitters  are  either  to  use  one  omni  directional  emitter  (similar  to  the  
ultrasonic  system),  or  to  array  several  directional  emitters.    The  infrared  transmitters  are  very  low  in  
both  mass  and  power  consumption.    As  a  result  there  is  very  little  difference  between  the  two  options.   
The  choice  to  use  omni  directional  emitters  comes  mostly  from  the  fact  that  the  emitters  will  come  as  
part  of  the Mimio  electronic whiteboard  eraser.   The metrology  team  is  currently planning on obtaining  
both the ultrasonic and infrared emitters from the same erasers.  The choice of infrared sensors will most  
likely be determined by what types of emitters are readily available.  
  
  
2.4.7  Infrared Receiver  
  

2.4.7.1  Purpose of Part 

 

Infrared  receivers  are  used  to  receive  the  IR  signal  emitted  by  the  vehicles.    Since  the  field  of  view  is  
180º  for  the  sensor,  we  use  an  array  of  three  to  cover  the  required  360º  set  forth  by  the  requirements  
document. <OM>  
  
2.4.7.2  Discussion of Trade Analysis  
  
As  with  the  infrared  emitters,  there  are  various  receivers  available.    Again  there  is  no  fundamentally  
important  difference  between  the  various  receivers,  thus  the  metrology  team  will  most  likely  use  
whichever receivers are readily available.

2.4.8  Rate Gyro  

 


2.4.8.1  Purpose of Part 

 

The  data  from  the  ultrasonic  and  IR  sensors  provide  enough  data  to  determine  relative  angle  and  
position,  however  the  data  is  not  obtained  fast  enough.    Integrating  the  data  from  the  rate  gyro  will  
provide the current angle at a higher rate than is available from the sonic/IR system.  Since the data from  
the rate gyro can be polled at 50 Hz, the control system can use accurate data. <OM>  
 

2.4.8.2  Discussion of Trade Analysis 

  
It  was  initially  believed  that  the  ultrasonic  positioning  system  would  provide  information  quickly  
enough  to  maintain  control  of  the  system.    At  this  point  the  limiting  factor  on  the  metrology  system  is  
determined  by  the  speed  of  sound.    Thus  in  order  to  increase  the  refresh  rate  it  was  necessary  to  add  
additional  hardware.    The  rate  gyros  are  expensive  but  they  have  proved  successful  when  used  on  
SPHERES.  The rate gyro is also important because the control team requested rate data.  <APA>  
  
  
2.4.9  Accelerometer 

 


2.4.9.1  Purpose of Part  

 

The accelerometer is added for the same reason as the rate gyro.  Integrating the data twice can give us a  
position reading to satisfy the need from the control subsystem of data readings at 50 Hz. <OM>  
 

2.4.9.2  Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

As  with  the  rate  gyro,  accelerometers  will  provide  data  in  order  to  increase  the  refresh  rate  of  the  
position information.  The accelerometers are also expensive but they have proved successful when used  
on  SPHERES.    The  accelerometers  are  also  important  because  the  control  team  requested  rate  data.  
<APA>  

  

  

  
2.4.10  Metrology Design Issues  

The  system  still  needs  testing.    The  first  test  Metrology  Team  needs  to  conduct  is  the  best  design  for  the  
cones  for  the  hand  made  omni-directional  sensor.    We  will  have  to  investigate  and  research  acoustic  
documents  to  determine  what  design  (parabolic,  angle,  etc.)  will  give  us  the  strongest  signal  from  a  
transmitter. <OM>  
  
Another  test we wish  to  conduct  is  the  effects  of  the Electromagnetic  on  the  sensors.    Since  there will  a be  
significant B field around the sensors, we want to test to see how much effect the magnetic fields have to the  
readings of our sensors.  <OM>  
  
Next,  we  hope  to  test  our  accuracy  based  on  range.   We  know  as we  start  increasing  the  separation  on  the  

61  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

vehicles we  start getting  less precise on  the distance and angle data.   We hope  to keep  this error as minimal  
as  possible.   We  hope  to  come  up with  a  graph  of Accuracy  vs. Range  so  that we know where our  systems  
starts to  “fail. ” <OM>  
  
Finally, we need  to  look at  the refresh rate.   Because we use Ultrasonic  transmitters, we have to wait for the  
sound  to  leave  the  testing  area  so  that  we  don’t  get  “bad”  data.    Based  on  initial  numbers,  we  need  23  ms  
between  each  vehicle  saying  “I’m   here. ”     Rate  gyros  and  accelerometers  will  can  lower  that  refresh  rate.  
<OM>  
 

 

2.4.11  External Interfacing Needs  

  

The  metrology  subsystem  interfaces  with  the  avionics,  communications,  control,  power,  and  structure  
subsystems.  The following are descriptions of the interface requirements for each vehicle. <APA>  
  

2.4.11.1  Avionics Interfaces  
  
The  metrology  subsystem  will  interface  physically  with  the  avionics  subsystem.    The  IR  emitters  will  
require one digital output from  the avionics board (TT8).   Regardless of how many emitters are used (to  
get  full  360  degree  coverage),  all  of  the  emitters  will  be  wired  in  series  and  transmit  the  same  signal.   
Thus  they  will  only  require  one  output.    Likewise  the  IR  receivers will  require  one  digital  input  on  the  
avionics board.   It  is unknown at  this  time exactly what form of signal conditioning or support hardware  
will be required between the IR units and the avionics system.  This hardware is the responsibility of the  
Metrology  Team  and  will  be  determined  after  more  experimentation.    The  ultrasonic  emitter  will  also  
require  one  digital  output.   The  ultrasonic  receivers will  require  three  digital  inputs.   The  rate  gyro will  
require one analog  input  to  the avionics board.   The accelerometers will require two analog inputs to the  
avionics board, one input for each direction of motion (X and Y). <APA>

2.4.11.2  Communications Interface  

The  metrology  system  will  interface  with  the  communications  system  through  the  avionics  system.   
Using the current design for the metrology system, each vehicle will determine the separation distance to  
each  other  vehicle  and  the  angular  orientation  of  the  vehicle.    The  angular  orientation  of  the  other  
vehicles  is  also  necessary  to  control  the  formation.    This  information  will  be  relayed  to  the  control  
software  via  the  communications  system.    Exactly  what  information  needs  to  be  transmitted  and  the  
required bandwidth will depend greatly upon the design of the control software. <APA>

2.4.11.3  Control Interface  
  
The metrology  system will  interface with  the control subsystem via  the avionics system.   The metrology  
software  will  take  all  inputs  from  sensors.    The  metrology  software  will  then  calculate  the  separation  
distance   between   each   vehicle   as  well   as   the   relative   angular   orientation   of   each   vehicle.     This  
information  will   be   provided   in   polar   coordinates  with   the   origin   at   the   center   of   each   vehicle.   
Specifically,  the metrology  software will  return values for sAB, sBC, sAC(cid:3)(cid:4) (cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)C, (cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:7)C, (cid:9)(cid:8) (cid:3)(cid:4) and,(cid:4)(cid:9)(cid:6). (see  
figure  2.4.4  below)   The metrology  software will  also  return  linear  velocity  data  (by  taking  the derivate  
of the data from the accelerometers) and angular velocity data from the rate gyros.  The form of this data  
and the refresh rate will be determined by the control team and has not yet been determined. <APA>

2.4.11.4  Power Interface  

The  metrology  system  will  interface  with  the  power  subsystem  physically.    The  metrology  subsystem  
will most likely require a low voltage power bus (5-12 volts) with low current draw (less than one amp).   
These  are  the  exact  voltage  requirements  for  the  metrology  system  has  not  yet  been  determined.    The

2.4.11.5  Structural Interface  
  
The metrology system will interface with the structures subsystem physically.  The metrology subsystem  
will  be  attached   to   the   top  surface  of   the  vehicle  so   that   the  sensors  and  emitters  will  have  an  
unobstructed  360-degree  view.    Signal  conditioning  and  support  hardware  will  fit  on  one  of  the  racks  
allotted  for circuit boards.   The exact nature of  the physical attachment for  the metrology subsystem has  
not yet been determined. <APA>

eraser.   The erasers contain  two omni directional sonic emitters and four omni directional IR emitters.   Two  
such  erasers  will  provide  all  of  the  IR  and  ultrasonic  emitters  required  for  the  current  design  of  the  
metrology  system.    The  Mimio  whiteboard  erasers  retail  for  $60  from  the  Mimio  online  store.    Based  on  
information  from  the SPHERES  team,  the ultrasonic receivers will cost around $5 each.   It  is estimated  that  
the IR receivers will be similarly priced. <APA>  
  
All  weight  and  power  consumption  estimates  are  estimated  from  the  SPHERES  documentation.    Similar  
equipment  will  be  used.    It  was  assumed  that  any  differences  between  the  equipment  would  be  negligible.   
Requirements for signal conditioning and other interfacing hardware have not been directly addressed at this  
time due to lack of available information. <APA>  
 

 

2.4.13  Conclusion  
  
The current design of the metrology system is based on the designs for the SPHERES metrology system and  
the Mimio  electronic whiteboard  system.    There  are  still  several  details  that  need  to  be  sorted  out  however  
the  basic  design  of  the  system  is  set.   Various  components will  need  to  be  tested  before  implementation  of

the  current  design  of  the  system.    Most  significantly,  the  reflective  cones  for  the  receivers  will  need  to  be  
tested  extensively.    Also,  the  entire  system  will  be  tested  for  variations  due  to  range,  input  power,  and  
magnetic  field  effects.   The  algorithm will  need  to  be more  precisely  determined  and  coded  as well.   There  
is  a  significant  amount  of  work  left  to  do,  however  it  should  be  possible  to  complete  the  project  in  the  
allotted time and with the requested budget. <APA>

2.5 Communications   
2.5.1 Subsystem Overview   

Communications  is  the  technology  employed  in  transmitting  messages.    The  communications  subsystem  
includes  the  architecture,  or  protocol  by  which  messages  are  transmitted  and  received,  the  hardware  and  
software  necessary  to  implement  the  architectural  design,  and  a  consideration  of  the  needs  of  the  other  
subsystems.  The end goal is to achieve predictable and robust message transmission and reception. <JEU>

Figure 2.5.1: Information Flow Perspective of the Communications Subsystem  
The  above  diagram  demonstrates  the  information  flow  interfacing  of  all  the  subsystems  with  the  main  
computer.    The  communications  subsystem  is  interfaced  with  the  main  computer  in  two  ways.    First,  the  
communications  software  is  loaded  onto  the  main  computer  and  all  necessary  computations  are  handled  
there.    Second,  the  transceiver  module  must  interface  with  the  main  computer  using  digital  input/output  
channels. <JEU>  

The communication  subsystem must provide  internal and external digital communications between  the TT8  
processor  board,  the  communication  transceiver modules,  the  other  cluster  vehicles,  and  the  laptop  serving  
as the ground station. <JEU>

2.5.2 Radio-Frequency Transceiver  

  

2.5.2.1 Purpose Of Part  

The  radio-frequency  transceiver  is  a  piece  of  hardware  that  operates  as  a  transmitter  and  receiver  in  the  
radio-frequency  range.  The  transceiver  is  necessary  to  achieve  wireless  communications  among  the  
cluster of vehicles and between the cluster and the ground station. <JEU>  
  
2.5.2.2 Part Interaction with Subsystem  

The  transceiver  hardware  includes  an  antenna  and  a  circuit  board  module  that  interfaces  with  the main  
processor  via  digital  Input/Output  ports.   The  transceiver  transmits  and  receives messages  sent  between  
vehicles  and  between  the  vehicles  and  the  ground  station.    The  digital  information  that  is  sent  between  
the  processor  and  the  transceiver  is  interfaced  with  the  software  component  of  the  subsystem.    The  
software  receives  information  from  other  subsystems,  other  vehicles,  and  the  ground  station,  interprets  
and  packages  data  packets,  and  then  forwards  the  packets  through  the  transceiver  and  the  antenna  for  
transmission. <JEU>

2.5.2.3 Discussion of Trades Analysis  

2.5.2.3.1 Radio-Frequency Transceiver Modules Versus Wireless LAN Systems  

The  high-level  hardware  options  for  the  radio-frequency  transceiver  selection  are  radio-frequency  
(RF)  transceiver  modules  and  Wireless  LAN  systems.    Both  systems  operate  using  the  radio-
frequency spectrum.  However, each system utilizes different hardware and protocols. <JEU>  

By  comparing  the  two  available  hardware  options,  a  preliminary  selection  can  be  made.  Recent  
internet  searches  suggest  that  on  average,  a  LAN  card  costs  more  than  the  average  RF  transceiver  
module.  The  LAN  system  also  requires  a  base  station  (the  central  LAN  node,  used  in  conjunction  
with  the Ground Station)  that would add a  lot  to  the  total hardware cost of  the subsystem, as well as  
to  the weight and volume  that must be shipped  to Denver. On average  the size and weight of a LAN  
card  is  relatively greater  than  that of  the RF. The LAN  system has greater bandwidth and range  than  
an  RF  transceiver.  However,  given  that  only  telemetry,  control,  and  health  information  are  being  
transmitted  within  a  short  range,  the  extra  bandwidth  and  range  of  the  LAN  seem  redundant  and  
wasteful  especially  when  the  extra  cost,  weight,  and  size  is  considered.  The  RF  transceiver  drains  
less  power  on  average  than  the  LAN  system.    Both  systems  appear  to  have  the  capacity  to  reject  
electromagnetic  interference  since  both  operate  at  frequencies  around  or  above  1GHz.    Both  are  
easily  interfaced;  the LAN  system  consists of  cards  that  can be  readily  interfaced with most modern  
systems, and the RF transceiver modules can be connected directly to the onboard processor. <JEU>  

Given  all  of  the  above  considerations,  the  best  selection  for  the  EMFFORCE  system  is  the  RF  
transceiver module. <JEU>  

2.5.2.3.2 Radio-Frequency Transceiver Selection  

Next,  it ’s   necessary  to  apply  the  previous  metrics  with  respect  to  the  available  RF  transceiver  
options.  Two  transceivers  were  chosen  for  comparison:  the  AeroComm  AC5124C-10  and  the  RF  
Monolithics DR3000-1. The AC5124C-10 meets all requirements and comes with a development kit.   
However,  it  is  rather  expensive  and  the  company  is  based  in  Europe.    Furthermore,  the  power  
consumption  is  quite  a  bit more  than  that  of  the DR3000-1.    The  range,  data  rate,  and  frequency  of  
the AC5124C-10  is  far  beyond what  is  required  in  the class, and doesn’t make up  for  the extra cost,  
size,  and  weight.  The  DR3000-1,  on  the  other  hand,  is  familiar  to  many  members  of  the  staff  who  
worked   on   the   SPHERES   project,   is   small,   lightweight,   inexpensive,   and   meets   all   other  
requirements.  It also comes with a development kit. A model similar  to  the DR3000-1,  the DR1012,  
is available for immediate prototyping use by the EMFFORCE Team. <JEU>  

Upon   consideration   of   the   transceiver   options,   it   is   determined   that   the   RF   Monolithics          
 
DR3000-1 more closely matches the needs of our subsystem. <JEU>

2.5.3.1 Purpose Of Part  

  

The  communications  subsystem  architecture  sets  the  message  transmission  and  reception  protocols.   
Determination  of  the  architecture  design  is  essential  to  the  development  of  communication  procedures  
and coding algorithms, and to the estimation of transmission rates.  The protocols also address the needs  
of the other subsystems, particularly that of control. <JEU>

2.5.3.2 Part Interaction with Subsystem  

The  subsystem  architecture  links  every  vehicle  to  every  other  and  links  the  cluster  of  vehicles  to  the  
Ground  Station.    Additionally,  it  ascertains  the  transmission  protocols  between  them.  In  essence,  the  
architecture  is  everything  but  the  hardware.    The  hardware  is  merely  the  physical  means  by  which  the  
messages are propagated between the entities comprising the test bed. <JEU>  
  
2.5.3.3 Discussion of Trades Analysis  

There  are  three  possibilities  for  the  overall  architecture  design.    Each  assumes  two  communication  
channels.  The first channel allows the Hub and Ground Station to communicate independently while the  
cluster communicates on the second channel to maintain autonomous formation control. <JEU> 

2.5.3.3.1 Sequential transmission   

  

Figure 2.5.4: Sequential Architecture Diagram  
Vehicle  2  has  the  token.    The  token  allows  it  to  communicate  to  the  Hub  on  the  second  communication  line  
while the Hub and Vehicle 1 remain silent, awaiting their turns. Once Vehicle 2 completes its communication,  
the  token  is  passed  to  Vehicle  1.      Vehicle  1  communicates  with  the  Hub  while  the  Hub  and  Vehicle  2  are  
silent. Once  the control  states and other updates have been collected, the Hub makes control calculations and  
communicates  state updates  to  the Vehicles.   Meanwhile,  the Hub has direct communication with  the ground  
station. <JEU>  
  
The  Sequential  architecture  assumes  that  the  ground  station  communicates  solely  with  the  Hub.   
Each  vehicle  is  built  exactly  the  same,  so  the  cluster  still  meets  the  interchangeability  requirement  
discussed at the beginning of this document.  <JEU>  
  
As  long  as  the  transmission  rate  is  sufficiently  high,  there  should  not  be  a  problem with  the  time  it  
takes   for  one  communication  cycle   to  occur.     Due   to   the  nature  of   the  polling  protocol,   the  

70  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

Sequential  architecture  requires  excess  communication  code  beyond  that  required  for  the  second  
option, the Simultaneous architecture.  <JEU>  

The architecture appears  to be reliable from a communications point of view; every vehicle is polled  
in  sequence  and  there  is  plenty of opportunity  to  request  retransmission.    It  is also  relatively  reliable  
from a controls perspective because only one vehicle makes the control calculation.  As long as each  
communication  channel  maintains  robustness  and  reliability,  than  every  vehicle  should  be  well  
coordinated with  the  cluster  formation.   Unfortunately,  it  also places  restrictions on how  the  control  
law can be implemented.  <JEU>  

There  also  seems  to be  a  lack  of  redundancy  and  an  inability  to  correct  for  emergency  situations.    If  
the  Hub  makes  a  significant  calculation  error,  there would  be  very  few ways  to  adjust  for  it.    If  the  
Hub  has  to  be  switched  for  some  reason, none  of  the  other  vehicles would  have  a  recent  set of  state  
data to start from, assuming the chosen vehicle can recognize that it is now the new Hub. <JEU>  

2.5.3.3.2 Simultaneous transmission   

  

Figure 2.5.5: Simultaneous Architecture Diagram  
Vehicle  2 has  the  token.   The  token  allows  it  to communicate  to  the Hub and Vehicle 1  simultaneously on  the  
second  communication  channel  while  the  Hub  and  Vehicle  1  remain  silent  and  await  their  turns.  Once  
Vehicle  2  completes  its  communication,  the  token  is  passed  to  Vehicle  1.      Vehicle  1  communicates  with  the  
Hub  and Vehicle  2, who  remain  silent. The  token  is  then passed  to  the Hub, which communicates  its  states  to  
the Vehicles.  Finally, all vehicles make independent control calculations and move accordingly. <JEU>  
  
The  Simultaneous  architecture  also  assumes  that  the  ground  station  communicates  solely  with  the  
Hub.    The  main  difference  is  that  each  vehicle  inactively  listens  in  to  the  first  communication  
channel   chatter   in   addition   to   being   actively   involved   in   the   second   communication   channel  
interaction.    Once  again,  each  vehicle  is  built  exactly  the  same,  so  the  cluster  still  meets  the  
interchangeability requirement discussed at the beginning of this document.  <JEU>  

71  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

The  Simultaneous  architecture  is  easier  to  implement  than  the  Sequential,  but  is  not  as  reliable.   
While  there  is  some  redundancy  inherent  in  the  communication  line,  the  control  subsystem  is  quite  
vulnerable.  Should  there  be  any  significant  mistake  in  the  control  calculation  of  any  vehicle,  there  
could  be  serious  repercussions.    If  an  error  is  perpetuated,  the  cluster  may  not  be  able  to  recover  
before  a  catastrophic  failure  occurs.    With  this  design,  there  is  the  very  real  danger  that  the  cluster  
formation  could  go  out  of  control  and  possibly  result  in  collisions.   Any  collision  endangers  the  flat  
floor facility. <JEU>  

The design allows for the Hub to be switched relatively easily; all vehicles listen in to both channels.   
However,   the   Hub   isn’t   actively   involved   in   maintaining   the   cluster   formation,   so   it   may          
        
not be useful to switch Hubs in an emergency situation.  <JEU>  

2.5.3.3.3 Hybrid transmission  

Figure 2.5.6: Hybrid Architecture Diagram  
Vehicle   2   has   the   token.      It   communicates   to   the   Hub   and   Vehicle   1   simultaneously   on   the   second  
communication  channel  while  the  Hub  and  Vehicle  1  remain  silent.    The  token  is  then  passed  to  Vehicle  1,  
which communicates to the Hub and Vehicle 2, who remain silent.   The hub obtains the token, determines the  
commanded  control  vector,  and  passes  the  new  commands  to  Vehicle  1  and  Vehicle  2.    The Ground  Station  
listens  in  on  the  second  communication  channel  while  actively  communicating  to  the  Hub  on  the  first  line.  
<JEU>  

  

The Hybrid  architecture  assumes  two  communication  lines.   The  first  is  for Ground-Hub  interaction  
only.    The  second  is  for  the  cluster  communication.    All  vehicles  are  equipped  to  listen  in  on  both  
channels to meet the interchangeability requirement. <JEU>  

This design enables an easy switch of Hubs as needed in emergency situations.  All vehicles have the  
control  states  of  the  system,  but  only one,  the Hub,  is  allowed  to  command  a new  state vector.   The  

72  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

  

  

architecture also allows greater flexibility in communication and control design. The design does not  
place  restrictions  on  how  the  control  law  can  be  implemented;  the  control  law  implementation  can  
even  change  during  the  course  of  the  test.    However,  there  is  a  need  for  an  increased  transmission  
rate,  as  there  is  lot of  information being passed around  in a manner  similar  to  the Sequential design.  
<JEU>  

There  is a high degree of  redundancy  in  the system.   Emergency situations can be dealt with swiftly.   
If  there  is a disagreement between any vehicles on  the new state, steps can be  taken  to determine the  
correct new  state.   Similarly,  there  is plenty of opportunity  for a vehicle  to  request  retransmission of  
faulty data.  <JEU>

Figure 2.5.7: Current Architecture Design Diagram  
The current design choice is the Hybrid architecture. <JEU>  

  

Upon  consideration  of  the  architecture  options,  the  communications  team  decided  that  the  best  choice  
for the EMFFORCE project is the Hybrid architecture. <JEU>  

The  current  design  assumes   two  separate  communication  channels.     The  first   is  for  Ground-Hub  
interaction only.   The  second  is for  the cluster communication.   All vehicles are equipped  to  listen  in on  
both  channels  to  meet  the  interchangeability  requirement.    The  Ground  Station  initiates  the  active  and  
inactive  listening  status  of  each  vehicle  upon  system  startup.    The Hub  is  the  only  vehicle  that  actively  
uses  both  channels.  If  all  necessary  transmissions  can  be  accommodated  using  one  channel  only,  then  
the design will be compressed to utilize only one channel. <JEU>  

73  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

Should  an  emergency  situation  arise  and   the  Hub  needs   to  be  switched,  the  Ground  Station  can  
command  another  vehicle  to  take  over  as  the  Hub.    Proper  use  of  data  framing  ensures  that  the          
                       
chosen vehicle does not filter out the command from the Ground Station. <JEU>  

  

2.5.4 External Interfacing Needs   
 

There are several external interfacing considerations for the communications subsystem.  <JEU> 


Foremost among  these  is  the interface with the avionics subsystem.  The transceiver module must be able to  
interface  to  the  processor  via  digital  I/O.    Since  the  communications  software  must  share  space  on  the  
processor with  avionics  and  control,  there  needs  to  be  software modularity  and  a  system  of  standardization  
for  functions  that are passed between modules.   Since  the  subsystem  requires  two  transceivers,  there should  
be a sufficient number of I/O ports for both to ensure interchangeability among the vehicles. <JEU>  
 
  
Communications  must  also  interface  with  the  control  subsystem.    There  should  be  sufficient  flexibility  for  
the control subsystem to implement the control law in whatever manner it is deemed necessary.  Once again,  
software  modularity  is  a  key  external  interfacing  issue  since  communications  must  share  processor  space  
with control. <JEU>  
  
The communications hardware must interface with the structural supports.  <JEU>  
 
  
The communications  software must accept data  from  the metrology board before packaging  the  information  
into telemetry and state update packets.  <JEU>

The  communications  team  estimates  that  each  transceiver  will  cost  around  $35  each  (estimate  provided  by  
SPHERES).      Miscellaneous   parts   expenditures   will   be   approximately   $100   per   transceiver,   with  

74  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

replacements  and/or  repairs  estimated  to  be  another  $70  per  transceiver.    This  figure  allows  for  each  
transceiver  to  be  replaced  once  during  the  lifetime  of  the  project with  a  spare  on  hand  during  testing  at  the  
Denver Flat Floor facility.  If each vehicle is equipped with two transceivers, this puts the estimated cost per  
vehicle  at  $275.     The  ground  station   is  also  equipped  with   two   transceivers,  and  with   the  requisite  
equipment and  replacement cost,  the estimated cost for  the ground station  is also $275.   With  three vehicles  
and one ground station, the total for the system comes to $1100. <JEU>  

Mass  is  computed  similarly.   Each  transceiver  is  about 0.02kg.   Miscellaneous parts  are  estimated  to weigh  
on  the  order  of  0.1kg.    Replacements/repairs  should  not  add  mass  to  the  totals.    Thus,  the  communication  
subsystem  will  require  0.24kg  per  vehicle,  0.24kg  for  the  ground  station,  giving  a  system  total  of  0.96kg.  
<JEU>  

The  only  part  currently  recognized  to  draw  any  appreciable  power  is  the  transceiver.    Each  transceiver  
draws  approximately  0.04W.    With  two  transceivers  per  vehicle,  this  gives  a  total  vehicle  power  draw  of  
0.08W, the ground station drawing the same.  Thus, the total system power draw is 0.32W.  <JEU>  

  

2.5.6 Conclusion  

The  communications  subsystem  is  comprised  of  hardware,  software,  and  an  architecture  that  links  every  
vehicle  to  every  other  one  and  to  the  Ground  Station.    The  hardware  has  been  chosen  to  be  the  RF  
Monolithics  DR3000-1  transceiver  module.    The  processor  for  the  communications  subsystem  is  to  be  
shared  amongst  avionics,  control,  and  communications.    Software  unique  to  the  implementation  of  the  
subsystem is to be written by the students involved.  As discussed above, the architecture has been chosen to  
be the Hybrid architecture. <JEU>

2.6.1 Subsystem Overview 

 

The avionics subsystem manages all electronic resources within a single vehicle of the EMFFORCE system.   
The  main  focus  of  the  avionics  subsystem  is  to  run  the  control  algorithm  written  by  the  Control  Team.   
Specifically,  the  avionics  subsystem  receives  input  from  metrology  sensors  and  uses  the  Control  Team ’s  
algorithm  to  translate  them  into  electronic  signals, which  command  current  to  the  actuators  (electromagnet,  
EM, and reaction wheel assembly, RWA). <MAS>  
  

Figure 2.6.1: Avionics Subsystem Diagram  

  

Figure 2.6.1  is a block diagram of  the avionics  subsystem.    It  shows both  the overall electronic  layout of an  
EMFFORCE  vehicle  and  additional  physical  interactions  of  the  avionics  subsystem with  other  subsystems.   
The  solid  arrows  represent  data  or  information  flow  over  electronic  wiring;  dashed  lines  indicate  non-
electronic  connections  (e.g. power  supply,  structural  interface, and  software applications).   Each connection  
is explained in full in section 2.6.6 (avionics external interfacing needs).  
  
The  central  on-board  vehicle  computer  is  the main part of  the  avionics  subsystems.   Avionics  also  includes  
software, software and hardware support, and other hardware.  <MAS>

2.6.2 On-board Computer:  Tattletale Model 8.  
  
2.6.2.1  Purpose Of Part  

The  purpose  of  the  on-board  computer  is  to  manage  all  electronic  resources  and  perform  all  central  
calculations for an EMFFORCE vehicle.   The on-board computer must allocate manage processing time  
and  data  storage  space  among  the  control,  metrology,  communications,  EM,  RWA,  avionics,  and  even  
power  subsystems.    However,  the  primary  task  of  the  computer  is  to  bring  in  data  gathered  by  the  
metrology  system,  run  the  control  loop  developed  by  the control  team, and  send actuation commands  to  
the EM and RWA subsystems.  <MAS>  

2.6.2.2  Part Interaction with Subsystem  

The on-board computer  is  the main physical component of the avionics subsystem as well as the  “brain”  
of  the entire vehicle.   The computer  is  the hardware bed for the software which organizes computational  
vehicle  processes;  the  remaining  parts  of  the  subsystem  must  interact  with  the  computer  through  as  
software,  through  a  prototyping  board  or  input/output  pins  located  on  the  computer  circuit  board.   
<MAS>  

2.6.2.3  Discussion of Trades Analysis  

The  on-board  computer  for  the  EMFFORCE  vehicles  must  adequately  meet  all  the  avionics  needs  for  
the system to operate.  The avionics needs include processing power, data interfaces (digital and analog),  
support  interfaces  (structure  and  power),  working  memory  capacity,  and  data  storage  capacity.    In  
addition  to  satisfying  the  technical  requirements,  the  EMFFORCE  on-board  computer  must  satisfy  
system  constraints,   including  mass,  power  consumption,  cost  and  availability,  ease  of  use  by   the  
EMFFORCE team, and room for expansion in future applications.  <MAS>  
  
Because  the  time  allotted  to  finding  a  computer  was  less  than  that  required  by  a  thorough  search  of  all  
small computers,  the Avionics Team narrowed  the field of on-board computer options to those available  
within  the  MIT  Space  Systems  Laboratory  (SSL).    Previous  research  teams  in  the  SSL  have  spent  
considerable  time  and  effort  working  with  small  processors  ideal  for  systems  similar  to  EMFFORCE.

       5/16/2002  

  

  

  

  

  

The  three  computers  available  in  the  SSL  are  the  self-contained  Tattletale  Model  8  (TT8)  by  Onset  
Computer  Corporation,  a  Motorola  C40  series  model,  and  a  6701  model  by  Sundance,  on  a  SMT  375  
board.  <MAS>  

2.6.2.3.1  Central Processor  

  

  

The  function  of  the  central  processor  is  to  run  the  algorithm  written  by  the  controls  team.    For  the  
EMFFORCE system  to perform correctly,  the control algorithm must run  in real-time.   This requires  
a   minimum   update   frequency   of   the   control   loop,   which   includes   at   the   very   least   control  
calculations,  actuation  instructions,  and  a  matrix  describing  the  state  of  the  EMFFORCE  system.   
The  processing  power  required  for  the  system  depends  on  the  number  of  calculations  that  must  be  
made in each iteration of the control loop, and the control loop update frequency.  <MAS>  

Without  knowing  the  control  algorithm,  the  Avionics  Team  can  make  only  an  order-of-magnitude  
estimate of  the control  loop calculation  requirements.   That number  is on  the order of 1000 or fewer  
calculations  per  iteration,  updating  at  a  rate  of  approximately  50  Hz,  for  a  total  of  approximately  
50K calculations per second.  <MAS>  

Each  of  the  three  computers  considered  by  the  Avionics  Team  processes  information  at  a  rate  well  
above  50K  calculations  per  second.   The weakest  computer,  the Tattletale,  processes  approximately  
4 million instructions per second (MIPS); the C40 and 6701 process information at 13 and 250 times  
the   rate  of   the  Tattletale,  respectively.     In  fact,   through  closer   inspection   the  Avionics  Team  
determined  that  the  6701  holds  much  more  processing  power  beyond  the  EMFFORCE  system  
requirements.  This extra capability adds weight and size to the computer that violates constraints set  
on  vehicle  mass  and  causes  concern  about  power  draw.    Therefore,  the  6701  was  eliminated  first  
from the computer options because it was unsuitable for the project needs and constraints.  <MAS>  

2.6.2.3.2  Data Interfaces  

The  data  interfaces  are  introduced  in  section  2.6.2.2  [Part  Interaction with  Subsystem],  and  detailed  
in  section  2.6.6  [External  Interfacing Needs].   However,  a  summary  of  the  data  traffic needs  for  the  
EMFFORCE vehicle computer is as follows:  
(cid:1)(cid:2) 6+ digital inputs (4x metrology, 2x communications, 1x power; health)  
(cid:1)(cid:2) 3 digital outputs (2x metrology, 2x communications)  
(cid:1)(cid:2) 1-2 analog inputs (metrology)  
(cid:1)(cid:2) 4 analog outputs (actuators)  
<MAS>  
  
The  Tattletale  includes  25  digital  input/output  ports;  eight  of  these  may  be  reserved  for  analog  
inputs,  and  14  may  be  used  for  timing  purposes.    However,  the  Tattletale  requires  an  external  D/A  
converter,  because  it  does not handle  analog  outputs.   The C40  includes only digital data  interfaces,  
and would require both external D/A and A/D converters.    <MAS>

2.6.2.3.3  Support Interfaces  

The  support  interfaces  for  the  on-board  computer  include  the  power  supply,  the  physical  location  
and  position  of   the  computer  within   the  vehicle,  and   the  program  upload/download  port   that  
connects to the Operations computer.    <MAS>  

Both the Tattletale and the C40 have a readily accessible power connection and can easily connect to  
a  structural  frame.    However,  the  Tattletale  is  small  (~5cm  x  7.6cm  x  1.27cm)  and  light, making  it  
more versatile for positioning within  the vehicle frame;  in contrast,  the C40  is built up on both faces  
of  its  circuit  board, which may  cause  difficulty when  trying  to  position  it  for  easy  access within  the  
vehicle frame.  <MAS>  
  
2.6.2.3.4  Working Memory Capacity (RAM)  

The  principle  function  of  working  memory  in  the  EMFFORCE  vehicle  computer  is  to  temporarily  
store  the  variables  used  in  control  calculations.    The  minimum  storage  must  hold  the  matrix  of  
position  and  motion  variables  describing  the  state  of  the  system  as  well  as  all  forces  and  moments  
applied  to  the  system,  and  other  variables  created  in  the  calculation  process.   A  conservative  (high)  
estimate  of  the  memory  needed  for  storing  variables  is  on  the  order  of  16kB  of  memory.    Both  the  
Tattletale and the C40 have well over 16kB memory (256kB and 16MB, respectively).  <MAS>  
  
2.6.2.3.5  Data Storage Capacity (ROM)  

The permanent or semi-permanent memory in the EMFFORCE vehicle computer primarily serves as  
storage  for  system-test  program  files,  which  run  during  vehicle  operation.    The  operator  loads  at  
least  one  test  program  onto  each  vehicle’s   computer,  and  the  test  program  automatically  executes  
after  power-up  and  initialization  of  the  computer.    Assuming  a  maximum  of  1000  lines  of  code  
(LOC)  for  one  test  program,  a  conservative  estimate  of  required  storage  capacity  is  on  the  order  of  
8kB of semi-permanent memory.  <MAS>  

The  Tattletale  and  C40  computers  use  FlashMemory,  a  semi-permanent  re-writeable  “ROM ”,   as  
storage   space.     This  allows   the  EMFFORCE  operators   to   load  different   test  programs   to   the  
computer  without  having  to  hold  all  programs  in  the  memory  simultaneously.    Both  the  Tattletale  
and C40 have well over 8kB FlashMemory: 256kB and 640 kB respectively.  <MAS>  
  
2.6.2.3.6  Constraint Satisfaction  

The  budget  constraints  were  the  deciding  factor  in  the  selection  of  a  single  on-board  computer  for  
the  EMFFORCE  vehicles.     The  most   important  constraint  on   the  EMFFORCE   system   is   the  
minimization  of  mass;  only  slightly  less  critical  are  the  cost,  ease  of  use,  and  availability  of  the  
system parts.    It  is also  important  that  the EMFFORCE  system  retain  the ability  to expand and grow  
into  a  more  complex  system   in   the  future,  but   this  goal  is  secondary  to  the  primary  task  of  
demonstrating formation flight.  <MAS>  

The  Tattletale  Model  8  satisfies  all  of  these  constraints  except  one.    Its  mass  is  well  under  0.1  kg,  
there  are  user  packages  (including  hardware  and  software)  available  in  multiple  common  computer

languages,  and  the MIT  SSL  has  donated  four  Tattletale  computers  to  the EMFFORCE  project  free  
of  charge.   The  cost  to  repair  one Tattletale  is on  the  order of $60;  a  completely new TT8  computer  
costs  $500.   However,  the Tattletale does  not  allow  for  extensive  expansion.   Because of  its design,  
the Tattletale processor would have to perform extra calculations to handle floating-point values (see  
*,  Table  2.6.1);  these  extra  calculations  mean  the  EMFFORCE  system  may  run  the  Tattletale  close  
to  its  processing  limit.    Although  it  satisfies  the  current  EMFFORCE  system  requirements,  the  
Tattletale might not be sufficient for a more complex application.  <MAS>  

The   C40   has   enough   processing   power   to   allow   for   expansion   of   the   EMFFORCE   project.   
However,  it  lacks an  internal A/D  signal converter,  implying  the Avionics Team would need  to buy,  
build,  and  test  more  hardware  separately.    A  more  important  aspect  of  the  C40  is  that  the  version  
available  in  the  MIT  SSL  is  a  custom-fabricated  model.    Team  members  of  previous  MIT  SSL  
projects  put  together  the  C40  board  in  the  lab;  the  board  would  be  virtually  impossible  for  the  
Avionics  Team  to  reproduce,  and  prohibitively  expensive  to  order.    The  C40  would  be  extremely  
time-consuming  to  replicate  and  repair;  it  is  also  heavier  and  more  awkward  to  work  with  than  the  
Tattletale.   The  cost  in dollars,  time,  and  effort  to  use  the C40  is  not worth  its  expansion  capability.   
<MAS>  

2.6.2.4  Summary of Options/Selection Criteria (Table)  

  

  

  

The  Avionics  Team  has  selected  the  Tattletale  Model  8  as  the  central  on-board  computer  of  the  
EMFFORCE  vehicles.    The  Tattletale  has  adequate  processing  power,  interfaces  for  data  and  support,  
working memory,  and  data  storage  to meet  the  EMFFORCE  system  needs.    It  is  the  easiest  to  use,  and  
has  the  lowest  mass,  power  draw,  and  cost  of  any  computer  examined  by  the  Avionics  Team.    The  
Tattletale 8  is a  relatively  low-power computer whose capabilities may not accommodate more complex  
applications, but the Avionics Team will plan for possible future expansion to a different architecture by  
using  standardized  cables  and  interfacing  accessories  in  hopes  that  another  commercial  product will  be  
compatible.  <MAS>

2.6.3 Software Environment and Code  
  
2.6.3.1  Purpose of Part  

2.6.3.1.1 Software Code  
  
The purpose of the code to be developed by the Avionics Team is to manage the interfacing between  
vehicle  subsystems.    The  code  should  be  capable  of  including  system  updates  from  the  various  
subsystems and  should also route  the newly updated  information  to  the subsystems  it affects.   It also  
is  designed  in  simple  modular  manner  such  that  it  can  include  any  software  written  by  other  
subsystems (e.g. communications, controls). <SJS>  
  
2.6.3.1.2 Coding Environment  
  
The  purpose  of  the  coding  environment  is  to  give  the  EMFFORCE  team  members  a  standardized  
coding  program  through which  they  can  create  and  compile  any written  code.    It  also  allows  for  the  
loading of code onto the Tattletale computer. <SJS>  
  
2.6.3.2  Part Interaction with Subsystem  

2.6.3.2.1 Part Interaction: Software Code  
  
The  software  code  is  written  by  the  Avionics  Team  and  is  then  loaded  onto  the  computer  board  
utilizing   the   coding   environments   described   below.      The   written   code   is   what   manages   the  
information  gathered  from various  subsystems  and  allows  the computer  to process  the data gathered  
by  the  metrology  system,  to  run  the  control  loop  developed  by  the  control  team,  and  to  send  
actuation  commands  to  the  EM  and  RWA  subsystems.  Software  code  is  what  allows  for  system  
updates and the relay of such updates to the relevant subsystem parts. <SJS>  
  
2.6.3.2.2 Part Interaction:  Coding Environment  
  
The   coding   environment   compiles   the   software   code   written   by   the   team   members.      The  
environment interacts with both the code and the computer; after the environment compiles the code,  
the code is then transferred to the computer.  <SJS>  

2.6.3.3  Discussion of Trades Analysis  

2.6.3.3.1  Trades of the Coding Environment  
  
The  Avionics  Team ’s   computer  selection  included  two  options  for  software  support:    the  BASIC  
package or  the C package.  In fact, commercially packaged software support for the Tattletale Model  
8 was one of its major benefits in usability [2.6.2.3.6-Para.2].  <MAS>  

There is a vast consumer base for the C language  – much larger than that for BASIC.   From this fact  
stem  the  two major  benefits  of  using C  for  the EMFFORCE  project:    team member  familiarity with  
the  language  and  compatibility  with  other  teams ’   code.    Six  to  eight  members  of  the  EMFFORCE  

  

81  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

project  team  will  be  writing  code  for  the  system:  the  Avionics,  Communications,  Control,  and  
possibly  Metrology  Teams.    The  majority  of  these  team  members  are  familiar  with  or  experienced  
using  the  C  language.   Also,  the  Control  Team  uses Matlab  Simulink  to model  the  control  loop  for  
their  subsystem; Simulink  can map  directly  to program  code  if necessary,  and  the  language  it writes  
in is C.  For these reasons, the obvious design choice for computer language is C.  <MAS>  
  
The  SPHERES  project  also  programmed  the  TT8  computer  in  C.    The  Avionics  Team,  therefore,  
decided  to  use  the  coding  environment  software  already  purchased  by  SPHERES.    The  C  software  
support  packages  for  the  Tattletale  computer  include  two  programs:  Metrowerks  CodeWarrior  for  
program   development   and   compiling,   and  Motocross   for   loading   to  and   running   tests  on   the  
Tattletale.    It  is  also  important  to  utilize  these  software  environments  because  it  has  proven  its  
reliability   in   the   SPHERES   project.      The   Avionics   Team   has   developed   some   low-level  
representative tests for the Tattletale using these tools.  <MAS, SJS>  
  
2.6.3.3.2  Trades of Software: Creation of Code and Utilizing Code Resources  
  
One must weigh the consequences of writing code from scratch vs. utilizing previously written code.   
While  much  of  the  EMFFORCE  code  will  be  project-specific  and  must  be  written  by  the  project  
team  members,  some  of  the  avionics  responsibilities  involve  tasks  for  which  other  code  already  
exists. <SJS>  
  
The  usage  of  previously written  code  should  be  considered  on  a  case-by-case  basis  (a  trade  analysis  
must  be  implemented  before  each  coding  decision  is  made).    The  Avionics  Team  must  first  decide  
what needs to be accomplished, and what the best method is to accomplish the specific task. <SJS>  
  
The  Avionics  Team  is  studying  various  programs  written  by  members  of  the  SPHERES  project  to  
determine  if  any  of  this  code  suits  the  EMFFORCE  project  needs.    The  studying  of  the  code  gives  
the  Avionics  Team  a  starting  point  for  writing  the  code  for  EMFFORCE.    Example  software  code  
furthers  the  learning  process  of TT8  coding.   Also,  the  time  to  complete  the  software  design  can  be  
decreased  if  the  Avionics  Team  is  able  to  reuse  any  code  that  is  both  functional  and  applies  to  the  
scope  of  the  EMFFORCE  project.    Therefore,  while  the  vast  majority  of  the  code  must  be  original  
because it is project specific, code written by another author has been both proven reliable in the past  
and also can often save time when used with caution.  <SJS>  

  

  

 

2.6.4 Hardware Support: DAC 


2.6.4.1  Purpose of Part  
  
The  digital-to-analog  converter  (DAC)  will  translate  selected  digital  output  signals  from  the  Tattletale  
into  analog  signals.    This  is  necessary  because  although  the  Tattletale  has  an  internal  analog-to-digital  
converter  (ADC)  for  incoming  signals,  it  does  not  have  a  corresponding  digital-to-analog  converter  
(DAC)  for  output  signals.    Therefore,  the  Avionics  Team  must  construct  or  obtain  a  DAC  to  produce  
these signals.  <MAS>

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

2.6.4.2  Part Interaction with Subsystem  
  
The DAC requires a coded procedure modeling a pulse-width modulation (PWM) process, simulating an  
analog  signal  with  bursts  of  digital  data.    However,  a  DAC  is  also  a  small  chip  which  attaches  to  an  
electronics  board;  in  this  case  to  the  Tattletale.    This  implies  both  physical  and  software  interface  
between the DAC and the on-board computer.  <MAS>  
  
2.6.4.3  Discussion of Trades Analysis  
  
The  detailed  analysis  concerning  the  DAC  will  occur  over  the  summer  of  2002.    Research  needs  to  be  
done  on  physical  vs.  software  needs,  and  the  Avionics  Team  needs  to  check  for  possible  in-house  
supplies.  <MAS>  
  
  
2.6.5  Subsystem-Specific Electronics Boards  
  
   2.6.5.1  Purpose of Part  
  

Although  the  on-board  computer  performs  all  the  main  control  calculations  for  each  EMFFORCE  
vehicle,  there  are  some  processes  that  are  handled  outside  the  central  processor.    For  example,  the  
metrology  system  may  in  fact  pre-process  the  data  from  its  sensors,  and  feed  only  position  and  rate  
information  to  the  avionics  subsystem  for  use  in  the  control  software.   The  power  subsystem  requires  a  
voltage regulator to distribute its power among the other subsystems; this regulator requires a baseboard.   
The EM  and RWA  subsystems may  require  circuit  boards  to  convert  a  signal  instruction  into  the  actual  
current they receive.  The Avionics Team is responsible for the fabrication of these boards.  <MAS>  
  
2.6.5.2  Part Interaction with Subsystem  
  
If  any  subsystem  outside  avionics  requires  its  own  circuit  board,  whether  for  processing  needs  or  as  a  
physical  bed  for  other  electronic  parts,  this  circuit  board  will  form  the  interface  between  the  on-board  
computer  and  that  subsystem.    There may  be  data  transmission  or  other  resource management  involved  
in  the  connection.    It  is  also  possible  that  an  additional  subsystem  board may  reduce  the  number  of  I/O  
ports required in the Tattletale computer.  <MAS>  
  
2.6.5.3  Discussion of Trades Analysis  
  
The  design  is  not  finalized  in  all  subsystems which may  preprocess  signals.   Therefore,  it  is  not  certain  
which  approach  will  be  best  for  obtaining  additional  customized  circuit  boards.    The  detailed  analysis  
concerning  additional  electronics  boards  will  occur  over  the  summer  of  2002.    This  includes  drawing  
circuit schematics and ordering original boards for fabrication.  However, the Avionics Team is prepared  
to  obtain  electronics  for  up  to  four  additional  subsystems  at  an  estimated  cost  of  approximately  $1000  
per original board.   The EMFFORCE  system will  require  several copies of each board:   one per vehicle  
plus  sufficient  replacement  stock.   The  cost  estimate  for  these boards  is  therefore  approximately $6500.

2.6.6  External Interfacing Needs 

 

The  avionics  subsystem  must  interface  with  all  other  subsystems.    Figure  2.6.1  describes  the  avionics  
subsystem ’s  interfaces  with  the  system  as  a  whole.    Through  discussions  with  each  of  the  other  subsystem  
teams,  the  Avionics  Team  has  determined  that  the  subsystem  needs  to  interact  with  each  of  the  other  
subsystems as explained below: <SJS>  
  

Power.   There will  be one digital  signal  input  to  the  computer  for a health/low battery  indicator.   There  
is  also  a  physical  connection  that  supplies  the  necessary  voltage  for  Tattletale  processing  capabilities.  
<SJS>  
  
Controls.   No  input/output  interfacing  is  necessary  because  the  controls  subsystem  consists of  software  
loaded onto the computer. <SJS>  
  
Reaction Wheel Assembly  (RWA).   One  analog  actuator will  be  needed  to  control  the  reaction wheel  
assembly. <SJS>  
  
Electromagnet.    The  current  design  of  the  electromagnet  is  in  Y-pole  configuration.    For  a  Y-pole,  3  
analog actuation signals will be outputs from the computer (one to each leg of the magnet). <SJS>  
  
Metrology.    The  design  of  the  metrology  subsystem  includes  ultrasonic  sensing  for  position,  infrared  
sensing for timing, and a rate gyro for determination of angular rate.  
(cid:1)	 Ultrasonic:  Three  receivers  will  be  needed;  these  are  all  digital  inputs  to  the  computer.    One  
digital transmitter (an output) is also needed.  
(cid:1)	 Rate  Gyro:  The  computer  will  need  to  take  in  one  analog  signal  specifying  the  angular  velocity  
of  the  rate  gyro.    If  accelerometers  are  part  of  the  final  design  choice,  then  2  analog  inputs will  
also be routed from the accelerometers to the computer.  
Infrared:    Infrared  will  be  used  for  timing  purposes.    One  receiver  (input)  and  one  transmitter  
(output), both digital, will be needed for the IR timing. <SJS>  

(cid:1)	

  
Comm./Ops.   Digital  inputs and outputs are needed to accomplish the 2-way intervehicle data exchange  
as described in Section 2.5. <SJS>  
  
Structure.   Structure packages  the components within a vehicle.   The  structure will physically  interface  
with  the  avionics  subsystem.   That  is,  the  structure  system  designs  casing  and  supports  to hold  the TT8  
computer and any additional boards. <SJS>  

  

2.6.7  Budgets  
  
Like  other  EMFFORCE  teams,  the  Avionics  Team  is  responsible  for  tracking  its  estimated  budgets  for  
money,  power,  and mass  and  relaying  this  information  to  the  systems  team.   More  accurate budgets will be  
established  once  the  design  is  further  decided  upon.    For  this  reason,  the  avionics  estimates  are  being  
frequently  updated.    Table  2.6.2  lists  the  current  budget  estimates  (as  of  12  May  2002)  for  the  avionics  
microgroup team. <SJS>

This  table  shows  the Avionics Team’s  budgeting  estimates  as  of  12 May  2002.   Subsystem  circuit boards will  
be designed during the CDR period; therefore, details concerning power draw and masses are not yet known.   
Cost is total system cost while power and mass estimates are per vehicle.  

2.6.7.1  Cost Budgets  
  
The Avionics Team believes that one Motorola TT8 computer per vehicle should provide sufficient  
processor capabilities.  Therefore, our current design concept only includes one TT8 per vehicle.  The  
Avionics Team, however, has decided upon the use of two TT8 computers per vehicle if it is found that  
one TT8 is no longer sufficient. <SJS>  

The SPHERES project provided four working Motorola TT8 computers for use on our vehicles.   
Assuming a 3-vehicle configuration, the Avionics Team will need to purchase 2 more TT8 computers if  
it is determined that 2 TT8s will be used on every vehicle.  Minor repair of TT8 computers cost  
approximately $60; $500 dollars has been allocated for TT8 maintenance and repair. <SJS>  
  
During Fall 2002, boards will need to be designed and custom-ordered for the metrology,  
communication, power, and actuation subsystems.  Because this design process has not yet begun, only  
rough cost estimates can be given for the boards.  Original boards will cost approximately $1000 apiece  
while the duplicate boards (8 boards) should cost somewhere in the $200-$400 range each. <SJS>  
 

2.6.7.2  Power Budgets 

  
The Motorola TT8 computers require supplied power.  The least favorable scenario in terms of power  
consumption would be if two TT8s were used per vehicle.  In this case, the double TT8 combination  
would require a total of 3.6W per vehicle. <SJS>  

Project EMFFORCE has not yet reached the point where the individual subsystem boards have been  
designed; therefore, the power draw for such boards has yet to be determined.  The Avionics Team will  
have a more complete power draw estimate during the fall term after the board designs have been  
completed.. <SJS>  

2.6.7.3  Mass Budgets  
  
A single TT8 computer has a mass of 0.028 kg (1.0 oz).  If two Tattletales are required, the mass of the  
computer per vehicle will be 0.058 kg.  As explained in section 2.6.7.2, the individual subsystem boards  
have not been designed.  Therefore, the Avionics Team is uncertain of the mass of each of these boards.   
However, for the purpose of system mass budgets the Avionics Team estimates each additional board  

  

  

  

  

85  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

will have mass of 0.028kg (1.0 oz) or less.  The Avionics Team ’s estimate of four external subsystem  
boards brings the total electronics mass to approximately 0.169kg.  <SJS, MAS>  

 

2.6.8  Conclusion 

 

The avionics subsystem is the administrator of the EMFFORCE system.  It incorporates both hardware and  
software, and interfaces with every other subsystem, to organize all electronic processes on a single vehicle.   
The EMFFORCE central on-board computer, the Tattletale Model 8, will handle all central computing for  
the system.  The software and software support will manage all resources supplied by the computer; the  
external hardware support and additional electronics will preprocess and reformat both incoming and  
outgoing data for the Tattletale.  Through these operations the avionics subsystem will manage  
communications and metrology data, as well as the current supplied by the power subsystem, to control each  
EMFFORCE vehicle.  <MAS>

2.7  Power  

  

2.7.1  Subsystem Overview  
  
The power subsystem is responsible for providing the necessary voltages and currents to each of the other  
subsystems.  The complete subsystem includes batteries, voltage regulators, amplifiers, and on/off switches.   
The design presented here will be for a single vehicle  –
 each vehicle on the testbed will have an identical  
power subsystem.  Since power is the underlying force driving the entire system, its design and functionality  
is crucial to the overall mission success. <TAS>

This diagram shows the interfaces between the power supply (1.2 V batteries) and the individual subsystem components.   
The gyro, accelerometer, and reaction wheel assembly will connect directly to the power supply.  The on-board  
transmitters, receivers, and Tattletale processors will require voltage regulators to buffer the incoming power.  Finally,  
the current through the electromagnet will be controlled with a switchmode amplifier.  Each of these components will be  
further explained in this section. <TAS>  

EM

  

  
The requirements pertaining to the power subsystem per the Requirements Document are as follows:  
  

(cid:1)(cid:2) The power supply must be completely contained within the structure [7.2.2.2].  This implies  
that the power must come from an on-board source such as batteries or solar cells.  As  
explained in section 2.7.2, the final choice is to use rechargeable batteries.  <TAS>  

  
(cid:1)(cid:2) The subsystem must provide sustained power for a minimum of thirty minutes [7.2.1.2].   
This will primarily affect the battery selection, since battery chemistry must be chosen to  
provide the required voltage and current levels for this length of time. <TAS>  

  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Battery power should be able to be recharged in 30 minutes [7.2.2.1].  This implies that any  
batteries used must be rechargeable.  Due to the limited availability of rechargeable batteries  
with this capability; this requirement will be slightly amended.  An alternative way to satisfy  

87  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

the intent of this requirement is to have extra battery packs on hand during testing.  For  
example, if a battery pack supplies power for thirty minutes but requires one hour to  
recharge, then having two battery packs on hand will allow testing to be completed without  
having to wait for batteries to finish charging. <TAS>  

  
2.7.2  Batteries  
  
   2.7.2.1  Purpose of Part  
  

The purpose of the batteries is to provide the source of power to each vehicle.  By wiring combinations  
of batteries in series and parallel, adequate voltages and currents will be provided. <TAS>  
  
  
2.7.2.2  Interfacing 

 

The batteries will have three different interfaces; connect directly with components from other  
subsystems, connect to voltage regulators, or connect to a switchmode amplifier.  The batteries will also  
be connected to a main on/off switch, which will allow outside operators to turn the main power on or  
off. <TAS>  
  
  
2.7.2.3  Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

The first trade analysis was conducted to decide between using solar cells or rechargeable batteries.  The  
current requirements for the system are estimated to be on the order of 5 to 7 amps, this means that using  
solar power is infeasible.  The best available solar cells provide currents on the order of milliamps to a  
maximum of one amp.  Also, solar cells are very expensive and often have a long procurement time.   
For these reasons, the Power Team ruled out solar power as a possibility for the EMFFORCE testbed.  
<TAS>  
  
After choosing rechargeable batteries, the next trade analysis was deciding which battery chemistry to  
use.  Given the voltage and current demands and using prior knowledge about battery chemistries, the  
three initial battery types that were considered were Lithium Ion (Li-Ion), Nickel Cadmium (NiCd), and  
Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH).  Li-Ion batteries offer a high energy density; however, they have low  
current discharge rates.  The highest discharge rate that could be found was 2 amps, which is inadequate  
for this system.  NiCd batteries offer an adequate discharge rate, but they lose efficiency at the high  
current draws we expect for our system.  This would mean the system would require more batteries to  
supply a given voltage, which would add to the overall mass.  The ideal battery chemistry was found to  
be NiMH.  These batteries offer high energy densities, fast discharge rates, and excellent efficiencies at  
high current draws.  They can provide the necessary power for the system at acceptable mass levels.   
The final downselect for battery chemistry was therefore NiMH. <TAS>

2.7.2.4  Summary Of Options / Selection Criteria  
  
Before choosing the specific type of NiMH battery to use, a good estimate of the power requirements for  
each subsystem is necessary.  The estimates given will be the requirements per vehicle. <TAS>  
  
Using estimates obtained from the previous SPHERES and ARGOS projects, the gyros will each require  
0.36 Watts, and the accelerometers will each require 0.18 W.  These should operate in the range of 12-
18 Volts.  The metrology sonic and IR sensors together will require 0.55 W at 3-5 V.  These components  
are expected to draw this much power throughout the duration of the tests. <TAS>  
  
The maximum power draw for the reaction wheel is estimated at ~13 W at 12-18 V.  One thing to note is  
that the reaction wheel is not expected to draw this much power throughout the duration of the tests.  At  
low spin rates, the reaction wheel will require very little power.  It will only draw 13 W during complex  
spin-up maneuvers and for limited amounts of time.  However, for the purposes of conducting a  
conservative analysis, a power draw of 13 W will be assumed throughout the entire testing period.  As  
the system is further designed and built, more accurate estimates for the RW power draw will be  
obtained. <TAS>  
  
The TT8 Tattletale processor will draw no more than 2 W at 9-12 V.  This includes the power draw of  
the on-board communications transceivers that will be connected to the TT8.  The current design calls  
for the use of only one TT8 per vehicle; however, it is possible that the final design will use two. <TAS>  
  
A proof of concept test for the electromagnet was performed, during which each EM drew a current of  
3-4 amps.  However, the EM subsystem team has proposed a final current draw of up to 7 amps.   
Assuming a 12 V current draw, this puts the power draw for the EM at around 84 W.  Like the reaction  
wheel, the maximum power draw for the EM would not be sustained throughout the entire test; however,  
a constant 84 W draw will be used to make a simple, conservative estimate.  <TAS>  
  
The following table summarizes the power requirements for each subsystem component.  This is the  
total power requirement per vehicle.

TOTAL:  
  
This table shows the preliminary power estimates for each vehicle.  These values will be used to narrow down the  
appropriate NiMH battery type to use in the power system.  <TAS>  

  
One final subsystem component that may require power is an on-board air compressor.  This was not  
included in the power estimates here because it is undetermined whether or not one will actually be  

89  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

used.  If the air compressor is used, it will dramatically increase the power requirements of the overall  
system.  This would change the choice of battery and the individual battery configurations.  For now, it  
will be assumed that a compressor will not be used.  If it turns out that a compressor will definitely be  
used, the power subsystem will be redesigned to accommodate this.  This may include adding more  
battery packs in series to produce a higher current draw, or it could mean switching to a battery with a  
higher energy density.  Both of these solutions would result in adding more mass to the power  
subsystem. <TAS>  
  

  
The next step in the design process is selecting the specific battery type to be used.  The dominating  
power user is the electromagnet.  The current draw for most of the other components can be assumed to  
  
be negligible.  Assuming a current draw of up to 7 amps for a period of 30 minutes, this requires an  
  
energy capacity of 3.5 Amp-hours (Ah) from the batteries.  From here an appropriate battery type can be  
  
selected. Figure 2.7.1 shows a sample of possible battery types. <TAS>  
  
  
  
  
  

  

A preliminary search on the Panasonic website (http://www.panasonic.com) yielded a few suitable battery  
types.  The table below summarizes the results of the search:

Depending on the finalized power requirements of the system, these batteries can be wired in  
combination of series and parallel to produce the necessary voltage and currents.  For the preliminary  
power design, the HHR200SCP batteries can be wired into “packs. ”  Each pack would contain 15  
batteries in parallel, producing an 18-volt battery pack with an energy capacity of 1.9 Ah.  To bring the  
current capacity up to acceptable levels, two packs can be wired in parallel, bringing the total capacity to  
3.8 Ah at 18 volts. <TAS>

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

The final battery selection will be made after the requirements for each subsystem component are  
finalized.  The battery selection will be one in which an adequate amount of power is provided at a  
minimum mass.  Some other promising NiMH battery types are manufactured by GP Batteries  
(http://www.gpbatteries.com); their newest model has a capacity of 1.8 Ah, voltage of 1.2 V, and weighs  
26 grams.  They are also fairly inexpensive and thus would be an excellent candidate for the power  
subsystem. <TAS>  
  
Finally, battery chargers will have to be purchased.  Some chargers will recharge up to four batteries in  
about an hour, but they are fairly expensive.  Chargers that recharge slower (usually overnight) are less  
expensive but will result in needing more complete sets of batteries on hand during testing.  Determining   
the lowest cost solution will depend on knowing exactly how many batteries are needed per vehicle and  
how long they will last. <TAS>  
  
2.7.2.5  External Interfacing Needs  

 

As mentioned before, some of the subsystem components contain internal voltage regulators and will be  
directly connected to the battery source.  Other subsystems will require the batteries to connect to a  
voltage regulator rather than directly to the component.  The electromagnet will connect to the batteries  
through a switchmode amplifier.  The batteries will be contained within the main structure of the  
vehicles.  They will be positioned in a symmetric way to distribute the weight evenly across the  
structure.  There will need to be an access point for the main on/off switch somewhere on the main  
structure. <TAS>  
  
  
2.7.3 Voltage Regulators 

  
 

   2.7.3.1  Purpose of Part 

 


The purpose of the voltage regulators is to provide a way to step down the voltage of the power source  
to a level that can be used by the individual subsystem component.  They also ensure that the subsystem  
component sees a constant voltage level, since the voltage level provided by the batteries will tend to  
decrease as they get depleted.  
  
2.7.3.2  Interfacing  
  
The voltage regulators will reside on an electronic circuit board and will provide a direct connection  
between the batteries and the subsystem component. <TAS>  
  
2.7.3.3  Summary Of Options 

 

Since the SPHERES project went through the same down-select process for voltage regulators, the final  
choice will likely be similar to the regulators they chose.  That system used the same TT8 processors  
and similar metrology instrumentation as EMFFORCE.  ASTEC AA10B and AA05A models were  
used, which were 5V and 12V regulators, respectively (http://www.astecpower.com).  The same regulators  
(or ones quite similar) can be used for this project.  Figure 2.7.2 shows a sample voltage regulator.

2.7.3.4  External Interfacing Needs  

 

As previously mentioned, the voltage regulators will be integrated onto the circuit board of the 

subsystem component for which they are being used. <TAS> 

 


  
2.7.4  Switchmode Amplifier  

  
   2.7.4.1  Purpose of Part  
  

The swichmode amplifier will be responsible for varying the amount of current going to the  
electromagnet.  It will receive a signal from the Control subsystem that will tell it how to vary the  
outgoing current to the electromagnet. <TAS>  
  

2.7.4.2  Interfacing  
  
The switchmode amplifier will reside on an electronic circuit board and will provide a direct connection  
between the batteries and the electromagnet.  <TAS>  

  
2.7.4.3  Summary of Options  
  
The main criterion for the switchmode amplifier is that it must be able to provide a high current output  
(possibly up to 10 amps).  Like the voltage regulators, these are commercially available and relatively  
easy to obtain.  One amplifier which satisfies this criteria is the SA60 PWM from Apex  
Microtechnology (http://www.apexmicrotech.com).  The amplifier can handle up to an 80-volt input and  
can provide a continuous 10-amp output.  It has a high efficiency and is commonly used for magnetic  
coil applications.  This model is shown in Figure 2.7.3.  For the final subsystem design, this model or  
one very similar to it will be used. <TAS>

       5/16/2002  

  

  
2.7.4.4  External Interfacing Needs  
  
The switchmode amplifier will be directly connected to the battery source.  It will interface with the  
controls, avionics, and electromagnet subsystems.  It will receive a voltage signal from avionics and  
controls, which it will then use to allow the appropriate amount of current through to the electromagnet.  
<TAS>  

  
  

  

2.7.5  Budgets  
  
The power subsystem budget estimates per vehicle are shown below.  The estimates include the possibility  
of having up to three complete battery sets per vehicle. <TAS>

2.7.6  Conclusion 

 

The success of the overall mission is entirely dependent on the success of the power subsystem.  The power  
subsystem design is fairly straightforward and simple, and the type of batteries selected will determine its  
success.  Once final power requirements are obtained from each subsystem, the optimal battery will be  
chosen and the power subsystem can be finalized.

2.8  Structure  
  
  

  

2.8.1  Subsystem Overview  

 

There are  three main components of  the structure subsystem:  the vehicle casing, magnetic shielding, and air  
carriage. <ALS> 
  
2.8.2  Vehicle Casing  

2.8.2.1  Purpose of Part  

 

The  purpose  of  the  vehicle  casing  is  to  provide  physical  interfacing  capability  for  all  of  the  subsystem  
hardware, and to prevent damage to the hardware in case of collision.  <ALS>  
 

2.8.2.2  Interfacing 

 

The  structural  design  must  be  flexible  in  order  to  absorb  changes  in  other  subsystem  design.    For  this  
reason  the vehicle casing has a modular design.  The base holds the electromagnet and is separated from  
the  remaining  subsystems  by  magnetic  shielding.    The  base,  in  turn,  bolts  to  the  main  body.    The  lid,  
which  sits  in  the  main  body,  latches  to  the  top  of  the  vehicle  and  holds  the  electronics.    The  entire  
vehicle attaches to the air carriage with wing nuts for ease of manual assembly.  <ALS, GG>  
 

2.8.2.3  Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

The critical property of the vehicle casing is the weight as the weight is the dominant driver of the entire  
vehicle  design.    The  structure  team  must  fulfill  its  requirements  at  the  lowest  weight  possible.    While  
minimizing  the weight,  issues  of  cost  of  the material  and machinability  also  come  into  play.   Currently  
the  structures  team  is considering aluminum and Lexan plastic as  the candidate materials for  the vehicle  
casing.  
  
2.8.2.4 Concept Design  
  
When   designing   the   vehicle   casing,   the   structure   team   took   into   consideration   the   following:  
accessibility  to  critical  subsystems  during  operation,  accessibility  to  all  subsystems  during  development  
phase,  thermal  considerations  regarding  the  electromagnet,  axial  symmetry,  center  of  mass  location,  
total structural mass, and manufacturability.  <ALS, GG>  
  
During  operation  the  EMFFORCE  team  may  need  to  access  critical  subsystems  such  as  power  and  
avionics,  in  order  to  replace  batteries  or  reboot  the  main  processor.    Other  subsystems  such  as  the  
reaction  wheel  will  most  likely  not  be  accessed  during  operation  but  must  still  be  easily  accessible  in  
case of replacement, repair, and other development. <ALS, GG>  
  
There  is a possibility  that  the electromagnet will overheat.   This may affect the structure as well as other  
subsystems   of   the   EMFFORCE   vehicles.      Therefore,  methods   for   cooling   the   electromagnet   are  
considered in the structural design.  <ALS, GG>

Since  the  vehicles  will  be  rotating,  an  axis  of  symmetry  allows  simplification  of  the  system  dynamics.   
Also  a  low  center  of  mass  keeps  the  system more  stable.    Because  of  the  properties  of  electromagnetic  
forces,  it  is  imperative  to  minimize  the  mass  of  each  vehicle.    The  structure  team  must  minimize  the  
structural   mass   to   accomplish   this.      Constraints   on   time,   cost   and   resources   also   require  
manufacturability. <ALS, GG>  
  
Since  it  is critical  that  the subsystems be accessible during building and development, the vehicle casing  
is  designed  with  ease  of  disassembly  in  mind.    The  entire  vehicle  (Figure  2.8.1)  is  cylindrical  with  the  
axis  of  symmetry  aligned  with  the  axis  of  rotation  of  the  vehicle.    The  air  carriage  assembly  (shown  at  
the bottom) attaches to the main vehicle casing with wing nuts. <ALS>  
  
  

  

Figure 2.8.1: Vehicle assembly with air carriage <GG>  
  
  
The base of the vehicle (Figure 2.8.2) contains the electromagnet.  The base is grated to provide air flow  
for convective cooling over the electromagnet.  This grating is made of aluminum to allow for additional  
heat  conduction  and  radiation  to  the  atmosphere  in  the  event  of  magnet  cooling.    Directly  above  the  
magnet  housing,  a  plate  of magnetic  shielding material  separates  the  electromagnet  from  the  rest  of  the  
subsystems.  The reaction wheel assembly is attached to the top of this plate.  <ALS>

The  reaction  wheel  assembly  fits  inside  the  bottom  of  the  body  (Figure  2.8.3)  when  the  base  is  bolted  
on.    The  upper  portion  of  the  body  houses  the  batteries,  which  are  accessible  via  access  panels  in  the  
side  of  the  vehicle.    The  rate  gyros  and  other  internal  metrology  units  sit  in  the  center  of  the  body,  
aligned with the axis of rotation.  Weight-bearing handles are located on the outside of the body for ease  
vehicle transportation when not in operation.  <ALS>

The  lid  (Figure  2.8.4)  latches  onto  the  top  of  the  vehicle.   Attached  to  the  underside  of  the  lid,  a  small  
truss holds  the electronics circuit boards for  the avionics, communications, and metrology systems.   The  
electronics  are  connected  via  one  or  two  power/electronics  umbilicals  to  the  rest  of  the  vehicle  so  that  
when  the  lid  is  removed  and  replaced,  there are a minimum number of connections  to worry about.   All  
communications  and  metrology  transmitters  and  receivers  are  located  on  the  top  of  the  lid,  thereby  
maintaining  direct  connection  with  the  electronics  on  the  truss.    Also  on  the  top  of  the  lid,  a  power  
switch  and  a  reboot  button  provide  manual  user  interface  to  the  vehicle,  and  a  handle  allows  easy  
disassembly/reassembly.  <ALS>

When  the  vehicle  is  in  the  disassembled  state,  all  subsystem  teams  should  be  able  to  access  their  
components  easily.    In  addition,  other  than  the  avionics,  communications,  and  metrology  teams,  who  
must  all  share  the  lid,  all  teams  may  access  and  work  on  their  physical  systems  independently  of  the  
other teams.  After maintenance is done, the vehicle is easily reassembled.  <ALS>  
  
2.8.3  Magnetic Shielding  

2.8.3.1  Purpose of Part  
  
Each  EMFFORCE  vehicle  has  various  electronic  subsystems  aboard,  as well  as  an  electromagnet.   The  
magnetic  shielding  exists  in  order  to  keep  the  crucial  electronic  subsystems  from malfunctioning due  to  
interference of the magnetic field. <GG>  
 

2.8.3.2  Interfacing 

 

The  magnetic  shielding  must  interface  with  the  vehicle  casing  of  the  system.    It  must  interface  in  a  
manner in which it successfully blocks the magnetic interference while minimizing mass.  <GG>  
 

2.8.3.3  Discussion of Trade Analysis 

 

When   choosing   the   magnetic   shielding,   trades   the   structure   team   needs   to   consider   cost,   mass,  
reliability, and application method. <GG>   
  
2.8.3.4 Summary of Options/Selection Criteria  
  
The structure  team will purchase a  test kit of shielding products from MuShield.   This kit  includes foils,  
plates, and sheets of magnetic shielding material.  Upon arrival of this kit the structure team will conduct  
tests  to  determine  the  reliability  of  each  usable  material  in  the  described  (2.8.3.4)  configuration.    The  
team  will  then  decide  on  the  material  with  the  lowest  mass  that  demonstrates  robust  shielding  of  the  
magnetic interference. <GG>  
  
2.8.4  Air Carriage  

2.8.4.1  Purpose of Part  
  
The  air  carriage  is  a  critical  component  for  testing  the  dynamics  of  the  system.    To  simulated  a  space  
environment,  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  external  forces  on  the  system,  including  those  caused  by  
frictional contact with the laboratory floor.  The air carriage provides a hydrostatic cushion of air to float  
the  vehicle  some  distance  off  the  floor.    The  carriage  must  maintain  sufficient  cushion  thickness  for  a  
given  vehicle  mass  so  as  to  keep  the  vehicle  from  touching  the  facility  floor  throughout  the  testing  
phase, both for steady-state translation and for slight disturbances of cushion thickness.  <ALS>  
  
  
  
  

98  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

2.8.4.2  Interfacing  
  
The  air  carriage  sits  at  the  bottom  of  the  vehicle  and  is  detachable  from  the  main  vehicle  body.    Its  
components for each vehicle are as follows:  three (3) cylindrical pucks, structural mount for the vehicle,  
pressure  regulator,  air  supply,  and  air  supply  connections.    The  air  supply  will  most  likely  be  a  small  
household compressor equipped with a  tank  to act as a capacitor and provide damping.    In  the event  the  
chosen  compressor  uses  alternating  current,  a  power  inverter would  be  required.    If not,  a direct battery  
connection (with a possible voltage regulator) will suffice.  <ALS>  
  
In  the  event  that  a  suitably  sized  compressor  cannot  be  found,  each  vehicle will  use  three  (3)  refillable  
carbon dioxide canisters (one tank per puck).  Each tank will require its own pressure regulator.  <ALS>  
  
2.8.4.3  Discussion of Trade Analysis  
  
When  designing  the  air  carriage  the  structure  team  will  look  at  the  trades  between  fabricated  air  
carriages  and  off-the-shelf  units.    The  characteristics  that  will  be  important  in  this  comparison  include  
cost  and  efficiency.    Fabricating  air  carriage  systems  (specifically,  the  pucks)  at  MIT  may  decrease  
costs, however  it may also decrease efficiency. Manufacturing  the pucks provides  the distinct advantage  
of  freedom  of  design  and  capability  for  experimentation.    Currently,  the  pucks  will  be  designed  by  the  
EMFFORCE  team and manufactured at MIT.   In  the event that the analysis leading to design is too time  
consuming  to  provide  an  optimum  design,  commercial  pucks  with  advertised  specifications  may  be  
purchased.  This case significantly increases the required structures budget.  < ALS, GG >  
  
There are also design trades involved with air tanks and compressors.  Though they limit the testing time  
to  a  few  minutes,  air  tanks  are  cheap,  light,  and  require  no  power  draw.    This  option  is  still  being  
investigated.    The  use  of  a  compressor  is  highly  desirable,  because  the  benefits  of  the  increased  testing  
time  available  far  outweigh  the  mass  and  power  cost.    Commercially  available  compressors  run  the  
gamut  of  mass,  power  draw,  pressure,  flow  output,  and  cost.      Investigation  will  be  conducted  to  
determine  the  desired  compressor.    Tank  air  supply  will  be  held  as  a  backup  plan  in  the  event  that  a  
suitable compressor cannot be found.  <ALS, GG>  
  
  
2.8.4.4  Design Stratagem  
  
The  design  problem  for  the  air  carriage  is  a  complicated  one.    All  of  the  objectives,  constraints,  and  
design  variables  are  linked  and  interdependent.    At  the  same  time  weight  is  maximized  for  a  given  
cushion  thickness,  for  example,  it  is  also  of  interest  to maximize  air  cushion  height  (to  enable  use  of  a  
rougher  floor)  for  a  given  weight.  However,  a  thicker  (or  thinner)  air  cushion  also  introduces  other  
modeling   problems   such   as   transitions   between   compressible   (sonic)   regions   and   incompressible  
regions.  The  design  variables  available  to  accomplish  this  optimal  design  are  supply  pressure,  puck  
radius, and supply orifice.  <ALS>  
  
Lubrication  theory  is  the  field  of  fluid  mechanics  required  to  describe  the  dynamics  of  the  sliding  air  
bearings.    It makes  appropriate  assumptions  and  theoretically  should  enable  the  structures  team  to  solve  
the  flow  and  optimize  the  design  parameters  of  supply  pressure  and  puck  radius.    Lubrication  theory

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

assumes a cushion  thickness, h,  that  is much, much  less  than  the radius of  the puck, Rp.   It also assumes  
a very low Reynolds number, which for a dynamic puck is given by:

dynamic viscosity, and h is the cushion thickness. (Gross 33)  <ALS> 
  
Having  just been  redirected  in  the  search  for an appropriate mathematical model,  the air carriage design  
is  currently  at  a  jumping  off  point.    Further  analysis will  involve  solving  the  governing  equations  from  
lubrication   theory   to  develop  relationships  between  the  critical  parameters:  load  capacity,  cushion  
height,  supply  pressure,  and  puck  size.    In  addition,  the  structure  team  must  now  take  into  account  the  
effect  of  compressible  effects  near  the  supply  orifice  and  assess  the  advantages  of  different  puck  
designs.   Examples of  such  puck designs are  shown  in Figure 2.8.5.   The various designs have different  
pressure profiles and exhibit different characteristics in stiffness and disturbance rejection.  <ALS> 

 

  
  
  

2.8.5  External Interfaces  

The  structure  subsystem  must  interface  with  all  subsystems  except  control.    Structure  must  provide  the  
attachments  and  interfaces  for  all physical  components, while  retaining  easy access  to parts and  subsystems  
during the building and operating phases.  <ALS>  
  
The structure team must also ensure that the magnetic shielding is sufficient for the size and field strength of  
the magnet and will sufficiently protect the electronics. <ALS>  
  
In  the  event  that  air  compressors  are  used  for  the  air  supply,  an  interface with  the  power  subsystem will be  
required.  <ALS>

The  structure  of  the  vehicle  plays  an  integral  part  in  the  physical  system.    Although  the  mission  of  the  
EMFFORCE  team does not directly depend on  the structure  itself, an efficiently designed physical structure  
will prove itself a necessity in the success of the testbed. <GG>

3.1  Budgets  
  
The  systems  engineering  team  is  responsible  for  allocating  the  budgets  of money, mass,  and  power  for  each  of  
the  subsystems.    Each  subsystem  of  the  EMFFORCE  project  has  reported  estimated  budgets  for  each  of  the  
categories.    The  systems  group  then  determines  and  balances  budgets  such  that  EMFFORCE  can  achieve  its  
project   goal.      Because   the   mission   objective   of   EMFFORCE   is   to   demonstrate   the   feasibility   of  
electromagnetically-controlled  formation  flight,  the  budgeting  of  money,  mass,  and  power must  help  to  ensure  
that  this  task  can  be  achieved.    For  instance,  in  many  cases,  certain  subsystems  can  incorporate  previously  
designed  technology  into  the  testbed  vehicle  design  to  ease  budgeting  concerns  and  allow  for  more  accurate  
budgeting estimate needs.   The controls and electromagnet teams have been asked to complete a design that has  
not  be  done  before.    For  this  reason,  it  is  more  difficult  to  determine  a  working  design  and  thus  determine  
budgeting for these subsystems.  <SJS>  
  
The  processes  group  had  set  up  spreadsheets  using  Microsoft  Excel  to  aid  in  the  budgeting  process.    These  
spreadsheets   allow   for   inputs   of   estimated   expenditures,   and   graphical   outputs   can   allow   the   systems  
engineering  team  to  determine  if  the  EMFFORCE  team  is  on  track  to  complete  the  project  while  maintaining  
necessary budgets.    If EMFFORCE  appears  to be  in  a  “safe  zone”  as  far  as money, mass,  and power budgeting  
is  concerned,  the  subsystems  can  continue  with  the  design  process  as  planned.    However,  if  there  is  any  
indication  that  the  team may  surpass  the  budgets  allotted,  reallocation of  subsystem budgets  as well as changes  
in project design will occur. <SJS>  
  

3.1.1  Cost Budget 

 


The EMFFORCE team must work in compliance with the given monetary budget of $50,000.   
Continuous tracking of the estimated expenditures on both the subsystem and the system level help to  
ensure that the cost of the project does not exceed this budget that has been given to the team. <SJS>

3.1.2 Power Budget  
  

  

It  is  necessary  to  determine  subsystem  power  budgeting  to  ensure  that  the  vehicles  are  functional.    The  
Power subsystem  is responsible for allocating power  to all other subsystems in a vehicle.  If it is determined  
that  not  enough  power  or  enough  different  voltages  can  be  supplied  to  the  individual  subsystems,  then  the  
Systems  team must notify  the various subsystem  teams of  the problem, and alterations in subsystem designs  
may need to occur. <SJS>

3.1.3 Mass Budget  
  
Mass budgeting is crucial to the success of EMFFORCE.  The vehicles are electromagnetically controlled;  
therefore, the greater the total mass of the vehicle, the larger and more powerful the electromagnet will have  
to be.  For this reason, the EMFFORCE project is primarily a mass-driven optimization problem.  The  
Formation Flight, Electronics, and Structures groups are therefore attempting to minimize the masses of  
their respective subsystems. <SJS>

3.2  Parts  
  
Many  parts  will  need  to  be  either  purchased  or  fabricated  in  order  to  build  the  EMFFORCE  vehicle  testbed.   
The Processes Group has set up various validation and verification procedures to increase the chance of success  
for  the project.   These procedures shall be followed by  the EMFFORCE  team members and will be enforced by  
the  systems  team.   The Validation and verification processes are outlined  in  the following processes documents  
in the systems team folder: 23-1 Component and System Verification and 23-2 Component Validation. <SJS>  
  
  

3.2.1 Validation  

As defined by the EMFFORCE Processes group, validation is the name for the procedures designed to  
demonstrate that a newly received part meets design specifications as per the design document.  This can  
also be envisioned as “getting the right part.” <SJS, BAB>  
  
All  parts will  be  validated  before  they  are  fabricated  or  purchased.    If  a  part  is  to be procured,  a  requisition  
form  (entitled  Requisitions  Form  V1.0)  must  be  completed  and  the  part  can  be  ordered  once  it  has  been  
validated.    Purchased  parts  will  be  checked  against  the  specifications  and  tolerances  given.    Only  if  the  
purchased part meets all specifications and tolerances will the part be validated.  If a part is to be fabricated,  
the  fabrication  can  commence  only  after  the  validation  process  is  followed.    Fabricated  parts  will  be  
checked  against  the  specifications  and  tolerances  given  to  the  fabricator  prior  to  fabrication.    Only  if  the  
fabricated part meets all specification and tolerances will the part be validated. <ESS, SJS>  
  
  

3.2.2 Verification  

 

The  EMFFORCE  team  shall  make  use  of  the  term   “verification”  
to  describe  procedures  designed  to  
demonstrate that a part or system meets design requirements as per the requirements document.  This can be  
thought of as  “getting the part or system right.”  <SJS, BAB>  
  
The process of verification includes ensuring that the system or subsystem meets requirements and  
providing a means by which to verify that the requirements are being met.  This process occurs in three  
phases <SJS, BAB>:  
  
Phase  One:  Determining  Requirements  Flowdown.    Before  a  system  or  subsystem  is  created  that  
team  must  obtain  the  applicable  system  or  subsystem  requirements  and  the  interface  specifications  
required  by  other  teams  or  groups.    The  system  designers  must  also  obtain  a  resource  budget.    This  
budget will  include mass, power, cost,  time, error, flops, etc.   As appropriate, each team ’s design for the  
system or subsystem must meet all the requirements within the allotted resources. <BAB, ESS>  
  
Phase Two:   Test Design.   (The  layout of  the  test plan  is entitled Test Plan Document, CDIO Form 32-
121  ).    As  part  of  designing  a  particular  system  or  subsystem,  the  team  is  required  to  design  a  testing  
procedure for their subsystem.  This testing procedure must establish that the system meets all applicable  
requirements and that all interfaces are within specification.  The team itself will decide upon this testing  
procedure.  Any resources used by the team in the designed test will be taken out of that team ’s resource  
budget, and must be accounted for in the subsystem design. <SJS, BAB, ESS>  

108

       5/16/2002  

  
Phase  Three:    Verification  of  Results  (entitled  Verification  Review  Document,  CDIO  Form  32-122.)   
Once  the  test  designed  in  Phase Two  has  been  performed,  the  team will  evaluate  the data brought  forth  
by  the  test and check  the aquired data against  the requirements and constraints.   Only if all requirements  
and resource constraints are met may the team verify the system or subsystem. <SJS, BAB, ESS>  
  
If  a  part  is  found  to  be  non-compliant,  a  noncompliance  document  (CDIO  Forms  23-291  and  23-292)  
that can be found in the systems folder must be completed.

3.4  Operations  
  

 

3.4.1  Operations Overview 


The  ultimate  goal  of  the  CDIO  program  is  to  successfully  operate  the  completed  EMFFORCE  testbed  at  a  
flat  floor  facility  in Lockheed Martin’s Technology Development Lab  in Denver.   All  subsystems must  not  
only work  as  designed,  but must  come  together  into  a  complete  operational  system  that  can  perform  useful  
research in a deployed location. <ESS>  

The  EMFFORCE  mission  is  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  EMFF.    This  can  only  be  done  through  
planned  experimentation  with  coordinated  data  collection  and  analysis.    Every  member  of  the  team  must  
know  exactly  what  is  going  on,  and  be  able  to  perform  the  mission  and  overcome  in  real-time  whatever  
setbacks may occur while Project EMFFORCE is deployed to Denver. <ESS>  
 

3.4.1.1  Priorities 


The   following  priorities   are   set   forth   by  Operations  Team   to   guide   all  operational  planning  and  
implementation:  
(cid:1)	 Safety.    Safety  is  paramount,  as  the  well-being  of  our  team  members  is  more  important  than  
completing  the  project.    The  EMFFORCE  team  must  also  safeguard  the  testing  facility  and  
associated  equipment  against  damage  from  system  malfunction.     Personal   injury  or  severe  
infrastructure damage will negate any mission successes that may have been achieved. <ESS>  
(cid:1)	 Equipment  Longevity.    Equipment  longevity  must  be  promoted  at  all  levels.    The  two  most  
valuable  system  resources,  time  and  money,  both  suffer  when  parts  break  and  need  to  be  either  
repaired or replaced.  Conservative stewardship of materiel will pay off in the long run. <ESS>  
(cid:1)	 Mission  Completion.    Mission  completion,  which  includes  the  satisfaction  of  all  operational  
requirements  listed  for  the  system  (given  in  the  introduction)  and  is  determined  by  the  system  
test  program.    The  objective  of  the  project  is  to make  the  testbed work  and  prove  the  feasibility  
of EMFF. <ESS>  
(cid:1)	 Efficiency.    Efficiently  planning  and  conducting  operations  will  save  time  and  money.    The  
EMFFORCE  Team  should  do  as  little  work  and  spend  as  little  money  as  possible  without  
jeopardizing the above priorities. <ESS>  

  

3.4.1.2  Mission  

The mission of the Operations Element of the EMFFORCE Team is threefold:  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Operations-oriented Development.  Guide the development of the EMFFORCE project with respect to the  
operational  architecture.    The  operational  architecture  is  just  as  important  as  any  other  subsystem  architecture,  
and interfaces closely with all subsystems. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Field Operations.   Develop  the Field Operations Plan  for  the  transportation of  the class  to  the Denver Test  
Site.   The EMFFORCE  team must be able  to move  itself and  the vehicle  to  the  test site as efficiently and safely  
as possible. <ESS>  

113  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Test  Program.    Develop  the  Test  Program  Operations  Plan  that  will  be  executed  at  the  test  site.    The  
program  will  determine  if  the  EMFFORCE  Team  has  accomplished  the  mission,  and  will  provide  evidence  to  
support that finding. <ESS>  

This version of the Design Document specifies the operational architecture design and outlines the major  
elements  of  the  Operations  Plan  designs.    The  formal  EMFFORCE  Operations  Plan  that  contains  the  
Field  and  Test  Program  Operations  Plans  will  be  completed  as  the  system  matures,  towards  the  end  of  
Fall 2002. <ESS>  

  

  

  

  
3.4.2  Operations-oriented Development  

At  the  end  of  the  development  cycle,  the  vehicles  will  need  to  operate  in  the  field.    However,  there  is  a  
lengthy   development   process   during  which   it  may   be   possible   to   lose   sight   of   the   end-state.     The  
EMFFORCE Team must  therefore  incorporate planning for  the eventual operation of  the  test bed  into every  
aspect  of  system  development,  beginning  with  the  earliest  design  stage.    In  order  to  accomplish  this,  an  
operational  architecture must  be  specified  and  updated  parallel  to  the  architectures of  the other  subsystems.   
By  integrating  operational  considerations  into  all  aspects  of  product  development,  the  EMFFORCE  team  
seeks to minimize the costs of operation and maximize the probability of success. <ESS>  

3.4.2.1  Scope and Architecture Overview  

The operational  architecture  is  the  responsibility  of  the Operations Element of  the Communications and  
Operations  Team.    All  hardware  not  physically  part  of  the  test  vehicles  and  all  procedures  employed  
outside  of  the  laboratory  development  environment  are  included  in  this  architecture.    The  Operations  
Element  is  also  responsible  for  interfaces with  external  organizations  and  facilities.    It  is  necessary  that  
all  subsystem  teams  maintain  an  interface  with  this  operational  architecture  to  promote  successful  
operation of the test bed in the end-state. <ESS>  

The  operational  architecture  must  account  for  all  operational  constraints  and  actively  promote  the  
Operational   Priorities   listed   in   subsection   3.4.1.1.      It   accomplishes   this   by   establishing   discrete  
operational   states,   system   health   monitoring   procedures,   failure   minimization   procedures,   and  
emergency operational states. <ESS>  

3.4.2.2  Operational Constraints  

When  operating  the  EMFFORCE  testbed  outside  of  the  MIT  development  laboratories,  additional  
constraints are placed on  the system.   Failure  to account for  these constraints early on will  lead  to costly  
revision later in the development cycle. <ESS>  

The  flat  floor  testing  facility  at  the  Lockheed  Martin  Technology  Development  Laboratory  in  Denver,  
CO is a unique testing environment that brings unique constraints to the project.  The maximum pressure  
at  any  point  on  the  floor  is  500  psi  (3.5  Mpa).    EMFFORCE  personnel  may  walk  on  the  floor  with  
restricted  footwear.   The  floor  is protected as a clean environment; personnel will have  to wear  lint-free  
clothes  and  guard  against  other  types  of  contamination  according  to  the  clean  room  procedures  at  the  
facility, thus adding more time to test preparation. <ESS>  

114  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

The  laptop  ground  station  must  be  able  to  monitor  the  appropriate  RF  frequencies  and  must  have  a  
source  of  power  to  sustain  operations.    The  ground  station  must  record  data  in  real-time  as  it  is  
generated. <ESS>  

The  batteries  used  by  the  vehicles  will  need  to  recharge,  and  the  Operations  Element  and  Power  Team  
must secure the necessary resources on-site. <ESS>  

Other  constraints  will  be  added  as  development  continues,  and  must  be  incorporated  into  the  final  
design. <ESS>  

  

3.4.2.3  Normal Operational States  

To  facilitate  work  division  and  modularity,  the  Operations  Element  has  characterized  the  operation  of  
the  testbed  by  several  system  operational  states.    These  states  are  independent,  self-contained,  and  
mutually  exclusive;  the  system  may  move  from  one  to  another  only  when  directed  to  do  so  by  the  
operator  or when  the  software  detects  pre-programmed  conditions  that  authorize  and mandate  a  change  
of  state.    The  states  direct  software,  hardware,  and  operator  actions,  thus  unifying  all  elements  of  the  
system in a combined operational architecture. <ESS>  

  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Safe Mode.    In Safe Mode,  the  system powers down all actuation  subsystems while not changing  the status  
of  the avionics, communications, metrology, and control subsystems.   If  the system detects certain faults, it will  
enter  Safe  Mode.    This  prevents  the  system  from  going  further  out  of  control,  but  preserves  data  for  analysis.   
Operators  may  also  place  the  system  into  Safe Mode  by  hitting  the  Big  Red  Button  located  on  the  top  of  each  
vehicle. <ESS>  
Initialization.    In  this  state,  the vehicle powers up  the electronics and checks for faults before  the operators  
(cid:1)(cid:2)
place  the  vehicle  on  the  floor.   With  the  vehicles  near  the  entrance  but  off  the  test  floor,  an  operator manually  
toggles  the  master  power  switch,  which  turns  on  the  avionics  subsystem.    The  communications  subsystem  is  
also  activated,  and  the  ground  station  designates  a  vehicle  as  the  hub,  illuminating  an  LED  on  the  selected  
vehicle.    The  system  runs  automatic  diagnostics  of  avionics  and  communications  functions  and  transmits  the  
results to the laptop ground station.  If a fault is detected, the system enters Safe Mode.  If the diagnostics detect  
a  communications  fault,  the  avionics  illuminate  an LED  and  the  operators may  dump  the data via  serial port  to  
the  ground  station.    If  all  avionics  and  communications  diagnostics  complete  successfully,  the  system  informs  
the operators that it is ready for deployment. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Deployment.    Deployment  activates  the  metrology  and  air  carriage  subsystems  and  guides  the  vehicles  to  
their  initial  positions.    EMFFORCE  personnel  place  the  vehicles  manually  on  the  floor.    The  ground  station  
transmits  the  planned  mission  to  the  vehicles,  including  initial  position,  desired  steady  state  flight  parameters,  
and  other  variables.   The metrology  subsystem  is  activated  and  runs  its  own  diagnostics.    If  a  fault  is  detected,  
the  system enters Safe Mode.   Otherwise, an operator activates  the air carriage  subsystem while other operators  
move  to  monitoring  positions  on  the  test  floor.    The  metrology  subsystem  takes  data  to  assist  the  operators  in  
moving  the  vehicles  to  the  commanded  initial  positions.    The  operators  then  position  the  vehicles  in  the  
commanded  initial  positions.    When  the  metrology  subsystem  indicates  that  the  relative  vehicle  positions  are  
acceptable  and  stable,  the  Control  system  is  activated  in  diagnostic mode  and  the  actuation  system  is  activated  
in  standby mode.   System health monitoring devices are also powered on and begin  to provide health  telemetry  
to  the  ground  station.   Once  diagnostics  have  been  completed  successfully,  i.e.,  the  system has  determined  that  

115  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

the  control  system  can  communicate  as  designed  with  the  actuation  devices,  the  operator  may  initiate  Spin-up  
by command from the ground station. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Spin-up.    At  the  command  to  initiate  spin-up,  the  actuation  devices  leave  standby  mode  and  act  upon  
commands  from  the  control  subsystem.   The  control  subsystem  commands  the  actuation  subsystem  to  steer  the  
system  towards  the  steady  state goal by using  the Spin-up algorithm.   The  system  leaves Spin-up mode when  it  
either  has  reached  the  steady  state  or  is  commanded  to  safe  mode  by  operator  input  or  the  fault  detection  
system. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Steady-state  Rotation.     When  metrology   indicates   that   the  system  is  within  the  desired  steady-state  
parameters, the system automatically enters steady-state rotation mode without operator input.  In this mode, the  
control  algorithm  changes  to maintain  the  desired  rotational  velocity.   The  system may  exit  this mode  upon  an  
operator command  to De-spin or enter Safe Mode, or upon an automatic command to enter Safe Mode resulting  
from operator inattention. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) De-spin.    De-spin  switches  the  control  algorithm  again  to  bring  the  vehicles  to  rest  from  the  Steady-state  
Rotation Mode.   This  is  the  fault  remediation method  used while  control  is  still possible,  as  it  should bring  the  
system  to  rest  with  the  minimum  chance  for  damage.    After  the  vehicles  have  completed  De-spin,  they  are  
placed in Safe Mode for recovery by operator command. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Recovery.   Upon  entering  Safe Mode,  the  operators will  attempt  first  to  bring  the  vehicles  to  rest  and  then  
move  them  off  the  floor.   Once  the vehicles  are off  the  floor,  the  air  carriage  is powered down.    If  there  are no  
faults, the vehicles may be powered down to the Off state by using the master power switch. <ESS>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) Off.    The  state  where  none  of  the  electronics  systems  is  drawing  current  and  the  air  carriage  is  inactive.  
<ESS>  
  

3.4.2.4  System Health Monitoring and Operator Interface  

Critical  variables  are  monitored  by  the  subsystems  and  transmitted  to  the  operations  ground  station.   
These  health  variables  include  electromagnet  core  and wire  temperatures,  air  carriage delivery pressure,  
reaction  wheel  speed  and  vibration,  power  supply  voltage  and  amperage,  and  control  error  for  the  
eighteen  system  state  variables.    These  critical  variables  may  fall  into  one  of  three  ranges  classified  as  
Green, Yellow, or Red.   The  several  subsystem  teams are  responsible  for placing monitoring equipment  
to report the status of these critical variables. <ESS>  

The  safety  officer  is  responsible  for  monitoring  this  data  in  real-time  during  operation.    Green  is  the  
normal  operating  range  for  all  variables, which will  be  determined by  a  combination of  experiment  and  
design.    The  ground  station  laptop  displays  the  variables,  and  provides  warnings  to  the  operator  if  any  
reach  the Yellow  level.   The  safety officer  in  conjunction with  the  test  supervisor may  choose  to  ignore  
the warning,  or may  take  corrective  action.    If  any  of  the  variables  reach  the Red  level,  the  system will  
either de-spin or enter Safe Mode without an explicit override from the ground station. <ESS>  

  

3.4.2.5  Failure Minimization  

During development,  equipment  longevity  is  an  operational  priority.   The EMFFORCE  team has a  tight  
budget   and   cannot   afford   to  waste  money   on   preventable   equipment   destruction.     Therefore,   all  
laboratory  testing  must  follow  a  documented  test  plan,  which  should  be  well-considered  and  minimize  
risk. <ESS>  

116  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

The  consequences  of  failure  in  the  field  are  even  greater  than  in  the  lab,  because  the  necessary  repair  
facilities might  not  be  available  and  the  time  budget will  be  tightly  constrained.   To make  the operation  
successful,  things  need  to  go  right  on  the  first  try  as  much  as  possible.    Thorough  testing  and  system  
integration practice prior to departure will serve this end. <ESS>  

In   order   to   perform   effective   field   maintenance,   the   vehicles   are   designed   with   operational  
considerations  in  mind.    Access  panels  and  removable  modules  provide  easy  access  for  maintenance  
technicians.      The   modules   themselves   and   all   the   subunits   are   interchangeable,   making   field  
replacements  more  expedient.    Finally,  all  Teams  are  expected  to  track  failures  carefully  during  testing  
and prepare documentation on failure modes to aid in rapid diagnosis in the field. <ESS>  
  
3.4.2.6  Fault Remediation and Emergency States  

While  the  initialization  and  deployment  diagnostics  seek  to  detect  faults  before  the  system  is  fully  
activated,  thus  minimizing  the  impact  of  the  failure,  many  factors  may  lead  to  emergency  conditions  
requiring fault remediation during operation. <ESS>  

Safe Mode  is  implemented  to  prevent  further damage as a  result of a  failure.   On  the actual  test  floor,  it  
is conceivable  that  the control and/or actuation systems may fail  to maintain controllability.   There must  
be  a  mechanism  in  place  to  bring  the  vehicles  safely  to  rest.    If  the  system  is  no  longer  controllable,  it  
automatically  enters  Safe  Mode.    Operators  on  the  floor  must  catch  the  vehicles  and  manually  bring  
them to rest for recovery. <ESS>  

De-spin Mode may  be  commanded  by  the  operator  to  prevent  a  problem  from becoming  a  fault.    If,  for  
example,  the  magnet  core  temperature  or  air  carriage  delivery  pressure  enters  the  Yellow  range,  the  
operator may  command  an  immediate De-spin  rather  than concluding  the  test.   By bringing  the vehicles  
to rest in a controlled manner, the risk of damage is minimized. <ESS>  

  
3.4.3  Field Operations  

Only after a successful deployment to and assembly at the test site can the actual system test program begin.   
To  get  to  Denver,  EMFFORCE  needs  a  Field  Operations  Plan.    The  following  is  an  overview  of  the  
important  elements  that  will  be  included  in  the  Field  Operations  Plan,  including  personnel,  materiel,  and  
facilities considerations. <ESS>  
  
3.4.3.1  Personnel  

Personnel, the most valuable resource in the EMFFORCE program, require a lot of work to get from one  
point  to another.   For  the deployment of  the EMFFORCE Team  to Denver,  the Operations Element will  
have to arrange for all travel, lodging, food, and scheduling considerations. <ESS>  

The EMFFORCE Team will be divided into three travel groups for the deployment.  The Advance Team  
will  consist  of  3-4  personnel  arriving  in  Denver  6-18  hours  ahead  of  the  Equipment  Group  in  order  to  
secure  transportation  and  lodging.    Transportation will  consist  of  two  15-passenger  vans,  one  for  cargo  
and  the  other  for  personnel.    Depending  on  the  remaining  budget,  the  Advance  Team  may  also  secure  
food  for  the main  group.    It  is  easier  to make  these  arrangements with  a  small  group  unencumbered  by  
cargo.   The Equipment Group of 12-15 personnel will travel with the EMFFORCE cargo and will arrive  

117  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

in  Denver  the  evening  before  scheduled  testing.    The  Follow-on  Team  of  2-4  personnel  will  leave  
Boston around 0600 on the day of testing and arrive in Denver around mid-morning. <ESS>  

Once  the EMFFORCE Team  is  reassembled,  all personnel must be  fully prepared  to do  their  individual  
parts for  the  test program.   All personnel must also be adequately prepared to troubleshoot the system in  
the field, and this will require training and documentation.  The Operations Element especially will need  
to be very familiar with the ground station interface. <ESS>  
  
3.4.3.2  Materiel  

The   test  vehicles  will  need   to  be  broken  down  and  securely  packaged   to  prevent  damage.     The  
Equipment Group will  transport  them via  commercial airline.   The Equipment Group will need  to bring  
all  necessary  spare  parts,  diagnostic  and  repair  tools,  and  other  operations  support  equipment  into  the  
field.    The Operations  Team  and  Systems Group will  create  an  inventory  of what  needs  to  go;  Systems  
Group will track the deployment mass and volume budgets. <ESS>  

Upon  arrival  in  Denver,  the  equipment  will  be  unpacked  and  visually  and  electronically  inspected  for  
damage  during  transport  and  for  completeness.    It  should  be  possible  to  bring  the  vehicles  up  through  
Deployment  Mode  without  specialized  laboratory  facilities.    If  any  problems  are  found,  the  Follow-on  
Team will be notified and will try to gather any necessary equipment prior to their departure. <ESS>  
  
3.4.3.3  Facilities  

Prior  to  and  upon  arrival  at  the  Lockheed  facility,  EMFFORCE  will  have  to  coordinate  with  the  
appropriate  Lockheed  personnel  to  arrange  for  facility  use  and  support.    The  scheduling  of  time  at  the  
facility will  have  a  direct  impact  on  both  arrival  times  and  the  length  of  tests  that  can  be  implemented.   
Therefore,  it  is  advantageous  for  the  EMFFORCE  Team  to  know  exactly  what  will  happen  as  far  in  
advance as possible. <ESS>  

To  this  end,  Operations  element  will  negotiate  a  contract  with  Lockheed  Martin  that  specifies  exactly  
which  services  will  be  received,  when  they  will  be  received,  and  who  the  points-of-contact  are  in  
Denver. <ESS>  

  

3.4.4  Test Program   

The EMFFORCE Team  is utilizing  the Denver Test Facility because  the Flat Floor Facility  there  is  the only  
one  in  the  country  that will  provide  opportunity  to  adequately  evaluate  the  complete  system with  respect  to  
its  operational  requirements  of  far-field  EMFF.    Simply  getting  to  the  site  is  very  expensive,  and  every  
effort must be made to ensure that the time spent there is fully utilized. <ESS>  

Therefore,  the  test  program  must  be  completely  specified  well  before  deployment  to  ensure  that  it  will  
accomplish  the  mission  objectives,  which  are  laid  out  in  the  requirements  document.    Every  trial  to  be  
executed  should be pre-loaded  into data  files  for  transmission  to  the  test vehicles.   Plans must also be made  
to  vary  the  test  program  if  the  schedule  begins  to  slip,  such  as  prioritizing  the  tests  and  criteria  to  evaluate  
when skipping certain tests may be justified. <ESS>  

The measurable outcomes must  be  tracked  and  accounted  for  in  the  early  stages of  the  test program design.   
The  test program  itself will be made up of a series of tests to demonstrate these requirements, and there will  

118  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

likely be a limited schedule with which the Operations Element can work.  All aspects of the operation must  
be  accounted  for,  including  set  up  of  the  facility,  time  required  for  repairs,  modification,  and  battery  
recharging. <ESS>  

The  test  program  will  be  the  first  time  the  full  system  has  been  evaluated,  and  will  be  the  first  true  
simultaneous verification of all the subsystem models.  While most concepts should have been demonstrated  
in  lab,  the  combination  of  all  systems  brings  new  complexities  to  the  planning  process.    Similarly,  the  test  
program  will  be  the  first  time  the  planning  and  craftsmanship  of  the  full  system  have  been  evaluated,  and  
the results, if positive, will be a good indicator that EMFF is indeed feasible. <ESS>  

The protocols and procedures designed to prepare the class for the test program require extra paperwork and  
close  coordination  between  teams.    The  procedures  must  be  reviewed  extensively  by  all  Teams  to  ensure  
nothing is overlooked. <ESS>

D.1 Data Framing  
  
  

Figure D.1.3: Data Framing  
This figure demonstrates the proposed data framing protocol for the EMFFORCE communications  
subsystem. <JEU>  

  

Data framing determines how data is to be packaged prior to transmission. It is necessary to design the data  
framing architecture as soon as possible to aid in structuring the framing coding algorithm.  It is also an  
essential part of any communications system design. <JEU> 

The current protocol is demonstrated in the above figure and is described in more detail below <JEU>:  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Start byte: This byte says: “This is the start of a data packet. Pay attention!”  The start byte may  
also incorporate a global time stamp. <JEU>  
(cid:1)(cid:2) From/To: This byte ensures that a piece of info is routed to the right recipient and says which vehicle (or the  
Ground Station) sent the info.  If a vehicle receives a data packet that is not intended for it, the information  
is filtered, and after a delay period, deleted.  The delay period is merely to ensure that if the Ground Station  
switches the Hub, that the new Hub has enough information to keep propagating the formation. <JEU>  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Type: The data type tells the recipient what type of data to expect.  The type could include: a  
command, health information, control state updates, a request, a retransmission, or the token.  
<JEU>  

(cid:1)	 Size: The size (# of bytes of data) tells the recipient how many bytes to expect before the packet is  
completed. <JEU>  

(cid:1)	 Error-checking: Provides a way of ensuring accurate data.  If the data is not accurate, then there  
should either be enough information in the check byte to determine what the correct data is, or a  
retransmission of the original data should be requested.  It may also be possible to use some error-
checking/error-correction methods within the header itself.  The implementation of such a system  
depends on error probabilities and the limits on the rate of information transmission. <JEU>   
Finally, there is a possibility that the header can be compressed to cut down on the size of the packet (and hence, the  
time of transmission).  <JEU>  
Currently, it is desired to use one byte for each section of the header since the TT8 UART channel operates in 8-bit  
pieces and because it results in encoding flexibility. <JEU>

Figure D.1.4: Preliminary Coding Scheme for From/To Header  

The above table shows a preliminary coding scheme for the From/To chunk of the Header.  Only those  
transmission paths that will be used for the Hybrid subsystem Architecture have been assigned codes.  
<JEU>  

The current code minimizes bit errors by encoding with a 2-bit difference between adjacent levels.  Hence, if a packet  
arrives from the Hub, there is a 2-bit difference in the code determining for which vehicle (or the Ground Station) the  
packet was intended.  Hence, it is highly unlikely that a packet will arrive from one place claiming to have come from  
another. <JEU>  

The From Ground encoding scheme is slightly different.  This communication path will only be used if it is  
necessary to give Hub status to another vehicle or to apply any other emergency intervention procedure.   
Since this will (hopefully) happen very rarely, it is safe to leave the code as not quite a 2-bit difference.  In  
addition to a simple parity check, the From/To header can be matched with the type of command to  
determine whether the Ground Station is indeed switching Hub status within the cluster.  If the header and  
the type match, then the vehicle will heed the command, but if the header and the type do not match, then  
the vehicle will ignore the command. <JEU>  

Also, the current code enables a second layer of bit-error detection by utilizing a simple 1-bit             
modulo2 parity check-sum. Thus, the From/To byte will look something like: 00001111.  <JEU>  

The preliminary breakdown of data types and the coding schemes to go with them are as follows <JEU>:    

Ground to Hub:  

(cid:1)(cid:2) User command (111 1)  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Emergency command (100 1)  

Hub to Vehicles:  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Hub command (110 0)

(cid:1)(cid:2) Emergency Intervention (11111 1)  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Hub switch (111111 0)  
Once again there exists a 2-bit difference between adjacent levels and a single bit check sum. <JEU>  

There are a few differences.  First, the token ring commands are assigned an extra 1.  This will allow the  
vehicle that receives the token to immediately know if it is able to talk or if the token is being used by  
another vehicle.  The use of a free token and a busy token is in accordance with normal token ring design.  
<JEU>  

The Type byte will look something like: 00001001. <JEU>  

The free token will look like: 00011101. <JEU>  

The busy token will look like: 00011110. <JEU>  

If there is an emergency, and the Ground Station must send a command to one of the vehicles, then an extra  
1 on top of the free token should alert the vehicle being queried that it has been sent a command from the  
Ground. <JEU>  

The Emergency intervention will look like: 00111111. <JEU>  

If a Hub switch is required in the cluster, than two extra 1’s on top of the busy token should alert the vehicle  
being queried that it is now the Hub.  <JEU>  

The Hub switch will look like: 01111110. <JEU>  

143

       5/16/2002  

A comparison of the Hub Switch, the From/To header, and the parity checks should enable the receiving  
vehicle to know whether it is being switched to Hub on purpose or by accident.  If it is by accident, then the  
Vehicle ignores the request. <JEU>  

These assignments only hold true if the current 8-bit framing is maintained. <JEU>  

  

D.2. Communication Channel Usage  
Currently, there are 6 variables in the state vector (the x and y positions, the angle orientation, and the derivatives  
thereof), and 4 variables to the actuators (3 voltage/current commands to the EM and 1 to the RWA) per vehicle.   
Preliminary calculations using a spreadsheet suggest this will result in about 800 bits being transmitted per cycle. This  
number is with 10% retransmission and includes framing bytes. The cluster communication channel will also be  
carrying about 500 bits/cycle to deal with health updates necessary for ensuring cluster survival. <JEU> 
Also, it is expected that the channel connecting to the ground station will be around 400 bits/cycle or about that order  
of magnitude.  However, since the requirements are as yet still undefined for the data that will be transferred over this  
link, a better estimate cannot be made. <JEU>  

These estimates are made for one complete cycle of the system (as generalized in architecture trades).  
<JEU>  

  

D.3. Transmission Rate Estimation  

Since the control runs at 50 Hz (e.g.: how frequently the systems/states are measured), and since the rate at  
which health data is measured is set at a max of 10 Hz (estimate), we can estimate the transmission rate of  
the channel.  This was found to be around 45 kbps when considering the estimated needs of both control and  
health data. <JEU> 
  

800 bits/cycle * 50 cycles/sec + 500 bits/cycle * 10 cycles/sec = 45kbps 


 


D.4. Error Detection/Correction  

In the current design, the Header utilizes single-bit parity checks in each section to detect bit errors.  <JEU>  

As in SPHERES, it is hoped to use a set of 8-bit check sums to detect errors in the data chunk.  SPHERES  
used two (2) 8-bit check sums. <JEU>  

Also, clever code will minimize timeout errors and errors associated with “broken ” packets (packets that  
have chunks lost in transmission). <JEU>  

Currently, the only scheme to correct errors is to request retransmission from the sender.  Codes should exist  
to allow for detection AND correction.  As of this publication of this document, further research is required  
to determine what these codes are and whether these codes should be implemented for this project.  
However, it may be possible to enhance the current coding scheme (as discussed in Appendix F.1) to obtain  
correction capabilities. <JEU>

D.5. Channel Coding  

Channel coding is the addition of redundant bits to improve accuracy.  There are several different ways to  
improve accuracy (communication accuracy is very important for this design).  The main types of channel  
coding are <JEU>:  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Repetition codes  
Repetition codes are what they sound like. They repeat the data at least once. <JEU>  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Block codes  

Data is broken into equal length blocks.  Each block is “mapped” onto larger blocks.  An example is  
the famous Hamming Code. <JEU>  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Systematic codes  

Systematic codes have a data part and a redundant part.  Block codes can be systematic codes as  
long as they have a data part and a redundant part.  Systematic codes are linearly independent and  
can be written as a generator matrix such that every codeword is a linear combination of the rows of  
the generator matrix. Using the generator matrix, one can also find a matrix that gives a parity    
check. <JEU>  

Currently, it is preferred that a systematic code be used since it will make the code needed to implement  
communications the scale of this project more efficient. <JEU>  

  

D.6. Automatic Repeat Request Protocols (ARQ’s)  

Automatic Repeat Request Protocols (ARQ’s) are designed to automatically request retransmission should  
there be an error in the data that has been sent.  There are three potential ARQ protocols: Stop and Wait, Go  
Back N, and Selective Repeat.  <JEU> 

The characteristics of each are listed below <JEU>:  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Stop and Wait  

Stop and wait transmits one packet at a time, then waits for an acknowledgement (ACK) before  
sending another packet. The protocol is easy to implement, but is not efficient when the delay is  
greater than the transmission time. <JEU>  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Go Back N (“Sliding Window”)  

Go Back N transmits new packets before all previously sent packets are acknowledged (Ack).  A  
benefit is the ability to implement bi-directional piggy-backing, where a request number can be sent  

145  

EMFFORCE DESIGN DOCUMENT  

  

  

       5/16/2002  

along with an acknowledgement and vice-versa.  The protocol is relatively easy to implement, but  
the entire window must be resent upon discovery of an error. <JEU>  

(cid:1)(cid:2) Selective Repeat  

Selective repeat only retransmits packets that are in error or are lost.  The protocol requires buffering  
to achieve this capability. A consequence of being able to retransmit packets that are in error or are  
lost is that the protocol requires more coding than Go Back N.  A major benefit is that Selective  
repeat is better than Go Back N when using a large transmission window. <JEU>  

The preliminary selection is Go Back N since it allows for bi-directional piggy-backing, is relatively easy to  
implement, and is fairly efficient (less efficient than Selective Repeat, but is much easier to implement).  
Should a large transmission window be chosen, or should the Go Back N method prove to not be efficient  
enough, it is possible to modify the code for Go Back N to achieve Selective Repeat. <JEU>
