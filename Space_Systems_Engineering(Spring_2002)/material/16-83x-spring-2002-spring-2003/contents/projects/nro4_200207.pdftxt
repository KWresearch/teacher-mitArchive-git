DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORT 
 
 
The Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (SSL)  and  the  Lockheed 
Martin  Advanced  Technology  Center  (ATC)  are  collaborating  to  explore  the  potential  for  an 
Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites  flying 
in close formation. 
 
PROGRESS OVERVIEW 
 

At  MIT,  work  on  electro-magnetic  formation  flight  (EMFF)  has  been  pursued  on  two 
fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design,  implement  and  operate  (CDIO)  class,  and  the  MIT  Space 
Systems Lab research group, as described in the April 2002 progress report. 
 
The  CDIO  class  has  completed  its  first  semester  performing  trades  on  and  preliminary 
design  of  a  six-degree-of-freedom  electromagnetic 
formation 
flight 
testbed,  called 
“ElectroMagnetic  Formation  Flight  of  Rotating  Clustered  Entities, ”  or 
“EMFFORCE. ”  
EMFFORCE  will  utilize  electromagnets  to  control  the  size  and  attitude  of  a  cluster  of  bodies.  
The MIT Space Systems Lab research staff is supporting the CDIO class with guidance in trades 
analysis and design. 
 
Recent work has  focused on  trade  analyses  for  the design of  the  electromagnets  that will 
be  used  in  the EMFFORCE  testbed.   These  electromagnets will  act  as  actuators,  controlling  the 
relative  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  bodies  that  compose  EMFFORCE.    The  following  report 
summarizes  recent  progress  on  the  trades  performed  in  the  design  of  the  EMFFORCE 
actuation system. 

 

 

Preliminary Trade Analysis for the Electromagnet 
Design for the EMFFORCE Testbed 

1  Actuation System Overview 
 
The  actuation  system  includes  the  electromagnet  and  reaction  wheel  subsystems.    The 
electromagnet  is  designed  to  provide  the  electromagnetic  force  and  torque  used  to  induce  the 
spin-up of the vehicles in formation, as well as to reject disturbances in the system during steady-
state  spin.    The  reaction  wheel  assembly  is  designed  to  provide  torque  to  counteract  the  torque 
induced  by  the  electromagnet.    Figure  1.2  shows  two  dipoles  at  rest  in  a  perpendicular 
orientation at a separation distance 2m.   The arrows represent  the direction of  the  induced  forces 
and  torques  on  the  dipoles.    Figure  1.3  depicts  the  spin-up  of  two  dipoles  from  an  initially 
perpendicular  orientation.    As  current  is  applied  to  the  dipoles,  they  begin  to  move  in  the 
direction  of  the  induced  forces  and  torques.    The  reaction wheel  is  then  used  to  apply  torque  to 
counteract  the  induced  torque.    This  applied  torque  is  then  decreased  until  the  dipoles  are  in 
steady-state rotation, aligned along the same axis.

2  Purpose of Electromagnet 
 
The  amount  of  force  induced  by  the  electromagnet,  made  up  of  a  solenoid  coil  and  core 
material,  is  dependent  upon  the  strength  of  its  magnetic  field.    The  solenoid  coil  produces  a 
magnetic  field  when  current  is  applied  to  it.    When  the  solenoid  is  wrapped  around  a 
ferromagnetic material, this core has the effect of multiplying the strength of the magnetic field. 
 

 

 

3  Design Trade Analysis 
 
For  the  electromagnet,  trade  analyses  were  performed  to  select  the  core  material,  core 
configuration, and mass of the core, coil, and system for the EMFFORCE testbed. 
 

3.1  Core Material 
 
One  of  the  main  focuses  of  the  EMFFORCE  project  is  to  optimize  the  amount  of  force 
generated by the electromagnet while minimizing its mass.  This force depends upon the strength 
of  the  induced  magnetic  field.    Therefore,  the  core  material  will  be  selected  based  on  magnetic 
properties that provide the maximum induced magnetic field at a minimum mass. 
 
When  current  is  applied  to  a  solenoid  wrapped  around  a  ferromagnetic  core,  a  magnetic 
field,  or  B-field,  is  induced  in  the  core.  As  the  current  is  increased,  the  strength  of  the  B-field 
increases  until  it  reaches  a  strength  that  cannot  be  exceeded  with  increasing  current.    This  is 
known as the saturation value, or Bsaturation, for a given material.  Table 3.1 compares the Bsaturation 
values and densities of several ferromagnetic materials.

Iron  and  steel  have  the  highest  values  for  Bsaturation  of  2.15  and  2.10  Tesla,  respectively.  
Both  iron  and  steel  have  the  same  density,  7.88  g/cm3, which  is  the  lowest  among  the magnetic 
materials  considered.    High  Bsaturation  values  combined  with  lower  densities  are  desirable 
properties to increase the strength of the induced magnetic field while keeping the mass as low as 
possible.

Figure 3.1:  Iron and Steel - Induced Field vs. Applied Field 

 
 
Figure 3.1  is a plot of  induced versus applied  field  for  iron  and  steel.   For higher values of 
the applied field, both iron and steel reach a Bsaturation point at approximately 2.1 Tesla.  However, 
for  lower  values  of  the  applied  field,  this  plot  shows  that  iron  has  higher  induced  field  values 
than steel.  This is important because it indicates that iron will induce a larger magnetic field, and 
therefore higher levels of force, than steel at low current levels. 
 
Another  magnetic  property  that  must  be  considered  is  the  hysteresis  effect.    When  a 
magnetic material is magnetized by an applied field, it will not completely demagnetize when the 
applied  field  is  reduced  to zero.    In order  to bring  the  induced  field back  to zero, a  field must be 
applied  in  the  opposite  direction.    The  strength  of  this  applied  field  is  called  the  coercive  force.  
The  coercive  force  for  iron  and  steel  are  79.6  and  143.2  Amps/m,  respectively.    Therefore, 
hysteresis  is  less  of  an  issue  with  iron  since  it  requires  less  of  an  applied  force  in  the  opposite 
direction to drive the induced field back to zero. 
 
Recently,  another  possibility  for  the  electromagnet  core  was  discovered.    Hiperco  50A,  a 
magnetic  alloy  made  up  of  48.9%  Fe  and  49.0%  Co,  exhibits  better  magnetic  properties  than 
iron, which was previously  the best choice  for core material.   Table 3.2  shows  that Hiperco 50A 
has  a  higher  value  of  maximum  induced  field  and  requires  the  same  amount  of  applied  field  to 
counter the hysteresis effect.

Figure  3.2  shows  the  relationship  between  induced  field  [Tesla]  and  applied  field 
[Oersteds]  for  Hiperco  50A  and  iron.    Hiperco  50A  has  significantly  higher  values  for  induced 
field for a given applied current than iron. 
 

At this time, more analysis is required to determine whether Hiperco 50A is a better choice 
than  iron  for  the  electromagnet  core material.    Initial  analysis  indicates  that while Hiperco  50A 
exhibits  better  magnetic  properties  than  iron,  it  will  be  extremely  costly  to  the  project  and  may 
exceed the electromagnet budget allocation.  There are very few distributors of Hiperco 50A, and 
it will be considerably more expensive to purchase and machine this material than iron. 
 

 

 

3.2  Core Configuration 
 
Several  preliminary  options  for  the  electromagnet  configuration  on  the  EMFFORCE 
testbed  have  been  considered. These  include  a  basic  dipole,  a Y-pole  (3  legs),  an  L-pole  (2  legs 
connected at their ends), and an X-pole (4 perpendicular legs).  All are shown in Figures 3.3-3.6. 
 

Figure 3.3:  Dipole 

Figure 3.6:  Y-Pole 

 
Before  discussing  the  details  of  each  configuration,  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
requirements  of  the  system.  The  reasoning  will  come  in  the  following  section,  but  for  now  we 
assume that our system is driven by its mass. Thus, for a given configuration, if two magnets are 
at distance between zero and two meters, the mass should be minimized for a given force. 
 
Also,  the  selected  configuration  needs  to  produce  the  least  amount  of  torque  for  a  given 
force,  since  this  excess  torque  must  be  transferred  to  the  reaction  wheel.  The  reaction  wheel ’ s 
mass  will  be  proportional  to  the  amount  of  torque  that  needs  to  be  stored  in  it,  so  any 
unnecessary torque on the system should be minimized. 
 
Finally,  there  is  a  requirement  that  the  design  of  the  electromagnet  should  minimize  the 
effort  in  transitioning  from  a  two-dimensional  testbed  to  one  that  operates  in  three  dimensions. 
This means that the direction of the poles in the magnet should be able to change for the selected 
configuration. 
 
In order  to determine which configuration will  satisfy  these  goals, preliminary calculations 
were  run  and  a  modeling  software  called  “ MagNet ”   was  used.  From  these  calculations,  the 
following table was constructed.  For each configuration, the performance in several categories is 
rated  between  1  and  5,  with  5  being  the  best  performance.    The  “ total ”   performance  of  each 
configuration is summarized in the rightmost column, and it appears the dipole is quite favorable.

In addition  to  the most  important  trades  summarized  in  the  table,  there are  some additional 
arguments against using the L-pole and the X-pole configurations. 
 
The L-pole has a center of mass outside of its own body and would produce adverse torque 
that would have to be countered by the reaction wheel.  Thus using an L-pole would increase the 
complexity  in  controlling  a  body’ s  rotation,  since  the  forces  on  the  system  would  not  be  acting 
through the system ’ s center of mass. 
 
The X-pole was  eliminated  due  to  the  fact  that  the mass would  have  to  be  distributed  to  4 
legs.   Energizing  one  of  these  legs would  only  be  utilizing ¼  of  the mass  that would  be  used  in 
the single dipole situation and would not produce a large enough force, relatively. 
 
As mentioned  before,  these  are  preliminary  calculations,  and  they must  be  supported  with 
more modeling  and  testing. However,  the  favored  configurations  at  this point  are  the dipole  and 
the Y-pole.  In order to determine whether to use a dipole or a Y-pole, it is necessary to compare 
them closely, with the help of the modeling software. 
 
Two  simulations  were  carried  out  on  the  modeling  software.  In  both  simulations  each 
configuration  has  the  same  volume  and  mass.  The  first  simulation  was  with  two  Y-poles 
separated  by  a  distance  of  2  meters;  one  leg  on  each  Y-pole  was  energized  with  a  current  of  6 
amps  through  1200  turns  of  wire.  The  energized  legs  were  perpendicular  to  each  other.  See 
Figure 3.7.

For  the  dipole  simulation,  two  dipoles were  used,  separated  by  a  distance  of  2 meters  and 
perpendicular to each other. Both were energized with a current of 6 amps  through 1200 turns of 
wire.  See Figure 3.8. 
 
From the results, the following conclusions can be made:  
 
It  was  originally  believed  that  the  dipole  would  generate  a  greater  force  for  a  given mass, 
because  for  a  set  core  mass,  it  utilizes  the  entire  core.  Also,  the  Y-pole  would  not  energize  the 
entire core mass at one time and thus it would  “ waste”  some mass. Since the force is what drives 
the satellites to spin up, this was a key factor. 
 
After  running  the  simulation,  it  turns  out  that  the  Y-pole  magnetizes  the  remaining  ends 
that  are  not  energized  and  the  amount  of  force  generated  is  greater.  This  can  be  explained 
through  Figure  3.7,  which  shows  that  the  legs  on  the  first  Y-pole  (that  are  not  energized)  are 
closer to the second Y-pole legs (that are not energized) than are the two dipoles ’  main cores.

For the requirement of easy transition to three dimensions, it was determined that the dipole 
cannot  change  the direction of  its  poles  to  an  arbitrary direction. The Y-pole, on  the other hand, 
is more versatile and more  transitions more easily  to  three-dimensional applications.   This is due 
to  the  fact  that  the  Y-pole  magnetic  field  direction  can  vary  by  changing  the  amount  of  current 
energizing  each  of  its  legs.    This  would  decrease  the  time  it  would  take  to  rotate  an 
electromagnet  to  the  desired  alignment  using  a  reaction  wheel.  The  Y-pole  configuration, 
however,  also  generates  a  greater  adverse  torque  than  the  dipole,  which  would  have  to  be 
counteracted by the reaction wheel, making it more massive. 
 
In summary,  the Y-pole  simulation shows a greater force  than  the dipole configuration, yet 
produces more unnecessary  torque. The Y-pole performs better  in  transition  to  three dimensions 
and has  less mass  for  a  given  force  than  the dipole configuration. However,  the  torque produced 

 

 

by  the  Y-pole  is  greater  than  that  produced  by  the  dipole;  in  other  words,  the  dipole  performs 
better in terms of minimizing the amount of torque for a given core mass. 
 
Although  it  seems  that  the  Y-pole  would  be  the  best  configuration,  this  cannot  be 
determined yet. For example,  the  torque on  the electromagnets could be more  important  than  the 
force  on  the  electromagnets,  in  which  case  the  performance  of  the  Y-pole  and  the  dipole  could 
change.  Since  this  is  unknown,  more  tests  will  be  run  to  determine  the  relations  between  these 
factors. 
 
Another possible configuration  is a dipole mounted on a  rotating disk,  so  that  the direction 
of  the  poles  could  be  changed  as  easily  as  with  the  Y-pole. While  the  dynamics  of  this  system 
could be more complicated, it will be considered in future trade analyses. 
 

3.3  Core and System Mass 
 
The  driving  parameter  for  this  design  problem  is  mass.  Increases  in  the  total  system  mass 
quickly  ripple  through  the  system,  causing  increases  in  the  size  of  the  electromagnet,  power 
system,  and  structure.  Therefore  the  design  of  the  electromagnet  was  conducted  with  the 
intention  of  working  at  the  minimum  system  mass  for  a  given  system  performance  (i.e. 
separation distance and spin rate).  
 
In order  to determine  the magnet size, a mathematical model of  the system was developed. 
The total mass of the system is given as:

where  the  terms  are  the  total mass of  the  system,  the mass of  the magnetic  core,  the mass of  the 
coil of the magnet, the mass of the power system, and the initial system mass, respectively. 
 
Consider  the  steady-state  spin mode,  shown  in  Figure  3.9, where  the  electromagnets must 
provide a  force  that  is equal  in magnitude but opposite  in direction  to  the centripetal force of  the 
system. The magnetic force on the leftmost vehicle resulting from the other two is given by:

The magnetic moment of an electromagnet can be approximated as the product of the 
induced magnetic field (B), the core mass, and the inverse of the core density. Equating Equation 
3.2 and 3.3 with this substitution for the magnetic moment and solving for the total mass of the 
system yields:

applied magnetic field (H). The expression for  the battery mass  is defined based on  the available 
battery  parameters.  These  equations  define  the  necessary  parameters  to  model  the  system.  The 
only effect that is neglected in the model is the effect of system mass on the mass of the required 
structure. This  is  incorporated  into mo, which  has  been  assumed  to  be  a  constant  for  the  current 
analysis.  

 

 

 
This  model  has  been  incorporated  in  a  Mathematica  script,  which  can  be  run  to  find  the 
optimum operating masses for the system. Before the results of this design are finalized there are 
a  few  more  factors  that  must  be  incorporated.  First,  it  is  important  to  obtain  detailed  material 
properties  for  the  core  and  coil,  including B-H  curve data  for  the  core material. Also,  the model 
does  not  yet  include  an  accurate  trade  between  the  current  and  the  number  of  wire  wraps.  This 
study  will  essentially  trade  between  coil  mass  and  battery  mass  for  a  given  amount  of  applied 
magnetic field. Incorporating this trade into the script is anticipated to be a simple step. 
 
Preliminary  calculations  yield  a  core  mass  of  ~6.5  kg  and  a  total  system  mass  of  ~15  kg. 
The goal is to reduce the mass as the system design optimization continues. 
 

4  Conclusion 
 

The  electromagnet  will  be  composed  of  a  coil  and  a  core.  The  favored  core  materials  are 
currently  Iron and Hiperco 50A, and  the favored configurations are  the fixed dipole, Y-pole, and 
steerable  dipole.  Further  analyses  and  simulations  will  be  performed  in  order  to  downselect  the 
electromagnet  materials  and  configuration,  and  the  optimal  number  of  coil  wraps  will  be 
determined at that time.  All design decisions will be based on the assumption that the success of 
the system depends largely on reducing mass while still meeting the necessary requirements.
