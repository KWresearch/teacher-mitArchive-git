OVERVIEW 

Description of the Effort 

The  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (MIT  SSL)  and  the 
Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center  (ATC) are  collaborating  to explore  the potential 
for  an  Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites 
flying in close formation. 

Progress Overview 

At  MIT,  work  on  EMFF  has  been  pursued  on  two  fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design, 
implement and operate (CDIO) class, and the MIT SSL research group. 
This  report  summarizes  recent  progress  made  in  the  MIT  SSL  research  group  with 
regards  to  analyzing  the  dynamics  of  a  two-spacecraft  electromagnetic  formation  flying  system. 
It is a follow-up to the work presented in the October 2002 progress report, which introduced the 
nonlinear  and  linearized  dynamics  of  such  a  system.    In  this  report,  we  summarize  our  recent 
findings about the controllability and stability of this system. 

Introduction

1.  Introduction 

In this report, we sumarize the dynamics of the electromagnetic formation flying (EMFF) 
system of spacecraft introduced in the October 2002 progress report [1], and then continue 
by presenting results from recent controllability and stability analyses performed on simi ­
lar  EMFF  systems.    In  particular,  we  consider  a  formation  of  two  spacecraft  under  no 
external forces and rotating about a common origin.  Each spacecraft contains a specified 
configuration of fixed electromagnets (EM) and reaction wheels (RW) for use as position 
and attitude actuators. 

We  begin  in  Section 2  by  reviewing  the  results  presented  in  [1].  In  Sections  3  and  4, 
respectively, we  define  and  respond  to  certain questions pertaining  to  the  controlla (cid:173)
bility and stability of the system at hand.  We then summarize our results and draw con­
clusions in Section 5. 

2.  Background 

We begin by reviewing the linearized dynamics of a system similar to those considered in 
this  exercise.    Reference  [1]  describes  the  dynamics  of  a  two-spacecraft  EMFF  system, 
where  each  spacecraft  has  a  single  fixed electromagnet, nominally pointed  along  the  line 
of  sight  between  the  two  spacecraft.    Each  spacecraft  also  has  a  single  reaction  wheel, 
nominally  oriented  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  rotation  of  the  two  spacecraft.    Such  a 
system has nine degrees of freedom (or eighteen state variables): 

x  = 

∆ r  ∆ φ   ∆ψ   ∆α1  ∆α 2  ∆α 3  ∆ β1  ∆ β2  ∆ β 3

, 
where  ∆ r, ∆ φ   ∆ψ   are  the  relative  displacements  of  the  vehicles  in  curvilinear  coordi ­
nates depicted in Figures 1 and 2,  ∆α 1, ∆α 2, ∆α 3   are the Euler angles of the first space ­
craft  (denoted  spacecraft  “A”)  about  its  body-fixed  z,  y,  and  x  axes,  respectively,  and 
∆ β 1, ∆ β 2, ∆ β 3  are  the  corresponding  Euler  angles  of  the  second  spacecraft  (denoted 
spacecraft “B”) about its body-fixed coordinate axes.

Controllability Analysis

We  recognize  that,  rather  than  deriving  the  linearized  dynamics  of  the  similar  sys(cid:173)
tems considered in the following sections from first principles, we can simply modify 
Equation  2.2  by  removing  the  appropriate  degrees  of  freedom  from  the  dynamic 
matrices and altering the actuator coefficient matrix as necessary. 

3.  Controllability Analysis 

We  begin  by  considering  the  linearized  dynamics  of  two  vehicles  in  two  dimensions  (a 
plane), where  the  total angular momentum of  the system  is zero (wheels plus spacecraft), 
but  the  rotational  angular momentum of  the  two  vehicles  about  a  common  origin  is  non­
zero. 

Part a) 

In  this  case,  each  spacecraft  has  a  single  dipole,  fixed  to  the  spacecraft  and  nominally 
pointed  along  the  line  of  sight  to  the  other  spacecraft.    Each  spacecraft  also  has  a  single 
reaction wheel, oriented perpendicular to the plane of rotation of the spacecraft. 

Also, we assume the vehicles are free to rotate about any axis  passing through their center 
of mass (any “central” axis), and are not necessarily constrained  to rotate about axes per ­
pendicular  to  the plane of rotation.   Hence each spacecraft has  three rotational degrees of 
freedom.  After analyzing this case, and before moving on to Part b, we will also consider 
a  simplified  version,  in which  rotations  are  constrained  to  axes  perpendicular  to  the  sys-
tem’s rotational plane, and each spacecraft thus has only one rotational degree of freedom. 

With these assumptions, we recognize that the only difference between this system and the 
system in [1] is that in the present system, the two spacecraft do not leave the nominal hor ­
izontal plane of rotation (the X-Y plane in Figure 1).  Therefore, the system does not have 
a degree of freedom associated with the latitude,  ∆ψ  , and we modify Equation 2.2 by strik­
ing  the  third  column  of  each  square  “coefficient”  matrix,  as well  as  the  third  row  of  the 
entire matrix equation.  This results in the following modified equations of motion:

and M, C, K, and F are the appropriate matrix coefficients.  The control vector, u, contains 
four  control  variables:  ∆ µA  and ∆ µB  ,  which  represent  the  deviation  of  the  EM  mag­
netic dipole moments on spacecraft A and B, respectively, from their nominal, steady-state 
∆ iRW   A   and  ∆ iRW   B, 
values,  and 
,  which  represent  the  deviation  of  the  RW  motor  cur-
,
rents on spacecraft A and B, respectively, from their nominal values. 

To  investigate  the  controllability  of  this  system  using  linear  control  analysis  tools,  we 
recast Equation 3.1 in first order (state-space) form as: 
· x˜ =  A x˜ + B u

I represents an  --- × --- identity matrix, where --- is the number of degrees of freedom of the

system (and n is the number of states). 

The  system  described  in  Equations  3.3-3.8  is  represented  by  eight  degrees  of  free (cid:173)
dom, or 16  state variables.  This  is expected,  since we have  removed one degree of  free ­
dom ( ∆ψ  ) from the system described in [1]. 

To assess the controllability of the linearized dynamics in 3.5, we form the “controllability 
matrix,” defined as (See [4].): 

Controllability Analysis 

7 

C  = 

B AB A 2B  ...  A n  1 –  B 

(3.9)

From linear control theory, we know that the system is only controllable if  rank  C(

)

 =  n . 

Substituting A  and B  as defined by  3.7-3.8  and  3.1  into 3.9, we obtain  the  controllability 
matrix.  Testing the rank using the Matlab “rank” command yields: 

rank  C(

)

 = 8 < n 

(3.10) 

so  that  clearly  the  system  at  hand  is  not  fully  controllable.  Since rank  C(
)
 = 8   in  this 
case, we  see  that  only  eight  states  (or  four  degrees  of  freedom)  are  controllable,  and 
this system as a whole is not fully controllable. 

This  result makes  sense  intuitively,  since we  have  eight degrees  of  freedom  (two  transla ­
tional  degrees  of  freedom,  ∆ r  and  ∆ φ  ,  and  six  rotational  degrees  of  freedom, 
∆α 1, ∆ α2, ∆α 3, ∆ β 1, ∆ β 2, and ∆ β 3 ),  but  only  four  actuators  (one  EM  and  one  RW  on 
each spacecraft). 

It  is  also  interesting  to  consider  a  simplified  version  of  this  geometry,  in  which  the 
system has only  four degrees of  freedom,  ∆ r ,  ∆ φ   ∆α 1 ,  and  ∆ β 1 ,  and  thus  eight  state 
variables.  In this case, the bodies are allowed to translate within a plane as before, but are 
now constrained to rotate only about axes perpendicular to  the system’s plane of rotation. 
We  modify  the  dynamic  equations  in  3.1  by  striking  the  appropriate  rows  and  columns 
from the matrices M, C, K, and F, as well as from the state vector:

We  then  assemble  the  A  and  B  matrices  using  3.7  and  3.8  and  form  the  controllability

Hence  this  simplified  system  is,  indeed,  fully  controllable.   This result  is quite  inter (cid:173)
esting:  it  tells  us  that  we  can  fully  control  a  two-spacecraft  “planar”  system  (with 
degrees  of  freedom  ∆ r ,  ∆ φ  ,  ∆α 1 ,  and  ∆ β 1 ) using only  four  actuators  (one EM  and 
one RW on each spacecraft). 

Part b) 

The  geometry  in  this  case  is  similar  to  the  more  complicated  system  in  Part  a,  with  the 
exception that each spacecraft has one additional electromagnet, oriented perpendicular to 
the first and still in the plane of rotation of the two spacecraft. 

Since  the  system  geometry  is  identical  to  that  in Part  a,  the  non-actuated  dynamics  (and 
hence the A matrix) from 3.1 remain the same.  However, because the actuator configura(cid:173)
tion  has  changed,  the  control  vector,  u, and  the  linearized actuator  coefficient matrix, B, 
will change.  We define the new control vector as: 

u  = 

∆ µA 1  ∆ µA 2  ∆ µB 1  ∆ µB 2  ∆ iRW   A   ∆ iRW   B  
,
,

where  ∆ µA 1  and ∆ µB 1    represent  the  original  EM  dipole  moments  from  Part  a,  and
∆ µA 2  and ∆ µB 2    represent  the  dipole  moments  of  the  new  orthogonal  EMs  on  each 
spacecraft. 

With  two orthogonal electromagnets on each  spacecraft,  the net electromagnetic  force on 
spacecraft A may now be represented as a  sum of  the  interactions between  the  individual 
electromagnets on A and B: 

FA B =  FA 1 ⁄ B 1 + FA 1 ⁄ B 2 + FA 2 ⁄ B 1 + FA 2 ⁄ B 2 = –FB A
⁄
⁄

(3.14) 

,
,
where  FA i   B j   ( i  = 1 2  and  j  =  1 2 ) represents the force on the ith EM on spacecraft A 
⁄ 
due  to  the  jth  EM  on  spacecraft  B.    Note  that  the  force  on  B  is  equal  in  magnitude  and 
opposite in direction to that on A. 

Similar expressions yield the torque on each spacecraft due to the electromagnetic interac ­
tions with the other spacecraft: 

⁄TA B =  TA 1 ⁄ B 1 + TA 1 ⁄ B 2 + TA 2 ⁄ B 1 + TA 2 ⁄ B 2 

⁄TB A =  TB 1 ⁄ A 1 + TB 1 ⁄ A 2 + TB 2 ⁄ A 1 + TB 2 ⁄ A 2 

(3.15) 

(3.16) 

Unlike  the  forces,  the  torques  on  A  and  B  are  not  equal  in  magnitude  and  opposite  in 
direction. 

The  resulting  nonlinear  force  and  torque  expressions  may  be  written  as  functions  of  the 
EM  dipole  strengths,  the  separation  distance  between  the  spacecraft,  and  the Euler-angle 
attitude representations of the spacecraft, as described in detail in [1].  This yields compli ­
cated  expressions  for  the  resultant  forces  and  torques.    These  expressions  are  calculated 
using the “symbolic toolbox” in Matlab. 

In order to append these new forces and torques into our linearized dynamics, we must lin­
earize them about nominal values.  The nominal separation distance is r0, and the nominal 
Euler  angles  are  zero,  as  in  previous  linearizations.    Also,  the  line-of-sight-EM  dipole 

Controllability Analysis 

10 

moments  on A  and B  are  linearized  about  the  same nominal values as before,  in order  to 
provide the necessary centripetal acceleration for nominal steady-state spin of the system:

µB 1 0

(3.17)

(3.18)

Hence we have only to specify nominal values for the “new” EMs (orthogonal to the line-
of-sight  EMs)  on  spacecraft  A  and  B.  In  order  to  avoid  nonhomogeneous  forces  and 
torques  due  to  interactions  between  the  nominal magnetic moments  of  the  new EMs  and 
those of the line-of-sight EMs, we must linearize the new EMs about zero.  Hence: 

so that:

µA 2 0 =  µB 2 0 =  0

µA 2 =  ∆ µA 2  ,  µB 2 =  ∆ µB 2

where the six columns correspond to the six control variables in Equation 3.13. 

Note  that  the  dynamic matrices, M,  C,  and  K,  are  unchanged  from  Part  a,  since  only  the 
actuator  configuration has  changed.  Hence  the A matrix  is  also unchanged.  We proceed 
by  recalculating B using Equation 3.8,  and  substituting  the new F matrix  from 3.21.  We 
then  form  the  controllability  matrix  for  this  configuration  using  Equation  3.9,  and  using 
the Matlab “rank” command, we find: 

rank  C(

)

 = 8 < n 

(3.22) 

where we recall that n  =  16  for this geometry.  Hence, again, only four degrees of free (cid:173)
dom (or eight state variables) are controllable in this case, so this actuator configura(cid:173)
tion does not improve upon that of Part a. 

Finally, we  consider  adding  two  additional  reaction wheels  to  each  spacecraft, with  spin-
axes fixed in the plane of rotation and orthogonal to each other and to the existing RW.  In 
this case, the control vector is:

Substituting 3.24 into 3.8 to solve for B, then forming the controllability matrix and testing 
the rank, we find: 

rank  C(

) =  16 =  n 

(3.25) 

This  is  an  important  result;  it  tells  us  that  if  each  spacecraft  in  two  dimensions  has 
two  orthogonal  EMs  within  the  plane  of  rotation,  as  well  as  three  orthogonal  RWs 
(two  in  the plane  of  rotation  and  one  orthogonal  to  that plane),  then  the  system will 
be  fully  controllable  in  two  dimensions.    Note  that  this  includes  not  only  translation 
within  the  plane  and  rotation  about  axes  orthogonal  to  the  plane,  but  also  rotation  about 
arbitrary axes passing through the spacecraft center of mass! 

A  useful  extension  of  this  will  be  to  check  the  controllability  of  such  a  system  in  three 
dimensions.  A reasonable conjecture is that such a system will be uncontrollable, but if a 
third EM is added to each spacecraft and oriented orthogonal to the plane of rotation, then 
the  system  may  be  fully  controllable.    This  conjecture  will  be  investigated  in  the  near 
future. 

4.  Stability Analysis 

We now consider  the  linearized dynamics  of  two  spacecraft  in  three dimensions,  rotating 
about  a  common  origin  as  before  (in  a  plane), with  a  total  system  angular momentum  of 
zero  as  before  (spacecraft  plus  reaction  wheels).    We  will  examine  the  linearized  open-
loop dynamics of this system. 

Part a) 

We  are  now  working  in  three  dimensions,  so we  return  to  the  configuration  in  reference 
[1].  The A matrix is formed using Equation 3.7, based on the three-dimensional dynamics 
in  Equation  2.2.  Using  the  “eig”  command  in  the  Matlab  symbolic  toolbox  with  the  A 
matrix as a function input, we find the eigenvalues of this system to be:

detailed description of the airtrack hardware, dynamics, and experimental results.

(4.9)

By  comparing  these  poles  with  the  those  of  our  three-dimensional  formation  flying  sys­
tem, we find that the airtrack poles are of the same form as  λ 7  and  λ8  in Equation 4.2.  In 
both cases,  the poles are  real, one positive and one negative, and mirror each other about 
the imaginary axis in the complex plane as shown in Figure 3. 

In  the  airtrack  case,  the  pair  of  real  poles  is  expected.  We  know  the  configuration  to  be 
inherently  unstable,  as  described  in  [5],  and  this  is  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  one  of  the 
system poles is in the right-half complex plane.  As discussed in [5], the eigenmode corre ­
sponding to this eigenvalue represents a divergence of the dynamics; in particular, it repre ­
sents  the  fact  that  the  “sliding”  magnet  tends  to  fall  away  from  the  fixed  magnet  if  the 

Stability Analysis

attractive force is slightly too weak, but to accelerate toward the fixed magnet if the force 
is slightly too strong.  We see the same unstable physics occurring in the formation flying 
system.  The attractive force between  the  two magnets maintains  the centripetal accelera ­
tion  necessary  for  the  system  to  spin;  if  the  force  is  slightly  too  weak,  the  magnets  will 
quickly  “fall”  away  from  one  another.  If,  however,  the  force  is  slightly  too  strong,  the 
magnets will accelerate toward each other.  Hence we see very similar physics between the 
two  situations,  and  our  intuition  is  confirmed by  the  fact  that  the  system  poles  are  of  the 
same mathematical form. 

Next, we consider the poles of the airtrack system in its neutrally stable configuration: 

λ 1 2, 
S t a b l e  

4 cµ 2 
=  ± i  ------------
5 m r0 

(4.10)

These  are  of  the  same  form  as  λ 9  and 
λ10 
in Equation 4.3.  In both  cases,  there  are  two
imaginary poles, one positive and one negative,  that mirror each other about  the  real axis 
in the complex plane as shown in Figure 3. 

In  this  configuration, we  know  the  linear  airtrack  to  be  neutrally  stable;  once  the  sliding 
magnet is perturbed, it will oscillate indefinitely with respect to the fixed magnet.  (In real ­
ity,  this  configuration  is  stable  because  the  small  amount  of  friction  between  the  sliding 
magnet  and  the  track  adds  damping  to  the  system  and  moves  the  poles  slightly  into  the 
left-half complex plane.)  Since the formation flying system has poles of the same form, it 
must have a corresponding neutrally stable eigenmode.  By studying the eigenvectors pro-
· 
duced in Matlab, we see that the  ψ  and  ψ  components of this eigenvector are 90 degrees 
out of phase from one another, indicating  that this mode corresponds  to a sinusoidal “tilt ­
ing” of the entire plane of rotation of the two spacecraft.  This tilting occurs about an axis 
located in the global X-Y plane and passing through the origin of the global frame. 

Stability Analysis

One  encouraging  aspect  of  the  pole-zero map  in  Figure 3  is  that  only  one  pole  is  strictly 
unstable.  Hence if we can design a controller that will stabilize this mode, we have a good 
chance of controlling the entire system. 

Part c) 

As  a  final  exercise, we  investigate  how  the  formation  flying  system’s  poles  in Equations 
4.1-4.7 change as a function of the angular momentum of the vehicles about  the origin of 
rotation. 

First we recognize that the first six poles,  λ 1 – λ 6 , are equal to zero and thus are not 
affected  by  the  angular  momentum  of  the  spinning  vehicles  or  any  other  geometric 
properties of the system.  These poles represent the six rigid-body modes of the system. 

· 
λ10 
are  directly  proportional  to  the  nominal  spin  rate,  φ 0 ,  of  the 
Next, we  see  that λ 7  -
system.   Hence as  the nominal  spin rate varies  from zero  to infinity,  these  four poles 
move out from the origin, each along a different axis of the complex plane.  Since the 
positive-real  eigenvalue,  λ 7 , moves  further  into  the  right-half  complex  plane  as  the 
nominal  spin  rate  increases,  we  see  that  the  system  becomes  increasingly  unstable. 
Hence  the  larger  the  angular  momentum  of  the  vehicles  spinning  about  the  origin, 
the more unstable the system will be. 

· 
All  the  remaining poles, both  real and  imaginary, grow  in magnitude with  increasing  φ 0 , 
m,  and  r0.   Hence  as  the  angular momentum, mass,  and  separation  distance  of  the  space ­
craft  increase,  these  poles  move  further  out  from  the  origin  toward  infinity.    Note  that 
since all the arguments of the radicals in 4.1-4.7 are necessarily positive, there is no com­
bination  of values  that  can  change  the  sign  of  any  argument,  so  that  it  is not  possible  for 
real  poles  to  become  complex  or  imaginary  for  certain  geometries,  or  vice  versa.   The 
· 
result  is  that  as  φ 0 , m,  or  r0  increase,  the  poles 
λ 11  – λ18 
move  toward  infinity  along 
the axes on which they lie, so that the positive-real poles move further to the right along 
the  positive-real  axis,  and  so  forth.    This  makes  sense,  since  we  expect  the  system  to 

Conclusions

become  increasingly  unstable  as  the  angular  momentum,  mass,  and  separation  distance 
increase. 

5.  Conclusions 

The results presented in this report are summarized here.

In  Section 3,  Part  a,  we  discovered  that  if  we  retain  all  of  the  rotational 
degrees of freedom of each spacecraft in the two-dimensional configuration, 
only four of the eight system degrees of freedom will be controllable.  How ­
ever,  if  we  eliminate  spacecraft  rotations  about  axes  within  the  system’s 
plane  of  rotation,  then  we  have  only  four  degrees  of  freedom,  all  of  which 
are controllable. 
In Section 3, Part b, we find with only one RW (oriented perpendicular to the 
plane of rotation) that only four of the eight degrees of freedom are control­
lable.  If,  however,  we  append  two  RWs  per  spacecraft  (perpendicular  to 
each other and lying in the system’s plane of rotation), then all eight degrees 
of freedom of the system will be controllable. 
In  Section 4,  Part  a,  we  determined  the  18  eigenvalues  of  the  three-dimen-
sional system.  We assumed sample mass and geometric properties and plot­
ted  the  resulting  numerical  values  of  the  poles  in  the  complex  plane.    Six 
poles  lie at the origin,  two poles lie on  the real axis, and ten poles  lie on  the 
imaginary axis. 
In  Section 4,  Part  b, we  compare  the  system’s  poles  to  those  of  the  airtrack 
used  for  the  CDIO  class.   We  found  two  of  the  EMFF  system’s  poles were 
similar in form to the airtrack’s poles in its stable configuration, and two oth­
ers were similar in form to the airtrack’s poles in its unstable configuration. 
In  Section 4,  Part  c,  we  examined  the  behavior  of  the  system’s  poles  as  a 
function of  the angular momentum of  the  two  spacecraft  spinning about  the 
common origin.  We found that as the nominal angular momentum increases, 
all the non-zero poles move toward infinity along the axes on which they lie. 
Eight of these poles behave in a similar manner when the spacecraft mass or 
separation distance increases.
