F Coil and Containment Design and Manufacture (MW, JB) 
F.1 Electromagnet Subsystem Requirement (MW) 
The electromagnet team is responsible for the design and construction of the 
electromagnets for the actuation system of each vehicle.  The electromagnets will provide 
the forces and torques necessary for translational movement in the 2-D horizontal plane 
and for disturbance rejection.  To demonstrate the concept of electromagnetic formation 
flight, the baseline maneuver will consist of a two-vehicle system performing a spin-up 
maneuver as illustrated by Figure F.1-A.  In this figure, the two vehicles are represented as 
electromagnet dipoles in an initial perpendicular configuration.  As current is applied to 
the electromagnets, forces and torques are induced as illustrated by the arrows in Figure F.1
-B.  Using a reaction wheel, these forces and torques are counteracted such that the 
dipoles begin to spin-up until they are aligned along a single axis in steady state rotation.  
Each vehicle will be floated across a smooth surface using compressed gas to reduce 
friction.

The electromagnets must provide the forces and torques required to perform the baseline 
spin-up maneuver to a constant steady state angular rate of one rotation per minute, or six 
degrees of arc per second, at a separation distance of two meters measured from each 
vehicle’s center of mass.  The vehicles are required to maintain this rotation rate for a 
minimum of three rotations.  In order to fulfill these actuation system requirements, the 
electromagnet subsystem team considered several designs for the electromagnet coil.

F.2 Design History (MW) 
The original design for the electromagnet consisted of a ferromagnetic core made of steel 
wrapped with copper wire to produce the force and torque necessary to fulfill the system 
requirements.  However, since the ability of the system to spin up is dependent upon 
mass, it is desirable to keep the mass as low as possible.  Additionally, since the 
EMFFORCE satellite test-bed is demonstrating a concept that should be translatable to 
space application, a large, heavy steel core would not necessarily be the best option due 
to high launch costs and payload restrictions.  A coreless option was then considered. 
 
The electromagnet team discarded the steel core and worked on resizing the copper coil 
such that it was able to produce the required force and torque for spin-up without the core 
material.  However, the large copper coil could not satisfy the requirement due to the 
restriction on the amount of current that could safely be passed through the wire.  Even 
with cooling systems, it would not have been feasible to use a coreless copper coil 
electromagnet because of the resistance of the wire creating a large amount of heat.  The 
team then considered a new material to replace the copper that could carry higher levels 
of current. 
 
An electromagnet made of high temperature superconductor wire became the chosen 
alternative to the copper wire electromagnet coil.  American Superconductor’s Bi-2223 
reinforced high temperature superconductor wire is able to safely carry more than ten 
times the amount of current that copper can at temperatures below 110 K.  Below this 
temperature, the superconductor wire has zero resistance allowing more than 100 amps of 
current to be passed safely through the wire.  This amount of current made it feasible for 
the subsystem to produce the required force and torque necessary to spin up the system.  
However, since the superconductor wire must be kept below 110 K during the entire 
duration of the test, the superconductor wire adds the additional requirement for a coil 
containment system that keeps the wire below this temperature.  Using the coreless 
superconductor coil as the choice for the electromagnet, the team began the final design 
and fabrication of the electromagnet subsystem.

F.3 Design Overview (MW) 
The design for the electromagnet subsystem consists of two perpendicular, vertically 
oriented coils made of high temperature superconductor wire.  Two perpendicular coils 
are used to allow for variability in the direction of the magnetic field.  Since the 
superconductor coils must operate at temperatures below 110 K, they are immersed in 
liquid nitrogen at 77 K for the duration of the test.  The liquid nitrogen and coil are 
contained within a toroid-shaped casing, and the liquid nitrogen is replenished from a 
reservoir on top of the coil casings.  Figure F.3-A shows the configuration of the 
perpendicular coils.

F.4 Electromagnet Coil Sizing (MW) 
The first task to be completed was the sizing of the electromagnet coil.  In order to 
determine the size of the coil, the electromagnet team first calculated the strength of the 
coil necessary to meet the design requirements.  To do this, the team considered the 
baseline spin-up maneuver of two vehicles to a steady state rotation of one rotation per 
minute.  Each vehicle is modeled as a dipole.  Figure F.4-A shows the two dipoles at a 
separation distance (s) and at dipole angles of (α) and (β).  The two vehicles undergoing 
spin-up during the baseline maneuver are modeled as magnetic dipoles.

Solving for the magnetic moment of a dipole and assuming that both vehicles have

Equation F.4-5

 
This equation provides the instantaneous magnetic moments necessary to maintain a 
rotation rate (ω) for a vehicle of mass (m) at a separation distance (s) from another 
vehicle where the permeability constant (µo) is 4π * 10^-7.  The mass estimate of the 
vehicle is approximately 20 kg.  Using the set requirements for steady state rotation and 
•
separation distance and setting angular acceleration (
) equal to zero, the required 
ω
magnetic moment for one dipole is 2418 [A-m2].  
 
In order to determine the size of the coil, the electromagnet team increased the mass 
estimate and separation distance requirement by a margin of 25% for safety.  Calculating 
the required magnet strength for 25 kg vehicles at a separation distance of 2.5 meters, µA 
= µB = 4723 [A-m2]. 
 
Figure F.4-B shows the dependency of magnetic moment on mass and separation distance.  
The required magnetic moment for each dipole, in order to fulfill the baseline maneuver 
requirements for the nominal case and for the case with a 25% margin of safety factored 
into the mass and separation distance, is denoted by the dashed lines.

For the electromagnet coils, µ = nIA where n is the number of turns of the 
superconductor wire, I is the current, and A is the area enclosed by the coil.  The current 
was set at 100 amps, which is a safe level of current that may be passed through the 
superconductor wire.  Since there are two coils per vehicle, the outer coil was sized such 
that it exceeded the required magnetic moment for the system with margin while leaving 
enough room for the inner coil to be sized to meet the original requirement.   
 
The outer coil diameter was set at 0.835 m with 99 turns of superconductor wire.  For 
these coil properties and 100 amps of current, µouter = 5421 [A-m2].  The inner coil 
diameter was set at 0.670 m with 120 turns of superconductor wire.  For these coil 
properties and 100 amps of current, µinner = 4231 [A-m2].  At the diameters and number of 
turns set for the outer and inner coils, each coil requires the same length of 
superconductor wire and allows room for the coil casings to fit around each coil.

F.5 Coil Wrapping (MW) 
Once the sizing for each coil was determined, the electromagnet team began fabrication 
on the first vehicle’s inner coil.  The wire used for the electromagnet coil is Bi-2223 
reinforced high temperature superconductor wire manufactured by American 
Superconductor.  In order to prevent the coil from shorting out, the superconducting coil 
is layered with DuPont Kapton insulator tape with adhesive on one side of the tape.  
Figure F.5-A shows the dimensions of the superconductor wire, and Figure F.5-B shows the 
dimensions of the Kapton insulator.

Each coil consists of three individual coils of superconductor wire layered with insulator.  
This design allows for a more compact casing to be constructed around the coil than 
would be required for a single tall stack of the required number of wire turns.  Figure F.5-C 
shows a cross-section and dimensions of both the outer and inner coils.  The outer and 
inner coil stacks each contain 33 and 40 layers, respectively, of superconductor wire 
layered with Kapton insulator tape.

In order to wrap each coil stack, a spindle for the outer coil and another spindle for the 
inner coil were fabricated out of three layers of Plexiglas to match the inner dimensions 
of each coil.  The superconductor wire and Kapton tape were layered onto the spindle as 
it was slowly rotated until each stack was complete.  Figure F.5-D is a side-view of the 
wrapping assembly, and Figure F.5-E is a side-view of the spindle.  The three layers of 
Plexiglas are held together by wing nuts that allow the coil stack to be removed.  The 
spindle aligns the superconductor wire and Kapton tape during the wrapping process.  
The Plexiglas pieces are separated by removing the wing nuts.  This allows the coil stack 
to be removed once it is finished.

F.6 Coil Testing (MW) 
One layer of the inner coil was tested to determine whether it exhibited superconducting 
properties below 110 K and to measure the magnetic field for comparison with the 
expected values from the model derived by Samuel Schweighart from the equations 
found on http://www.netdenizen.com/emagnet.  The model for the field strength in the 
axial direction is given by Equation 6, and the model for the field strength in the radial 
direction is given by Equation 7 where (a) is the coil radius, (n) is the number of wire 
turns, (i) is the current, (r) is the radius of the measurement point, and (h) is the height of 
the measurement point.  EllipticK denotes a complete elliptic integral of the first kind, 
and EllipticE denotes a complete elliptic integral of the second kind.  In order to simplify 
the model, consider the following substitutions:

The resistance of one layer of the inner coil at room temperature was measured at 0.37 
ohms.  The layer was then immersed in liquid nitrogen at 77 K, and the measured 
resistance was zero, indicating that the wire was superconducting at that temperature.  
Thirty amps of current were applied to the immersed coil, and magnetic field (or B-field) 
measurements were taken using a Gauss-meter.  Figure F.6-A illustrates the experimental 
setup for the axial B-field measurements taken at varying radii, Figure F.6-B illustrates 
the setup for the radial B-field measurements taken at varying radii, and Figure F.6-C 
illustrates the setup for the axial B-field measurements taken at varying height.

F.7 Containment System (JB) 

• 

F.7.1 Requirements: 
•  The super conducting wire must be immersed in liquid nitrogen at all times during 
operation 
Insulate from  the environment  the wire and  the  liquid N2. A better  insulation will 
allow  a  slower  boil  off,  which  means  less  liquid  nitrogen  will  be  needed  to 
maintain  the  required  temperature,  and  thus  the  EM  subsystem  will  be  lighter, 
which is more desirable for overall design of the vehicles 
•  Stiff  enough  to  support  liquid  N2  container,  its  own  weight,  and  the  weight  of 
other  components  that  will  be  attached  to  it.  As  shown  in  the  diagram  of  the 
vehicle,  the  containment  system  is  the  main  structure;  therefore  it  needs  to  have 
attached  points  and  be  strong  enough  to  support  the  weight  of  the  different

In order to hold the coils and the liquid nitrogen that surrounds it, and achieve the desired 
insulation, STYROFOAM extruded polystyrene insulation was used to build a toroidal

The  size  constraints  come  from  the  coil Figure F.7-A. The wire  goes  through  the  center  of 
the toroid shaped container.

Since there are two coils, which need to be perpendicular to each other, one of the 
containers is small enough fit inside the other. The dimensions of the coils are shown in 
Figure F.7-B and Figure F.7-C, respectively.

In order for the liquid nitrogen to flow better through the container, spacers were 
included on the sides of the wire. These are shown in the cross section figures for the 
coils.  Figure 0-D shows the details of the spacers on the side and bottom for the male 
part of the container. Another part that has the mirror shape of this one, attaches to the 
top creating more space for the liquid N2.

The  manufacturing  of  the  containers  is  a  time  consuming  process.  For  every  container 
tested  there  at  least  six  to  ten  hours  of  only  manufacturing  time.  There  is  also  time  to 
epoxy  the  different  parts,  which  is  about  an  hour  and  finally  the  curing  time,  which  is 
from sixteen to 24 hours for every layer of epoxy. 
 
The  containers  were  built  in  two  parts,  each  part  having  had  four  pieces  each.  These 
pieces were made  in  a milling machined programmed  in mastercam 9. The  first part was 
the “Male” piece and the second one was the “Female” piece, since they were negative of 
each other. 
 
After putting each part together with epoxy the super conducting wire was put into the 
female piece, where all the extra wiring took place. 
Before epoxing the two halves together, tests were performed to make sure that current 
could flow through all the wires. 
 
Once the two main parts’ assembly had dried, fiberglass and cryogenic epoxy were 
applied to the outside for leak proofing and to make the structure stiff. 
 
Finally, the containers have to be thermo cycled about ten times, in order to stress relieve 
the foam. This causes many cracks on the foam, but once it has gone through enough 
number of cycles it will stop cracking and leaking.

F.7.3.2 Tank 
 
The purpose of the tank is to hold liquid nitrogen, in order to keep the wires immersed as 
the nitrogen boils off. The volume the tank has to hold is directly related to the amount of 
time the system is expected to operate. Based on boil off testing on the coils and the fact 
that the limiting factor for operational time is the air carriage system, which can run for 8 
minutes, the tank was designed to carry enough nitrogen to keep the coils immersed for 
10 min. 
 
If at some point the desired volume is increased, the current design for the tank allows to 
simply add another layer of foam and the volume would be increased by whatever thick 
ness this new layer has. This is clearer in Figure F.7-E.

The tank was constructed in a similar manner as the coils containment. A foam frame was 
made and epoxied together and fiberglass with epoxy was applied to the outside. 
 
The foam frame was composed of a square base and two square layers of the same size 
but the inside was cut off, leaving a squared ring. 
 
Finally, 4 pipes were connected to the coils (2 for each coil) as shown in Figure F.7-F.
