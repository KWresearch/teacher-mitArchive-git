DESCRIPTION OF THE EFFORT 
 
The Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (SSL)  and  the  Lockheed 
Martin  Advanced  Technology  Center  (ATC)  are  collaborating  to  explore  the  potential  for  a 
Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites  flying 
in close formation.   
 
PROGRESS OVERVIEW 
At  MIT,  work  on  electro-magnetic  formation  flight  (EMFF)  has  been  pursued  on  two 
fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design,  implement  and  operate  (CDIO)  class,  and  the  MIT  Space 
Systems  Lab  research  group.    The  CDIO  class,  a  three  semester  undergraduate  course  where 
students  will  design,  build,  test  and  operate  an  electro-magnetic  testbed  for  formation  flight,  is 
currently  in  its  first semester.   The  testbed  that  the class  is designing will allow  for six degree of 
freedom  testing  of  EMFF  systems  and  give  students  the  chance  to  see  the  life  cycle  of  a  real 
aerospace  system.  The  MIT  Space  Systems  Lab  research  staff  has  been  working  on  optimal 
systems design of spacecraft formations that will utilize electromagnets to control formation size 
and attitude.  The details of the work accomplished by both the class and the lab are described in 
more detail below. 
  
CDIO CAPSTONE COURSE 
Formation  flight  of  satellites  is  a  concept  that  has  been  proposed  for  many  purposes, 
including  space  interferometry.  Unlike  monolithic  telescopes,  interferometers  are  based  on  the 
concept of  combining  light  from multiple  apertures  spaced  a distance  apart.  Just  as  a monolithic 
telescope’s  angular  resolution  improves  with  aperture  size,  an  interferometer’s  resolution 
improves  with  increased  distance  between  apertures.  Hence  formation  flight  of  separated 
spacecraft appears to be a useful tool in implementing space interferometry. 
Until  now,  traditional  thrusters  have  been  proposed  for  formation  flight  attitude  and 
positional control. However, there are several concerns with the use of thrusters, including plume 
contamination  of  neighboring  spacecraft  and  sensitive  optics,  and  the  use  of  fuel  as  a 
nonrenewable  energy  source.  Rather  than  thrusters,  electromagnets  could  be  used  for  formation 
flight control. Electromagnetic formation flight control has the potential to: 
•  Eliminate concerns about thruster plume impingement and optics contamination 
•  Control  relative  degrees  of  freedom,  as  opposed  to  the  inertial  degrees  of  freedom 
controlled by thrusters 
•  Rely  on  electricity  provided  by  solar  arrays,  a  renewable  energy  source,  as  opposed  to 
thrusters whose finite fuel supply often limits the life of the spacecraft 

 

Therefore,  the  objective  of  this  class  is  to  demonstrate  the  feasibility  of  an 
electromagnetically  controlled  array  of  formation  flying  satellites.  This  objective  is  cast  as  the 
following Mission Statement: 
 
Demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic control for formation flying satellites. 

 
•  Demonstrate  implies  operating  an  electromagnetic  formation  flight  testbed  in  a  mode 
representative  of  a  real  world  application,  or  “scaled”  to  demonstrate  real-world 
feasibility.

•  Electromagnetic  control  implies  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  controller  using 
electromagnets as actuators to control relative position and attitude. 
•  Formation  flying  satellites  implies  a  testbed  composed of multiple  rigid bodies  that must 
exhibit the functionality of a real cluster of satellites in formation flight. 

 
In pursuant to this goal, the CDIO class was divided into four teams:  
•  The  architecture  team  investigated  all  plausible  technical  options  for  implementing  the 
various mission  elements.    Open  literature,  space mission  databases,  textbooks,  internet, 
engineering  advisors,  as  well  as  other  sources  were  used  to  identify  these  options.  Then 
the  element  options  that  were  compatible  with  other  element  options  are  combined  into 
system architecture.  If an architecture meets  the customer and  functional  requirements,  it 
was considered a candidate architecture for the mission. 
•  The  requirements  team’s  first  responsibility  is  to  determine  the  customer  requirements.  
This  is  done  by  determining  the  customer’s  needs  and  desires.  Functional  requirements 
based on the customer requirements and mission timeline were created that describe what 
must be achieved without going into details on how it will be accomplished. 
•  The  databasing  team  was  responsible  for  generating  a  database  of  possible  vendors  for 
many of the components that will be purchased later in the project. This database that was 
created will allow the teams to purchase items more efficiently later in the project. 
•  The  processes  team  was  responsible  for  determining  and  implementing  the  program 
budgets  and  timelines.  The  budgets  include  cost,  as  well  as  mass,  power  and  other 
commodities. This team also developed a verification processes and configuration control 
so that all requirements will be met. 

 
The  four  teams  worked  over  the  first  half  of  the  semester  and  presented  their  work  in  a  Trade 
Analysis  and  Requirements  Review  (TARR)  on  March  19th.  The  power  point  presentation  that 
was presented along with annotated notes is attached to this report.  
 
MIT SPACE SYSTEMS LAB 
 

The  MIT  Space  Systems  Lab  research  staff  has  been  continuing  research  in  the  area  of 
optimal  designs  and  configurations  for  satellite  formations  utilizing  electromagnets  for  relative 
attitude,  relative separation and  inertial  rotation control.     A paper was presented on  this work at 
the  last  IEEE  conference  in  Big  Sky, Montana.    The  abstract  of  the  paper  is  shown  below  with 
the complete paper attached to this report. 
 
ABSTRACT - The use of propellant to maintain the relative orientation of multiple spacecraft in 
a sparse aperture telescope such as NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) poses several issues. 
These  include  fuel  depletion,  optical  contamination,  plume  impingement,  thermal  emission,  and 
vibration  excitation.  An  alternative  is  to  eliminate  the  need  for  propellant,  except  for  orbit 
transfer,  and  replace  it  with  electromagnetic  control.  Relative  separation,  relative  attitude,  and 
inertial  rotation  of  the  array  can  all  be  controlled  by  creating  electromagnetic  dipoles  on  each 
spacecraft  and  varying  their  strengths  and  orientations.  This  paper  not  only  discusses  optimized 
designs  for  a  generic  system  but  also  shows  that  feasible  designs  exist  for  a  five  spacecraft, 
seventy-five meter baseline architecture for TPF.
