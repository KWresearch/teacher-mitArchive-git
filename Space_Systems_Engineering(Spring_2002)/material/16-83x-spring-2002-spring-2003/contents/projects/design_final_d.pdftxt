D   Carriage Design (ALS) 
The air carriage system is composed of a CO2 gas supply system, pucks, and carriage. 
D.1   Gas Supply 
A tank containing liquid CO2 supplies the gas for the carriage.  The tank is mounted in a 
vertical position with the outlet at the top.  This ensures a desirable configuration for 
steady gas flow.  During operation, the tank must sit in a warm water bath to keep the 
tank temperature from dropping too quickly.  If the temperature drops too low and too 
quickly, dry ice chunks will form inside the tank, and not only will some of the gas be 
unavailable for use, but the flow path could be restricted and the supply pressure could 
drop.  A bath of hot tap water is sufficient to keep this from happening. 
 
The high-pressure outlet of the tank (860 psi) connects, via a bottomline hose, to a 
reducing pressure regulator.  The chosen Tescom regulators are capable of reducing up to 
3500 psi to a range of 0-100 psi.  The EMFFORCE system operates between 12-35 psi.  
A gauge allows the operator to manually set the desired operating pressure depending on 
the floor surface.  The low-pressure discharge from the regulator is split via a manifold 
into three flexible tubes routed to the pucks.

D.2   Pucks and Carriage 
The pucks selected for use on the carriage are 100 mm in diameter and have a single 
outlet aperture.  They are equally spaced (120° apart) around the base ring underneath the 
vehicle.  This configuration allows the pucks to maintain co-planarity with relative ease, 
while the ring adapts the three-armed tripod of the puck configuration with the four-
“armed” cross configuration at the base of the magnet containment rings.  Figure D.2-A 
shows the base ring with the pucks attached.

Also, the pucks are not rigidly attached to the rest of the carriage; rather, they are 
attached by screws with finger springs placed between the puck and the ring to allow 
them some play.  This also ensures their ability to remain coplanar in the event of slight 
imbalance and force shifts.  The main carriage base, to which the pucks are attached, is a 
rigid structure, rigidly attached to the rings of the magnet containment rings.  Figure D.2-B 
shows a closer view of the puck-base interface.

At the time of this publication, the air carriage is able to supply approximately seven and 
a half minutes of float time.  It may be desirable to increase this time for longer tests.  To 
do this with the current setup, a larger CO2 tank is required.  Twenty-ounce capacity 
tanks are available through paintball suppliers.  Alternatively, some research on 
lubrication theory and gas bearing behavior has been conducted by Jeannette Garza 
(Course 2, 2003).  This research may be consulted to refine the arrangement of the air 
carriage. 
 
Unfortunately, the use of the gaseous nitrogen from the cryogenic system boil-off was 
ruled infeasible by the structures team under the constraints of schedule and manpower.  
In future iterations of the project, the structures team would like to see this option 
reopened and explored. 
 
Table D.2-A shows a list of specific parts and quantities required to assemble one carriage.  
The components in the table are referenced by letter to their location in Figures D.2-B, 
D.2-C and D.2-D.
