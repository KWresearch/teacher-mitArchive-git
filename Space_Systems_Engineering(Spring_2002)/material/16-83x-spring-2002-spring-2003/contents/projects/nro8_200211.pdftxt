INTRODUCTION 

Description of the Effort 

The  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (MIT  SSL)  and  the 
Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center  (ATC) are  collaborating  to explore  the potential 
for  an  Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites 
flying in close formation. 

Progress Overview 

At  MIT,  work  on  EMFF  has  been  pursued  on  two  fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design, 
implement and operate (CDIO) class, and the MIT SSL research group. 

Recent  work  in  the  MIT  CDIO  class  includes  the  finalizing  of  the  design  for  a  planar 
EMFF  test  bed.    The  class  will  be  holding  its  Critical  Design  Review  (CDR)  on  December  5, 
2002,  and  the  final  hardware  design  presented  in  their  CDR  will  be  described  in  the  December 
progress report. 

Recent  work  in  the  MIT  SSL  has  focused  on  investigating  specific  applications  of  the 
EMFF  in  Low  Earth  Orbit  (LEO),  particularly  with  regards  to  managing  angular  momentum 
accumulation  in  LEO  due  to  periodic  disturbances.    The  following  report  discusses  in  detail 
the  use  of  EMFF  to  manage  angular  momentum  buildup,  specifically  due  to  the  Earth ’s 
magnetic  field  and  due  to  its  oblateness  about  the  equator,  also  known  as  the  J2  perturbation. 
Results  of  these  analyses  indicate  that  EMFF  could  serve  well  in  this  application,  replacing  the 
use of  thrusters  to correct for J2 accelerations, and  thus removing an array’s dependence on non(cid:173)
renewable  fuel  supplies.   These  results  are  promising,  as  they  suggest  yet  another  application  in 
which EMFF may be quite useful. 

ANGULAR MOMENTUM MANAGEMENT 

1.  Overview 

EMFF has  the property  that all  the  forces generated by  the electromagnets are  internal  to 
the  system.    Excluding  any  disturbance  interactions  with  the  Earth's  magnetic  field,  EMFF 
cannot apply any external forces to the formation. This prevents EMFF from having the ability to 
change  the  inertial  position  of  a  formation.    It  also  prevents  changes  in  the  total  system  angular 
momentum.  While  reaction wheels are used  to  temporarily  store angular momentum changes  in 
a formation, they are not able to change the total system angular momentum. 

In  an  ideal  situation,  this  would  not  be  an  issue,  since  the  angular  momentum  of  the 
system  would  remain  constant.  However,  disturbance  forces  cause  unwanted  torques  on  a 
satellite  formation  and  cause  a  net  gain  in  its  system  angular momentum.  If  left  unchecked,  the 
reaction wheels will eventually  saturate and become useless.   These disturbance  torques must be 
accounted for, and methods for removing this unwanted angular momentum are suggested in this 
report. 

2.  Earth ’s Magnetic Field 

One  disturbance  source  that  is  immediately  apparent  is  the  Earth's  magnetic  field. 
Whenever any of the EMFF electromagnets are energized, they interact with the Earth's magnetic 
field.  This  disturbance  will  manifest  itself  as  disturbance  forces  and  torques  on  the  satellite 
formation.  These disturbance forces and  torques will cause a net gain  in  the angular momentum 
of the satellite formation. 

In  order  to  characterize  this  effect,  the  Earth  can  be  thought  of  as  one  large 
electromagnetic  dipole.    This  is  the  same  simplification  technique  used  in  previous  studies, 
where  interactions  (forces  and  torques)  between  the  electromagnets  on  different  spacecraft  are 
modeled  as  functions  of  the  product  of  the  magnetic  dipole  strengths.    One  novel  way  of 
canceling  the  disturbance  torques  and  forces  due  to  the  Earth's  magnetic field  is  to  reverse  the 
polarity  of  every  spacecraft  dipole  at  the  same  time  [Hashimoto  et  al.  2002].  Since  the 
electromagnetic  forces are  functions of  the product of  the dipoles,  the  inter-spacecraft  forces are 
unchanged.   However  the disturbance forces and  torques due  to  the Earth's dipole have switched 
sign,  thus  canceling  out  the  disturbance  forces.    This  polarity  switching  could  be  done  at  a  low 
frequency;  the  dipoles  would  switch  only  when  the  accumulated  angular  momentum  becomes 
large,  or  the  switching  could  also  be  done  at  a  relatively  high  frequency,  essentially  preventing 
any angular momentum build-up. 

Since we  have  the  ability  to  apply  a  net  torque  to  the  satellite  formation  in  one  direction 
or  the  other,  the  Earth's  magnetic  field  could  be  utilized  to  remove  the  overall  net  angular 
momentum  of  the  system.  If  the  system  were  gaining  angular  momentum  due  to  some  other 
disturbance  torque,  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  could  be  used  to  reduce  the  system  angular 
momentum.  Also,  since  the  inter-spacecraft  forces  are  once  again  products  of  the  magnetic 
dipole  strengths,  we  can  selectively  turn  up  one  satellite's  dipole  strength  and  reduce  the  other 
spacecraft ’s dipole  strength.   The  inter-satellite  forces and  torques would  remain unchanged, but 

the  magnetic  disturbance  force  would  be  focused  on  one  specific  satellite.  Thus  individual 
satellites could be targeted for momentum exchange. 

3.  LEO and the J2 Disturbance 

Satellite  formations  in  Low  Earth  Orbit  (LEO)  are  subjected  to  variations  in  the  Earth's 
gravitational  potential.   The  largest  variation  is  known  as  the  J2  gravitational  potential  constant. 
The J2  term refers to the fact that the Earth is not round, but has a mass bulge around the equator. 
This mass bulge has  three main effects on  the satellite formation:  it changes  the orbital period of 
the  satellite,  it  causes  the  formation  to  separate  in  the  cross-track  direction,  and  it  causes  the 
formation as a whole to rotate about its own angular momentum vector. 

One  effect  of  the  J2  geopotential  is  that  it  causes  a  satellite's  orbital  angular  momentum 
vector  to  precess  about  the  vector  coincident with  the North Pole.   The  rate  of  this  precession  is 
dependent  primarily  on  the  satellite  inclination  and  altitude.    Except  for  a  couple  of  specific 
geometry  formations,  satellite  formations  usually  have  satellites  with  slightly  different 
inclinations and altitudes and  thus different  rates of precession of  the orbital angular momentum 
vector.  The  different  rates  of  precession  cause  the  formation  to  drift  apart,  since  their  orbital 
planes  are  not  aligned  anymore.    Internal  forces  can  be  used  to  counteract  these  differential  J2 
forces. 

In  order  to  counteract  these  disturbance  forces,  shear  forces must  be  used,  and  there  is  a 
net gain or loss in the formation angular momentum.  The loss or gain of the angular momentum 
is dependent, not on  the  direction of  the EMFF  dipole  as with  the Earth's magnetic  field,  but on 
the  geometry  of  the  formation.    Certain  satellite  formation  shapes  and  phasings  produce  a  net 
gain in the formation angular momentum and other formations produce a net loss. Once again, if 
this angular momentum gain or  loss  is  left unchecked,  the reaction wheels will become saturated 
as they absorb more and more of the angular momentum. 

Because  of  the  ability  to  select  the  net  gain  or  loss  of  the  angular  momentum  vector  by 
simply  re-phasing  the  formation,  angular  momentum  change  due  to  J2  disturbances  does  not 
prevent EMFF  from  being  a viable  option  for  satellites within LEO.    In  fact,  the  J2 disturbance, 
much  like  the  Earth's  magnetic  field,  can  be  used  to  add  or  lose  angular  momentum  from  the 
system  that  is  gained  from  other  sources.  Overall,  torque  management  is  key  to  the  success  of 
EMFF.  Luckily there are ways to change the system angular moment buildup without the use of 
thrusters. 

4.  Angular Momentum Management in the Presence of J2 Disturbances  

The  J2  effect  of  the  Earth’s  geopotential  is  a  disturbance  acceleration  on  satellite 
formations  that  must  be  counteracted.    This  section  looks  in  detail  at  the  effects  of  fighting  the 
separation of an array in the cross-track direction. 

The acceleration of a satellite due to the J2 force is defined as:

  is  a  local  vertical,  local  horizontal

(LVLH)  coordinate  system with  the  origin  of  the  coordinate  system  coinciding with  a  reference 
orbit.  The  xˆ
  vector  points  in  the  radial  direction,  the  zˆ
  vector  is  perpendicular  to  the  orbital 
plane  and  points  in  the  direction  of  the  angular  momentum  vector.    Finally,  the yˆ  vector 
ˆ  − − zˆ  coordinate 
yˆ
completes  the  orthogonal  triad,  pointing  in  the  direction  of movement. The  x
system is a curvilinear coordinate system.  The  xˆ
 vector remains unchanged, while the  yˆ  and  zˆ 
vectors curve along a sphere with radius rref. 

While  J2  disturbances  acting  on  the  formation  as  a  whole  are  important,  it  is  the 
differential  disturbance  accelerations  between  the  satellites  in  the  cluster  that  causes  the 
formation to separate. 

Linearizing the J2 acceleration about one of the satellites produces the following result:

Assuming a  two-satellite formation with one satellite at  the center of a closed Hills orbit, 
the second satellite will orbit the first (assuming no disturbances) as defined by Hill’s equations:

One approximation  to calculating  the differential  forces over one orbital period  is  to  take 
the non-perturbed motion and dot it with the gradient of the J2 disturbance:

J 2 

(4) 

where & 
  is  the relative position of one satellite with respect  to another.   This differential force  is 
s
then  converted  to  axial  and  shear  components.    The  axial  force  needed  to  counteract  the 
differential  J2  forces  does  not  produce  any  torque  on  the  satellite  formation.    It  is  the  shear 
component of the force that produces torque on the satellite formation and must be counteracted. 
Forces in the radial direction are along the axis between the two satellites, and the tangential and 
normal  accelerations  are  the  shear  forces  with  the  tangential  force  lying  in  the  relative  orbital 

plane,  and  the normal  force, normal  to  this plane.  Forces  in  the  tangential  and normal direction 
produce  a  torque  on  the  satellite  system  and  the  net  angular  momentum  gain  or  loss  must  be 
accounted for. 

Figure 1 shows  the disturbance accelerations due  to  the J2 geopotential on a 50m satellite 
formation.  The  reaction  wheel  will  absorb  the  fluxuation  over  an  orbital  period,  but  if  the 
accelerations  in  the  normal  and  tangential  direction  integrate  to  a  non-zero  number,  the  reaction 
wheels will eventually saturate.

Looking  at  equation  4,  the  relative  obrit  between  the  two  satellites  can  be  changed  by

shape  of  the  formation,  while  λ1, λ2  control  the  phasing  of  the  formation.  The  phasing  plays  a 
very  important  roll  in  the  direction  of  the  gain.  Figure  2  shows  the  integrated  value  of  the 
differential  acceleration  over  one  orbit  as  a  function  of λ1, λ2.   There  are  two  things  that  should 
be  taken from  these plots.   First, certain phasing angles produce zero net gain  in  the  torque, both 
in  the  normal  and  tangential  directions.    These  formation  do  not  have  a  net  gain  in  the  system 
angular  momentum  when  counteracting  the  differential  J2  disturbances.  Also,  the  net  gain 
appears  to  be  somewhat  sinusoidal,  and  so  the  net  gain  is  either  positive  or  negative,  depending 
on the phasing angles.

Overall, Figure 2  shows  that while  for most  satellite  formations,  there  is a net gain  in  the 
system  angular momentum when  counteracting  the  J2  disturbance,  the  direction  of  the  gain  can 
be chosen at will by simply rephasing the satellite formation, and thus can be used to control the 
system angular momentum.
