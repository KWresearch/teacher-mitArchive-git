<BAB>

The CDIO Space Systems Product Development Class met as a team for the first time five weeks ago.  At this 
meeting we were presented with the challenge of demonstrating the feasibility of using electromagnetic control 
for formation flight of satellites.  Since then the team has been working diligently to understand the problem and 
quantify any relevant requirements and trades.  To this end, the class organized it self into the following groups: 
Requirements, Processes, Architecture, and Databases.  The Requirements team was formed to identify all 
customer requirements and constraints and to levy other pertinent requirements as dictated by the nature of the 
project.  The Processes team was formed to act as a systems engineering team so as to coordinate the other 
teams.  In addition, the processes team set up the processes by which the class would conduct the remainder of 
the project.  The Architecture team was formed to quantify the design trades in order to identify important 
metrics.  In the process of doing so, the Architecture team also drafted design possibilities and investigated these 
possibilities.  The Databases team was formed to construct a database of possible parts and manufacturers.  This 
database will become invaluable in determining whether to make or buy a particular part.  This database will 
also enable the project team to select parts that meet requirements.  Once the TARR has passed, the class will be 
divided into subsystem groups with a systems group coordinating the project.

The purpose of the TARR is explicit in its name, Trade Analysis and Requirements Review.  Specifically, the 
class hopes to review the requirements that have been levied and the trade analyses that have been conducted. 
The purpose of presenting this to an audience is twofold: 

1. To require the class to polish their work by having to make it presentable to an outside 

audience.

2. To seek outside view of our work as it stands. 

The class realizes that we do not have all the answers and hopes that through this exercise we will gain further 
understanding and new insight into the project.

<BAB & ESS & WDF> 

Formation flight of satellites is defined as the use of a cluster of satellites maintaining a designated formation in 
Space Flight. Although formation flight of satellites has yet to be used in practice it is being discussed in the 
aerospace industry as a way to provide new mission capabilities for satellites. SPHERES demonstrated the initial 
feasibility of the use of a group of satellites in formation flight and we hope to expand on this research with our 
project.

Electromagnetic control of satellites essentially means that we will be using electromagnets as the force 
generators to control the relative position, attitude, and angular rate of a cluster of satellites. This control can be 
achieved by varying the current in the coil of an electromagnet to vary the B field the electromagnets provide.

A number of current satellite missions are considering multiple spacecraft architectures for a variety of reasons. 
First, multiple spacecraft can be separated to large baselines thereby improving angular resolution for imaging, 
astrometry, and planet detection. Second, each spacecraft in the formation can be smaller than a single spacecraft 
designed to perform the same mission and thereby provide easier packaging, launch, and deployment. Third, 
since inter-spacecraft interfaces are soft (e.g., communications, optics, control, metrology), if a spacecraft fails, 
it can easily be removed from the formation and replaced with a functioning spacecraft. Fourth, as technology 
improves, replacement spacecraft can be launched and integrated into the array thereby evolving the formation’s 
capabilities without the costly “block changes” typical of past programs. (Miller, D. et. al., EMFF for Sparse 
Aperture Telescopes)

One of the main arguments for utilizing satellite formation flight for surveillance and imaging applications is the 
fact that large sensor apertures can be synthesized without the need for correspondingly large physical 
structures.  In the case of interferometry, larger apertures lead to higher resolution.  But other advantages to 
formation flight are equally compelling: these include the possibility of dynamically changing the formation 
geometry to respond to evolving mission sensing requirements or to address multiple missions, and the 
capability of replacing failed formation elements on orbit more efficiently and economically than heretofore.

Challenges of Current Formation

•  Command and control 
– Must control multiple vehicles’ inertial

•  Drawbacks of propellant for ACS

– Gas plumes contaminate IR and other 
imaging instruments 

–  Ion plumes potentially contaminate

BAB

While these benefits are clear, there are several drawbacks. As one explores the design of these systems in more 
depth, one recognizes that there is a miss-match between the geometric requirements that the formation must 
achieve and the way in which that geometry is controlled. Specifically, the relative separations between 
spacecraft, not the absolute inertial position in space, is important. However, thrusters actuate inertial degrees-
of-freedom.  In addition, precision formation flight of the satellites in the array requires that precious propellant 
be expended to maintain the formation geometry. This has several implications. First, propellant is a consumable 
which, once depleted, renders the satellite useless. Second, the impingement of a thruster plume on a 
neighboring spacecraft can cause a dynamic disturbance to its stability, deposit particulates on sensitive optics, 
induce inadvertent charging, and actually ablate material off the spacecraft thereby causing permanent damage. 
Third, for missions such as NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF), the propellant plume can put a thermally 
bright haze across the line-of-sight of the telescope. For example, micron particles at room temperature can blind 
TPF even if the particles are many kilometers away. Furthermore, low speed plume exhaust will tend to be 
attracted to the spacecraft creating a local pollution haze through which the telescope must look.  (adapted from

To overcome some of the difficulties of current FF technology, the use of electromagnets for formation control 
has been suggested.  Research has been conducted into the control models of such a system by the MIT Space 
Systems Laboratory (SSL). 

As earlier discussed, one of the undesirable aspects of formation flight is the use of thrusters.  EMFF would 
eliminate the use of thrusters for position in the formation.  This would lead to longer life, no contamination of 
IR imaging, and no damaging plume.  In addition EMFF would lead to better control of the formation. 
Specifically electromagnets control relative position instead of inertial position and it is this relative positioning 
capacity that we seek.

ESS & BAB 

There are also challenges with using Electromagnets for control of Formation flight. The first of which, is that it 
has never been done before. The problem of controlling satellites using electromagnets is also formidable. The 
details of the electromagnetic effects with multiple poles in multiple planes gets exponentially complicated with 
the number of satellites and degrees of freedom that need to be controlled. The system is inherently unstable and 
has the added difficulty that the control of each satellite is coupled with the motions of every other satellite in 
the constellation. Electromagnets are also very heavy and have a force which drops off proportional to the 
separation distance to the fourth.

SSL) and Lockheed-Martin Advanced Technology Center (LM-ATC) (hereafter referred to as T-M).  Both

•Representative Formation Flying Maneuvers:

•Replace thrusters: “The EMFF system would replace the traditional thrusters in maintaining the geometry of the 
formation in space or in evolving it in response to changing surveillance requirements,”  (E-S, p.1, col. 1a) [RD 
2.3.1]

•Degrees of Freedom (DOF): “As part of the EMFF program, this class will design, build, test, and operate a 
testbed that will allow for three and six DOF EMFF,” (T-M, p.4, col. 1a) [RD 2.3.2].  The class interpretation of 
this statement is as follows 

•The system shall operate in two dimensions. 

•Each individual vehicle shall have three controlled DOF:  two of translation and one of rotation (X, 
Y, (cid:537)).

•The system shall control all relative DOF.  The six possible DOF for two vehicles are as follows: 
linear separation distance, “skew” separation, direct translation of the formation, rotation of each 
individual vehicle, and rotation of the formation.  However, since the forces in an EMFF system are all 
internal to the system, the formation cannot translate its own center of mass.  Therefore, our System 
Functional Requirements will show that EMF2ORCE shall control all relative system DOF.

•Since the applications of this system involve space-based satellites, eventually the idea will be 
implemented in a three-dimensional environment. Therefore, EMF2ORCE shall show potential for 
translation to control six individual DOF (in 3-D: X, Y, Z, (cid:537), (cid:307), (cid:524)).

•The system shall have a robust control design and implementation that provides for the following: 

•Disturbance rejection: “… design that will have the capability to counteract any disturbance force 
that the satellite formation will encounter…” (T-M, p.1, col. 2b) [RD 2.3.3.1] 

•Vehicle repositioning: “have enough control authority to reposition satellites within the formation”
(T-M, p.1, col. 2b) [RD 2.3.3.2] 

•Restoring forces: “… using magnets to generate the necessary restoring forces [to remain stable 
for a sufficiently long time],” (E-S, p.1, col. 1b) [RD 2.3.3.3] 

Large-scale concerns such as the effect of the Earth’s magnetic field or valid orbital metrology techniques are 
not addressed by EMF2ORCE.  These points are outside the scope of our project; they will be tackled by the 
MIT SSL and LM-ATC.

•The system must demonstrate stable maneuverability using at least three vehicles.  This requirement, [5.1.1.1] 
stems from the customer requirements [2.1, 2.3.3]. 

•Control each relative system degree of freedom This requirement, [5.1.1.3] is derived from [2.3.2]. It implies 
the system must be demonstrated in 2 dimensions with identifiable transition to 3 dimensions.  Also, it cannot 
control absolute motion of center of mass. 

• The system should complete a representative five-rotation system maneuver as stated in [5.1.2.1] based on 
customer requirement [2.2.1], This maneuver will include one rotation for spin-up from rest to a separation 
distance of at least 2 meters.  Then, it will complete three rotations at a constant angular rate of 6 degrees of arc

•The system should operate in the far field of EM control as stated in [5.1.2.2]  This stems from customer 
requirements [2.2, 2.3] The “far field” interpretation implies a separation distance of at least 10 times 
electromagnet length. Any different interpretation will lead to inconsistencies with the 2 meter separation 
distance.

•The system shall operate without needing recharged batteries or gas resupply for a period of time useful to 
perform several tests, as stated in [5.1.1].  This comes from the constraints [4.6, 4.7]  Based on the five-rotation 
maneuver, duration of a single test is 5 minutes so stability can be demonstrated, data recorded, and significant 
maneuvers can be performed. 

•Operate with no external umbilicals as stated in [5.2.2] from constraint [4.5] This means the power supply must 
be on-board, wireless communication must be used, and all other resources (such as gas supply) must be self-
contained. 

•Each vehicle must be identicle to the others in the system.  This allows mission flexibility in that each vehicle 
can perform any task.  Also, the vehicles must be able to be replaced.  Identicle vehicles allows for easy 
replacement, as well as cost efficiency through standardized parts.  This is requirement [5.2.3] as derived from 
[2.2.2]

•Each vehicle shall record flight data including position and health.  The data will be sent to a ground station for 
inflight analysis, as well as recorded for later download and analysis. These are requirements  [5.2.4, 5.2.5], 
which come from the constraints [4.7, 4.8.2] 

•The system shall respond to other satellites in formation in real time at a distance of at least 2 meters to 
demonstrate far field, but no greater than 8 meters due to size of testing facility. These requirements [5.2.6, 
5.2.7] come from [2.2] 

•The system shall respond to user input from a ground station within 0.1 seconds as stated in [5.2.8] stemming 
from [2.2] 

•The system shall demonstrate a basic level of autonomy [5.2.9]  The system will receive user input from a 
ground station but must then executed the maneuver without further user input.  It must maintain stability, reject 
disturbances, and reposition the vehicles without additional user input.  This requirement stems from the 
customer requirement  [2.2.1] 

•The system must not be damaged during testing as stated in [5.2.10]. This comes from the constraints [4.8.1, 
4.8.2]

•The air carriage must support the full weight of the vehicle.  The system must remain stable when it is raised 
from the ground by the air carriage.  The height required to be lifted is determined by the roughness of the test 
space.  The height must clear the degree of roughness.  This requirement [6.1.2.1] is derived from  [4.2.2.2, 
5.1.1.1]

•The on-board power supply and gas supply must be easily accessible.  It shall take less than a minute to access 
the different resources so they can be replenished and renewed without wasting test time. This requirement 
[6.1.2.2] stems from the constraint [4.6] 

•On-board subsystems should also be located so they can be readily accessed.  The computer system, sensing 
system, and  other subsystems should be easily accessed for repair or maintenance without disturbing other 
subsystems. This is requirement [6.1.2.3] stemming from constraint [4.6] 

•Each vehicle must contain ports to download health and position telemetry after test run for later analysis. This 
is requirement [6.1.2.4] from constraint [4.7] 

•During testing, the system may not contain umbilicals that would alter angular momentum. This suggests

Functional Requirements 

•Each vehicle must contain one onboard power supply and one spare. The power supplies must be chargeable 
and reusable to save money.  While one is being used, the other can charge. This requirement [6.2.1.1] is from 
constraint [4.6] 

•Each power supply must sustain power for 30 minutes. This is to allow time for multiple tests without renewing 
power.  This is requirement [6.2.1.2] is from [5.2.1] 

•The batteries shall be usable (still able to be recharged) for at least one year, or the length of design and testing. 
This requirement [6.2.1.3] is derived from the constraints [4.1, 4.2] 

Operational Requirements 

•The power suppy shall be recharged in 30 minutes to allow for continual testing. This is requirement [6.2.2.1] is 
from constraint [4.6] 

•Power supply completely contained within structure. Requirement [6.2.2.2] stemming from [5.2.2.1] 

To allow the system to run freely on the testing environment the power must be internal.  An untethered in-flight 
power supply is necessary to simulate space-like dynamics – outside forces will affect the dynamics and stability 
of individual vehicles through friction and balance. 

The testing time will generally be less than 30 minutes.  Spin up and Spin down times will be less than 5 
minutes, and stable flight will generally last less than 5 minutes.  It is desired that multiple test be run on the 
same power unit. 

The recharge time is set so that at no time will we be unable to perform a test because we do not have a power 
unit.  This is coupled with the requirement that we have 2 power units per vehicle. 

The requirement of a 1 year overall life is set so that we do not have to replace the units while in our testing 
phase.  Our testing phase will be less than 1 year, however, power units tend to deteriorate as time progress, 
resulting in a less efficient power supply.

•Each vehicle shall control three degrees of freedom.  In a multiple vehicle configuration, there will be many 
degrees of freedom, both relative and absolute.  Absolute degrees of freedom, such as translation of center of 
mass of system, will be impossible.  Only relative degrees of freedom will be controlled, as stated in requirement 
[6.3.1.1] traced to [5.1.1.2] 

•Both relative position and angle will be controlled to a certain tolerance.  These are dependent on the 
separation distance and the angular rotation rate.  These are requirements [6.3.1.1.1, 6.3.1.1.2] with 
suggested separation distances and rotation rates listed in [5.1.2.1.2] 

•The size of the electromagnet determines the strength, and the ratio of the separation distance to length of 
magnet determines satisfaction of the far field requirement.  The electromagnet must be sized to satisfy far field 
requirement. This is requirement [6.3.1.2] as derived from [5.1.2.2] 

•One function of the electromagnet besides controlling motion is to induce stability This requirement [6.3.1.3], 
along with the details regarding stability below, are derived from requirement [5.1.1.1] 

•Responsiveness of the magnet must be sufficient to respond to small changes and maintain stability. 

•The magnet location must be determined to not disturb system stability.  In a moving system, the 
magnet of one vehicle can create a torque on other vehicles if the magnets are not located near the 
midpoint of the vehicle. 

•Many equations used to model the system assume the magnet is an infinite solenoid.  The magnet should 
approximate an infinite solenoid for this reason and to limit fringe effect of the field lines.

There are many points addressed in the customer requirements documents and 
discussed in class which do not specifically qualify as “requirements.”  Among 
these are recommendations to make use of new technology to support the 
electromagnetic system, including power supply and shielding or cooling systems. 
Other new areas include the EM control itself, with brand-new control algorithms 
based on different magnetic dipole configuration.  These and other concerns

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities

<JB, TS, LW, GG> 
These are the primary system trades necessary to provide a preliminary architectural  
analysis. 

Looking at the relevant force equations, we will be able to manipulate them into  
equations for core mass, vehicle mass, and magnetic moment.  These equations will  
be based off given values for radius of separation. 

We will make certain dipole assumptions and use these to analyze some of the  
various constraints to the problem. 

Using conservation of angular momentum equations, we will get an idea for the  
necessary moment of inertia for the torque wheel.  From there, mass and radius  
estimates can be made depending on the shape of the torque wheel. 

By deriving equations for inductance and resistance, we can figure out the time  
constant of the electromagnet.  This is important in determining how fast the  
response of the system will be. 

Finally, we will conduct a voltage and power analysis and compare these equations  
to the time constant equation.

During rotation, the centripetal force must balance the electromagnetic force from 
each magnet.  This is necessary to keep the satellites from either flying apart or 
coming together.  This balance is shown in the first equation. 

Magnetic moments of each satellite (A and B) are assumed to be equal.  The 
equation is rewritten in terms of the magnetic dipole moment, mu_magnet.  The 
magnetic moment that will be provided by the magnet is equal to the quantity 
2.15*(volume of the iron core)/mu_nought.  This relation provides the necessary 
core volume for given values of mass, angular rotation and separation.  The value 
2.15 Tesla is the magnetic saturation value for iron.  Magnetic saturation is the 
maximum obtainable field strength for a material.  We will aim to operate slightly 
below the saturation point during testing, but for purposes of analysis we use the 
value of 2.15. 

Mu_nought is the permeability of free space, and is a constant.

The magnetic moment equation was manipulated to provide an equation for the  
mass of the iron core.  This equation gives a relation between the mass of the  
magnetic core and the total vehicle mass (including the core mass). 

A value of 7000 kg/m^3 was used as the density of iron. 
A radius of 0.5 m was used because a separation distance of 1 m was assumed. 
The value for omega used in this analysis is 2pi/15 rad/sec.  The actual value will be  
mandated in the Requirements Document.

The x-axis represents the total mass of the vehicle, which includes the mass of the 
magnetic core.  The y-axis represents the mass of only the magnetic core.  Due to 
this definition of ‘total mass,’ it is not possible to have a core mass greater than the 
vehicle’s total mass.  The straight line on the graph is the line core_mass = 
vehicle_mass.  Therefore, all configurations shown in the darkened area are not 
possible.

The curve shown on the graph represents the core mass as a function of vehicle 
mass.  The point where the curve crosses the straight line is the smallest possible 
configuration, where the entire vehicle mass consists of only the core mass (leaving 
no room for any other components).  All other possible configurations are located 
along the curve to the right of this point.

The separation distance between the curve and the straight line represents the 
available mass for all other system components.

This graph shows the previous graph with the added dimension of radius of  
separation.  
Vehicle configuration options are feasible until the radius of separation increases to  
a certain critical value.  This point is shown on the graph where the curve  
(core_mass as a function of vehicle_mass and radius) breaches the flat plane  
(core_mass = vehicle_mass). 
Feasible options are only those for which the curve lies beneath the flat plane.

The diagram on the left depicts two stationary dipoles just before spin-up.  The 
straight arrows represent net forces on each dipole.  The curved arrows represent net 
moments on each dipole. 

The diagram on the right depicts the two dipoles as they begin to spin up.  The 
dipoles begin perpendicular to each other.  As soon as a current is applied to the 
electromagnets, forces and moments are induced in the dipoles.  The moments are 
due to the perpendicular geometry of the system at this point.  These moments must 
be counteracted by an applied torque from the torque wheels.  The dipoles initially 
move in the directions of their respective net forces.  As they begin to move the 
applied torque is decreased to induce centripetal motion.  As centripetal force 
increases, the applied torque continuously decreases, which allows the rotating 
dipoles to slowly become aligned along the same axis. At the point when there is no 
more applied torque, the dipoles are perfectly aligned and the centripetal force 
equals the magnetic force. The system is now in steady-state.

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities

<LW> 
These assumptions are constraints which the system would ideally satisfy.  
However, by fixing all these parameters, design freedom is removed from the  
system.  The design would be fully constrained.  Therefore, some of these  
assumptions must be relaxed through the course of the design process.  

Alpha is the aspect ratio.  To satisfy the assumption that the solenoid is infinitely  
long, alpha should be at least 10. 
(cid:65) is the length of the solenoid. 
a is the radius of the solenoid. 

Beta is a parameter that measures the far-field capability of the system.  To satisfy 
the assumption of operation in the far-field, beta should be ~10. 
2r is the distance of separation, as defined in configuration assumptions. 

It is also assumed that the magnet comprises a significant proportion of the total  
vehicle mass (one half of the total vehicle mass).  This is a rough estimate based on  
the properties of electromagnets.  The assumption is based specifically on the fact  
that electromagnets are heavy and weak.

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities 

47 

<LW> 

Here both the far-field approximation and the infinite solenoid approximation are 
applied, as shown in the first equation.  When these two constraints are applied 
simultaneously, r=100a. 

The analysis begins with the original force balance equation.  The relation r=100a is 
plugged into the force balance equation, as is the relation for magnetic moment, 
mu=BV/mu_nought.  Here B is the applied magnetic field strength and V is the 
volume of the magnetic core.  The relation for ‘a’ is found by simplifying the 
resulting expression. 

The expression for ‘a’ shows that the system is over-constrained.  ‘a’ is only a 
function of omega and m.  Omega is defined for the system in the Requirements 
Document.  Therefore, ‘a’ is only a function of the mass of the system.  As ‘a’ is 
directly related to l and r through the constraints, this means that for every mass of 
the system, there is a corresponding system geometry that is defined on the basis of 
the dipole assumptions. 

Since it is not ideal to have system geometry defined solely by total mass, it is 
necessary to relax one of the constraints placed on the system.  It is most likely that 
the far-field assumption will be relaxed, because some of our testing facilities may 
not capable of running tests in the far-field.

It is assumed that the torque wheel is a ring.  The moment of inertia, I, is  
represented as:  I=mr2. 

In order to satisfy the conservation of angular momentum, the angular momentum  
of the vehicles in steady-state rotation must be equal to the angular momentum of  
the torque wheels at the instant spin-up begins. 

The parameters omega_reactionwheel, omega_formation, and r_formation are given  
properties of the system.  Therefore, the conservation of angular momentum  
relationship provides a method to find the mass and radius of the reaction wheel as a  
function of total vehicle mass.

Electromagnet Time Constant 
MIT Aero/Astro 

•  Looking at equations that govern overall system 
dynamics:
–  System time constant = rotation rate of the 
system, (cid:550).

•  To control the system, electromagnet time 
constant must be less than the system time 
constant.

•  Electromagnet time constant is L/R. 
–  Need to find equations for inductance and 
resistance.

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities 

49 

<TAS>

The time constant of the electromagnet is an important factor, since a small time 
constant means a faster response from the electromagnet.  Looking at the equations 
of the dynamics of the system, the natural system time constant is equal to the 
rotation rate of the entire formation.  The time constant of the electromagnet should 
thus be smaller than this value.  The equation for the electromagnet time constant is 
L/R (inductance/resistance), so we need to find equations for these now.

Here an initial equation for resistance is given.  Next, the relationship for standard 
wire gauges is noted.  For most wires, the maximum current it can carry divided by 
pi*wire_radius^2 is a constant.  The value of this constant is the same for most all 
wire gauges.  The length of the wire is then put in terms of number of turns and core 
diameter.  This yields an expression for resistance in terms of material resistivity, 
number of turns, radius of the core, and current. 

It is possible to find an expression for the radius of the core.  Recalling the two 
given equations, the necessary radius of the core can be written as a function of 
magnetic moment, induced magnetic field, and alpha (the aspect ratio of the core).

By combining the equations for inductance and resistance, the result is the equation

induced magnetic field in the core, and the aspect ratio.

This is the graph of time constant vs. aspect ratio.  The values assumed are: 

Rho: the resistivity of copper wire 
C_o: this value was computed using data from standard 20, 22, and 24 gauge wire. 
Mu_magnet: this value was computed from the earlier equation mu_magnet = 
2.15*Volume_core/mu_nought. 
Mu_nought: this is the permeability of free space. 
Bmagnet:  this is the saturation point for iron. 

This graph shows that by increasing the aspect ratio of the magnet, the time constant  
will also be increased. 
We expect to be operating at an aspect ratio of ~10, meaning the time constant of  
the electromagnet should be around 2.3.

This graph shows that a reduction in the time constant may be achieved using wires

The current is derived from the definition of magnetic field, where B =  
(mu_nought)(chi)(ni).  Chi is the magnetic susceptibility, which is a material  
property.  Chi is equal to the ratio of the induced magnetic field to the applied  
magnetic field. 
Using the relationship for power (P=iV) and the previously derived voltage  
expression, the final power equation is found.  This equation dictates how much  
power the system requires.

There is a linear relationship between power and resistivity.  The red lines show the 
power estimate when a 22 gauge copper wire is used.  The resistivity of copper wire 
is shown in the parameters at the right as rho.  This graph shows a similar power 
estimate as is predicted by the power vs. aspect ratio graph, approximately 0.55

The expressions for L/R and P are given again here.  It is clear that power is directly 
related to the time constant.  This is an interesting relationship to consider when 
designing a control system, as the goal is to minimize the time constant.  Power may 
be a limiting factor in control system design.

•  Found core mass as a function of vehicle 
mass (force balance equations). 
–  Certain values of core mass were invalid. 
–  A maximum allowable radius of separation 
exists.
•  Both far field and infinitely long solenoid 
assumptions over-constrained the system. 
–  Relax one constraint (most likely far field). 
•  Found required moment of inertia of the 
torque wheels (conservation of angular 
momentum). 

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities 

62 

<TAS> 
After analyzing the governing equations for the system, several major design  
tradeoffs were noted. 
An equation for core mass was found in terms of total mass of the system and radius  
of separation.  Here, we saw that some total mass values below a certain point were  
invalid because the iron core would have been heavier than the total mass (which  
includes the iron core).  If you increased the total mass of the system beyond this  
critical point, the percentage of total mass taken up by core mass decreased, leaving  
larger amounts of mass available for all other components.  These relations were  
then plotted on a 3-D graph, where radius was allowed to vary.  This showed that  
for values of radius above a certain point, the values for core and total mass were  
invalid. 
An analysis was made on the far-field and infinitely long solenoid assumptions.  
This analysis showed that when these assumptions are both put into place, the  
system is over-constrained, leaving no freedom for the selection of core radius.  
Freedom is restored if one of these assumptions is relaxed, which will likely be the  
far-field assumption. 
By looking at the conservation of momentum equations, the required moment of  
inertia for the torque wheel could be found.  Depending on the geometry of the  
torque wheel, estimates of radius and mass could then be made.

•  Found electromagnetic time constant 
(inductance and resistance equations). 
–  Time constant most easily changed by varying 
the aspect ratio of the electromagnet. 

•  Found equations for voltage and power. 
–  Also a function of aspect ratio. 

•  Showed that decreasing the time constant 
increases the necessary power. 

•  What now? 

–  Apply these trades to the various subsystems. 

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities

<TAS> 
By finding equations for inductance and resistance, the time constant of the  
electromagnet was found (L/R).  This equation showed that the time constant  
depended mostly on aspect ratio of the magnet, and somewhat on the resistivity of  
the wire used in the coils.  However, since it is difficult to obtain wires with  
abnormally high resistivities, it is easiest to vary the aspect ratio in order to vary the  
time constant.  The objective of varying the time constant is to make it as small as  
possible in order to provide as much control as possible over the system. 
Equations for voltage and power were then derived.  These equations also depended  
primarily on aspect ratio and resistivity.  Through comparison with the time  
constant equation, it was shown that any effort to reduce the time constant would  
result in higher power requirements. 

The next step in the design process is to apply these overall system trades to the  
individual subsystem designs.

The overall system will be divided into six major subsystems: 

Avionics: these are the onboard computers that will run the program codes and  
control the system as a whole.  They will also act as an interface between the  
communication, metrology, attitude control, and power systems. 

Communication: this subsystem will be responsible for transmitting data from  
vehicle to vehicle and from each vehicle to the ground base.  Some of the different  
types of data to be transmitted include telemetry, system health, and attitude and  
position measurements. 

Metrology: this is the method by which attitude and position of each vehicle will be  
determined.  Onboard sensors will be used to make these measurements, which will  
then be passed to the control system.

• Attitude Control: combines previous three 
subsystems with electromagnets and torque 
wheels to control attitude and relative 
positions. 
• Power: provides the necessary voltage and 
current needed to operate the system 
• Structure:
–  Basic structure: holds all components together 
–  Magnetic shielding: shields avionics from 
potential damage due to the magnetic field 
–  Air carriage: provides a frictionless way to 
operate vehicles on the testbed 
ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities

Subsystems (cont): 

Attitude Control: the attitude and relative position of each vehicle will be controlled 
by the electromagnets.  By varying the current through each electromagnet, the 
vehicles can be controlled to perform complex configurations, including spin-up 
and spin-down maneuvers.  This subsystem will also include the torque wheels 
which will provide the necessary angular momentum reactions. 

Power: this will provide the necessary currents and voltages to the other subsystems. 

Structure: there are three components to the main structure – the basic structure, the 
magnetic shielding, and the air carriages.  The basic structure will be responsible for 
holding all the system components together and forming the outer shell of the 
vehicles.  Magnetic shielding will most likely be necessary to protect the avionics 
and sensors from possible damage due to the presence of a strong magnetic field 
from the electromagnet.  Finally, air carriages will be needed to produce a 
frictionless environment in which to perform operation tests on the vehicles.

representation does not reflect any detailed analysis of the potential layout of the 
various subsystems, but rather a basic preliminary design incorporating these 
subsystems into a coherent structure.  The subsystems are all contained within the

The subsystems of the testbed have been determined.  Metrics have been established 
for each subsystem so that components with the most desirable parameters have 
been researched. A thorough trade analysis has been done on each component.  The 
Databasing team has been in direct contact with various vendors and manufacturers 
of components to discuss pricing, procurement time, and component specification 
information.  At the current time, it appears as if the majority of our components 
can be bought COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf), with the exception of the casing, 
the airbearings, and the Electro-Magnets.

This table shows the final downselection process. The pros and cons of each system 
are indicated, resulting in a final selection. This selection process was used because 
most candidates were easily ruled out based on infeasibility issues. Note that the 
final selection does require auxiliary hardware.  Although this is the final selection 
currently made, it is not set in stone and is also dependent on the development of 
other sub-systems.

<GG> 

From these criteria we can rule out infrared or laser because they both require  
accurate aiming amongst satellites.  In our final system, it will be difficult to have  
specific points on satellites face each other.  This makes these systems less feasible  
and therefore undesirable. 

We have therefore down-selected the communications architecture to radio- 
frequency. 

<GG> 
Because we are currently unsure of how much data we need to transmit we wish to  
maximize our bandwidth.  
Power consumption must remain low to keep the power supply simple and adequate 
for an extended period of time. 
Mass and volume must be minimized in order to keep the mass and size of the entire  
vehicle small.

Infrared and laser communications require a direct line of sight between the emitter

Umbilical will require physical connection to vehicles which might interfere with 
their free motion.  Umbilical might become entangled for a rotating formation of 
vehicles. 

Ultrasonic are semi-directional.  Signals could easily interfere with signals from

This is how bandwidth is calculated, but because we will most probably need to 
transmit several floating point numbers several times a second we know we will 
want a high bandwidth.  We do not do the calculations of the bandwidth needed 
instead we will look to choose an architecture that maximizes this criterion.

These chips are estimated as within one cubic centimeter and 6 grams of each other,  
we consider these estimates negligible and therefore do not include them in the

The first three are from RF Monolithics  (www.rfm.com) 
The last two are from RF Microdevices  (www.rfmd.com) 

Mass and volume for all chips are very similar, so no valuable comparison could be  
made using those parameters.  
Final conclusion will be tentative pending price information which we have  
requested.  Obviously the RF2969 Chip provides the best bandwidth, however it  
also requires more power.  Our final decision will be tentative on how the final  
design fits together, if it can supply enough power, and how much bandwidth is  
enough. 
We will also need to check for compatibility with the avionics and metrology

Optical devices:  IR ranging devices measure distance by sensing reflection of IR  
waves.  Laser ranging devices measure distance by one of two methods.  The first is  
measuring the time-of-flight of the laser to reach the target and return.  This method 
is used mainly for larger distances (> 1 m).  The second method is the triangulation  
method, which is used for smaller distances (< 1 m).

GPS-like system:  There is no commercially available indoor GPS-like system.  
The system would require transmitters mounted inside the testing facility and a  
receiver on each of the satellites. The technology is still experimental, thus we  
would need to design our own system, which would be both time consuming and  
expensive.  Therefore, this option is not feasible. 
Laser Ranging:  Laser ranging is a technology that provides position measurement  
between a ground station and a body in space.  It is not practical for our purposes  
for two reasons.  First, we are testing in an indoor facility.  A large laser is not  
needed to provide global metrology (position measurement between the system and  
a ground station).  Second, it is very expensive.  Use of laser ranging would exceed  
the scope of the project’s budget. 
<http://almagest.as.utexas.edu/~rlr/mlrs.html> 
Radio Interferometry:  Radio interferometry determines position by a  
triangulation method.  It requires three antennae to determine the position of a body  
with a radio emissor.  It is not feasible for use on this project, because the radio 
interferometry systems are not available on a small scale suited to our test  
environment. 
<http://www.drao.nrc.ca/science/vlbi/principles/principles.shtml> 
Electronic Whiteboard:  Intended for use on board of ~1x2 m.  The system uses a  
combination of IR and Sonic sensors to determine the location of the pen on the  
board.  The system has high accuracy and works in realtime, but it cannot track  
multiple targets.  Several systems cannot be used in overlapping regions.

Range is the maximum distance away from the sensor at which another object can  
be sensed. 
Precision is measured both in distance (linear) and angular position (angular).  
Requirements are those specified in the Requirements Document. 
Precision is specified as the allowed tolerance for each measurement.  Therefore,  
minimizing the ‘Precision’ variable will yield a very precise system. 
Power needed is the power that must be supplied in order for the sensors to  
function.

<LW> 
The current final design choice is the ultrasonic sensing device due to the fact that it 
satisfies all requirements. 

The infrared sensors do not satisfy the maximum required range of 2 m.  However,  
they are much more affordable than either the laser or the ultrasonic devices.  They  
also have a much smaller mass that either of the other range finders.  Additionally,  
they have a very small power draw.  It is possible that a higher quality IR sensor is  
available, and may provide a better metrology solution. 

The laser range finders are the most precise solution.  However, they are not  
feasible due to the fact that they have a large mass and are exceedingly expensive.

Our two options for mechanical attitude control are torque wheels and control 
moment gyros, or CMG’s. 

Upon first investigation, CMG’s appeared a better option because they are small, 
light, accurate and versatile – more so than the traditional torque wheel. 

Further study however, revealed that CMG’s are still an experimental technology. 
They are not commercially available.  In fact, the only real usage to date of a CMG 
system was on NASA’s FUSE sattelite – recently publicized because of the failure 
of its attitude control system. 

Torque wheels will be more readily available and provide more options.

Torque wheels are required for our system to help control the actuation forces 
provided by the electromagnets. 

It is interesting to note that most commercially available torque wheels use 
magnetic bearings.  The far field effects of these magnets is not currently known 
and interference with the B-field of the electromagnetic actuators will be 
investigated.

Shown are ranges of some typical specifications for torque wheels appropriate for a 
30kg unit.  30 kilograms was a very preliminary rough estimate drawn from the

EM Core Material Trade Analysis: 

The core material selection criteria included permeability, Bsaturation, cost, and 
availability.  Permeability is a measure of the material’s magnifying effect on the 
magnetic field.  Bsaturation is extremely important for our application because it is a 
measure of what field strength we can obtain when the core is saturated.  Cost (and 
subsequently, availability) is important because of budgetary constraints to our 
program. 

A wide variety of ferromagnetic materials were considered for the EM core ranging 
from materials commonly used in industrial applications to rare, specialty materials. 
There were two main reasons for materials to not be selected.  First of all, many of 
the materials with very high permeabilities had low values for Bsaturation, well below 
those that would probably be required for our testbed.  Secondly, many of the high-
permeability materials were quite rare.  This made them extremely costly and also 
difficult to machine since there were no vendors with the correct equipment and 
expertise.

EM Core Material Trade Analysis: 

A wide variety of soft ferrous materials were considered for use as the 
electromagnet core.  This table represents some of the more likely candidates based 
on permeability, Bsatuaration, density, and cost. 

Low carbon steel was chosen for its high value for Bsaturation and wide availability. 
After speaking to several of the electromagnet and ferrite material vendors, it was 
clear that low carbon steel (specifically, AISI 1010 or AISI 1020) would be the most 
likely choice.  Although other materials have extremely high permeabilities, their 
values for Bsaturation were too low for our application.  Additionally, these exotic 
materials (such as permalloy and supermalloy) are extremely expensive and not 
widely available.  Low carbon steel is what is commonly used in industrial 
applications and presents less of a machining challenge for manufacturers.

The available options for providing the necessary power to our vehicles include 
Batteries, Solar Cells, or some form of beamed energy. The metrics used to 
downselect these potential options include energy density and feasibility. It is 
important to have a high energy density to help reduce the mass of the overall 
system while still providing the necessary power. It is also important to make sure 
any system we choose is within the scope of this design project. Beamed energy is 
not feasible for this project and therefore has been ruled out as an option.

<SJS> 

Batteries can be procured both COTS (Commercial over the shelf) or custom-made. 
For our purposes, it would save procurement time as well as cut down the cost of 
the power subsystem if the batteries were bought COTS.  COTS batteries are 
usually 1.5 V per battery cell, and cells can be connected in series or parallel to 
achieve the desired voltages and/or currents.  Batteries seem a viable option due to 
their low cost (from single digit to double digits per cell, depending on type of 
battery), their ease of replacement (they can be easily removed when they can no 
longer achieve the desired voltage and be replaced with new batteries), and their 
small mass (each cell is between 0.5 and 2 grams). 

We can either utilize dry cell disposable batteries, or we could choose to utilize 
rechargeable batteries.  A rechargeable battery has a shorter average lifetime and a 
higher cost per individual cell than does a disposable battery.  However, testing can 
be done with fewer rechargeable batteries because each cell can be recharged.  If 
disposable batteries are used, on the other hand, more individual cells must be 
bought to replace cells that have been discharged during testing.

For our power subsystem, we wish to minimize cost and mass, while keeping in 
consideration ease of replacement during testing as well as feasibility. 

Batteries are easily replaceable and the CDIO3 team members are all familiar with 
battery powered systems. 

Solar film is a new topic to the CDIO3 team.  It is more expensive, however the 
film is extremely lightweight and can closely simulates a satellite’s power system 
(easing the transition from testbed to satellite system).  Although manufacturers and 
vendors claim that solar cells can be utilized in indoor facilities, there is some 
uncertainty as to whether the given lighting is sufficient at both the Denver Flat 
Floor facility as well as the MIT glass testing plate. 

Batteries are the better option because we can be certain that they will work. 
Although they are higher mass than the solar film, their mass is still low enough to 
keep our entire vehicle design low-mass.  It is not safe to assume that the solar film 
will properly work at the testing facilities, and buying lighting systems would only 
further increase our project cost.

ElectroMagnetic Formation Flight Of Rotating Clustered Entities 

99 

<SJS> 

Different types of batteries were examined and a trade analysis downselect was done to find the current battery choice as of 
TARR.  The following metrics were chosen: 
Cost: The cost of each battery cell.  A lower cost will receive a higher rating. 
Voltage Profile:  The relationship of its voltage over time of  discharge. A flat voltage profile curve is less desirable than a  
sloped voltage profile; a battery with a flat voltage profile must be replaced as soon as the voltage is no longer steady. 
Safety Factor: Are the chemicals utilized in the battery cells known to be safe?  For instance, there has been concern with Li- 
ion batteries due to the volatile interaction between Lithium and water.  The safer the battery is known to be, the higher the  
rating it will receive. 
Memory Effects: This is only a concern with rechargeable aka secondary batteries.  (All primary batteries, therefore,  
automatically receive a “5” in this category).  Often times when a battery is recharged before it is completely discharged, it will  
lose a portion of its memory.  NiCad batteries suffer considerably from memory loss. 
Lifetime: How long a battery can last while being used.  A longer lifetime is desired. 
Energy Density: How much energy the battery can supply relative to its weight or volume.  This is an extremely important  
factor, therefore it is weighted most heavily in the battery downselect process. 
Mass: The mass per battery cell. We wish to keep the mass at a minimum. 
Self-Discharge Rate: How much charge is lost over time.  While Alkaline batteries only discharge 2% a year, NiMH batteries  
discharge 3% per day.

When choosing the material for the main structure, several things must be taken into  
consideration: 

The material must not be ferrous, since this could potentially disrupt the magnetic  
field of the electromagnet. 
The density and strength of the material will be of crucial importance, and will  
factor into one of the design metrics later. 
To make the transition into 3-D space easier, a material with robust thermal  
properties may want to be chosen. 
The manufacturing method will play a crucial role in the final downselect.  Metal  
materials would require welding and machining and would require a number of  
man-hours from the team.  Plastic would be made with a mold, and may require  
fewer man-hours.  However, this would probably be contracted out to a vendor, in  
which case the cost may be higher than if we use metal and do the work ourselves.

Our structural design criteria are based on the idea of having a cylindrical satellite 
body with multiple layers that stack on top of each other.  For the most part, we 
don’t have to worry about any significant loading on our structure.  The biggest 
loads and deflections will be seen on the lower flat panels of the cylinder, since they 
will be supporting most of the weight of the structure.  Therefore, we use the 
equations for bending of a flat plate in order to come up with design metrics. 

The equations given are usually used for a square plate, whereas ours will most 
likely be round.  However, this will just affect the value for the constant C, which 
depends on geometry and the way the plate is supported.  The mass will still be 
proportional to density/modulus^1/3, so the metric still holds for a circular plate. 
Our main objective will be to minimize this value, since that will produce the 
structure with the least amount of mass.

Shown here is a table of material properties.  The table includes several types of 
metals and plastics.  The parameters of interest here are density, modulus, the 
design metric of density/modulus^1/3, coefficient of thermal expansion, and the 
thermal conductivity.  Note that for plastics, the flexural modulus and not the tensile 
modulus is used. 

Using only the design metric, Aluminum and magnesium alloys as well as several 
types of plastics are the ideal choices.  Parameters not taken into consideration here 
are cost and ease of manufacture.  Further downselect of materials requires further 
investigation.

Some sort of system is required to reproduce microgravity in 2 dimensions. 
Supporting the system with a cushion of high-pressure CO2 will allow the system to 
translate with low friction. A simulated profile of the pressurized cushion can be 
seen in the upper right corner.  The air bearings can provide the required support, 
using onboard CO2 canisters to provide pressurized gas.

Air bearings operate by creating a cushion of air for frictionless translation and 
rotation. These systems will be self-contained with replenishable CO2 canisters.
This eliminates the need for an umbilical cord which may cause unwanted forces 
acting on the system. The diagram shows how the air pressure drops of at the edges 
of the bearing but is mostly constant across the surface of the bearing.

Three air bearings are required to ensure stability. Thus, each bearing must support 
1/3 of the total weight of the system. To calculate the required area of each bearing, 
the above equation is used with a .3 efficiency factor to account for pressure loss at 
the fringes of the bearing. The required supply pressure is then a function of bearing 
area only.

Abstract:  Parts will need to be either purchased or fabricated for the project’s final product.  To ensure a 
successful final product it is imperative that a process be in place to validate the quality of the purchased or 
fabricated part prior to investment of project resources in this part. 

1.

Validation for Fabricated Parts. 

1.1. Definition.  Fabricated parts are parts that will be constructed or implemented by members of the project 
at a variety of production facilities.  These facilities include but are not limited to laboratories, workshops, 
machine shops, and computer labs. 

1.2. Validation Process.  Fabricated parts will be checked against the specifications and tolerances given to 
the fabricator prior to fabrication.  Only if the fabricated part meets all specification and tolerances will the part 
be validated. 

1.3. Documentation.  Prior to inclusion in a subsystem, every fabricated part must be verified and documented 
as verified on CDIO Form 23-212. 

2.

Validation for Purchased Parts 

2.1. Definition.  Purchased parts are parts that are purchased by members in the group from a variety of 
sources.  These sources include but are not limited to companies, manufacturers, and stores. 

2.2. Validation Procedure.  Purchased parts will be checked against the specifications and tolerances given 
by the entity from which they come.  Only if the purchased part meets all specifications and tolerances will the 
part be validated. 

2.3. Documentation.  Prior to inclusion in a subsystem, every purchased part must be verified and 
documented as verified on CDIO Form 23-211. 

2.4. Non-Compliance.  Purchased parts that do not meet the specification of the entity from which they are 
purchased will be returned to the entity from which they are purchased for a full refund.  Non-compliance will 
be documented on CDIO Form 23-291.

Abstract: Once systems and subsystems are created it becomes necessary to ensure that the system meets requirement and 
interface specifications.  To this end, a procedure by which systems and subsystems are tested against the requirements 
becomes necessary. 

1.
Definition.  The process of verification includes ensuring that the system or subsystem meets requirements and also 
providing a means by which to verify that the requirements are being met. 

2.

Verification Process.  The verification process occurs in three phases. 

2.1. Phase One:  Determining Requirements Flowdown.  Before a system or subsystem is created that team must obtain 
the applicable system or subsystem requirements and the interface specifications required by other teams or groups.  The 
system designers must also obtain a resource budget.  This budget will include such things as:  mass, power, cost, time, error, 
flops, etc.  This group’s design for the system or subsystem must meet all the requirements within the allotted resources. 

2.2. Phase Two:  Test Design.  As part of designing a particular system or subsystem, the team is required to design a 
testing procedure for their subsystem.  This testing procedure must establish that the system meets all applicable requirements 
and that all interfaces are within specification.  The team itself will decide upon this testing procedure.  Any resources used by 
the team in the designed test will be taken out of that team’s resource budget, and must be accounted for in the subsystem 
design.

2.3. Phase Three:  Verification of Results.  Once the test designed per subparagraph 2.2 has been performed the team will 
evaluate the data brought forth by the test and check that data against the requirements and constraints.  Only if all 
requirements and resource constraints are met may the team verify the system or subsystem. 

3.

Verification Documentation. 

3.1. Test Plan Document CDIO Form 23-111.  As part of the test design the subsystem design team will submit a test plan 
document which outlines the functional requirements of the subsystem and the tests that will be performed to the subsystem to 
verify that these requirements have been met. 

3.2. Verification Review Document CDIO Form 23-121.  The subsystem design team is required to document all 
applicable test data.

placed in the hands of the System’s Team. The system’s team will assign budgets to 
each sub-team as they see fit. Sub-teams will be responsible for managing their own

Using an Excel Spreadsheet the System’s team will be able to quickly enter in each 
Sub-team’s current budget data and get instant feedback on budget status for all 
parameters. This includes a week by week plot of all tracked items to allow 
observance of spending trends. All reallocations of budget numbers must be decided 
by the Systems Team. Plot shows a sample plot of the project cost versus time. This 
plot has the actual value used, the amount that has been allocated and the total 
budget. A similar plot is generated for every parameter (mass, power, labor and 
volume).

INCLUSION OF INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS IN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN 

1. The most important aspect of systems integration during the latter stages of the 
systems design project will be the interfaces between the various subsystems. 
Therefore, it is critical that all inputs to and outputs from each subsystem are well 
documented. 

2. When designing an abstract for a subsystem, the interfaces must be summarized 
in an interface specification document (CDIO Form 22-112).  Types of interfaces 
may include but are not limited to: 

a. Physical design and specification of power connections 

b. Electronic Communications between various subsystems 

c. Structural connections and attachments from the subsytems to the main structure 

3. This interface documentation should be included in the design of the final 
architecture, which will be included in all formal reviews.

For any plan, it’s important to consider problems encountered before and to take 
steps to prevent them from occurring again. There were many problems with 
Timelining the project encountered during the first six weeks. 

In this capacity, the Processes Group proposes the following four Team Goals. 

1. Assurance of Task Completion 

The briefing gives an opportunity for the whole Team to get on the 
same page, so to speak. 

2. Provide Warning of Potential Problems Ahead 

Consistent updates to the TimeLiner allow for consistent  checks on 
progress, and thus allows the Team to be informed of potential future problems 
with task completion and ensures the issue is addressed immediately. 

3. Maintain Strong Communication Lines 

Provides open forum for group interaction to avoid problems with 
task dependencies. 

4. Sustained Time Commitment 

Each team member should plan on placing a sustained emphasis 
(time and effort) on their portion of the project to accomplish all tasks on schedule.

In the next week, the project will move into the Preliminary Design Phase (PDP). In 
order to ensure the progress of the project through the PDP the Processes team 
recommends that the class be divided into the following groups and teams. There 
will be four groups each of which will have on representative on the System’s 
Group. These Groups are: EM Hardware, Attitude Control Group, Formation Flight 
Group, and the Structures Group. These groups will then be furthered divided teams 
whose specific responsibilities are all detailed above

<JEU> 
The main focus of the Plan to Execute the Preliminary Design Phase (PDP) is a  
projected timeline to the PDR on 7 May. 

This timeline lists major tasks to be accomplished by each Sub-System Team (or  
Group).  The tasks differ in Developing their Sub-System Designs.  These diverging  
tasks are included on a separate page (and backup slide). 

The Gantt Chart beside the Major Task List shows the proposed time allocation for  
each task for each group.  Many things must be run in parallel within each group for  
the tasks to be accomplished on time.  There is some flexibility within groups to  
assign more detailed timelines and tasks to individual members, but it is absolutely  
critical that each individual and group stay aware of the overall timeline.  This is to  
be directed and verified by the Systems Group.

Finally, it’s important to look ahead to the other major milestones, such as CDR and 
AR.  This is a timeline from the completion of the Preliminary Design Review to 
the wrap-up of the Critical Design Review in November 2002.  There is not much 
detail because much has yet to become apparent. However, there are some things 
that can be considered now as major sections of the project.  These are shown above 
in the task list and Gantt chart.  The Gantt chart describes the proposed timeline of 
events as seen currently. 

The Long-Term Procurement phase of the project occurs over Summer break 2002 
(May 2002 – August 2002). 

Note: Past the PDR, all of the dates are rough estimates.

We began with an explanation of the details and motivation behind our project. We 
then detailed the requirements and constraints that our design will be verified 
against. An overall System’s Trade Analysis was presented which detailed many of 
the key trades for this design. We then listed our metrics and recommended 
components for each of the various subsystems. Finally we detailed the processes 
and procedures that will be used to carry through project forward towards 
completion.

Acceleration information will help to make the system controllable.  This is  
desirable since the system will be inherently unstable. 

Accelerometers are highly accurate scientific measurement devices.  
The gyro shown is an off-the-shelf, low accuracy, angular acceleration measurement  
device.

Cost: A lower cost will receive a higher rating. 

Voltage Profile:  Flatter voltage curves will receive a lower score and higher scores 
will be given to those with the  more constant sloped curve profiles. 
Safety Factor: Those batteries with known safety concerns will receive lower  
ratings. 
Memory Effects:  The greater the memory loss, the lower the score. 
Lifetime: A longer lifetime is desired. 
Energy Density:  A high energy density is the primary concern in selecting battery  
type. 
Mass:  We wish to keep the mass at a minimum. 
Self-Discharge Rate: The lower the discharge rates, the higher the batteries will  
score.
