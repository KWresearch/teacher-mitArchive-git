Formation Design 
 
 
This progress report will focus on  the work done on  the satellite formation design 
and  trajectory  control.    This  includes  the  spin-up  of  satellite  formations,  angular 
momentum management, and disturbance rejection. 
 
Satellite Formation Spin-Up 
 

In  order  to  simplify  the  problem,  the  MIT  SSL  initially  looked  at  interferometer 
formation  flight  missions  outside  the  Earth’s  gravity  well.    Space-based  interferometry 
missions  must  have  a  spinning  formation  in-order  to  fill  the  uv-plane.  The  specific 
problem  that was  addressed  first was how  to  spin-up  and de-spin  the  satellite  formations 
using only electromagnets. 
If  the  electromagnetic  dipoles  are  oriented  perpendicular  to  one  another,  shear 
forces  result.      This  force  allows  the magnets  to move  perpendicular  to  the  line  between 
the  two magnets.   As  the  two satellites begin  to rotate around each other,  the magnets are 
rotated  so  that  their  dipoles  align,  and  the  formation  is  held  together.  The  left  side  of 
Figure  1  shows  two  magnetic  dipoles  initially  at  rest  along  the  x-axis.    The  dipoles, 
represented  by  arrows,  are  initially  perpendicular  to  each  other. As  the  formation  begins 
to  rotate,  the dipoles  are  rotated  so  that  they provide  an  attractive  force  to  counteract  the 
increasing centrifugal acceleration action on the spacecraft.

Figure 1: Satellite Formation Spin-Up 

Having  shown  the  ability  to  spin-up  two  satellite  formations,  the  technique  was 
applied  to  satellite  formations  of  three  and  five  satellites.  The  satellites  are  initially  at 
rest, and are spun-up to a steady state rotation rate.  
 
 

Angular Momentum Management 
 
 
The MIT  SSL  is  also  looking  at  the  problem  of  angular momentum management 
for  these  multiple  satellite  formations.  When  these  shear  forces  are  used  to  spin-up  a 
satellite formation, torques are also placed on the individual satellites due to conservation 
of angular momentum.  These torques are not the same for both spacecraft.  While adding 
complexity  to  the problem,  it also allows  for  the ability  to actively  select which  satellites 
receive more or less angular momentum on them. 
 
An example is easily shown in the three satellite case.  The right formation has an 
even distribution of torque between the three satellites. This type of formation would lend 
itself  to  formations  with  identical  satellites.      In  the  left  simulation,  the  outer  satellites 
receive  ¼  the  torque  as  the  center  satellite.      This  type  of  formation  would  benefit 
formations with a large combiner satellite, and light collector satellites.

Formations in the Earth’s Gravity  
 
 
Most,  if  not  all,  of  the  NROs  missions  will  lie  within  the  Earth’s  gravity  well.  
The  MIT  SSL  is  continuing  to  look  at  formation  control  and  management  within  the 
Earth’s  gravity  well.    Instead  of  having  to  spin-up  formations,  the  orbital  mechanics  of 
the  formation  causes  the  cluster  to  spin  at  a  specific  rate  without  effort  from  the 
formation.    The  difficulty  lies  not  in  spinning  up  the  formation,  but  in  holding  the 
formation  together  (disturbance  rejection),  and  initializing  and  changing  the  shape of  the 
formation. 
 

Disturbance Rejection. 
 
 
Satellite  formations  will  always  be  subject  to  some  type  of  external  disturbance 
force.  EMFF must be capable of rejecting these formations if it is to be a useful means of 
formation control.   When  these  formations are placed  into Earth orbit,  they  are under  the 
influence  of  many  different  disturbance  forces.  One  obvious  disturbance  force  is  the 
Earth’s  own  magnetic  field.    Because  EMFF  uses  electromagnetics,  any  type  of 
electromagnetic  field  created  will  interact  with  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  and  cause  a 
disturbance  force on  the  satellite. The MIT SSL  is currently evaluating  the degree of  this 
disturbance  force  and  determining  if  it  is  a  significant  disturbance,  or  if  it  could  be 
exploited  and  used  to  our  benefit.  For  example,  if  the  earth  can  be  thought  of  as  another 
spacecraft,  could  the  angular  momentum  management  techniques  discussed  earlier  be 
used  to  move  the  angular  momentum  storage  from  the  satellites  to  the  Earth?    This  is 
already done with single satellites using magnetic torque rods, but the ability to do it with 
satellite formations is being actively researched. 
 
Another  disturbance  force  is  the  J2  geopotential  force.  The  MIT  Space  Systems 
Lab  has much  experience with  satellite  formations  and  the  disturbances  caused  by  the  J2 
geopotential.   This experience  is being applied  to  the EMFF problem. The EMFF  system 
must  have  enough  control  authority  to  reject  the  disturbances  caused  by  the  J2 
geopotential. EMFF systems are now being sized  to counteract  this disturbance force and 
still provide enough control authority for maneuvers. 
 
 
Angular Momentum Management 
 

While  having  enough  control  authority  to  reject  these  disturbances  is  important, 
another  limiting  factor  is  the  reaction  wheels  of  the  system.    The  forces  needed  to 
counteract  the  J2  forces  include  shear  forces.    As  stated  earlier,  these  shear  forces  cause 
torques on  the  satellites  that must be absorbed  in  the  reaction wheels.   The MIT SSL has 
shown  that many  satellite  formations produce a net gain  in  the angular momentum of  the 
satellite as it rejects the J2 disturbance forces. This will cause the reaction wheels to spin-
up  and over  time  cause  them  to  saturate unless  they  can be desaturated using propellants 
or by exploiting the Earth’s magnetic field. 
However,  the MIT  SSL  has  found  some  satellite  formations  of  two  satellites  that 
do  not  produce  a  net  gain  in  the  individual  angular momentum  of  the  satellite.    Figure  3 
shows  10  different  two  satellite  formations  that  have  zero  angular  momentum  gain  over 
the  course  of  an  orbit.  The  black  dot’s  represent  the  position  of  the  satellite’s  as  they 
cross the equator.

Figure 3: Satellite Formations that Have Zero Angular Momentum Gain 

 
 
The  lab  is  now  looking  at  more  complex  formations  of  many  satellites.  These 
formations, while more  complex, may have more  control  authority  and  a better  ability  to 
manage  torque.    It  is  the  hope  by  adding  more  satellites  and  having  better  torque 
management,  there  will  be  a  larger  set  of  formations  that  produce  zero  net  gain  in  the 
angular momentum. 
 
Conclusion and Other Work 
 

The  MIT  Space  Systems  Lab  is  continuing  its  research  in  the  area  of  satellite 
formation  design  and  control.      Discussed  above  is  the  ongoing  research  on  satellite 
formation  spin-up,  angular  momentum  management,  and  disturbance  rejection.    The  lab 
is  also  currently  working  on  control  algorithms  to  produce  these  trajectories  and  reject 
disturbances,  and  to  change  the  shape  of  the  class.  The  undergraduate  class  (CDIO)  is 
continuing  to  build  an  EMFF  testbed  where  the  control  algorithms  can  be  further 
developed and tested.
