• 

High Risk: Structure 
Air Bearing: 
• 
Vehicles must obey Flat-Floor rules of contact 
• 
Development and procurement time 
•  Magnetic Shielding: 
• 
Shield crucial electronic subsystems from electro(cid:173)
magnetic field 
•  Must not interfere with controlling forces 
Vehicle Casing: 
•  Strength in case of collision 
•  Thermal considerations due to magnet heating 
•  Total mass consideration 

•

Action Items: Air Bearing 

•  Research 
•  Flat Floor Facility contact rules 
•  Tolerance on air cushion thickness 
• 
Profile of air cushion thickness with changing mass 
•  Air bearing procurement time 
•  Cost of bearing set-ups: manufactured and 
purchased 

If we decide to fabricate these ourselves we will also have to have made cad 
drawings of our air bearings.

Action Items: Shielding/Casing 

•  Obtain information and/or sample materials 
from shielding vendors and conduct tests. 
•  Decide upon shielding material and vendor. 

•  Brainstorm subsystem interfacing 
configurations. 
•  Decide on material(s) for casing. 

Magnetic shielding tests will be conducted by placing electronics next to electric 
fields and observing behavior when shielded and unshielded. 

Configurations should include access panels. 

6 

High Risk: Power 

• 

Finding batteries that will provide the 
necessary power. 
•  Providing between individual subsystem 
components (via voltage regulators). 

Power for this system will be much more challenging than was for the previous 
project, SPHERES, because of the high power draw from the electro-magnets. 

7 

Action Items: Power 

•  Obtain power requirements and/or 
dependable estimates from each individual 
subsystems. 
•  Investigate battery types. 
•  Investigate interfacing methods.

Group Milestones 

To date: 
•  Met with Paul Bauer  re: 
air bearing set-up and 
tests. 
•  Contacted shielding and 
air bearing vendors. 
•  Contacted requirements 
team re: flat floor rules. 
•  Ruled out solar power as a 
possibility. 

PDR: 
• 
Baseline high level 
vehicle casing design 
(CAD drawings). 
•  Finalize vehicle mass. 
•  Place orders for 
experimental 
materials/components. 
Construct power model.
