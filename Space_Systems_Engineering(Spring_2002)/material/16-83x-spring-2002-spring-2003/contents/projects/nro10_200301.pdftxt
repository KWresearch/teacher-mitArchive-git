OVERVIEW 

Description of the Effort 

The  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  Space  Systems  Lab  (MIT  SSL)  and  the 
Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center  (ATC) are  collaborating  to explore  the potential 
for  an  Electro-Magnetic  Formation  Flight  (EMFF)  system  applicable  to  Earth-orbiting  satellites 
flying in close formation. 

Progress Overview 

At  MIT,  work  on  EMFF  has  been  pursued  on  two  fronts:  the  MIT  conceive,  design, 
implement and operate (CDIO) class, and the MIT SSL research group. 

While all of the progress reports to date have focused on the work completed at MIT, this 
report summarizes recent progress made at the Lockheed Martin ATC. 

INTRODUCTION 

The  possibility  of  controlling  the  relative  positions  and  orientations  of  a  number  of 
satellites  flying  in  close  formation  by  means  of  applied  magnetic  fields  has  been 
addressed by  the Space Systems Product Development Class, Department of Aeronautics 
and  Astronautics,  MIT,  under  the  direction  of  Professor  David  Miller.    We  at  the 
Lockheed  Martin  Advanced  Technology  center  have  been  working  with  the  MIT  group 
under  contract  (ATC  Project  KQ8)  to  support  this  effort.    In  particular,  we  were  tasked 
with  examining  control  options  for  satellite  formations,  studying  the  feasibility  of 
magnetic  control  in  general,  and  producing  simulations  of  particular  magnetic  control 
scenarios.  This report details our efforts in these areas. 

The  reasons  for  looking  at  this  type  of  technology,  its  possible  applications,  its 
advantages and drawbacks, are presented in MIT ’s Preliminary Design Review of May 7, 
2002,  entitled  Electro  Magnetic  Formation  Flight  of  Rotating  Clustered  Entities.    This 
document also discusses generic requirements for a possible Electro Magnetic Formation 
Flight (EMFF) implementation and presents a plan for further study.  Of more immediate 
interest  to  us,  for  the  purposes  of  this  report,  are  the  technical  results  that  are  presented. 
These  include  trade  studies  between  different  dipole  configurations,  the  design  of  a 
magnetic  control  system,  analytical  results  obtained  on  sample  two-  and  three-satellite 
constellations,  and  a  simple  hardware  validation  demonstration.    All  this  provided  an 
excellent starting point for our own investigations into the subjects. 

APPROACH 

We  decided  to  use  our  own  tools  (AUTOLEV  and  ANIMAKE)  to  reproduce  MIT ’s 
results  to  date  on  formation  dynamics  and  then  to  continue  from  there.  There  were  two 
reasons  for  choosing  this  approach:  the  first  was  frankly  didactic;  we  felt  it  was  the 
quickest way  for  us  to  catch  up  to MIT ’s  level  of  expertise  in  the  field  and  start making 
our  own  contributions.    The  second  was  a  desire,  shared  by  MIT,  to  independently 
validate  their  results  to  date  and  to  incorporate  them  in  a  dynamic  simulation  that would 
visually  and  compellingly  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  the  technology.  From  the 
beginning we  also  considered ways  to  expand  on MIT’s work;  therefore,  in  consultation 
with  them, we defined  new  simulation  scenarios  and  considered ways  to  generalize  their 
results.  These are presented below. 

Our  principal  analysis  tool  is  a  symbolic  dynamics  program  distributed  by  OnLine 
Dynamics,  Inc.,  and  developed  jointly  by  David  Schaechter  and  David  Levinson  of 
Lockheed Martin,  Professor  Emeritus  Thomas  R. Kane  of  Stanford University,  and  Paul 
Mitiguy,  currently of MSC.Software,  Inc.  AUTOLEV permits a user  to  formulate exact, 
literal  equations  of  motion  for  any  system  of  interconnected  rigid  bodies  and  particles, 
and  creates 
ready-to-compile-link-and-run  Fortran  or  C  simulation  programs 
incorporating  the  equations.    In  the  words  of  Professor  Kane,  “AUTOLEV  makes  it 
possible  to  teach,  learn,  and  practice  mechanics  in  an  exceptionally  effective  way 
because,  in  addition  to  saving  the  user  a  great  deal  of  time  and  effort,  it  furnishes 
excellent means for communicating mechanics ideas with clarity and precision.”

ANIMAKE,  a  companion  program  to AUTOLEV, was  developed  by  Ting Hong  Chung 
and  Thomas  R.  Kane  of  Kane  Dynamics,  Inc.  It  permits  one  to  employ  directly  the 
numerical  output  produced  by  AUTOLEV-generated  Fortran  and  C  motion  simulation 
programs to create animations of the motions under consideration. 

The problems we studied are as follows: 

1. 	 Steady Planar Rotation of Two Solenoids 
2. 	 Steady Planar Rotation of Three Solenoids 
3. 	 Three-Dimensional Motions of Two Solenoids 
4. 	 Spinup of Two Solenoids from Rest 
5. 	 Expansion and Contraction of Formations 

A  magnetically-controlled  satellite  is  represented  herein  by  a  solenoid  of  given  size  and 
number  of  turns  of  wire,  through  which  a  variable  electric  current  can  be  impressed. 
Control  is  effected  by  varying  the  current  through  the  solenoid  wire.    In  some  cases, 
reaction  wheels  are  mounted  on  the  pitch  and  yaw  axes  for  attitude  control.    The 
quantities  in  which  we  are  interested,  as  functions  of  the  currents,  mass  properties, 
magnet  parameters,  and  initial  conditions,  are  the  intersatellite  distances  and  the  attitude 
of the formation as a whole as well as that of the individual satellites.  For two satellites it 
is sufficient  to control  the current  in only one of  them  to achieve  the desired behavior (as 
can  be  inferred  from  symmetry  considerations);  for  three  satellites  this  cannot  always  be 
done, as we will show below. 

We make the following assumptions in calculating the satellite motions: 

1. 	 the satellites are far away from any disturbing body (no gravity, no atmosphere, 
etc.) 
2. 	 all systems are assumed to be “ideal ” (ideal current sources, for instance.) 
3. 	 system aspects which have no bearing on our analyses are neglected (ohmic 
heating, if any; solar panel effects, etc.) 
4. 	 each satellite is in the far magnetic field of the others, so that a far-field 

mathematical approximation can be used 

5. 	 the satellites are identical as to size and mass properties 
6. 	 roundoff error in the simulation algorithm can be used as a surrogate for random 
system noise. 

The expression  for  the  far electromagnetic  field B of a  solenoid  at a point P  in  space can 
be written 
)] (− m / p  +  3m ⋅ pp / p 5 )
(

where p  is  the position vector  from P  to  the  center of  the  solenoid, p  is  the magnitude of 
p,  µ 0   is  the  permeability  of  free  space,  and  m  is  the  magnetic  moment  of  the  solenoid, 
given by 

B	 =  [µ 
0

m  =  NIAu 

with N denoting the number of turns in the solenoid, I the current carried by the solenoid, 
A  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  solenoid,  and  u  a  unit  vector  parallel  to  the  axis  of  the 
solenoid and pointing from the solenoid’s south pole to its north pole. 

When a second solenoid, of magnetic moment  m is brought into the magnetic field of the 
first,  the  system  of  magnetic  forces  exerted  by  the  first  solenoid  on  the  second  is 
equivalent to a single force F passing through the center of the second solenoid, given by 
F  =  m  ⋅ ∇∇∇∇Β 

together with a couple of torque T, given by 

T  =  m  ×  Β 

RESULTS 

We  present  results  below  for  five  different  scenarios.  Because  it  has  a  more  immediate 
physical meaning  for  us,  the  term  “solenoid ”  is  used  to  signify  the  simplified  spacecraft 
model.  A  proper  way  to  think  of  this  is  to  visualize  a  satellite  within  which  a  solenoid 
had been rigidly embedded. 

1 - Steady Planar Rotation of Two Solenoids 

Perhaps  the  simplest  maneuver  that  can  be  performed  with  magnetically  controlled 
bodies  is  the  steady  planar  rotation  of  two  solenoids  acting  solely  under  the  influence  of 
their  mutual  electromagnetic  fields.  Figure  1  shows  two  such  solenoids.  Here,  red 
denotes  the  north  poles  of  the magnets  and  blue  the  south  poles.  This  configuration was 
already studied by MIT and here we endeavored to reproduce and validate their results. 

With  the aid of AUTOLEV, we formed exact, explicit, nonlinear equations of motion for 
this  system.  By  specifying  the  steady  motion  of  interest,  we  then  used  AUTOLEV  to 
solve  these  equations  for  the  explicit  formula  relating  the  electric  current,  the  distance 
between  the  two mass  centers,  the  angular  speed  of  the  bodies,  and  the  speed  of  the  two 
mass  centers.  Our  analytic  results  confirmed  the  results  obtained  by  MIT,  and,  on  this 
basis, we proceeded to the production of a simulation of the motion of this system. 

With the aforementioned formula in hand, we computed the initial conditions required for 
bringing about  the desired steady motion.  By employing  these values  in connection with 
the full nonlinear equations of motion, we could,  in principle, simulate  the  steady motion 
of  interest.  However,  without  feedback  control,  numerical  roundoff  errors  eventually 
cause  the  simulated  motion  to  become  unstable,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  This  state  of 
affairs  is  easily  remedied,  however,  by  means  of  a  simple  feedback  control  scheme  in 

3


which  the  electric  current  of  either  solenoid  is  made  to  depend  on  the  distance  between 
the  two  mass  centers  as  well  as  the  time  rate  of  change  of  this  distance.    Once  such  a 
control  system  is  in  place,  the  simulation  of  the  steady  motion  can  proceed  without 
interference  from  cumulative  roundoff  errors.   Figure 3  shows  a  snapshot of  a  controlled 
motion  that  takes  place  at  an  instant  subsequent  to  the  time  associated  with  Figure  2. 
Both  the  uncontrolled  and  controlled  motions  have  been  simulated  by  means  of 
AUTOLEV-generated Fortran programs, and then  “movies” of the two motions, based on 
the Fortran program outputs, have been animated with the aid of ANIMAKE.  Figures 1 - 
3 are “stills ” from these movies.

2 - Steady Planar Rotation of Three Solenoids 

Another  scenario  already  analyzed  by  MIT  is  the  steady  planar  rotation  of  three 
solenoids.  The techniques used to analyze the steady planar rotation of two solenoids can 
be  extended  directly  to  larger  numbers  of  solenoids.    Three  solenoids  in  steady  rotation 
(see  Figure  4)  have  been  analyzed  with  AUTOLEV  and  animated  with  ANIMAKE  just 
as  in  the  case  of  two  solenoids.    Here  again,  there  is  spurious  unstable  motion  due  to 
roundoff errors when  feedback control of  electric  current  is not employed  (see Figure 5). 
By making  the  electric  current  in  the  central  solenoid  a  function  of  the  distance  between 
the  mass  center  of  the  central  solenoid  and  either  peripheral  solenoid,  together  with  the 
time-derivative of  this distance, one  can  stabilize  the motion.   Figure 6  shows a  snapshot 
of  a  controlled  motion  that  takes  place  at  an  instant  subsequent  to  the  time  associated 
with  Figure  5.    Here,  because  of  symmetry,  stability  of  the  system  can  be  enforced 
entirely from the central solenoid.

3 - Three-Dimensional Motions of Two Solenoids 

In  preparation  for  studies  of  three-dimensional  motions  of  two-  and  three-solenoid 
systems,  AUTOLEV  and  ANIMAKE  were  employed  to  generate  equations  of  motion, 
Fortran  simulation  programs,  and  animations  of  both  systems.    These  are  shown  in 
Figures 7 and 8.    In both cases, each solenoid contains pitch and yaw reaction wheels for 
attitude  control.    A  close-up  view  of  a  solenoid  equipped  in  this  manner  is  shown  in 
Figure 9.

4 - Spinup of Two Solenoids from Rest 

An  interesting  and  potentially  very  useful  result  obtained  by  MIT  was  that  two  EMFF-
controlled  satellites  at  rest  in  space  could  be  set  in  motion  about  their  common  mass 
center by employing magnets and  reaction wheels alone.   We wanted  to verify  this result 
and  to  supplement  the  analysis  with  an  animation  that  would  show  the  technique 
convincingly.  Figure 10 shows such a system in its rest state. 

Figure 10.  Two Solenoids, Equipped with Reaction Wheels, Initially at Rest 

Here, AUTOLEV was  employed  to determine  the  explicit  equations  for  the  two  reaction 
wheel motor  torques and  the electric current  in one of  the solenoids  that bring  the system 
from  rest  into  an  uncontrolled  steady motion  similar  to  the one  associated with Figure  1. 
The  full  nonlinear  equations,  also  formulated  with  AUTOLEV,  then  were  solved  in 
conjunction  with  these  input  functions,  and  it  was  found  that  the  system  did,  indeed, 
perform as intended.  Figures 11-13 show several stills from the ANIMAKE animation of 
the spinup simulation.

In  undertaking  a  spinup  from  rest,  it  matters  significantly  how  it  is  accomplished  as  to 
whether  or  not  the  target  steady  motion  can  be  achieved  without  feedback  control  to 
correct  overshoot.    For  example,  if  the  desired  time-history  of  the  angular  speed  of  the 
line  connecting  the  mass  centers  of  the  two  solenoids  is  chosen  to  be  a  second-degree 
polynomial  function  of  time,  such  as  the  green  curve  in  Figure  14,  it  leads  to  an 
orientation  angle  time-history  for  the  left  solenoid  in Figure 10  given by  the  green  curve 
in  Figure  15.    This  is  a  time-plot  of  the  angle  between  the  long  axis  of  the  left  solenoid 
and  the  line  connecting  the  mass  centers  of  the  two  solenoids.    It  can  be  seen  that  the 
slope  of  this  curve  is  not  zero  at  t  =  30  s,  the  instant  of  completion  of  the  spinup 
maneuver.  This  means  that  the  left  solenoid,  upon  reaching  alignment  with  the  right 
solenoid, has  “surplus”  angular  speed  and,  thus, overshoots  the mark.   An  animation  still 
of such an overshoot is shown in Figure 16. 

Figure 14.  	Angular Speed Time-Histories of the Line Connecting the Two Solenoid 
Mass Centers 

In  contrast,  if  one  chooses  a  more  suitable  function,  represented  by  the  purple  curve  in 
Figure 14, for the angular speed time-history of the line connecting the two solenoid mass 
centers, one obtains, correspondingly,  the purple curve  in Figure 15 for  the attitude  time-
history  of  the  left  solenoid.    This  curve  has  zero  slope  at  t  =  30  s,  the  time  at which  the 
spinup  maneuver  is  complete.    Thus,  there  is  no  surplus  angular  speed  when  alignment 
with  the  right  solenoid  is  achieved  and,  therefore,  no  overshoot.    The  smooth  transition

from  rest  to  steady  rotation  shown  in  Figures  11-13  was,  in  fact,  produced  with  this 
spinup strategy.

5 - Expansion and Contraction of Formations 

Having  developed  our  tools  and  having  verified  the MIT  results  (and  thus  the  soundness 
of  the EMFF approach), we  looked  for a different scenario  to analyze and  simulate.   One 
of the tasks that a realistic EMFF control system in orbit might be called upon to perform 
is  that  of  controlling  the  spacing  and  orientations  of  the  satellites,  either  to  compensate 
for perturbations  that, over  time, would destroy  the formation’s geometrical pattern, or  to 
redefine  the  spatial pattern  in  response  to evolving mission  requirements.   We  found  that 
it  is  possible  to  expand  and  contract  a particular  formation of  solenoids by decreasing or 
increasing  the  current  in  one or more  solenoids while employing  reaction wheels  to keep 
the  solenoids  aligned  with  each  other.    Figures  17-21  display  the  results  of  an 
AUTOLEV-generated  simulation  intended  to  demonstrate  this. 
In  Figure  17,  two 
solenoids are engaged  in steady rotation of  the kind shown previously  in connection with 
the  system of Figure 1.   The  inner  green  circle  is  the path  traced out by  the mass  centers 
of  the  two  solenoids.  Next,  by  means  of  formulas  obtained  from  the  exact  equations  of 
motion  generated  by  AUTOLEV,  the  current  in  one  solenoid  is  decreased  to  cause  the 
mass  centers  of  the  two  solenoids  to  separate  further,  while  the  reaction  wheels  on  both 
solenoids  are  engaged  to  keep  the  two  solenoids  aligned  with  each  other,  as  shown  in 
Figure  18.   When  the  mass  centers  of  the  two  solenoids  arrive  at  the  outer  green  circle, 
control  ceases  and  steady  rotation  is  once  again  achieved,  as  shown  in  Figure  19.    To 
bring the solenoids back to the inner circle, the control system is once again employed, as 
shown  in Figure 20, and, finally,  the solenoids arrive back on  the  inner circle and resume 
uncontrolled steady motion there, as shown in Figure 21.  The time-history of the variable 

11


electric current  is plotted  in Figure 22.   Note  the  two spikes associated with  the arrival of 
the solenoids at the larger and smaller circles.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, we have verified results already obtained by MIT, but we have extended 
them in significant ways.  First, we have incorporated the motion algorithms in a 
simulation that allows quick and easy visualization of a particular solution.  Analytically, 
we have suggested a smoother angular time history of the spinning solenoids, reducing 
the overshoot that was observed with the original MIT-supplied function.  We have 
moved beyond the basic magnetic force problem by incorporating the effects of reaction 
wheels along all three axes, and have been able to simulate a formation reconfiguration.  
Most important, we have validated the use of AUTOLEV for magnetic force problem, 
which will allow us to generalize our simulations in a straightforward way to address 
more complicated and physically realistic problems. 

Future work can move along several directions: more solutions can be sought with the 
formalism we have developed, giving us insight into the types of formations and missions 
that can profitably use EMFF technology.  More realism needs to be introduced in several 
important ways.  First, the mass properties of candidate satellites need to be modeled 
more faithfully, ditto for the performance of real coils and control systems.  Finally, the 
effects of the environment must be factored in, particularly the Earth ’s ambient field, 
which could be used as a sink for excess reaction wheel angular momentum.
