Mission Objective
Mission Objective

z  Demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic 
control for formation-flying satellites. 
z  2-D Flat floor test bed 

Æ Simplifies problem 
while achieving 
objective 
Æ Proves feasibility of 
planar control 
Æ Simplifies dynamics 

z  3 independent devices 

z  3 DOF per device 

Planar control vs. linear control… it takes 3 points to make a plane.  Plus, if we can 
prove controllability for 3 devices, adding more should be… trivial…
