The calendar below includes the lecture (LE) and lab (LA) sessions for the
first semester (16.83). The lectures provide background on the project, its
technical knowledge requirements, andÂ introduces studentsÂ to aspects of
system design which may be unfamiliar. Major presentations are identified in
theÂ Key Dates column, and sometimes include external audience members.
Subsequent semesters (16.831, 16.832)Â favor lab activities heavily.Â 
LecturesÂ are given on demand,Â when a knowledge gap is identified.Â 
Milestones for each semester include major presentations and important report
documents.Â
