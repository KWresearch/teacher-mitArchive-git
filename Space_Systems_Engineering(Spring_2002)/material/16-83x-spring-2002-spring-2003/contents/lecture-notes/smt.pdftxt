Uniqueness of Satellite 
Manufacture

(cid:91)Small production runs
(cid:91)Extreme operational environments
(cid:91)Limited repair/replace options after launch
(cid:91)High product cost and importance
(cid:91)High cost test environment
(cid:91)Highly coupled designs minimize weight 
and maximize performance but yield high 
complexity

Classical Quality Assurance

(cid:91)Identify points in process flow where we 
can make sure the hardware construction 
complies with engineering data before the 
next steps prevent inspection
(cid:91)Test surveillance certifies test equipment 
and processes
(cid:91)Quality assurance records all failures and 
anomalies

Qualification Test

(cid:91)Establishes that the design has suitable
l Performance
l Capacity to survive the operating environment
(cid:91)Includes vibration, shock, launch acoustics 
and the temperature extremes of space
(cid:91)Unique functional performance tests in 
each environment

Designing for Manufacturability

(cid:91)Traditional approach to quality (test/retest) 
is high cost and takes a long time
(cid:91)New approaches use concurrent 
engineering and lean manufacturing 
processes to reduce cost and ensure quality

Lean Manufacturing

(cid:91)Establishes and implements quality goals in 
the design phase
(cid:91)Focuses on the processes
(cid:91)Minimizes wasted time and effort
(cid:91)Involves manufacturing personnel in the 
design effort
(cid:91)Minimizes work in progress

Test Philosophies

(cid:91)Design verification establishes the 
performance of the design in functional test, 
vibration, shock, and space environments
l Moving toward limiting verification to initial 
system
(cid:91)Process verification establishes the 
performance of the production system
l The focus of lean manufacturing

Part Selection Criteria

(cid:91)Cost - S-level parts are not always required
(cid:91)Interchangeability - Ease of remove/replace
(cid:91)Simplicity - Cheaper, fewer installation 
issues, higher reliability
(cid:91)Availability - Just In Time delivery 
minimizes inventory
l Reduces part cost, handling, waste due to 
obsolescence and redesign 

6/21/2004

12

Concurrent Engineering

(cid:91)Involves manufacturing and test personnel 
in the design team
(cid:91)Refines the design while changes are 
relatively inexpensive
(cid:91)Permits quality, manufacturability, and 
profit to be designed into the system

13

Test Reduction

(cid:91)High quality processes that are well 
characterized, controlled and repeatable 
permit testing to be reduced
(cid:91)Continuous process improvement until the 
process, not inspection, guarantees quality
l Reduces inspection points
(cid:91)Reduced testing reduces opportunities to 
inject variability

14

Process Characterization Process

(cid:91)Process definition
(cid:91)Process capability
l Establish current level of process performance
(cid:91)Process optimization
l Focus on key metrics
l Determine which variables influence process 
output
(cid:91)Process control

Learning Cycles

(cid:91)Simulation packages model and predict 
performance
(cid:91)Prototypes allow physical evaluation
(cid:91)Pathfinding models handling, 
manufacturing and logistics activities

Conclusion

(cid:91)Modern spacecraft manufacturing seeks to 
design-in quality and manufacturability to 
reduce cost and time to market.
