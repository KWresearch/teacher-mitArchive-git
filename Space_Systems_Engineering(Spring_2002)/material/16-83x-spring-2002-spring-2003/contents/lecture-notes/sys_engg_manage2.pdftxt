Systems Engineering Management

Definitions
• What is Systems Engineering?
– the ensemble of coordinated analyses, simulations, and processes
which lead to a technical product which best meets the needs of an 
identified customer.
• What does it mean to manage systems engineering?
– Systems engineering management requires the allocation of 
resources in a manner that ensures success.
– Resources include funds, schedule, personnel, tools, and 
environment.
– Proper allocation requires that the manager continuously predicts 
the future needs of the program and technical hurdles and allocates 
the currently available resources such that these needs are met and 
these hurdles are cleared at the appropriate time.

The Restaurant Analogy
INGREDIENTS - available technologies, funds, schedule, 
personnel, etc.
• APPLIANCES - tools (e.g., software) for synthesizing, 
modeling, and analyzing a design.
• KITCHEN - environment in which tools and 
communications are exercised (e.g., design room).
• CHEF & ASSISTANTS - the systems engineering team.
• RECIPE - the sequence of activities, tests, and refinements 
used to ensure the successful completion of the product
• MEAL - the product that arrives on time, on budget, and 
meets requirements (tastes good)
All are required to produce a good yet cost-effective 
meal/product

Key Elements of Systems Management
• Resources (margins)
– Resources provide the fuel.  Holding margin ensures that fuel is
available when you need it.  Spend it sparingly and wisely.  Very 
painful to get more later
• Scheduling
– Scheduling coordinates the various activities of the team to ensure 
that the team receives information and hardware when it is needed.  
Scheduling identifies when and on what to spend resources 
(including allocating personnel) to ensure success when it is 
needed.
• Prototyping
– Analysis and simulation only answer some questions.  Others 
require actual testing in hardware.  Prototyping can be a resource-
effective element of the design process.

Key Elements (cont.)
• Communications
– Keep the team on the same page.  Time spent by team members 
designing under old assumptions is a waste of resources.
– Good communication with your customer(s) is essential in 
maintaining advocacy and access to resources.
– Assures that expectations do not drift
Interfaces
– In larger projects, interfaces between groups/subsystems must be
well-defined.
– Two types of interfaces:  physical and functional.
– Interface violations will happen.  Need to be arbitrated at next
highest level.
– Keep your interfaces to the outside world simple, clear, defined, 
and consistent.

Systems Engineering Management

Ensure that your Resources are Adequate
• Personnel
– Ensure  that the number of people as well as their skill mix 
satisfies the needs of the program.  Consultants, subcontractors, 
and research divisions can be used to fill gaps.
• Funding
– Funds are needed to pay personnel (salaries, employee benefits),
operate facilities (taxes, utilities, overhead), acquire hardware, and 
communicate with team and customer (travel, telephone).
• Schedule
– Identifies when analyses or products need to be delivered.
• Technologies
– Available technology is cheaper than invented technology
Don’t underbid a program or promise “unobtanium”

Flight Hardware
– Coordinate the activities of the team to maximize productivity
– Allocate resources - identify dependencies - manage costs
• Milestones
– Events which force the team to communicate the current form of 
the product in a coherent fashion
– Opportunity to solicit outside critiques from experts
– Often required by customer to ensure progress is on schedule, on
cost, and meeting performance requirements

Systems Engineering Management

Manage the Margins
• Hold margin in all resources
– Resources required by the product tend to increase due to 
unforeseen problems, better understanding of the design, etc.
– Margin allows the manager to accommodate such resource 
requirement growth without renegotiating resources with the 
customer.
• How much margin should be held?
– Reduces as the product design matures
– Suggest holding 30% at TARR, 20% at PDR, and 10% at CDR.

Systems Engineering Management

Tools (cont.)
• Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
– The list of tasks that need to be completed in order to accomplish 
the job
– Tree-structure
– Defined to lowest level that makes sense for a particular 
group/system.
– Often includes the expected labor hours and calendar schedule to
form a baseline for managing the effort
