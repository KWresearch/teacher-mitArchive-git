***** Course Description *****
Space Systems Engineering (16.83X) is the astronautical capstone course option
in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.Â  Between Spring 2002 and
Spring 2003, the course was offered in a 3-semester format, using a Conceive,
Design, Implement and Operate (C-D-I-O) teaching model.Â 16.83X is shorthand
for the three course numbers: 16.83, 16.831, and 16.832.Â The first semester
(16.83) is the Conceive-Design phase of the project, which results in a
detailed system design, but precedes assembly.Â  The second semester (16.831)
is the Implement phase, and involves building theÂ students' system.Â  The
final semester (16.832) is the Operate phase, in which the system isÂ tested
and readied toÂ perform in its intended environment.
This year's project objective was to demonstrate the feasibility of an
electromagnetically controlled array of formation flying satellites.Â  The
project, "EMFFORCE", wasÂ an extension of the first C-D-I-O course project,
"SPHERES", which ran fromÂ Spring 1999 through Spring 2000, and demonstrated
satellite formation flying using gas thrusters for station-keeping.Â  The whole
class works on the same project,Â but dividesÂ into smaller subsystem teams,
such asÂ power, metrology, and structures, to handle design details.
