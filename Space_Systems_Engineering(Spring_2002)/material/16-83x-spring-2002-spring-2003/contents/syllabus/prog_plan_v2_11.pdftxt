GENERAL DESCRIPTION: 16.684 CDIO 

CDIO:  Conceive,  Design,  Implement,  and  Operate  will  take  you  through  all  the 

activities required to create a final aerospace product. In this context the goals of CDIO are: 

• 	 To educate students to master a deeper working knowledge of the technical fundamentals 
• 	 To educate future engineers to lead in the creation and operation of new products/systems 
• 	 To educate future researchers to understand the importance and strategic value of their work 

Our  vision  is  to  provide  students  with  an  education  that  stresses  the  fundamentals  and  is 

focused  on  real  world  systems  and  products.  It  will  provide  an  integrated  education  that 

provides  experiential  learning  through  a  rich  offering  of  team-based  design-build-operate 

projects; both in the classroom and a state-of-the-art Learning Laboratory. 

For every product  there  is a concept, a vision of  something new.  The design of  the 

project  creates  a  user’s  manual  for  the  implementation.  Each  part  of  this manual must  be 

self-consistent;  each  section  must  allow  physical  implementation.  At  the  same  time,  the 

result must  be  visionary,  either  in  the way  in which  it meets  the  customer needs,  advances 

scientific  knowledge,  exploits  new  technology  and  processes,  or  reaps  return  for  investors. 

Good analysis, careful design, and precise implementation will translate into success. 

In this class, each of you will be part of one team, the CDIO team.  We will analyze 

the  requests  from  our  ‘customer’;  design  a  product  to  meet  all  the  specified  requirements; 

implement our design in a working, final product; and operate it to evaluate its performance 

in a controlled environment. 

As part of  the Systems Engineering  and Architecture  (SE&A)  curriculum,  the class 

will  put  emphasis  on  the  design  process. While  there  are  many  definitions  of  SE&A,  one 

definition,  closest  to  the  philosophy  behind  CDIO,  is  “the  ensemble  of  coordinated 

analyses,  simulations,  and  processes which  lead  to  the design of  a  technical product which 

best meets  the needs of an  identified customer. ”    It  is essential  that any  systems design  tell 

the “whole” story.  The whole story consists of  why, which, what, how, when and where: 

• 	 Why:   the  requirements  define  the  customer’s  needs  and  why  the  mission  is  worth 
conducting.

• 	 Which:  The  trade  analysis  compares  different  mission  architectures  and  determines 
which architecture best meets the requirements and therefore the customer needs. 
• 	 What:   The  design  describes  what  will  actually  be  built  and  operated  to  conduct  the 
mission. 
• 	 How:  The  program  plan  describes  the  organizational  structure,  resource  allocation, 
In  essence,  it  describes  how  the  mission  will  be 
funding  profile,  and  schedule. 

deployed. 
• 	 When:   As  part  of  the  program  plan,  the  schedule  describes  when  different  mission 
development and deployment stages will occur and how they depend upon each other. 
• 	 Where:  Also as part of the program plan, the hardware flow details where the following 
are  located:  component  procurement  sources,  sub-system  integration  facilities,  test  and 

validation sequence and operations facilities. 

CDIO, as 16.684, is an educational experiment.  The course aims to provide each of 

you a lifecycle experience with a hardware-related, complex aerospace system.  You will be 

part  of  a  large  team  environment, which  emphasizes  communication,  teamwork,  planning, 

and  responsibility.  In  addition,  you  will  also  be  individually  responsible  for  designing, 

building,  operating,  and  analyzing  a  specialized  subsystem  in  a  laboratory  setting.  In  this 

way  you  will  be  exposed  to  the  interfaces  between  the  needs  of  the  team  and  the 

responsibilities  of  the  individual  team  members.  Further,  it  is  the  first  time  that  an 

undergraduate  class  will  have  to  deliver  a  final  product  to  a  major  outside  organization. 

We  will  have  a  fixed  delivery  schedule,  strict  requirements  and  restrictions,  and  several 

reviews. 

At  the end of  the course each of us,  including  the students, will assess  the merits of 

integrating  this  class  into  the  standard  academic  program.  At  any  time  during  the  course 

you  should  feel  free  to  contact  Dr.  Doris  R.  Brodeur  (  with  any 

feedback  on  the  pedagogic  aspects  of  the  class.  She  will  be  the  liaison  between  you,  the 

students,  and  the  board  of  faculty,  which  will  review  the  course  as  a  whole.  We  believe 

that  these  experiences  will  be  of  great  educational  value,  and  hope  each  of  you  will  both 

learn and enjoy it.

THE PROJECT 

Formation flight of satellites is a concept that has been proposed for many purposes, 

including space  interferometry.  Unlike monolithic  telescopes,  interferometers are based on 

the  concept  of  combining  light  from  multiple  apertures  spaced  a  distance  apart.  Just  as  a 

monolithic  telescope’ s  angular  resolution  improves  with  aperture  size,  an  interferometer’ s 

resolution  improves with  increased  distance  between  apertures.   Hence  formation  flight  of 

separated spacecraft appears to be a useful tool in implementing space interferometry. 

Until now,  traditional  thrusters have been proposed for formation flight attitude and 

positional control.  However,  there are several concerns with  the use of  thrusters, including 

plume contamination of neighboring spacecraft and sensitive optics, and the use of fuel as a 

nonrenewable  energy  source.  Rather  than  thrusters,  electromagnets  could  be  used  for 

formation flight control.  Electromagnetic formation flight control has the potential to: 

A. 	 eliminate concerns about thruster plume impingement and optics contamination 

B. 	 control relative degrees of freedom, as opposed  to  the  inertial degrees of freedom 

controlled by thrusters, and 

C. 	

rely on electricity provided by solar arrays, a renewable energy source, as opposed 

to thrusters whose finite fuel supply often limits the life of the spacecraft. 

Therefore, 

the  objective  of 

this  class 

is 

to  demonstrate 

the  feasibility  of  an 

electromagnetically  controlled  array  of  formation  flying  satellites. This  objective  is  cast  as 

the following Mission Statement: 

Demonstrate the feasibility of electromagnetic control for formation flying satellites. 

Specifically, 
• 	 Demonstrate  implies  operating  an  electromagnetic  formation  flight  testbed  in  a  mode 
representative  of  a  real  world  application,  or  “ scaled ”   to  demonstrate  real-world 

feasibility. 
• 	 Electromagnetic  control  implies  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  controller  using 
electromagnets as actuators to control relative position and attitude.

• 	 Formation  flying  satellites  implies  a  testbed  composed  of  multiple  rigid  bodies  that 
must exhibit the functionality of a real cluster of satellites in formation flight.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE 

CDIO  is a  three-term class.   The  first  two  terms will be  twelve units;  the  third  term 

six.  As we progress  through  the project, more  time will be  allotted  to  laboratory  time  (the 

implementation  stage).  Recall  that  CDIO  corresponds  to  16.83,  16.621,  and  16.622; 

therefore  it  includes  teaching on  both Space Systems Engineering and Laboratory practice. 

Details on class organization and each of the terms follow below.

SCHEDULE AND WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE 

Good scheduling is key to getting the work done in the time allotted.  Formal reviews 

provide  not  only  an  opportunity  to  present  progress  on  the  program,  but  also  provides 

intermediate  milestones  for  making  sure  that  the  SE&A  story  makes  sense  and  that  the 

various  parts  of  that  story  fit  together. 

If  problems  are  revealed,  careful  scheduling 

(planning)  allows  the  team  to  understand  how  the  remaining  time  can  be  most  effectively 

used  to  finish  the work while  correcting  the problems.   Figure 4.1  shows  the  schedules  for 

CDIO  as  they  exist  on  the  first  day  of  classes.   The  individual  sections  describe  each  term 

in more detail.  These may change as needed by the various demands that will be placed on 

the program. 

4.1  Overall Program Schedule 

As mentioned,  the  course will be  conducted over  three  semesters: Spring CY02, Fall 

CY02  and  Spring  CY03.  The  total  number  of  units  will  be  thirty  (30)  with  Spring  CY02 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

being  4-4-4,  Fall  CY02  being  2-6-4,  and  Spring CY03  being  1-5-0.   The  overall  hardware 

development and test and operations plan consists of the following: 

• 	 System  Conceptualization.  For  the  period  starting  on  2/5/02  and  ending  3/21/02,  the 
class  will  organize  into  system  conceptualization  teams.    These  teams  will  be 
responsible  for  defining  requirements,  downselecting 
to  a  candidate  mission 
architecture,  trading  sub-system  components  and  formalizing  hardware  development 
processes. 
• 	 Prototype  Hardware.  Following  Spring  Break  in  the  Spring  of  CY02,  students  will 
organize  into  sub-system  teams  and  develop  sub-system  prototypes  in  the  laboratory. 
While  the  teams  will  need  to  adhere  to  interface  allocations  and  requirements,  the 
laboratory  work  of  each  sub-system  team  is  primarily  performed  in  isolation  from  the 
other  teams.  During  the  Fall  CY02  semester,  prior  to  CDR,  sub-system  benchtop 
prototypes  will  be  brought  together  and  integrated  into  a  system  prototype  that  will  be 
tested  by  CDR.  The  design  presented  at  CDR  must  reflect  lessons  learned  through  the 
sub-system and system prototypes. 
• 	 Flight  Hardware.  Following  successful  completion  of  CDR  in  the  Fall  of  CY02,  the 
flight  system  will  be  developed.  It  is  envisioned  that  those  components  of  the  system 
prototype  that have not undergone design modification will be used  in  the  flight  system 
in  order  to  save  schedule  and  cost.    Flight  hardware  fabrication  and  verification will  be 
complete by the Acceptance Review in CY03 after which it will be operated in the field.

4.2  Spring 2002: Conceive & Design 

The  weekly  schedule  for  16.684  Space  Systems  Product  Development  consists  of  two 

lectures  of  two  hours  each.  These  lectures  will  take  place  Tuesdays  and  Thursdays  from 

1:00 p.m.  – 3:00 p.m. In addition,  laboratory sessions are  
encouraged on Friday  afternoons 
or  at other  times  convenient  for  all group members,  for a  
total of four hours per week.
 
The laboratory facilities have been assigned to 16.684. Documents, software etc. may be left 
in this room throughout the course. The rooms have PCs installed and are usable immediately. 
 
See  Section 9.2 for details on the facilities, which can be used by this class. Together  with  the 
four  hours  of  homework/preparation this results in the 4-4-4 assignments of the 12 units for
 Spring 2002.

Space Systems Product Development  –

 Spring 2002 

Description 

The  Spring  2002  program  consists  of  two  formal  presentations  (milestones):  the 

Trade  Analysis  and  Requirements  Review  (TARR)  and  the  Preliminary  Design  Review 

(PDR).   The work  for  this  term  is mainly  concentrated  on  the Conceive  and Design  stages 

of  the  project.    Lectures  will  concentrate  on  the  design  process  and  team  and 

intercommunication  skills.   Still, we expect  that each  sub-system  team will have  some part 

of their design implemented by the end of the term. 

The  objective  of  the  Conceptual  Design  Phase  (start  to  TARR)  is  to  arrive  at  a 

mission  architecture,  which  meets  the  needs  of  the  customer  better  than  other  candidate 

architectures.  To  this  end,  several  tasks  must  be  completed,  which  are  described  below, 

and  the  class  will  be  divided  into  four  teams:    Requirements  and  Scaling,  Architectural 

Options, Databasing, and Processes.  The relevant document is shown in parentheses: 

1. 	 Requirements  and  Scaling:  The  requirements  task  involves  understanding  and 
analyzing  top-level  system  requirements,  flowing  those  requirements  down  to  sub­
system  requirements,  and  capturing  the  requirement  traceability  and  validation  in  the 
requirements document. 
1.1. Extract Customer Requirements:  	The mission  is being designed for a customer.  It 
is  essential  that  the  team  understand  the  needs  of  the  customer  through  the 
scientific  advisors,  as  well  as  the  published  literature.    These  needs  must  be 
translated  into  customer  requirements,  which  guide  the  development  of  the 
program.  These  requirements  are  stated  in  the  language  of  the  customer.  The 
design  should  be  periodically  compared  back  to  these  requirements  during  the 
program.  [Requirements Document] 
1.2. System  Functional  Requirements  and  Scaling:  	 The  functional  requirements  are 
created  from  the  customer  requirements  and  mission  timelining.    The  functional 
requirements  explain what must be  achieved by  the mission design, but not how  it 
should  be  done.  They  should  be  scaled  from  the  dimensions  of  a  real-world 
mission  to  those  of  your  testbed,  while  still  demonstrating  the  feasibility  of  the 
real-world  mission.  The  functional  requirements  are  stated  in  engineering  terms. 
[Requirements Document] 
1.3. Sub-System  Requirements.  	 The  sub-system  requirements  are  extracted  from  the 
system  functional  requirements  and  provide  the  specifications  to  which  each  sub­
system team needs to design. 
2. 	 Architectural  Options:   All  plausible  technical  options  for  implementing  the  various 
elements  of  the  mission  will  be  listed.    The  open  literature,  space  mission  databases, 
textbooks,  internet,  engineering  advisors,  as  well  as  other  sources  should  be  used  to 
identify  these  options.    Then,  those  element  options  that  are  compatible  with  other

 Spring 2002 

element  options  are  combined  into  a  systems  architecture.    If  an  architecture meets  the 
customer  and  functional  requirements,  it  is  considered  a  candidate  architecture  for  the 
mission.  [Design Document] 
2.1. Metric  Definition:  Only  a  formal  and  quantifiable  method  for  measuring  the 
ability  of  each  candidate  architecture  to  meet  or  exceed  the  requirements  allows  a 
fair  downselect  to  the  architecture  to  be  further  developed  in  subsequent  design 
phases.  These  metrics  should  include  performance  and  cost,  but  can  also  include 
time, reliability, etc.  [Design Document] 
2.2. Conceptualization: 
Identify  those  attributes  of  an  architecture  that  must  be 
understood  in order  to allow one  to  judge  the merits of  that architecture against the 
metrics. 
  Conceptualization  specifically  pertains  to  the  manner  in  which 
“ understanding”   is  achieved.  High  fidelity  models,  fundamental  design  relations, 
engineering experience, etc., can all be used but entail different  levels of effort and 
uncertainty. 
2.3. Trade Analysis:  Given the metrics, each candidate architecture needs to be studied 
in  some  detail  in  order  to  quantify  how  each  ranks  with  respect  to  the  defined 
metrics.  This study requires understanding of some of the functional dependencies 
between performance and cost and consumed resources such as mass, power,  time, 
etc.  [Design Document] 
2.4. Evaluation:  A  formal  downselect  must  lead  to  an  architecture  that  merits  further 
study.  If  a  second  architecture  is  carried  forward,  it  should  only  be  retained  if  it 
provides  an  alternative  to  some  very  high-risk  element  in  the  first  architecture,  it 
represents a de-scope, or  it  is deemed comparable  to  the first architecture.   [Design 
Document] 
3. 	 Databasing: 
Obviously, many components will need  to be procured from vendors 
in  order  to  save  cost  and  schedule.  Therefore,  there  is a need  to generate a database of 
components and their specifications that are candidates for use in our system. 
3.1.1. 	 Component  Class  Identification:  Identify  different  classes  of  components 
that  will  probably  be  needed  by  the  system.  This  can  often  be  done  without 
knowledge of the final architecture. 
3.1.2. 	 Database  Commercial-Off-the-Shelf  (COTS)  Components:  Through  web 
searching  and  other  avenues,  acquire  specifications  for  candidate  components 
and  vendors  within  each  component  class.    This  information  should  be 
archived either electronically or in hardcopy (file cabinet). 
3.1.3. 	 Make/Buy  Criteria:  Define  criteria  based  upon  requirements  and  cost 
constraints  that  will  allow  the  future  sub-system  teams  to  make  decisions  on 
whether the team should buy or fabricate a particular component. 
3.1.4. 	 Procurement:  Initiate  the  procurement  of  long-lead  items  so  that  they  will 
be in the laboratory by the time that the class needs them.

4. 	 Processes:  Well  thought-out  processes  are  essential  to  ensure  that  requirements  are 
met,  interface  definitions  are  adhered  to,  and  programmatic  budgets  (schedule,  cost, 
etc.) are not exceeded. 
4.1. Budgets:  Develop  a  process  that  will  be  used  by  the  Systems  Team  to  track 
budgets (mass, power, cost, volume, flops, etc.). 
4.2. Verification:  All  requirements  need  to  be  measurable  so  that  one  can  verify  that 
the  requirements  have  been  met.    Therefore,  define  the  requirements  verification 
process. 
4.3. Configuration  Control:  Develop  a  process  for  managing  interfaces  and 
configuration. 
If  left  untracked,  the  process  of  integrating  the  sub-system 
prototypes into the system prototype will be a painful process. 
4.4. Mission  Timelining:    Any  mission  will  not  only  have  a  design  but  also  a 
chronology  of  events  through  which  elements  of  this  design  are  implemented. 
Timelining  focuses  on  the  proper  sequencing  of  these  events  and  helps  to  identify 
technical  options  for  implementing  these  events.    It  is  similar  to  program 
scheduling.  [Design Document] 

It  is  important  to realize that decisions made during the Conceptual Design Phase, a 

phase that always consists of the least amount of funding, commits most of the funding that 

will  be  spent  in  subsequent  phases.  If  a  decision  proves  to  be  poor,  it  is  difficult  and 

expensive to change in the subsequent design phases.  In other words,  “ Roughly 10% of the 

resources are used to determine how to commit the remaining 90%.” 

The  objective  of  the  Preliminary  Design  Phase  (TARR  to  PDR)  is  to  take  a 

“ strawman ”   mission  architectural  concept  and  develop  the  design  in  more  detail. 

Functional  requirements  are  flowed  down  to  technical  sub-system  requirements.  The 

design  explains  how  the  system  achieves  its  requirements  and  how  the  sub-system 

functions are allocated.  The  tasks for each sub-system during the preliminary design phase 

(after Spring Break CY2002) are listed below: 

1. 	 Respond  to  TARR  Action  Items:  A  formal  presentation  such  as  the  TARR  allows 
outside experts to review the design and suggest alternatives, corrections, and solutions. 
These comments are collected at the end of the review, ranked by priority, and assigned 
to a representative of the team as  “ action items.”
 Action items are completed as soon as 
possible and formally closed at a team meeting.  [Design Document] 
2. 	 Requirements  Flowdown:  The  customer  and  functional  requirements  are  flowed  down 
to  the  sub-system  level.    At  this  level,  they  are  stated  in  technical  terms  and  start  to

levels. 

the  system  and  sub-system 

describe  how 
the  mission  will  work  at 
[Requirements Document] 
3. 	 Interface  Refinement:  After  the  TARR,  the  organization  of  the  team  will  change  and 
groups  of  people  will  form  more  clearly  defined  groups  around  individual  disciplines 
such  as  electromagnetics,  power,  software,  etc.  A  formal  definition  of  the  new 
organizational  structure,  as  well  as  definitions  of  each  group’ s  interfaces,  is  needed. 
These  interfaces  define what  each  group  needs  to  know  in  order  to do  their  analysis  as 
well as define  the  type and format of  information  that  that group will provide  to others. 
[Interface Control Document] 
4. 	 Sub-system  Trade  Analysis  and  Preliminary  Design:  Each  sub-system  group  will 
conduct  trade  analyses  during  the  preliminary  design  phase.  For  example,  one  can 
calculate  the  impact  of  variations  in power  consumption, hardware mass, or number of 
units on the system cost, performance, or reliability.  This is a highly interactive process 
and  works  best  if  conducted  concurrently  among  the  team  members.  [Design 
Document]  Software  modules  that  relate  sub-system  performance  and  cost  to  sub­
system requirements will be developed to aid in this task. For example, the power group 
will  need  to  relate  cost,  mass,  volume,  lifetime,  and  heat  load  of  the  power  system  to 
inputs  such  as  peak  power, average power, watt-hours, duty cycle, etc.    [Appendices  to 
Design Document] 
5. 	 Budget  Development:  The  systems  group  will  use  the  budget  tracking  methods  to 
monitor  the  inevitable growth  in resource consumption during  the semester.   Resources 
such  as  mass,  power,  computation,  reliability,  volume,  and  cost  will  be  tracked.  The 
systems  group will  hold margins  (30%  at  PDR  and  20%  at CDR).   The  systems  group 
will  also  re-allocate  margins  between  groups  in  order  to  balance  the  difficulty  of  the 
design effort.  [Design Document] 
6. 	 Detailed Timelining: The details of the chronology of events also impact the design and 
warrant further analysis.  [Design Document] 
7. 	 PDR  Preparation:  Preparing  for  the  review  is  not  simply  “ viewgraph  engineering.”     It  
forces  the  SE&A  story  to  be  coherent  and  correct.    Do  not  under-estimate  the  effort 
associated with this task. 

The Preliminary Design Phase  is where  teamwork  is defined.   Most design  failures can 

be  traced  back  to  poor  teamwork.  One  of  the  hardest  parts  of  systems  engineering  is  the 

management of  interfaces.  There will be  times when your work requires  input from others 

in  the  class.  Often  this  input may not be  forthcoming  for a variety of  reasons.   Sometimes 

it  is  in the best interest of the project to make assumptions, proceed with your analysis, and 

present  your  results  to  those  with  whom  you  need  to  interface.    If  you ’ ve  performed  the 

analysis correctly, changing the value of an input should not take too long.

4.3  Student Laboratory Objectives 

For  the  purpose  of  fulfilling  the  laboratory  requirement,  it  is  envisioned  that  the  class 

will be divided  into  five  sub-system development  teams.  Each  team will consist of several 

undergraduate  students  who  will  flow  down  requirements  to  their  sub-system,  develop  a 

design  that  optimizes  performance  while  meeting  carrier  and  interface  constraints, 

formulate  fabrication  and  procurement  plans,  fabricate  the  prototype  hardware  and 

software,  conduct  tests,  compare  with  models,  and  alter  flight  hardware  designs  as 

appropriate.  Suggested teams are: 

1. 	 Electromagnetic  (EM)  and  Reaction  Wheel  Assembly  (RWA)  Design:  Design  EM 
dipole  configurations  and  hardware,  and  size RWA  to meet  requirements while  staying 
within mass and power budgets. 
2. 	 Structure  and  Air  Carriage.  Define  mechanical  interfaces  for  subsystems,  minimize 
frame  mass,  etc.    Model  and  measure  system  inertias  and  model  system.    Complete 
CAD  and  FEM  models  of  system  with  static,  dynamic  and  thermal  loads  analysis. 
Integrate  model  of  structure  prototype  built  with  CNC  and/or  rapid  prototyping 
machine.  Design or modify existing air carriage for longer-duration operations. 
3. 	 Communications and Operations:  Create  the operations plan  that allows  the  testbed  to 
verify that it is meeting requirements.  Also develop the system that allows wireless and 
autonomous operation of the  “ satellites.” 
4. 	 Power, Avionics and Software.  Define electrical power system and electrical interfaces, 
optimize  system  electrical  efficiency,  and manage battery hazard  control,  analog  signal 
conditioning,  touch  temperature  control,  analog  device  drivers,  etc.  Also  responsible 
for  on-board  software  device  drivers,  real-time  control  software  operating  system,  data 
handling and temporary storage, and control loop design. 
5. 	 Systems.  The  role  of  the  Systems  Team  will  change  each  semester,  as will  its  student 
composition.  It  is  desired  that  the  Systems  Team  be  composed  of  one  member  from 
each  of  the  sub-system  teams  so  that  each  sub-system  have  representation  in  the 
Systems  Team.    Membership  turnover  will  attempt  to  accommodate  all  students  who 
wish  to  serve  on  the  Systems  Team.  This  team  is  responsible  for  mass,  power,  error 
and  cost  budgets,  verification  and  validation  plan,  configuration  management  of  CAE 
drawings, documentation and presentation preparation, etc. 

Formal  laboratory  notebooks  will  be  maintained  during  the  second  half  of  the 

Spring  CY02  semester.  These  notebooks  will  be  used  to  archive  design  decisions,  test 

results, observations, important parameter values, vendor phone numbers, etc.  Periodically,

key  information  from  these  notebooks  should  be  transferred  to  the  Design  Document. 

Laboratory  notebooks  will  be  graded  about  every  two  weeks  (three  times  over  the 

semester).  Details on laboratory notebook grading are provided in Section 8.6. 

4.4 

Fall 2002: Implement 

Welcome  to  the  Implementation  portion  of  CDIO.    It  is  time  to  make  our  designs 

work.  This  is  the most difficult of  the  three  semesters but hopefully  the most rewarding  in 

terms of accomplishment.  The semester starts with prototype subsystems and ends with the 

arrival  of  some  of  the  flight  hardware.    In  between,  the  class  must  complete  sub-system 

testing, assemble and  test  the prototype,  successfully complete  the Critical Design Review, 

and  initiate  flight  hardware  procurement.    This  section  discusses  the  organization  of  the 

Implementation phase (Fall semester CY02). 

The  Fall  of  2002  will  be  mainly  dedicated  to  implementation.    As  part  of  this,  the 

group  will  reach  the  Critical  Design  Review  (CDR).  The  objective  of  the  Critical Design 

Phase  is  to  develop  the  design  such  that  once  the  CDR  is  successfully  completed;  the 

program  is  ready  to  “ cut metal.”  At  this  point  detailed  designs  of  the  sub-systems will  be 

required.    These  must  be  sufficiently  detailed  so  that  implementation  of  each  system  is 

possible  and  the  integration  of  each  sub-system  becomes  a  reality.  The  specific  tasks  are 

described below: 

1.  	 Most  of  the  tasks  started  during  the  Preliminary  Design  Phase  are  continued  in  more 

detail during the Critical Design Phase. 

2.  	 Program  Plan:  The  Program  Plan,  as  part  of  the  Design  Document,  details  the 

organization,  workforce,  schedule,  spending  profile  and  other  programmatic  issues 

associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  mission  beyond  CDR. 

“ The  Design 

Document explains what you are going  to do while the Program Plan explains how you 

are going to do it. ” 

4.5  Spring 2003: Operate 

 

The customer’ s  requirements plan  for a  first  test  in early April, 2003.   As such,  this 

term will  be  greatly  dedicated  to  ensure  that  the  test  occurs.   The  first part of  the  term will

continue with  implementation.  Towards  the  initial  test,  the  group will  start  to  concentrate 

on validation strategies. Initial planning calls for (a) initial tests on a flat surface at MIT and 

(b)  if  the  system  performs  satisfactorily,  field  operations  at  Lockheed  Martin’ s  flat-floor 

facility in Denver.

the  presentations.  Each  of  the  presentations  will  be  accompanied  by  one  or  more 

documents. 

(Each  presentation  description  lists  the  relevant  documents  that  should 

accompany  the  presentation.  Descriptions  of  the  documents,  themselves,  are  given  in  the 

following section.) 

1. 	 Trade  Analysis  and  Requirements  Review  (TARR):  The  objectives  of  the  TARR  are 
threefold.  First,  to  formally  accept  and  place  under  configuration  control  the 
Requirements Document.  Customer, functional and highest level systems requirements 
are placed under control.  Second,  the rationale for selection of the mission architecture 
that  is  to  be  carried  forward  is  presented  and  formally  accepted.  Third,  the  plan  for 
executing the Preliminary Design Phase is presented and captured in the PDP ICD. 
2. 	 Preliminary  Design  Review  (PDR):  The  objectives  of  the  PDR  are  threefold.    First,  it 
provides a  formal opportunity  to present  the  status of  the design (and budgets) down  to 
the  requirements  and  associated  functions  of  the  various  sub-systems.  Second,  it 
provides  an  opportunity  to  present  the  design  to  an  audience  that  is  not  part  of  the 
design  team.  This  aspect  of  the  PDR  is  often  called  a  Non-Advocate  Review  (NAR) 
since  it provides  the  customer with  a critical  “ sanity check ”  before  substantial program 
resources  are  spent  on  the  design.  Third,  the  plan  for  executing  the  Critical  Design 
Phase is presented.  This plan is captured in the CDP ICD. 
3. 	 Critical  Design  Review  (CDR):  The  objectives  of  the  CDR  are  threefold.    First,  the 
CDR  provides  an  opportunity  to  present  the  completed  design.  Second,  it  is  the  first 
review  in  which  the  entire  Program  Plan  for  implementing  and  deploying  that  design 
will  be  presented.  Third,  it  provides  an  opportunity  to  “ sell”   the  design  and  program 
plan  to  an  audience  that  is  comprised  of  the  customer  and  funding agencies.  In  typical 
programs,  successful  completion  of  a  CDR  leads  immediately  into  flight  hardware 
fabrication  (i.e.,  “ cut  metal” ).  Therefore,  a  strong  CDR  presentation  is  essential  for 
ensuring that the large resources required for the fabrication phase are made available. 
4. 	 Acceptance Review (AR): The objectives of the AR are threefold.  First, the IDF is used 
as  an  opportunity  to  put  the  higher-level  portions  of  the  mission  design  under 
configuration  control.  This  helps  the  team  to  focus  on  the  details without  concern  that 
major  design  assumptions  are  going  to  change  and  thereby  invalidate  their  work. 
Second, it provides an intermediate opportunity to review progress on the Program Plan 
for  developing  and  deploying  the  design.  Third,  it  provides  a  critical  opportunity  to 
refine  the  CDP  ICD  based  upon  the  accomplished  work,  remaining  work,  and 
remaining time. 

Presentation Guidelines 

Remember  that  there  are  two  ways  to  sink  an  idea:  have  a  bad  idea  or  have  a  good  idea 

that is poorly presented.

• 	 All presentations will have a duration of three (3) hours, where 2.5 hours is spent on the 
presentation  and  half  an  hour  is  devoted  to  questions  and  answers.  All  presentations 

will be accompanied by annotated viewgraphs. 

5.3  Documents 

All  the  documents  in  the  class  have  a  specific  purpose,  and  are  essential  to  the 

success  of  the  project.    Recall  that  each  document  must  be  self-sufficient,  factual,  and 

accurate.    Therefore,  attention  must  be  paid  to  each  of  them.    The  description  for  each 

document is given below. 

1.0 	 Requirements  Document:  defines  the  “ goods  and  services ” 

that  are  required  of  the 

design.  This  document  constitutes  the  “ contract ”   between  the  customer  and  the 

systems  engineering  and  architecting  team.    Sometimes,  part  of  this  document  is 

written  by  the  customer.  At  other  times,  it  results  from  a  study  by  the  systems  team 

to determine the needs of a customer in order to assess the viability of a new product. 

1.1  	 Revision 1.0 will be placed under Configuration Control at the TARR.  It will 

therefore  require 

the  signature  of 

the  Chief  Systems  Engineer  for 

modifications  to  the customer, functional or  top  level subsystem requirements 

to be made. 

2.0 	 Design  Document:    captures  the  “ build-to”  specifications  for  the  mission.    It  also 

captures the rationale that led to these specifications.  To this end, the trades analysis, 

requirements  pushback,  budgets,  system  and  sub-system  designs,  analysis  tools  and 

simulation  results  are  included.    Requirements  pushback  is  the  analysis  that  verifies 

that  the  design  meets  the  requirements.    This  is  in  contrast  to  the  requirements 

flowdown, which simply allocates sub-system requirements with minimal knowledge 

of  the  implications  of  these  allocations.    Requirements  pushback  is  essential  to 

determine whether  the  design meets  the  requirements  and whether one  sub-system  is 

facing  particularly  stringent 

requirements  while  others 

face  more 

lenient 

requirements.  This allows proper balancing of the allocated requirements. 

2.1  	 Revision  1.0: At  this  stage,  the Design Document  consists  of  portions  of  text 

and  portions  that  are  in  outline  form.  The  text  portion  identifies  the 

Massachusetts Institute of Technology

 Spring 2002 

subsystems,  discusses  the  subsystem  trades  conducted,  and  justifies  the 

selected  subsystem  implementation.  This  discussion  will  reference  the 

Requirements  Document  on  which  it  is  based.  The  outline  portion  identifies 

the  locations  in  the  design  document  where  requirements  are  presented, 

designs are developed, and budgets are kept. 

3.0 	

Implementation  Plan:    describes  how  the  design  will  be  developed  and  deployed. 

Since  this document is placed under configuration control at the CDR, it describes all 

events  subsequent  to  CDR. These  include  the  schedule,  funding,  suppliers,  hardware 

flow,  sub-system  integration,  flight  hardware  validation  and  verification,  etc.  for  the 

fabrication,  qualification,  acceptance,  and  operations  phases  of  the  mission.    For  a 

commercial  venture,  it  may  be  tightly  coupled  to  the  Business  Plan,  which  also 

captures the “ return ”  or profit along with a market risk analysis and contingency plan. 

4.0 

	Operations Plan: outlines the procedures and dates for operation of the satellite.  This 

plan must be  self-sufficient  from  a user point of view.    It must clearly define  startup, 

operation, and shutdown methods.  It should also have a plan on the dates for testing, 

validation, and future operation of the satellite. 

Document Guidelines 
• 	 All  the  documents  will  enter  under  “ Configuration  Control ”   after  they  have  been 
submitted  to  the  staff.  After  submission,  the  Chief  Systems  Engineer  (Professor Dave 

Miller)  will  sign  the  document,  which  indicates  that  it  can  no  longer  be  changed.    In 

order  to modify  the  document  after  submission,  the  changes must  be  authorized  by  the 

Chief Systems Engineer.  Note that there will be a complete lecture on this topic, where 

you will get details on the system and understand the ideas behind it. 
• 	 All documents will be developed  in  the  software  specified  the  first week of class (most 
likely: MS Word).  This way we  ensure  that  all members  of  the  CDIO  team will  have 

access to the information in a timely manner.

MODULE DEVELOPMENT 

In  order  to  perform  trade  analyses  and  design,  students  will  develop  and  utilize 

software modules.  These modules describe the particular disciplines for which the students 

are  responsible  and  mathematically  capture  the  relationships  between  that  discipline ’ s 

inputs  and outputs.  There will be  times during  the  class when one person will ask another 

how  much  that  second  person’ s  sub-system  will  change  (outputs)  in  the  event  that  the 

requirements on that sub-system change (inputs).  For example, a power subsystem module 

might  describe  how  the  mass,  volume,  and  reliability  change  if  the  required  watt-hours, 

battery (dis)charge duty cycle, and mission lifetime change.  As another example, a systems 

module  might  describe  how  the  total  cost  of  the  spacecraft  changes  as  required  power, 

mass,  mission  lifetime,  and  reliability  change.    These  relationships  can  be  derived  from 

SMAD as well as other reference material. 

These  modules  serve  several  purposes  and  may  be  combined  with  other  modules 

within  a  group.  First,  they  force  the  students  to  understand  and  codify  functional 

relationships  within  their  discipline.    Second,  they  help  to  define  and  clarify  interfaces 

between  the  different  groups  and  modules.  These  modules  will  be  codified,  grouped  with 

other  modules  within  that  group,  documented,  utilized,  and  submitted  to  the  Design 

Document as an appendix. 

The  Modules  can  be  created  in  several  software  packages,  as  long  as  they  contain 

the full mathematical description and behavior of the sub-system.  If codified in Matlab, for 

example,  they  can  be  linked  as  function  calls  (subroutines)  with  their  strict  definitions  of 

inputs  and  outputs.  During  an  integrated  concurrent  engineering  exercise,  the  computer 

display  of  key  assumptions  and  system  budgets will  be  projected  onto  a  screen  in  front  of 

the  class.  The  class  will  then  alter  assumptions  and  view  the  impact  of  these  changes  in 

real  time  on  the  screen.  In  this  way,  design  spaces  can  be  explored  and  compared  in 

fractions  of  the  time  conventionally  required.  Remember,  the  module  must  be  complex 

enough  to  capture  the  important  relationships  yet  simple  enough  to  provide  outputs  that 

make  sense  and  code,  which  is  available  in  time  to  be  used  in  these  integrated  concurrent 

engineering exercises.  The modules are only useful  if  their  information  is correct and  they 

are available on time.  The following attributes are suggested for each module:

COMMUNICATIONS 

7.1  Daily Communications 

An  email  list  has  been  established.    It  should  be  used  to  augment 

communication  between  individuals  and  groups  in  the  class.  The  GAs  will  be  on  the  list 

but  the  faculty will not be on  the  list.   The GAs will keep  the  faculty and  staff  informed of 

all  important  issues  that arise.   A separate  list, with  just  the staff has 

also  been  setup.  Be  sure  to  only  use  the  staff  list  if  absolutely  necessary,  since  the 

professors get too many e-mails already! 

7.2  Weekly Communications 

The  faculty,  staff  and  GAs  will  meet  every  Monday  at  10am  to discuss 

progress  in  the  class. Representatives  from  the class will on occasion be asked  to come 

and  talk with the faculty and staff at this meeting. Almost every Tuesday  will  start  with 

a  20-minute  review  of  action  items  and  the  last  20  minutes  of  Thursday  will  end  with 
the  assignment  of  action  items.    The  review  will  consist  of  email 

memos (in standard CDIO memo format) as well as a brief verbal description by the cog-e.

Description of Grading Criteria: 

1. 	 Colleague  reviews:   the  students  will  submit  colleague  reviews  to  the  Graduate 
Assistants  (GAs)  around  the  times  of TARR  and  PDR.  Students ’   reviews will  include 
evaluations  of  their  student  colleagues,  as  well  as  themselves.    The  format  of  this 
evaluation will be discussed later. 
2. 	 Progress  Presentations:  Throughout  the  term,  several  opportunities  will  exist  for 
informal  presentations  on  either  individual  or  team  progress.    These  presentations will 
be mostly guided  to interface design, ensuring that all sub-systems will be able to come 
together.  They will include both written updates and oral presentations and are listed in 
the  weekly  assignments  schedule  in  Section  5.1.    Each  student  will  give  two  oral 
progress  reports,  at  least  one  of which must  be  an  individual  report.    For  team  reports, 
all  members  of  the  groups  will  be  involved  in  the written  part,  but  individual  students 
will present orally. 
3. 	 Formal presentations:  Each student will present at one of the two formal presentations 
during  the  Spring  of  CY02.    The  formal  presentations  will  be  the  TARR  and  PDR. 
Each  formal  design  review  presentation will  be  accompanied  by  annotated  viewgraphs

provided  electronically  and  in  written  form  by  the  students  to  the  faculty,  staff  and 
GAs.  Each  student ’ s  contribution  to  the  written  presentation  will  be  indicated  by 
initials.  The faculty and staff will grade and the students will hand in critique sheets. 
4. 	 Documentation:  At  the  end  of  the  semester  the  following  documents  should  have 
contributions  from  all  students: Requirements Document  and Design Document.  Each 
student ’ s contribution to the documents will be indicated by initials. 
5. 	 Laboratory  Participation  and  Attendance:   Any  systems  engineering  organization 
depends upon  teamwork  and  access  to  colleagues.  Best  access occurs during class and 
lab  time.    The  Graduate  Assistant  will  take  attendance  and  report  it  to  the  faculty  and 
staff.  Obviously, there may be a class that the student cannot attend.  Contact Professor 
Miller  for  semester-long  conflicts.  Clear  other  conflicts  with  one  of  the  Graduate 
Assistants. 
6. 	 Laboratory Notebooks:  The  notebooks will be kept by each  individual  student  to  fully 
document  all  designs  for  the  project.    Each  lab  session  should  have  an  entry  for  the 
progress  made  during  that  session.  Each  entry  should  not  only  document  the  design, 
but  should  also  explain  its  function  and  operation,  since  this will  lever  down  the work 
on  the  formal  documents.    The  notebooks  will  be  reviewed  three  times  during  the 
semester  by  the  faculty  and  staff.    Each  time  a  grade  will  be  assigned  based  on  the 
correct use of  the lab book (not on the success of the design, since the design process is 
iterative we don ’ t expect a full working solution the first time around). 
7. 	 Design Validation: By  the  end of  the  semester  each  sub-system  should have a working 
design.  This  ‘ prototype’  is  to be tested by  the students to demonstrate how it meets the 
requirements set forth in the Requirements Document.

9.2  CDIO Design Room and Facilities 

The  Design  Studio  is  a  computer  and  laboratory  facility  dedicated  to 

CDIO.    This  room  has  computers,  Internet  access,  software  applications,  presentation 

material,  filing  cabinets,  etc.  All  the  computers  in  the  room  are  identical,  to  provide with 

easy  of  use.  Further,  the  computers  have  been  networked  in  order  to  provide  better 

communication  between  the  teams.  Every  computer  should  have  access  to  all  the 

information at all times, therefore, we ask that all your work always be placed in the shared 
drive.  Make  sure  that  you  fill  in  the  form  passed  around  during  the  first  day  of 
classes, such  that your number will be programmed  in.
 
The laboratory facilities have been assigned to 16.684. Documents, software etc. may be left in
this room throughout the course. The rooms have PCs installed and are usable immediately.

Be  sure  to  contact  the  staff with any questions about  the computers or  the  software 

in  them.  Specifically  the  system  administrator  for  setting  up  your  user  accounts,  class 

accounts,  user  privileges  /  permissions  is  Fred  Donovan.  He  can  also  show  you  how  to 

operate  the  equipment  (projectors,  audio-visuals  etc …

).  Further,  be  sure  to  follow  the 

guidelines  regarding  documents  and  presentations.  Especially, be sure to use the software 

provided in the CDIO room.

Funding 

The  project  has  been  given  to MIT  by  several  outside  companies  and  agencies.  As 

such,  the  project  is  funded.  Yet,  the  funding  is  not  unlimited,  therefore,  careful  studies 

must  be  made  before  purchasing  products.    Once  a  trade  analysis  has  been  made  on  the 

necessary  materials  to  complete  the  project  (Databasing),  then  the  students  should  contact 

Paul  Bauer  in  order  to  initiate  procurement.    He  will  then  review  the 

proposals  together  with  the  rest  of  the  staff,  and  a  purchase  order  will  be  obtained  if  the 

proposal is approved.
