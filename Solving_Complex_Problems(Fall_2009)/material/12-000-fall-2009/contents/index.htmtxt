***** Course Description *****
12.000 Solving Complex Problemsis designed to provide students the opportunity
to work as part of a team to propose solutions to a complex problem that
requires an interdisciplinary approach. For the students of the class of 2013,
12.000 will revolve around the issues associated with what we can and must do
about the steadily increasing amounts CO2 in Earthâs atmosphere.
Each year's class explores a different problem in detail through the study of
complementary case histories and the development of creative solution
strategies. It includes training in Web site development, effective written and
oral communication, and team building. Initially developed with major financial
support from the d'Arbeloff_Fund_for_Excellence_in_Education, 12.000 is
designed to enhance the freshman experience by helping students develop
contexts for other subjects in the sciences and humanities, and by helping them
to establish learning communities that include upperclassmen, faculty, MIT
alumni, and professionals in science and engineering fields.
