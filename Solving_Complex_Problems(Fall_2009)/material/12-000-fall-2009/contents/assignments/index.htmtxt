***** Mission 2013 Travel Blog *****
During spring break, students traveled to Abu Dhabi to explore the world's
first carbon-neutral city. The trip was supported by the Massiah_Foundation.
Students reflected on their experiences in the Mission_2013_Travel_Blog.
***** Description of Assignments *****
**** Overview ****
In our second class, we will divide the class into approximately ten teams.
Each team will develop a proposal in the form of a Team Wiki. This work, which
is best considered the "research phase" of 12.000, is expected to be complete
by early November. Subsequently, the class will discuss the various proposals
and decide on the basic structure of a final plan.
Each team will be assigned one or two undergraduate teaching fellows (UTFs) and
one or more Alumni Mentors to serve as information resources. The UTFs, most of
whom are veterans of 12.000, can give you tips on how best to work toward a
successful conclusion. The Alumni Mentors can provide more general suggestions
as to how they tackled complex problems like those posed in Mission 2012. An
important aspect of 12.000 is its emphasis on teamwork. Consequently, 70
percent of your grade depends on the performance of your team and the class as
a whole, whereas the remaining 30 percent comes from your individual
performance.
**** Major Assignments ****
The challenges presented to the class will be fulfilled when two assignments
are completed.
First, the class must create a content-rich Web site to describe and justify
its overall design. More information about the Web site and supporting wikis
can_be_found_here.
Second, the class will make a final, one-two hour, oral presentation of its
solution in early December. This presentation will be open to the entire MIT
community. In addition, a panel of experts will be invited to attend the
presentation and to critique them in an open forum. Because it would be
logistically difficult for everyone to speak during the presentation, the staff
recommends that each team elect one member to join a presentation committee
that will choreograph the final presentation. The committee member should not
bear sole responsibility for the work involved in developing the presentation!
**** Individual Grade Component ****
Thirty percent of your grade reflects how well you, as an individual, met the
expectations of the teaching staff over the course of the semester. They expect
that you will:
    * attend all scheduled meetings;
    * arrive promptly for all meetings;
    * collaborate with other members of your team;
    * contribute to Team Wiki development and final presentations;
    * participate in the Case Study discussions; and
    * treat others and their ideas with respect.
