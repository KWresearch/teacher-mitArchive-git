Terrascope – Guiding Principles 


•	

•	

•	

•	

The Earth system provides a context for learning basic science 
and engineering concepts 

Students put those concepts to use in creative ways to 
understand the interdependency of physical, chemical, and 
biological processes that shape our planet 

Students explore how these concepts may be used to design 
protocols to ensure a sustainable environment 

Program emphasizes both theory and practice, and puts a 
premium on active learning 

Terrascope – Structure


First Semester 

•  Solving Complex Problems--Mission 2xxx 

Second Semester 

•  1.016 
•  Terrascope Field Experience (Spring Break) 

•  Terrascope Radio 

Solving Complex Problems


•	 Multidisciplinary, project-based learning experience 

•	

Students work toward a solution to a deceptively simple 
problem related to Earth’s environment 

•	 Each year’s theme is different and referred to as “Mission 
XXXX”, where XXXX refers to the graduation year of 
the class involved 

Solving Complex Problems--Motivation


• To build  	in you the capacity to tackle the “big” 
problems that confront society 

• To encourage you to take charge of the learning 
process 

• To show you how to do independent 
research, to evaluate the quality of information 
sources, and to synthesize different information 
streams 

Solving Complex Problems--Motivation


•  To encourage you to think about optimal solutions 
rather than correct solutions 

•	 To help you learn how to work effectively as 
part of a team 

• To improve your communication skills using two 
media: the web site and the formal oral 
presentation 

• To convince you of your potential!! 

Past Missions


•	 Develop a viable plan for the exploration of Mars with the 
aim of finding evidence for life 

•	 Design permanent, manned, underwater research 
laboratories and develop detailed research plans for the 
first six months of their operation 

•	 Design the most environmentally sensitive strategy for 
hydrocarbon resource extraction from the Arctic National 
Wildlife Refuge and determine whether or not the value 
of the resource exceeds its financial and environmental 
cost 

Past Missions


•	 To develop strategies for developing countries in the 
Pacific basin to cope with tsunami hazards and disasters. 
Due to the unique needs of each country, we specifically 
focused on developing plans for Peru and Micronesia. 

•	 To develop a plan for the reconstruction of New Orleans 
and the management of the Mississippi River and the Gulf 
coast. The reconstruction of New Orleans and the 
management of the Mississippi River and the Gulf coast. 

Past Missions


•	 To develop strategies to deal with the collapse of the 
global fisheries and the general health of the oceans 

•	 To develop a plan to ensure the availability of fresh clean 
water for western North America for the next 100 years. 

Subject Structure


Problem divided into approximately ten tasks; students 
divided into teams 

Each team assigned a Teaching Fellow, Alumni Mentors, 
and Disciplinary Mentors 

Four meeting styles: 

• 
Presentations on methodology 
•  Case-study discussions 
•  Team workshops 
•  Coordination meetings 

Subject Deliverables


•	 Each student develops a personal wiki 

•	 Each team will communicate through wiki-based structure 


¾	 Each class describes and justifies its overall plan in a web 
site 

¾	 Each class explains the design in a two-hour presentation 
before a panel of experts and a general audience

Mission 2013


Your Mission is to propose an integrated global 
solution to the rapid rise in atmospheric CO2  that 
will stabilize concentrations at an economically 
viable and internationally acceptable level.

Mission 2013


Humans depend on the consumption of 
massive amounts of fossil fuels that in 
turn pump large amounts of greenhouse 
gases into the atmosphere. 

Mission 2013


Increased CO2  may lead to mean global temperatures that 
will destabilize ice sheets, raise sea-level, and decrease pH 
of seawater. 

All of these could disrupt life as we know it for billions of 
people. 

Mission 2013


If we continue to consume fossil fuels at 
current rate for next 300 years we will 
have levels of CO2  not attained for the 
past 55 million years! 

CO2 Sequestration

•Burial in spent petroleum reservoirs 

•Burial in saline aquifers 

•Disposal in Basalt 

•Disposal in deep ocean 

•Disposal in lakes beneath ice caps 

•Mineralization of Magnesium-rich rocks


•Disposal in seafloor basalts 

Global Gardening

•Plant an area the size of France and Germany 
•Plant biomass eg., timber 
•Allow a quarter century of growth 

This volume and timescale could return 

atmosphere to pre-industrial CO2  levels


Vision: “...an array of plantations supplying commodities such as energy 
and timber, as well as a livelihood for countless communities.” 

Criticism: Some scientists question whether biomass planting on this scale is 
“…a dream or a nightmare…” 

Questions remain surrounding crop choice and productivity, 
implementation, and land use

Locations of deep saline formations 
Known stationary CO2  sources 
•Sequester from 920-3400 billion 
•Blue = electricity generation 
tonnes of CO2 
•Orange = cement manufacturing 
•Existing oil and gas reservoirs and 
•Red = petroleum and natural gas 
Unminable coal seams 
processing 
•82 and 184 billion tonnes 

But--”..turning saline formations from dream reservoir to sequestration reality remains a challenge.”


Coral Calcification


•Reef-building corals are under physiological stress 
•Changing climate and increased ocean absorption  

of atmospheric CO2

•Great Barrier Reef corals show decline in growth 
•Calcification decrease of 14.2% since 1990 
•Linear growth down 13.3% 

•Unprecedented in last 400 years 

•Calcification increases with increasing (overall) sea 
surface temperature 

Cause of decline is unknown 
Possibly increased temperature stress and/or declining 
aragonite saturation in seawater

Important Questions to Address

•  Is there an acceptable, economically viable
level of CO2 that we should attain in the next 
several decades? 
Can we make reduction of greenhouse
gases a matter of international
consensus without stopping economic
development? 

•  Should we consider an Actinide based energy
future as a replacement for Carbon based
energy? 

Important Questions to Address


• How do we sequester large amounts of
CO2  in geologically stable (104->106 
years) locations? 

• Can we extract CO2  from the 
atmosphere as well as capture it at the
point of production? 

• What are the consequences of doing
nothing? 

Class Structure 


We will present possible team topics and allow you to “self-organize” 

•	 Each of you will be assigned to a team, and each team will be assigned 
at least one upperclass teaching fellow (UTF), a library liaison, and 
multiple alumni mentors 

•	 Each team will be responsible for proposing to the class one or more 
options for its assigned part of the solution 

•	 Teams will work independently and will be responsible for their own 
solutions, although mentors and volunteer faculty resources may be 
called upon as “sounding boards”. 

First Assignment (Due Friday by noon)


•	 What are coal and petroleum made from? 
• How much CO2  is produced by burning a ton of 
coal? 
•	 Where and how is the electricity generated that 
you use at home? 
•  Is there a relationship between human activities, 

CO2  concentrations and global temperature?
