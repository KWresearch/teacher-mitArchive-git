***** Course Description *****
12.000 Solving Complex Problems is designed to provide students the opportunity
to work as part of a team to propose solutions to a complex problem that
requires an interdisciplinary approach. For the students of the class of 2013,
12.000 will revolve around the issues associated with what we can and must do
about the steadily increasing amounts CO2in Earth's atmosphere.
In this class, students will be tasked with solving the large and complex
problems necessary to sequester enough carbon to stop the steady increase of
atmospheric CO2 and to stabilize it. While reducing or eliminating greenhouse
gas emissions is a good strategy that must be pursued, it will not be enough
and we must also find ways of removing CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering
it in geologically stable reservoirs. There are many possible ways to sequester
CO2, including storing in porous rock formations, the deep ocean, forests and
soils, and precipitating carbonate minerals to name a few. However, the
capture, transport, and sequestration of CO2 will be logistically complex,
incredibly expensive, and require unprecedented international cooperation.
Your Mission is to propose an integrated global solution to the rapid rise in
atmospheric CO2 that will stabilize concentrations at an economically viable
and internationally acceptable level. Mission 2013 will focus on the issues
associated managing our planet's atmosphere. Attempting to control the
concentrations of greenhouse gases is an enormous, complex problem that will
require a major interdisciplinary, international, innovative effort unlike
anything ever attempted in human history.

***** Course Structure *****
Other than the initial introductory meeting, there are five different meeting
types:
   1. Information Sessions are special meetings of the entire class to learn
      about research techniques, teamwork strategies, and presentation skills.
   2. Case Study Sessions provide an opportunity for the class to discuss
      various aspects of carbon sequestration.
   3. Team Meetings are weekly opportunities for teams to brainstorm in
      independent work sessions.
   4. Coordination Meetings are whole-section meetings designed to enable the
      coordination of team design strategies in advance of the final section
      solutions.
   5. Freeform Sessions are formal meetings of special interest groups that
      develop as the semester progresses.
***** About 12.000 *****
12.000 Solving Complex Problems is a nine-unit, Fall-semester subject designed
to provide freshmen with the opportunity to work as part of an "imagineering"
team to design a viable solution to a complex problem that requires an
interdisciplinary approach.
Each year's class explores a different problem in detail through the study of
complementary case histories and the development of creative solution
strategies. The course includes training in Web site development, effective
written and oral communication, and team building. Initially developed with
major financial support from the d'Arbeloff_Fund_for_Excellence_in_Education,
12.000 is designed to enhance the freshman experience by helping students
develop contexts for other subjects in the sciences and humanities, and by
helping them to establish learning communities that include upperclassmen,
faculty, MIT alumni, and professionals in science and engineering fields.
***** Why Mission? *****
The Mission class offers freshmen a completely different way to learn. In
contrast to the core classes that rely on lectures and problem sets, Mission
attempts to teach students how to think about solving complex problems.
Students in Mission are independent, largely self-directed, and interactive.
They learn how to build teams and develop solutions that require teamwork
between scientists and engineers. Mission students will learn that many
problems are just too big and complex to be solved by any one person or
discipline and must involve integration. At the end of the class, the students
of Mission will have developed new and innovative solutions to an "unsolvable"
problem and been exposed to a variety of different disciplines.
