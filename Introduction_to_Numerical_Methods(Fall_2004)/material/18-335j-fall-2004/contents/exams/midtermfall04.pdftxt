In  all  problems,  all  matrices   are  real  and  square  and  all  vectors  are  real. 

1.  (5  points)  Assume   (do  not  prove  here) 
�x�∞  ≤ �x�2  ≤ √
Show  that  for  any  matrix   A


x�∞ ,  for  all  x  ∈ Rn  .
n�


�A�∞  ≤ √
2.  (5  points)  Let  A  be  symmetric  positive  deﬁnite  matrix  with  Cholesky  factor  C ,  i.e.  A  =  C T  C . 
Show  that  �A�2  = 
�C �
2  and  that  κ2 (A) = (κ2 (C ))2 ,  where  κ2 (X ) is  the  condition  number  of 
2
� 
the  matrix  X  measured  in  the  two­norm. 
j=i   |aj i | for  all  i. 
3.  A  matrix  A  is  called  strictly  column  diagonally  dominant  if  aii | > 
|

n�A�2  ≤ n�A�∞ . 

(a)  (5  points)  Show  that  such  an  A  is   nonsingular. 
(b)  (5  points)  Show  that  no  pivoting  is  needed  when   computing  A  =  LU  .  In  other  words, 
if  we  did  do  partial  pivoting   to  compute  P A  =  LU  ,  P  a  permutation  matrix,   then  we 
would  get  P  =  I .  Hint:  Show  that  after  one  step  of   Gaussian  elimination,  the  bottom 
right  n  − 1  by  n  − 1 submatrix  is   also  strictly  column  diagonally  dominant. 
4.  (5   points)  Let  A  be  skew   Hermitian,   i.e.  A∗  =  −A.  Prove   that  the  eigenvalues  of   A  are  purely 
imaginary  and  that  I  − A  is  nonsingular. 
5.  (5   points)  Let  � · � be  an  operator  norm.  Prove  that  if  �A� <  1  then  I  − A  is  invertible.  
6.  (5  points)  Let  x  = (1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,   7)T  and  y  = (−7.5,  2,  −4,   −4,   2,   3,   0.5)T  .  In  double  precision 
IEEE  binary  ﬂoating  point  arithmetic,  true  or   false: 

Explain. 

Tﬂ(x y) = 0?
