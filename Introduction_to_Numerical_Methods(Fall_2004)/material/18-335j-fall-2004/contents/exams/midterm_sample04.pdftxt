1.  (5   points)  Let  A  be  real  symmetric  and  positive  semideﬁnite,  i.e.  xT  Ax  ≥  0  for  all  x  =  0. 
Show  that  if  the  diagonal  of  A  is   zero,   then  A  is  zero.

that  the  eigenvalues  of  T  are  real  (5  points)  and  distinct  (5  points).

Hint:   Find  a  diagonal  matrix  D  such  that  C  =  DT D−1  is   symmetric.  Then  argue  about  the

rank  of  C  − λI .
