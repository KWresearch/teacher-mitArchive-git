Homework: 9 
 

Due December 1.  

1.  A is a square matrix of size 19,000. All entries of A are zero except for the 
primes 2,3,5,7,...,212369 along the main diagonal and the number 1 in all 
the positions aij with |i-j|=1,2,4,8,...,16384. Compute the (1,1) entry of A-1.  
Solution: See this website, and problem 7 (and its solution) there.  
2.  The 200-by-200 (diagonally dominant) matrix A has offdiagonal entries -
1/i-1/j and row sums s(i)=sum(A(i,:))=22i. Compute the smallest in 
magnitude eigenvalue of A. (Hint: The diagonal entries A(i,i) can then be 
computed as sum of positive (why?) numbers, thus to high relative 
accuracy. Abandoning the row sums s(i), however, robs you of any chance 
of computing the smallest eigenvalue accurately). You will encounter no 
(true) subtractions when running Gaussian elimination, obtaining the LU 
decomposition of A to high relative accuracy componentwise. Using the 
LU factors to compute the inverse of A one column at a time will not 
result in any subtractions either, yielding a positive A-1.)  
Solution: mmatinverse.pdf, hw6.m, InverseMM.m.
