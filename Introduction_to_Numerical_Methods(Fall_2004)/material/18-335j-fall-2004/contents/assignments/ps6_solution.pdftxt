6.1 Let A be skew Hermitian, i.e. A(cid:3)= (cid:0)A. Show that (I (cid:0) A)(cid:0)1 (I + A)
is unitary.
See solutions for the (cid:133)rst Homework, problem 2.

6.2 Trefethen 25.1
(a) Let (cid:21) be an eigenvalue of A: Therefore B = A (cid:0) (cid:21)I is singular and hence
rank(A (cid:0) (cid:21)I ) (cid:20) m (cid:0) 1
The m (cid:0) 1 (cid:2) m submatrix B2:m;1:m is upper triangular whose diagonal
entries are non-zero by our assumptions on A: Hence B2:m;1:m has m (cid:0) 1
linearly independent columns which implies

rank(B2:m;1:m ) = m (cid:0) 1
Therefore we must also have rank(A(cid:0)(cid:21)I ) = m(cid:0)1; and hence the null space
of B is spanned by one vector, a unique eigenvector of A correspoding to (cid:21):
Since A is Hermitian, which requires m linearly independent eigenvectors,
all (cid:21) must be distinct.
(b) (cid:18)0 0
1 0(cid:19)
