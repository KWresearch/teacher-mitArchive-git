Homework: 7 

Due November 17.  

1.	 Compute the smallest eigenvalue of the 100-by-100 Hilbert matrix 
H=1/(i+j-1). (Hint: The Hilbert matrix is also Cauchy. The determinant of 
a Cauchy matrix C(i,j)=1/(xi+yj) is 
det C = [\prodi< j(xj-xi)(yj-yi)]/ [\prodi,j(xi+yj)]. 
Any submatrix of a Cauchy matrix is also Cauchy. You can use Cramer's 
rule in order to compute accurate formulas for H-1 and then compute its 
largest eigenvalue. 
2.	 Trefethen 30.2
