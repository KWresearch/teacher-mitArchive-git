Due: September 29. 

1.	 Count the number of floating point operations required to compute the QR 
decomposition of an m-by-n matrix using (a) Householder reflectors (b) 
Givens rotations. 
2.	 Trefethen 5.4 
If A=R+uv*, where R is upper triangular matrix and u and v are (column) 
3.	
vectors, describe an algorithm to compute the QR decomposition of A in 
O(n2) time.  
4.	 Given the SVD of A, compute the SVD of (A*A)-1, (A*A)-1A*, A(A*A)-1, 
A(A*A)-1A* in terms of U, Sigma and V.
