Ax  =  λx  ⇔  (A  −  λI )x  = 0  ⇔  det(A  −  λI )  = 0  

(9.4) 

Deﬁnition:  P (λ)  =  det(A  −  λI ).  P  is  a  polynomial  of  degree   n. 
Algebraic  multiplicity  as  a  root  of  P  and  geometric  multiplicity  equals  to  the   number  of  linearly  
independent  eigenvectors  corresp onding  to  λ. 
Theorem:  A  and  X −1AX  have  the  same  characteristic  polynomial,  eigenvalues,  algebraic  and 
geometric  multiplicities. 
Proof:  P (X −1AX ):  OK.  If  Eλ  eigenspace  of  A  then  X −1Eλ  is  an  eigenspace  for  X −1AX . 
Defective  eigenvalue  algebraic   multiplicity  and  geometric  multiplicity. 
A  matrix  is  called  diagonalizable  if  it   has  an  eigenvalue  decomposition  A  =  X ΛX −1 ,  where  Λ  is 
diagonal. 
Unitarily  diagonalizable: 

happens  when  A  is  normal,  i.e., 

A  =  QΛQ ∗
