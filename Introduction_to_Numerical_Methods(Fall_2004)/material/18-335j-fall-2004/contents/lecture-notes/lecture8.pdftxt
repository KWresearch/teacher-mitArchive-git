7.1  Accuracy  

Problem:  Compute  f (x)  given  x.  Result  in  ﬂoating  point  arithmetic  f˜(x). 
Deﬁnition:  An  algorithm   is  accurate   if 
� � � 
� ˜�f ( ) −  f ( )
x
x
� 
�f (x)�

Usually  too  much   to   ask  if  f  is  ill  conditioned.


=  O(�machine ) 

7.2  Stability 

An   algorithm   f˜ for  a  problem  f  is  stable  if  for  all  x

f˜(x) −  f ( ˜x) 

�f ( ˜x)� 

=  O(�machine ) 

For  some   ˜x  such  that: 

Stable   algorithm   gives  almost  the  right   answer  to  nearly  the  right  question.

=  O(�machine ) 

7.3  Backward  Stability 

Satisﬁed  by  most   algorithms  in  this  course. 
Deﬁnition:  f  is  backward  stable  if 

f˜(x)  =  f ( ˜x), 

with

7.4.  MEANING  OF   O(�MACHINE ) 

19  

A  backward  stable   algorithm  gives  the  right  answer  to  nearly  the  right  question. 

7.4  Meaning  of  O(�machine) 
Converges  to  0   linearly  with  �machine  as  �machine  → 0. 
In  practice  O(�machine )  means  ≤ C · �machine ,  where  C  is  a  low  order  polynomial  in  the  size  of  
the  problem.  If  solving  Ax  =  b,  size(A)  = [m, n]. 
Usually  O(�machine )  means  100�,  1000�. 

7.5  Stability  of  Floating  Point

α  =  x1 y1 

˜α  =  x1 y1 (1  +  δ1 ) 

|δ1 | ≤ �machine

˜α  is  the  exact  answer  for  slightly  perturbed  data  x1 (1  +  δ1 )  and  y1 .
