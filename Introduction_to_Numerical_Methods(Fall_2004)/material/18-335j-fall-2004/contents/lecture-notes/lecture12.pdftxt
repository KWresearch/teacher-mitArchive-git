Always  backward  stable. 
A  matrix  A  is  symmetric  positive  deﬁnite  (s.p.d.)  if  it  is  symmetric  (AT  =  A), 

x T  Ax  ≥  0 

for  every  x,  and  x T  Ax  =  0  only  when  x  =  0 

(8.73) 

If  A  is  s.p.d.  then  all  eigenvalues  of  A  are positive  and  all  leading  principal  minors   A(1  :  k , 1  : 
k)  >  0,  k  = 1, 2, .  .  .  , n. 
Let 

be  the  LDU  decomposition   of  an  s.p.d.  matrix  A.  Then 

A  =  LDU  

U T  DT  LT  =  U T  DLT  =  AT  =  A  =  LDU. 

(8.74) 

(8.75) 

Since  U T  and  LT  are  unit   lower  and  upper  triangular   matrices  respectively,  we  obtain  two   LDU 
decompositions  of  A:

and  

A  =  U T  DLT  , 

A  =  LDU. 

These  decompositions  are  the  same,  therefore  U T  =  L.  Finally, 

A  =  LDLT  .

We  can  also  write  A  =  LDLT  = (LD1/2 )(D1/2LT  ) =   CC T  ,  where  C  =  LD1/2  is  lower  triangular 
det  A(1:k,1:k)
(all   elements   of  D,  di  =  det  A(1:k−1,1:k−1)  >  0,  so  we  can  safely form  D1/2 ). 
Deﬁnition:  The  decomposition  

A  =  CC T 

(8.79) 

of  an  s.p.d.  matrix  as  a  product  of  a  nonsingular  lower  triangular  matrix  and  its  transpose  is  called 
Cholesky  decomposition. 
Theorem:  A  matrix  A  is  s.p.d.  if  and  only  if  it  has  a  Cholesky  decomposition. 
Proof:  If   A  is  s.p.d.  then  it  has   a  Cholesky  decomposition  as   we  described  above. 
If  A  =  CC T  ,  where  C  is  nonsingular,  let  y  =  C T  x,  then

x T  Ax  =  x T  CC T  x  = (C T  x)T  C T  x  =  y y   =  y1  +  y2  +  · · ·  +  y  ≥ 0

with   equality  only   when   y  = 0,  i.e.,  only  when  x  = 0  (since  y  =  C T  x,  and  C T  is  nonsingular).
