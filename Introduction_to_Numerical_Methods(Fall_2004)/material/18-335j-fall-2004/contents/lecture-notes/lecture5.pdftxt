4.1  Householder  reﬂectors  

Example: 
∗
∗
∗ 
Find  H  :  H x  =  ce1 ,  |c|  =  �x�2 .  Pick  H  =  I  −  2uu  ,  �u�2  =  1.  Then:  H  =  H and  HH =  I , 
Hermitian   unitary  matrix

Px = ||x||  e2  1 

Figure  4.1:  Householder  Reﬂectors.  

u  = ? 

H  ·  x  =  x  −  2u(u T  x) =  c  ·  e1 

therefore,  u  is  parallel  to  x  −  ce1  (and  is   also  of  unit  length  by  default). 

which  choice  of  C  makes  most   sense? 

u  = 

x  −  C e1 
�x�2 

v 
therefore,  since  u  =  �v

C  =  −sign(x1 )e1  �x�

Applying  a  Householder:  (I  − 2uuT  )A.  Naive   implementation  costs  2n3  .  Instead:  A − 2u(uT  A). 
Matrix-vector   (2n2 ),  outer  product  (2n),  and  subtract  (2n
