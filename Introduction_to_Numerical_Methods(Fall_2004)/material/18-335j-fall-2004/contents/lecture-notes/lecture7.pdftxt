•  Floating  point   rounding   operator 

∀x  ∈ R, ∃�, |�| ≤ �machine :  f l(x) =  x(1  +  �) 

(6.10) 

The  distance between   x  and  the  closest  ﬂoating  point  number   is   less  than  �machine ,  i.e.,  less 
than  1 
2 unit  in  last  place. 

•  For  all  practical  purposes  we  say   that  the  result  of  any  ﬂoating  point  operation  conforms  to: 

f l(x � y)  = (x � y)(1  +  δ)
