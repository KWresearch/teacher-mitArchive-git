1.5  Vector  Norms 

Deﬁnition:  A  norm   k·k is  a  function  from  Cn  into  R  such  that: 

1.  kxk ≥ 0,  kxk = 0  ⇔ x  = 0 

2.  kx   +  yk ≤ kxk +  kyk 

3.  kαxk =  |α| · kxk 

Example  1:  1,  2,  ∞ norms:

1.6  Matrix  Norms  

Same  as  vector  norms,  functions  from  Cn×n  into  R,  satisfying: 

1.  kAk ≥ 0 

2.  kA  +  B k ≤ kAk +  kBk 

3.  kαAk =  |α| · kAk 

Some  matrix  norms  are  more  useful:  Induced  Matrix  Norms 

kAk = supx

= supkxk=1  kAxk

They  satisfy   kABk ≤ kAk · kB k,  which  is  not  satisﬁed  by  all  matrix  norms,  but  it  is  by  the  ones 
induced   by  vector  norms   and   the  Frobenius  norm:

Invariance  under  Unitary  Multiplication 

∗
Proposition:  If  Q  is  unitary  (Q Q  =  I ),  then 

and  

kQAk2  =  kAk2 

kQAkF  =  kAkF  . 

Proof:  Let   x:  kQAxk2  =  kQAk2 

kQAk2  =  kQ(Ax)k =  kAxk2  ≤ kAk2 
2 

Also  if  y :  kAyk =  kAk,  then 
2 

kAk2  =  kAyk =  kQAyk ≤ kQAk2

thus 

kAk2  =  kQAk2  .
