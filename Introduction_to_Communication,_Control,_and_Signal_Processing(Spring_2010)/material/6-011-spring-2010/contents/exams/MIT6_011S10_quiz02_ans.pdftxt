Problem  1  (6  points) 

For  each  of  the  following  statements,  specify  whether  the  statement  is  true  or  false  and 
give  a  brief  (at  most  a  few  lines)  justiﬁcation  or  counterexample. 

(1a)  (1.5  points)  If  X  and  Y  are  independent  random  variables,  the  unconstrained  MMSE 
estimator  Y�  of  Y  given  X  = x  is  Y�  = μY  . 

(1b)  (1.5  points) The  following  random  process  is  strict  sense  stationary:  x(t) = A where A  is 
a  continuous  random  variable  with  a  pdf  uniform  between  ±1. 

(1c)  (1.5  points)  The  following  random  process  is  ergodic  in  the mean:  x(t) = A  where A  is  a 
continuous  random  variable  with  a  pdf  uniform  between  ±1. 

(1d)  (1.5  points)  If  the  input  to  a  stable  LTI  system  is WSS  then  the  output  is  guaranteed  to

Problem  2  (15  points) 

Suppose  x(t) and  v(t)  are  two  independent  WSS  random  processes  with  autocorrelation 
functions  respectively  Rxx(τ ) and  Rvv (τ ). 

(2a)  (3 points) Using x(t) and v(t), show how you would construct a random process g(t) whose 
autocorrelation  function  Rgg (τ )  is  that  shown  in  Eq.  (2.1).  Be  sure  to  demonstrate 
that  the  resulting  process  g(t)  has  the  desired  autocorrelation  function. 

Rgg (τ ) = Rxx (τ )Rvv (τ ) 

(2.1) 

g(t) =

For  the  remainder  of  this  problem  assume  that  Rxx (τ ) and  Rvv (τ ) are  known to be 

Rvv (τ ) = e −3|τ | 
You  can  also  invoke  the  Fourier  transform  identity 

−|τ | 
Rxx (τ ) = 2e

e −β |τ |  ⇐⇒

β 2  + ω2

(2.3)

(2b)  (6  points)  Let  w(t)  denote  a  third  WSS  random  process  with  autocorrelation  function 
Rww (τ ) =  δ(τ ).  Suppose  w(t)  is  the  input  to  a  ﬁrst-order,  stable,  causal  LTI  system  for 
which  the  linear  constant  coeﬃcient  diﬀerential  equation  is 

dx(t) 
dt 

+ ax(t) = bw(t) 

(2.4) 

Determine  the  values  of  a  and  b  so  that  the  autocorrelation  of  the  output  x(t) is  Rxx(τ ) 
as  given  in  Eq.  (2.2). 

a = 

b =

(2c)  (6  points)  Is  it  possible  to  have  a  WSS  process  z (t)  whose  autocorrelation  function 
Rzz (τ ) =  Rxx (τ )  ∗ Rvv (τ ),  i.e.,  Rzz (τ )  is  the  result  of  convolving  the  autocorrelation 
functions Rxx (τ ) and Rvv (τ )  given  in Eq.  (2.2)?  If no, why not?  If yes,  show how  to  gen­
erate  z (t)  starting  from a WSS process w(t) with autocorrelation  function Rww (τ ) = δ(τ ) 
(you  can  perform  any  necessary  causal  LTI  ﬁltering  operations). 

z (t) =

Figure  3.1 

The process s[n] is transmitted  through a communication  channel  that  introduces noise and 
a  one-step  delay.  The  received  process  r [n]  is  related  to  s[n]  as  indicated  by  Eq.  (3.1).  The 
noise  process  w[n]  has  zero  mean,  autocovariance  function  Cww [m] = 3δ [m].  Furthermore,  the 
noise  process  w[·]  is  uncorrelated  with  the  process  s[·]. 

We  wish  to  design  an  estimator  s�[n] for  s[n].  Throughout  this  problem  the  ob jective  is  to 
choose  the  parameters  in  the  estimator  to minimize  the  mean  squared  error  E  deﬁned  as 

r [n] = s[n − 1] + w[n]

Figure  4.1 

D/A  converters  utilizing  oversampled  noise  shaping  often  use  the  structure  in  Figure  4.1  to 
quantize the output sequence to a 1-bit bitstream for which D/A conversion  is then very simple. 
Its  eﬀectiveness  assumes  that  x[n]  is  highly  oversampled  and  that most  of  the  error  introduced 
by  the  quantizer  falls  outside  the  signal  band. 
In  Figure  4.1  the  quantizer  error  is  modeled  as  an  additive,  zero  mean  i.i.d  sequence  e[n] 
that  is  uniformly  distributed  in  amplitude  between  ± (cid:2)  at  each  time  instant  n. Furthermore, 
2 
e[n] and  x[n]  are  assumed  to  be  independent.  The  input  x[n]  has  mean  μx  =  0  and  variance 
2  =  1.  Moreover,  the  input  x[n]  is  bandlimited,  i.e.,  the  power  spectral  density  Sxx(ejΩ ) is 
σx 
zero  for  π 
2  < |Ω| < π . 
The  output  y [n]  is  composed  of  two  components:  yx [n]  due  solely  to  x[n],  and  ye [n]  due 
solely  to  e[n].  Similarly,  w[n] =  wx [n] + we [n].  Note  that  the  transfer  function  from  x[n] to

yx [n]  is  unity,  and  the  transfer  function  from  e[n] to  ye [n] is  (1 − az−1 ).
