This  quiz  is  closed  book,  but  two  sheet  of  notes  are  allowed.  Calculators  will  not  be 
necessary  and  are  not  allowed. 

Check  that  this  ANSWER  BOOKLET  has  pages  numbered  up  to  14.  The  booklet 
contains  spaces  for  all  relevant  reasoning  and  answers. 

Neat work and clear explanations count;  show all relevant work and reasoning! 
You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  on  scratch  paper  and  then  neatly  transfer  to 
this  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need  additional 
scratch  paper.  Only  this  booklet  will  be  considered  in  the  grading;  no  additional  an­
swer  or  solution  written  elsewhere  will  be  considered.  Absolutely  no  exceptions! 

There  are  4  problems,  weighted  as  shown.  (The  points  indicated  on  the  following 
pages  for  the  various  subparts  of  the  problems  are  our  best  guess  for  now,  but  may  be 
modiﬁed  slightly  when  we  get  to  grading.)

4(d)  (4  points) When  the  initial  state  of  the  system  is  at  zero,  i.e.,  when  q(0) = 0,  and  when 
the  input  for  t ≥ 0  is  x(t) = 5e−t ,  the  output  y(t)  of  the  system  for  t ≥ 0  is 
y(t) = e 3t  − e−2t  .

new  external  input.  Write  down  the  resulting  state-space  model,  with  input  p(t),  state 
vector  q(t),  and  output  y(t).  You  need  to  show  the  model  in  detail,  making  explicit  the
