Problem  1  (5  points) 

Consider  the  discrete-time  LTI  ﬁlter  speciﬁed  by  its  frequency  response 
H (ejΩ ) = exp{−j (60Ω + 25Ω3 )}
 

for  |Ω| < π .
 
Determine  the  following  properties  of  the  ﬁlter  frequency  response  for  all  |Ω| < π :
 
(a)  (1  point)  its magnitude,  |H (ejΩ )|; 
(b)  (1  point)  its  phase,  ∠H (ejΩ ); 

(c)  (1  point)  its  group  delay,  τg (Ω).
 

Finally,
 

(d)  (2 points) determine which one of the following plots (labeled A, B, C, D, E) is the impulse 
response  h[n]  of  this  ﬁlter;  list  two  diﬀerent  features  of  the  chosen  response  that  support 
your choice.  (Adjacent values of h[n] are connected by straight lines in the attached plots, 
for  ease  of  visualization.)

(c)  (2 points) Keeping in mind your answer to (b), explicitly write down an expression for one 
possible  signal  x(t)  that  has  the  deterministic  autocorrelation  function  Rxx (τ )  speciﬁed 
above.  Be  sure  to  explain  your  reasoning! 
(d)  (2  points) Your  answer  in  (c)  is  not  unique;  for  example,  the  signal −x(t) would  have  the 
same  deterministic  autocorrelation  function.  Describe  precisely  the  relation  –  in  either 
the  time  domain  or  the  frequency  domain  –  between  any  other  (correct  but  otherwise 
arbitrary)  answer  to  (c)  and  the  speciﬁc  one  you  have  written  down  in  (c). 

(e)  (3 points) Suppose the x(t) above  is the  input to an  ideal  lowpass ﬁlter that has gain 1 for 
frequencies ω  satisfying |ω | < 1, and gain 0 elsewhere.  Denoting the corresponding output 
of  the  ﬁlter  by  y(t),  determine  its  energy  spectral  density  S yy (jω) —  draw  a  careful  and 
fully  labeled  sketch!  —  and  also  compute  the  energy  Ey  of  y(t).

Problem  3  (10  points) 

The  ﬁrst  ﬁgure  below  shows  our  standard  conﬁguration  for  DT  processing  of  a  CT  signal 
xc (t)  to  produce  a  CT  signal  yc (t).  Here  T  as  usual  denotes  the  sampling  and  reconstruction 
interval,  and  the  D/C  converter  implements  an  ideal  bandlimited  interpolation.  The  second 
ﬁgure  displays  the  frequency  response  of  the  DT  ﬁlter,  which  is  an  ideal  lowpass  ﬁlter.

Suppose  the  CT  input  xc (t)  is  chosen  to  be 

xc (t) = sin(2πf1 t)  , 

where  f1  = 1300  Hz. 

(a)  (1  point) What minimum  value  does  the  sampling  frequency  1/T  have  to  exceed  in  order 
to  avoid  aliasing  at  the  C/D  converter,  for  this  signal? 

For each of the following parts,  fully specify what the output yc (t) is for the indicated choice 
of  the  sampling/reconstruction  frequency  1/T . 

(b)  (3  points)  1/T  = 8000  Hz.

y(t) = [ 1  1 ] q(t) . 
(a)  (3  points)  Determine  the  natural  frequencies  (or  eigenvalues)  λ1  and  λ2  of  the  system, 
and the associated eigenvectors v1  and v2  respectively.  (Compute these careful ly, because 
errors will propagate, and you will lose signiﬁcant points!  You should check that what you 
claim  is  an  eigenvalue/eigenvector  pair  does  indeed  satisfy  the  deﬁning  matrix  equation 
for  such  a  pair.) 

(b)  (1  point)  Is  the  system  asymptotically  stable? 

(c)  (3 points) Determine  the  transfer  function H (s) of  the  system.  What  feature of  this H (s) 
tells  you  the  system  is  reachable  and  observable? 

(d)  (4  points) When  the  initial  state  of  the  system  is  at  zero,  i.e.,  when  q(0) = 0,  and  when 
the  input  for  t ≥ 0  is  x(t) = 5e−t ,  the  output  y(t)  of  the  system  for  t ≥ 0  is 
y(t) = e 3t  − e
−2t 
. 
(You  can  use  this  fact  as  a  check  on  some  of  your  preceding  answers!)  What  initial 
condition  q(0)  would  we  need  in  order  to  have  y(t)  ≡  0  for  t  ≥  0,  with  this  same  input 
for  t ≥ 0.

x(t) = 5e
(e)  (3  points)  Suppose  we  implement  a  state  feedback  control  of  the  form 
T 
x(t) = g q(t) + p(t) 
on  the  given  system,  where  the  feedback  gain  vector  is  gT  = [g1  g2 ],  and  p(t)  is  some 
new  external  input.  Write  down  the  resulting  state-space  model,  with  input  p(t),  state 
vector  q(t),  and  output  y(t).  You  need  to  show  the  model  in  detail,  making  explicit  the 
entries of all matrices and vectors  involved  in the  state evolution equation and  the output 
equation. 

(f )  (4  points)  For  your  closed-loop  system  in  (e),  determine  what  choice  of  g1  and  g2  will 
result  in  a  closed-loop  characteristic  polynomial  of 
ν (s) = s 2  + 3s + 2 .
 
Is  the  resulting  system  observable?  Be  sure  to  show  your  reasoning.
 

(g)  (2  points)  With  the  state  feedback  gains  picked  as  in  (f ),  suppose	  p(t)  in  the  closed-
loop  system  is  kept  constant  at  the  value  p =  6  for  all  time.  What  is  the  corresponding 
equilibrium  value  q  of  the  state  vector  q(t)?
