Problem  1  (5  points) 

H (ejΩ ) = exp{−j (60Ω + 25Ω3 )}  for  |Ω| < π .  In  this  frequency  range, 
1(a)  (1  point)  the  magnitude  |H (ejΩ )|  is:

1(b)  (1  point)  the  phase  ∠H (ejΩ )  is: 
−(60Ω + 25Ω3 ) 

1(c)  (1  point)  the  group  delay  τg (Ω)  is: 

...  the  negative  of  the  slope  of  the  phase with  respect  to Ω,  therefore  60 + 75Ω2 . 
This  is  60  samples  at  Ω = 0  and  rises  to  around  800  samples  at  Ω = π . 

1(d)  (2  points)  The  impulse  response  h[n]  of  this  ﬁlter  is  given  by  the  plot  in  (choose  A  or  B 
or  C  or  D  or  E): 

C 

Two  diﬀerent  features  of  this  response  that  support  choosing  it  as  h[n]  are: 

The  bulk  of  the  response  starts  around  time  60,  with  the  lowest  frequencies 
emerging  ﬁrst,  and  increasingly  higher  frequencies  emerging  later,  which  is  consis­
tent  with  the  group  delay  characteristic.  None  of  the  other  waveforms  has  these 
features.

2(a)  (3  points)  The  energy  spectral  density  S xx (jω)  of  this  signal  is  given  by  the  following —

What  we  want  is  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  deterministic  autocorrelation 
function,  which  is  S xx (jω) = 9  for  |ω |  <  2,  and  0  elsewhere.  (You  can  draw  the

2(b)  (2  points)  The  magnitude  of  the  Fourier  transform  of  x(t),  i.e.,  |X (jω)|,  is  given  by  the 
following —  careful  and  fully  labeled!  —  sketch  (be  sure  to  explain  your  answer): 
We  know  S xx (jω) =  |X (jω)|2 ,  so  |X (jω)|  = 3  for  |ω |  <  2,  and  0  elsewhere.  (You 
can  draw  the  ﬁgure!) 

2(c)  (2  points)  One  possible  signal  x(t)  that  has  the  speciﬁed  deterministic  autocorrelation 
function  Rxx (τ )  is: 
Assuming  a  signal  that  has  zero  phase,  i.e.,  ∠X (jω) = 0,  we  have  that  X (jω) = 
|X (jω)|,  so  an  appropriate  signal  would  be 

x(t) = 3

2(d)  (2  points)  The  relation  –  in  either  the  time  domain  or  the  frequency  domain  –  between 
any  other  (correct  but  otherwise  arbitrary)  answer  to  2(c)  and  the  speciﬁc  one  you  gave 
in  2(c): 

A  solution  can  have  an  arbitrary  phase  characteristic  (as  long  as  the  phase  is 
an  odd  function  of  ω).  All  solutions  have  the  same  magnitude  characteristic, 
determined  as  in  2(b).  Stated  another way,  one  solution  can  be  obtained  from 
another  by  all-pass  ﬁltering. 

2(e)  (3  points)  The  x(t)  above  is  the  input  to  an  ideal  lowpass  ﬁlter  that  has  gain  1  for 
frequencies  ω  satisfying  |ω | <  1,  and  gain  0  elsewhere.  The  corresponding  output  of  the 
ﬁlter  is  y(t),  with  energy  spectral  density  S yy (jω)  given  by  the  following  —  careful  and 
fully  labeled!  —  sketch  (be  sure  to  explain  your  answer): 

We  know 

S yy (jω) = |H (jω)|2S xx (jω)

where  H (jω)  is  the  frequency  response  of  the  lowpass  ﬁlter,  so  S yy (jω) = 9  for

The magnitude  of  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  signal,  i.e.,  |F (jω)|,  is  derived  below,  and

f (t)f (t − τ ) dt = cos(10τ ) 

Rf f (τ ) =

Taking  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  given  deterministic  autocorrelation  func­
tion,  we  ﬁnd  S f f (jω) = 0.5π  for  8  <  |ω |  <  12,  and  0  elsewhere.  Thus  F (jω)|  =

We  know  the  deterministic  correlation

X (jω)F ∗ (jω).  But  since  the  |X (jω)|  is  0  where  |F (jω)|  is  nonzero,  this  product 
of  transforms  is  0,  hence  the  deterministic  correlation  of  these  two  signals  is 
0. 

Problem  3  (10  points) 
Note  xc (t) = sin(2πf1 t),  with  f1  = 1300  Hz. 

3(a)  (1 point) The minimum  value  that  the  sampling  frequency  1/T  has  to  exceed,  in  order  to 
avoid  aliasing  at  the  C/D  converter: 

This  is  the  Nyquist  frequency,  namely  twice  the  highest  frequency  in  the 
signal,  hence  2600  Hz. 

For  each  of  the  following  parts,  fully  specify  what  the  output  yc (t)  is  for  the  indicated 
choice of the sampling/reconstruction frequency 1/T .  Show how you obtain your answers! 

In  the  absence  of  aliasing,  the  ﬁlter  behaves  as  a  CT  ﬁlter  whose  frequency 
response  is obtained by  the  substitution Ω = ωT  in  the DT ﬁlter  characteristic, 
i.e.,  as  an  ideal  lowpass  ﬁlter  with  unit  gain  and  cut-oﬀ  determined  as  fc  = 
Ωc/(2πT ) = 1/(4T )  Hz. 

4 

3(b)  (3  points) When  1/T  = 8000  Hz,  the  output  yc (t)  is: 

For  this  sampling  frequency,  there  is  no  aliasing,  and  the  eﬀective  ﬁlter  cut­
oﬀ  frequency  is  2000  Hz,  which  allows  the  input  to  go  through  intact.  Hence 
yc (t) = xc (t) = sin(2600πt). 

3(c)  (3  points) When  1/T  = 4000  Hz,  the  output  yc (t)  is: 

For  this  sampling  frequency,  there  is  no  aliasing,  and  the  eﬀective  ﬁlter  cut-oﬀ 
frequency  is  1000  Hz,  which  blocks  the  input.  Hence  yc (t) = 0. 

3(d)  (3  points) When  1/T  = 1600  Hz,  the  output  yc (t)  is: 

For  this  sampling  frequency  of  1600  Hz,  aliasing  does  occur,  so  we  need  to 
work  more  carefully.  The  principal  frequency  band  is  [-800  Hz,  800  Hz]  and 
the  ﬁlter  cut-oﬀ  frequency  is  400  Hz.  The  1300  Hz  input  component  is  outside 
these.  However,  the  lower  sideband  of  the  alias  centered  at  the  sampling 
frequency  of  1600  Hz  appears  at  a  frequency  that  is  1300  Hz  lower  than  1600 
Hz,  i.e.,  appears  at  positive  frequency  300  Hz,  therefore  as  an  upper  sideband 
in  the  principal  frequency  range,  and  within  the  passband  of  the  ﬁlter.  The 
output  will  therefore  be  yc (t) = − sin(2π300t) = − sin(600π t). 
Alternatively,  note  that  for  this  input  the  DT  signal  xd [n]  is  given  by 
sin(2π1300nT ) = sin(2π1300n/1600) = sin ((2πn) − (2π300n/1600)) = − sin(2π300n/1600) 
which  is  precisely  what  one  would  get  from  an  input  signal  of  − sin(2π300t). 
The  latter  signal  does  lie  in  the  principal  frequency  band  and  in  the  passband 
of  the  eﬀective  CT  ﬁlter,  thus  yielding  an  output  yc (t) = − sin(2π300t)  .

4(a)  (3  points)  The  eigenvalues  and  associated  eigenvectors  are:

s(s − 1) − 6 = s 2  − s − 6 = (s + 2)(s − 3)  .

The  roots  of  this  are  λ1  =  −2  and  λ2  = 3,  which  are  the  desired  eigenvalues. 
The  corresponding  eigenvectors  are  then  directly  obtained  from  the  deﬁning

4(b)  (1  point)  Is  the  system  asymptotically  stable?  Explain  your  answer. 

Because  one  eigenvalue  is  positive,  the  system  is  not  asymptotically  stable.

What  feature  of  this H (s)  tells  you  the  system  is  reachable  and  observable? 

The  fact  that  there  are  two  poles  in  H (s),  neither  one  canceled  by  the  zero, 
shows  that  this  2nd-order  system  has  no  hidden  modes,  i.e.,  is  reachable  and 
observable. 

4(d)  (4  points) When  the  initial  state  of  the  system  is  at  zero,  i.e.,  when  q(0) = 0,  and  when 
the  input  for  t ≥ 0  is  x(t) = 5e−t ,  the  output  y(t)  of  the  system  for  t ≥ 0  is 
y(t) = e 3t  − e−2t  . 

(You  can  use  this  fact  as  a  check  on  some  of  your  preceding  answers!)  What  initial 
condition  q(0)  would  we  need  in  order  to  have  y(t)  ≡  0  for  t  ≥  0,  with  this  same  input 
x(t) = 5e−t  for  t ≥ 0.  Be  sure  to  explain  your  reasoning! 

We  need  cT q(t)  for  the  ZIR  to  be  the  negative  of  the  given  output  ZSR.  So 
with  ZIR 

q(t) = α1v1e λ1 t  + α2v2e λ2 t 

we  need 

α1 (c T v1 ) = 1 ,  and  α2 (c T v2 ) = −1 ,

x(t) = g T q(t) + p(t) 

on  the  given  system,  where  the  feedback  gain  vector  is  gT  = [g1  g2 ],  and  p(t)  is  some 
new  external  input.  Write  down  the  resulting  state-space  model,  with  input  p(t),  state 
vector  q(t),  and  output  y(t).  You  need  to  show  the  model  in  detail,  making  explicit  the 
entries of all matrices and vectors  involved  in  the state evolution equation and the output

4(f )  (4  points)  For  your  closed-loop  system  in  (e),  determine  what  choice  of  g1  and  g2  will 
result  in  a  closed-loop  characteristic  polynomial  of 

ν (s) = s 2  + 3s + 2  . 

The  closed-loop  characteristic  polynomial  is 
ν (s) = s(s − (1 + g2 )) − (6 + g1 ) = s 2  − (1 + g2 )s − (6 + g1 )  . 
Setting  this  equal  to  the  desired  polynomial  speciﬁed  above,  we  ﬁnd  g1  = −8 
and  g2  = −4. 

Is  the  resulting  system  observable?  Be  sure  to  show  your  reasoning. 

We can write ν (s) = (s+ 1)(s+ 2),  so  the denominator of  the closed-loop  transfer 
function  has  a  factor  due  to  the  pole  at  −1  that  cancels  with  the  numerator 
factor  due  to  the  (unchanged)  zero  of  the  open-loop  transfer  function  at  −1. 
Since state  feedback cannot modify reachability,  the cause of this hidden mode 
must  be  a  loss  of  observability. 
Alternatively,  we  could  compute  the  closed-loop  eigenvectors  and  then  test 
observability  in  the  usual  way.

4(g)  (2  points)  With  the  state  feedback  gains  picked  as  in  (f ),  suppose  p(t)  in  the  closed-
loop  system  is  kept  constant  at  the  value  p =  6  for  all  time.  What  is  the  corresponding 
equilibrium  value  q  of  the  state  vector  q(t)?
