Problem  1  (6  points) 

For  each  of  the  following  statements,  specify  whether  the  statement  is  true  or  false  and 
give  a brief (at  most  a few lines) justiﬁcation  or  counterexample. 

(1a)  (1.5  points)  If  X  and  Y  are  independent  random  variables,  the  unconstrained  MMSE 
estimator  Y� of  Y  given  X  =  x  is  Y� =  µY  . 

(1b) (1.5 points) The following  random process is  strict  sense  stationary:  x(t) =  A  where  A  is 
a  continuous  random  variable  with  a  pdf  uniform  between  ±1. 

(1c)  (1.5  points) The  following  random  process  is  ergodic  in  the  mean:  x(t) =  A  where  A  is  a 
continuous  random  variable  with  a  pdf  uniform  between  ±1. 

(1d)  (1.5  points) If  the  input  to  a  stable  LTI  system  is  WSS  then  the  output  is  guaranteed  to 
be WSS.

Problem  2  (15  points) 

Suppose  x(t)  and  v(t)  are  two  independent  WSS  random  processes  with  autocorrelation 
functions  respectively  Rxx(τ ) and  Rvv (τ ). 

(2a) (3 points) Using x(t) and  v(t), show how you would construct  a random process  g(t) whose 
autocorrelation function  Rgg (τ )  is  that  shown  in  Eq.  (2.1).  Be  sure  to  demonstrate 
that  the  resulting  process  g(t)  has  the  desired  autocorrelation  function. 

Rgg (τ ) =  Rxx(τ )Rvv (τ ) 

For  the  remainder  of  this  problem  assume  that  Rxx (τ ) and  Rvv (τ ) are  known  to  be 

Rxx (τ ) = 2e−|τ | 

Rvv (τ ) =  e −3|τ | 

You  can  also  invoke  the  Fourier  transform  identity 

e −β |τ |  ⇐⇒ 

2β 
β 2  +  ω2 

(2.1) 

(2.2) 

(2.3) 

(2b) (6 points)  Let  w(t)  denote  a  third  WSS  random  process  with  autocorrelation  function 
Rww (τ ) =  δ(τ ).  Suppose  w(t)  is  the  input  to  a  ﬁrst-order,  stable,  causal  LTI  system  for 
which  the  linear  constant  coeﬃcient  diﬀerential  equation  is 

dx(t)
dt 

+  ax(t) =  bw(t) 

(2.4) 

Determine  the  values  of  a  and  b  so  that  the  autocorrelation  of  the  output  x(t) is  Rxx(τ ) 
as given in Eq.  (2.2). 

(2c)  (6  points)  Is  it  possible  to  have  a  WSS  process  z (t)  whose  autocorrelation  function 
Rzz (τ ) =  Rxx (τ ) ∗  Rvv (τ ),  i.e.,  Rzz (τ )  is  the  result  of  convolving  the  autocorrelation 
functions  Rxx (τ ) and  Rvv (τ ) given in Eq.  (2.2)?  If no,  why  not?  If yes,  show how to gen­
erate  z (t) starting from a WSS process  w(t) with  autocorrelation  function  Rww (τ ) =  δ(τ ) 
(you  can  perform  any necessary  causal  LTI  ﬁltering  operations).

Problem  3  (15  points) 

A  DT  wide-sense  stationary  random  process  s[n]  has  zero  mean  and  the  autocovariance 
function  Css [m] shown  in  Figure  3.1.  Css [m] = 0 for  |m| ≥ 5.

Figure 3.1 

The process  s[n] is transmitted through  a communication  channel  that introduces noise  and 
a  one-step  delay.  The  received  process  r [n]  is  related  to  s[n]  as  indicated  by  Eq.  (3.1).  The 
noise process  w[n] has  zero  mean,  autocovariance  function  Cww [m] = 3δ [m].  Furthermore,  the 
noise process  w[·] is  uncorrelated  with  the  process  s[·]. 

We  wish  to  design  an  estimator  s�[n] for  s[n].  Throughout  this  problem  the  ob jective  is  to 
choose  the  parameters  in  the  estimator  to  minimize  the  mean  squared  error  E  deﬁned  as 

r [n] =  s[n  − 1] + w[n]

E  � E {(s[n] − s�[n])2 } 

(3a)  (2  points)  Express  the  covariance  functions  Crs [m]  and  Crr [m]  in  terms  of  the  given 
autocovariance functions  Css [m] and  Cww [m]? 

(3b)  (3  points) If  the  estimator  is  restricted  to  be  of  the  form 

will  E  be  minimized  with  the  parameter  values  a0  = 0  and  a1  = 5? 

s�[n] =  a0 r [n] + a1 r [n  − 1]

(3c)  (5  points) If  the  estimator  is  restricted  to  be  of  the  form 

s�[n] =  a2 r [n] 

determine  the  value  of  a2  that  minimizes  E . 

(3d)  (5  points) If  the  estimator  is  of  the  form 

with  no  ≥  0,  determine  the  value  of  no  that  minimizes  E .

Figure 4.1 

D/A  converters  utilizing  oversampled  noise  shaping  often  use  the  structure  in  Figure  4.1  to 
quantize the output sequence to a 1-bit bitstream for which D/A  conversion is then very  simple. 
Its  eﬀectiveness  assumes  that  x[n] is  highly  oversampled  and  that  most  of  the  error  introduced 
by  the  quantizer  falls  outside  the  signal  band. 
In  Figure  4.1  the  quantizer  error  is  modeled  as  an  additive,  zero  mean  i.i.d  sequence  e[n] 
that  is  uniformly  distributed  in  amplitude  between  ± △  at  each  time  instant  n.  Furthermore, 
2 
e[n]  and  x[n]  are  assumed  to  be  independent.  The  input  x[n]  has  mean  µx  =  0  and  variance 
2  =  1.  Moreover,  the  input  x[n]  is  bandlimited,  i.e.,  the  power  spectral  density  Sxx(ejΩ ) is 
σx 
zero for  π 
2  <  |Ω| < π . 
The  output  y [n]  is  composed  of  two  components:  yx [n]  due  solely  to  x[n],  and  ye [n] due 
solely  to  e[n].  Similarly,  w[n] =  wx [n] +  we [n].  Note  that  the  transfer  function  from  x[n]  to

yx [n] is  unity,  and  the  transfer  function  from  e[n] to  ye [n] is (1 − az−1 ). 

(4a)  (7  points) Determine  the  power  spectral  density  of  ye [n] as  a  function  of  Ω  for  |Ω| < π .

(4b) (7 points)  Determine  E {wx [n]},  E {we [n]},  and  the  value  of  the  gain  constant  “a”  that 
maximizes the  signal-to-noise  ratio (SN R) of  w[n] deﬁned  as 

SN R  =
