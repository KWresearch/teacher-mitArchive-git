Properties  of  LTI  State-Space 
Models 

5.1  INTRODUCTION 

In  Chapter  4  we  introduced  state-space  models  for  dynamical  systems.  In  this 
chapter we study the structure and solutions of LTI state-space models.  Throughout 
the discussion we  restrict ourselves  to  the  single-input,  single-output Lth-order CT 
LTI  state-space  model 

q˙ (t) = Aq(t) + bx(t) 
y(t) = c T q(t) + dx(t)  , 

or  the  DT  LTI  state-space  model 

q[n + 1] = Aq[n] + bx[n] 
y [n] = c T q[n] + dx[n]  .

(5.3) 
(5.4) 

Equation (5.1) constitutes a representation of CT LTI system dynamics  in the form 
of  a  set  of  coupled,  ﬁrst-order,  linear,  constant-coeﬃcient  diﬀerential  equations  for 
the  L  variables  in  q(t),  driven  by  the  input  x(t).  Equation  (5.3)  gives  a  similar 
diﬀerence-equation  representation  of  DT  LTI  system  dynamics. 

The  basic  approach  to  analyzing  LTI  state-space models  parallels what  you  should 
already  be  familiar  with  from  solving  linear  constant-coeﬃcient  diﬀerential  or  dif­
ference  equations  (of  any  order)  in  one  variable.  Speciﬁcally,  we  ﬁrst  consider  the 
zero-input  response  to  nonzero  initial  conditions  at  some  starting  time,  and  then 
augment  that  with  the  response  due  to  the  nonzero  input  when  the  initial  condi­
tions  are  zero.  Understanding  the  full  solution  from  the  starting  time  onwards will 
give  us  insight  into  system  stability,  and  into  how  the  internal  behavior  relates  to 
the  input-output  characteristics  of  the  system. 

5.2  THE  ZERO-INPUT  RESPONSE  AND  MODAL  REPRESENTATION 

We  take  our  starting  time  to  be  0,  without  loss  of  generality  (since  we  are  dealing 
with  time-invariant  models).  Consider  the  response  of  the  undriven  system  corre­
sponding  to  (5.1),  i.e.,  the  response with  x(t) ≡ 0  for  t ≥ 0,  but with  some  nonzero 
initial  condition  q(0).  This  is  the  zero-input-response  (ZIR)  of  the  system  (5.1),

and  is  a  solution  of  the  undriven  (or  unforced  or  homogeneous)  system 

q˙ (t) = Aq(t)  . 

(5.5) 

It  is  natural  when  analyzing  an  undriven  LTI  system  to  look  for  a  solution  in 
exponential  form  (essentially  because  exponentials  have  the  unique  property  that 
shifting  them  is  equivalent  to  scaling  them,  and  undriven  LTI  systems  are  charac­
terized  by  invariance  to  shifting  and  scaling  of  solutions).  We  accordingly  look  for 
a  nonzero  solution  of  the  form 

q(t) = ve λt  ,  v = 0  , 

(5.6) 

where  each  state  variable  is  a  scalar  multiple  of  the  same  exponential  eλt ,  with 
these  scalar  multiples  assembled  into  the  vector  v.  (The  boldface  0  at  the  end  of 
the  preceding  equation  denotes  an  L-component  column  vector  whose  entries  are 
all  0 —  we  shall  use  0  for  any  vectors  or matrices  whose  entries  are  all  0,  with  the 
correct  dimensions  being  apparent  from  the  context.  Writing  v  =  0  signiﬁes  that 
at  least  one  component  of  v  is  nonzero.) 

Substituting  (5.6)  into  (5.5)  results  in  the  equation 

λve λt  = Ave λt  , 

(5.7) 

from  which  we  can  conclude  that  the  vector  v  and  scalar  λ  must  satisfy 

λv = Av  or  equivalently  (λI − A)v = 0  ,  v =6 0  , 
where  I  denotes  the  identity  matrix,  in  this  case  of  dimension  L × L.  The  above 
equation  has  a  nonzero  solution  v  if  and  only  if  the  coeﬃcient  matrix  (λI − A)  is 
not  invertible,  i.e.,  if  and  only  if  its  determinant  is  0: 

(5.8) 

det(λI − A) = 0 . 
For  an  Lth-order  system,  it  turns  out  that  the  above  determinant  is  a monic  poly­
nomial  of  degree  L,  called  the  characteristic  polynomial  of  the  system  or  of  the 
matrix A: 

det(λI − A) = a(λ) = λL  + aL−1λL−1  +
· · · 
+ a0 
(The  word  “monic”  simply  means  that  the  coeﬃcient  of  the  highest-degree  term 
is  1.)  It  follows  that  (5.6)  is  a  nonzero  solution  of  (5.5)  if  and  only  if  λ  is  one  of 
the L  roots  {λi }L  of  the  characteristic  polynomial.  These  roots  are  referred  to  as 
i=1 
characteristic  roots  of  the  system,  and  as  eigenvalues  of  the matrix A. 

(5.9) 

(5.10) 

The  vector  v  in  (5.6)  is  correspondingly  a  nonzero  solution  vi  of  the  system  of 
equations 

(λi I − A)vi  = 0  ,  vi  6= 0  , 
and is termed the characteristic vector or eigenvector associated with λi .  Note from 
(5.11)  that  multiplying  any  eigenvector  by  a  nonzero  scalar  again  yields  an  eigen­
vector,  so  eigenvectors  are  only  deﬁned  up  to  a  nonzero  scaling.  Any  convenient 
scaling  or  normalization  can  be  used.

The  Zero-Input  Response  and  Modal  Representation  87 

In  summary,  the  undriven  system  has  a  solution  of  the  assumed  exponential  form 
in  (5.6)  if and only  if λ equals  some characteristic value or eigenvalue of A, and  the 
nonzero  vector  v  is  an  associated  characteristic  vector  or  eigenvector. 

We  shall  only  be  dealing  with  state-space  models  for  which  all  the  signals  and  the 
coeﬃcient  matrices  A,  b,  cT  and  d  are  real-valued  (though  we  may  subsequently 
transform  these models  into  the diagonal  forms  seen  in  the previous chapter, which 
may  then  have  complex  entries,  but  occurring  in  very  structured  ways).  The  coef­
ﬁcients  ai  deﬁning  the  characteristic  polynomial  a(λ)  in  (5.10)  are  therefore  real, 
and  thus  the  complex  roots  of  this  polynomial  occur  in  conjugate  pairs.  Also,  it 
is  straightforward  to  show  that  if  vi  is  an  eigenvector  associated  with  a  complex 
eigenvalue λi , then vi∗ —i.e., the vector whose entries are the complex conjugates of 
the corresponding entries of vi  —  is an eigenvector associated with λ∗i ,  the complex 
conjugate  of  λi . 
We  refer  to  a  nonzero  solution  of  the  form  (5.6)  for  λ  =  λi  and  v  =  vi  as  the 
ith  mode  of  the  system  (5.1)  or  (5.5);  the  associated  λi  is  termed  the  ith  modal 
frequency  or  characteristic  frequency  or  natural  frequency  of  the  system,  and  vi  is 
termed  the  ith  mode  shape.  Note  that  if 

q(t) = vi e λi t 

(5.12) 

then the corresponding initial condition must have been q(0) = vi .  It can be shown 
(though we don’t do so here) that the system (5.5) — and similarly the system (5.1) 
—  can  only  have  one  solution  for  a  given  initial  condition,  so  it  follows  that  for  the 
initial  condition  q(0) = vi ,  only  the  ith  mode  will  be  excited. 
It  can  also  be  shown  that  eigenvectors  associated  with  distinct  eigenvalues  are 
linearly  independent,  i.e.,  none  of  them  can  be  written  as  a  weighted  linear  combi­
nation  of  the  remaining  ones.  For  simplicity, we  shall  restrict  ourselves  throughout 
to  the  case  where  all  L  eigenvalues  of  A  are  distinct,  which  will  guarantee  that 
v1 , v2 , . . . , vL  form  an  independent  set.  (In  some  cases  in  which  A  has  repeated 
eigenvalues,  it  is  possible  to  ﬁnd  a  full  set  of  L  independent  eigenvectors,  but  this 
is  not  generally  true.)  We  shall  repeatedly  use  the  fact  that  any  vector  in  an  L-
dimensional space,  such as our state vector q(t) at any speciﬁed time  t = t0 ,  can be 
written  as  a  unique  linear  combination  of  any L  independent  vectors  in  that  space, 
such  as  our  L  eigenvectors. 

5.2.1  Modal  representation  of  the  ZIR 

Because  (5.5)  is  linear,  a  weighted  linear  combination  of  modal  solutions  of  the 
form  (5.12),  one  for  each  eigenvalue,  will  also  satisfy  (5.5).  Consequently  a  more 
general  solution  for  the  zero-input  response  with  distinct  eigenvalues  is

Properties  of  LTI  State-Space  Models 

The  expression  in  (5.13)  can  easily be veriﬁed  to be a  solution of  (5.5)  for arbitrary 
weights  αi ,  with  initial  condition 
q(0) = X

Since  the  L  eigenvectors  vi  are  independent  under  our  assumption  of  L  distinct 
eigenvalues,  the  right  side  of  (5.14)  can  be  made  equal  to  any  desired  q(0)  by 
proper  choice  of  the  coeﬃcients  αi ,  and  these  coeﬃcients  are  unique.  Hence  spec­
ifying  the  initial  condition  of  the  undriven  system  (5.5)  speciﬁes  the  αi  via  (5.14), 
and  thus  speciﬁes  the  full  response  of  (5.5)  via  (5.13).  In  other  words,  (5.13)  is  ac­
tually  a  general  expression  for  the ZIR  of  (5.1) — under  our  assumption  of distinct 
eigenvalues.  We  refer  to  the  expression  on  the  right  side  of  (5.13)  as  the  modal 
decomposition  of  the  ZIR. 

(5.14) 

The  contribution  to  the modal  decomposition  from  a  conjugate  pair  of  eigenvalues 
λi  =  σi  + jωi  and  λ∗ 
σi  − jωi ,  with  associated  complex  conjugate  eigenvectors 
= 
i 
= ui  − jwi  respectively,  will  be  a  real  term  of  the  form

for  some  constants  Ki  and  θi  that  are  determined  by  the  initial  conditions  in  the 
process  of  matching  the  two  sides  of  (5.14).  The  above  component  of  the  modal 
solution  therefore  lies  in the plane  spanned by the real and  imaginary parts, ui  and 
wi  respectively,  of  the  eigenvector  vi .  The  associated  motion  of  the  component 
of  state  tra jectory  in  this  plane  involves  an  exponential  spiral,  with  growth  or 
Re{λi }  is  positive

respectively  (corresponding  to  the  eigenvalue λi  — and  its  conjugate λ
i  —  lying  in 
the  open  right- or  left-half-plane  respectively).  If  σi  = 0,  i.e.,  if  the  conjugate  pair 
of  eigenvalues  lies  on  the  imaginary  axis,  then  the  spiral  degenerates  to  a  closed 
loop.  The  rate  of  rotation  of  the  spiral  is  determined  by  ωi  = Im{λi}. 
A  similar  development  can  be  carried  out  in  the  DT  case  for  the  ZIR  of  (5.3).  In 
that  case  (5.6)  is  replaced  by  a  solution  of  the  form 

q[n] = vλn 

(5.17) 

and  we  ﬁnd  that  when  A  has  L  distinct  eigenvalues,  the  modal  decomposition  of 
the  general  ZIR  solution  takes  the  form

5.2.2  Asymptotic  stability 

Section  5.3 

Coordinate  Transformations  89 

The  stability of an LTI  system  is directly  related  to  the behavior of  the modes, and 
more  speciﬁcally  to  the  values  of  the  λi ,  the  roots  of  the  characteristic  polynomial. 
An LTI state-space system  is termed asymptotically stable or  internally stable  if  its 
ZIR  decays  to  zero  for  all  initial  conditions.  We  see  from  (5.13)  that  the  condition 
Re{λi } <  0  for  all  1 ≤  i ≤ L  is  necessary  and  suﬃcient  for  asymptotic  stability  in 
the  CT  case.  Thus,  all  eigenvalues  of  A  in  (5.1)  —  or  natural  frequencies  of  (5.1) 
—  must  be  in  the  open  left-half-plane. 

In the DT case, (5.18) shows that a necessary and suﬃcient condition for asymptotic 
stability  is  |λi | < 1  for  all  1 ≤ i ≤ L,  i.e.,  all  eigenvalues  of A  in  (5.3) —  or  natural 
frequencies  of  (5.3) — must  be  strictly  within  the  unit  circle. 

We  used  the modal  decompositions  (5.13)  and  (5.18)  to make  these  claims  regard­
ing  stability  conditions,  but  these  modal  decompositions  were  obtained  under  the 
assumption  of distinct  eigenvalues.  Nevertheless,  it  can be  shown  that  the  stability 
conditions  in  the  general  case  are  identical  to  those  above. 

5.3  COORDINATE  TRANSFORMATIONS 

We  have  so  far  only  described  the  zero-input  response  of  LTI  state-space  systems. 
Before  presenting  the  general  response,  including  the  eﬀects  of  inputs,  it  will  be 
helpful  to  understand  how  a  given  state-space  representation  can  be  transformed 
to an equivalent representation that might be simpler to analyze.  Our development 
is  carried  out  for  the CT  case,  but  an  entirely  similar  development  can  be  done  for 
DT. 

It  is  often  useful  to  examine  the  behavior  of  a  state-space  system  by  rewriting 
the  original  description  in  terms  of  a  transformed  set  of  variables.  A  particularly 
important  case  involves  the  transformation  of  the  state  vector  q(t)  to  a  new  state 
vector  r(t)  that  decomposes  the  behavior  of  the  system  into  its  components  along 
each  of  the  eigenvectors  vi : 
q(t) = X 
L
vi ri (t) = Vr(t)  , 
i=1 
where  the  ith  column  of  the  L × L  matrix V  is  the  ith  eigenvector,  vi : 
vL  ¢ 
V = ¡ 
· · · 
. 
v1  v2 
We  refer  to V  as  the modal matrix.  Under  our  assumption  of  distinct  eigenvalues, 
the  eigenvectors  are  independent,  which  guarantees  that V  is  invertible,  so 

(5.20) 

(5.19) 

r(t) = V−1 q(t)  . 

(5.21) 

The transformation  from the original system description  involving q(t) to one writ­
ten  in  terms  of  r(t)  is  called  a  modal  transformation,  and  the  new  state  variables 
ri (t)  deﬁned  through  (5.19)  are  termed modal  variables  or  modal  coordinates.

90  Chapter  5 

Properties  of  LTI  State-Space  Models 

More  generally,  a  coordinate  transformation  corresponds  to  choosing  a  new  state 
vector  z(t)  related  to  the  original  state  vector  q(t)  through  the  relationship 

q(t) = Mz(t) 

(5.22) 

where  the  constant  matrix M  is  chosen  to  be  invertible.  (The  ith  column  of M  is 
the  representation  of  the  ith  unit  vector  of  the  new  z  coordinates  in  terms  of  the 
old  q  coordinates.)  Substituting  (5.22)  in  (5.1)  and  (5.2),  and  solving  for  z˙ (t),  we 
obtain 

z˙ (t) = (M−1AM)z(t) + (M−1b)x(t) 
y(t) = (c T M)z(t) + dx(t)  . 

(5.23) 
(5.24) 

Equations  (5.23) and  (5.24) are  still  in  state-space  form, but with  state vector z(t), 
and  with  modiﬁed  coeﬃcient  matrices.  This  model  is  entirely  equivalent  to  the 
original one, since (5.22) permits q(t) to be obtained from z(t), and the invertibility 
of  M  permits  z(t)  to  be  obtained  from  q(t).  It  is  straightforward  to  verify  that 
the  eigenvalues  of A  are  identical  to  those  of M−1AM,  and  consequently  that  the 
natural  frequencies  of  the  transformed  system  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  original 
system;  only  the  eigenvectors  change,  with  vi  transforming  to M−1vi . 
We  refer  to  the  transformation  (5.22)  as  a  similarity  transformation,  and  say  that 
the model  (5.23),  (5.24)  is  similar  to  the  model  (5.1),  (5.2). 

Note that the input x(t) and output y(t) are unaﬀected by this state transformation. 
For a given input, and assuming an initial state z(0) in the transformed system that 
is related to q(0) via (5.22), we obtain the same output as we would have from (5.1), 
(5.2).  In  particular,  the  transfer  function  from  input  to  output  is  unaﬀected  by  a 
similarity  transformation. 

Similarity  transformations  can  be  deﬁned  in  exactly  the  same way  for  the DT  case 
in  (5.3),  (5.4). 

5.3.1  Transformation  to Modal  Coordinates 

What  makes  the  modal  similarity  transformation  (5.19)  interesting  and  useful  is 
the  fact  that  the  state  evolution  matrix A  transforms  to  a  diagonal  matrix  Λ:

The  easiest  way  to  verify  this  is  to  establish  the  equivalent  fact  that  AV  =  VΛ, 
which  in  turn  is  simply  the  equation  (5.11),  written  for  i  = 1, 
, L  and  stacked 
· · · 
up  in matrix  form. 

(5.25) 

The  diagonal  form  of  Λ  causes  the  corresponding  state  equations  in  the  new  co­
ordinate  system  to  be  decoupled.  Under  this  modal  transformation,  the  undriven

The  Complete  Response  91 

system  (5.5)  is  transformed  into  L  decoupled,  scalar  equations: 

r˙i (t) = λi ri (t) 

for  i = 1, 2, . . . , L  . 

Each  of  these  is  easy  to  solve: 

ri (t) = e λi t ri (0)  . 

Combining  this  with  (5.19)  yields  (5.13)  again,  with  αi  = ri (0).

5.4  THE  COMPLETE  RESPONSE 

Applying  the modal  transformation  (5.19)  to  the  full driven  system  (5.1),  (5.2), we 
see  that  the  transformed  system  (5.23),  (5.24)  takes  the  following  form,  which  is 
decoupled  into  L  parallel  scalar  subsystems: 

i = 1, 2, . . . , L 
r˙i (t) = λi ri (t) + βix(t)  ,

y(t) = ξ1 r1 (t) +  + ξL rL (t) + dx(t)  ,

(5.31) 

To  ﬁnd  an  interpretation  of  the  βi ,  note  that  the  ﬁrst  equation  in  (5.30)  can  be 
rewritten  as  b = Vβ .  Writing  out  the  product Vβ  in  detail,  we  ﬁnd 

b = v1β1  + v2β2  +

In  other  words,  the  coeﬃcients  βi  are  the  coeﬃcients  needed  to  express  the  input 
vector  b  as  a  linear  combination  of  the  eigenvectors  vi . 
Each  of  the  scalar  equations  in  (5.28)  is  a  ﬁrst-order  LTI  diﬀerential  equation,  and 
can  be  solved  explicitly  for  t ≥ 0,  obtaining

Expressed in this form, we easily recognize the separate contributions to the solution 
made  by:  (i)  the  response  due  to  the  initial  state  (the  zero-input  response  or ZIR); 
and  (ii)  the  response  due  to  the  system  input  (the  zero-state  response  or  ZSR). 
From  the  preceding  expression  and  (5.29),  one  can  obtain  an  expression  for  y(t).

Equation  (5.37)  gives  us,  in  compact  matrix  notation,  the  general  solution  of  the 
CT  LTI  system  (5.1). 

An  entirely  parallel  development  can  be  carried  out  for  the  DT  LTI  case.  The 
corresponding  expression  for  the  solution  of  (5.3)  is

Equation  (5.40)  is  exactly  the  expression  one  would  get  by  simply  iterating  (5.3) 
forward one step at a time, to get q[n] from q[0].  However, we get additional insight 
from  writing  the  expression  in  the  modally  decomposed  form  (5.39),  because  it 
brings  out  the  role  of  the  eigenvalues  of  A,  i.e.,  the  natural  frequencies  of  the  DT 
system,  in  determining  the  behavior  of  the  system,  and  in  particular  its  stability 
properties.

The  transfer  function  H (s)  of  the  transformed  model  (5.28),  (5.29)  describes  the 
zero-state input-output relationship in the Laplace transform domain, and is straight­
forward  to  ﬁnd  because  the  equations  are  totally  decoupled.  Taking  the  Laplace

which  can  be  rewritten  in matrix  notation  as 
H (s) = ξT (sI − Λ)−1β + d  . 
This  is  also  the  transfer  function  of  the  original  model  in  (5.1),  (5.2),  as  similarity 
transformations do not change transfer  functions.  An alternative expression  for the 
transfer function of (5.1), (5.2) follows from examination of the Laplace transformed 
version  of  (5.1),  (5.2).  We  omit  the  details,  but  the  resulting  expression  is 
H (s) = c T (sI − A)−1b + d 
We  see  from  (5.43)  that  H (s)  will  have  L  poles  in  general.  However,  if  βj  =  0  for 
some  j  —  i.e.,  if  b  can  be  expressed  as  a  linear  combination  of  the  eigenvectors 
other than vj , see (5.32) — then λj  fails to appear as a pole of the transfer function, 
even  though  it  is  still  a  natural  frequency  of  the  system  and  appears  in  the  ZIR 
for  almost  all  initial  conditions.  The  underlying  cause  for  this  hidden  mode  —  an 
internal mode  that  is  hidden  from  the  input/output  transfer  function —  is  evident 
from  (5.28)  or  (5.41):  with  βj  =  0,  the  input  fails  to  excite  the  j th  mode.  We  say 
that  the mode  associated with  λj  is  an  unreachable mode  in  this  case.  In  contrast, 
if  βk  =  0,  we  refer  to  the  kth  mode  as  reachable.  (The  term  controllable  is  also 
used  for  reachable  —  although  strictly  speaking  there  is  a  slight  diﬀerence  in  the 
deﬁnitions  of  the  two  concepts  in  the  DT  case.) 

(5.44) 

(5.45) 

If  all  L  modes  of  the  system  are  reachable,  then  the  system  itself  is  termed  reach­
able,  otherwise  it  is  called  unreachable.  In  a  reachable  system,  the  input  can  fully 
excite  the  state  (and  in  fact  can  transfer  the  state  vector  from  any  speciﬁed  initial 
condition  to any desired  target  state  in ﬁnite  time).  In an unreachable  system,  this 
is  not  possible.  The  notion  of  reachability  arises  in  several  places  in  systems  and 
control  theory. 
The  dual  situation  happens  when  ξj  = 0  for  some  j  —  i.e.,  if  cT vj  = 0,  see  (5.31). 
In  this  case  again,  (5.43)  shows  that  λj  fails  to  appear  as  a  pole  of  the  transfer 
function,  even  though  it  is  still  a  natural  frequency  of  the  system.  Once  again, 
we  have  a  hidden  mode.  This  time,  the  cause  is  evident  in  (5.29)  or  (5.42):  with 
ξj  =  0,  the  j th  mode  fails  to  appear  at  the  output,  even  when  it  is  present  in  the

Properties  of  LTI  State-Space  Models 

state  response.  We  say  that  the  mode  associated  with  λj  is  unobservable  in  this 
case.  In  contrast,  if  ξk  = 0,  then  we  call  the  kth mode  observable. 
If  all  L modes  of  the  system  are  observable,  the  system  itself  is  termed  observable, 
otherwise  it  is  called  unobservable.  In  an  observable  system,  the  behavior  of  the 
state  vector  can  be  unambiguously  inferred  from  measurements  of  the  input  and 
output  over  some  interval  of  time,  whereas  this  is  not  possible  for  an  unobservable 
system.  The  concept  of  observability  also  arises  repeatedly  in  systems  and  control 
theory. 

Hidden modes can cause diﬃculty, especially if they are unstable.  However, if all we 
are  concerned  about  is  representing  a  transfer  function,  or  equivalently  the  input– 
output relation of an LTI system, then hidden modes may be of no signiﬁcance.  We 
can  obtain  a  reduced-order  state-space  model  that  has  the  same  transfer  function 
by  simply  discarding  all  the  equations  in  (5.28)  that  correspond  to  unreachable  or 
unobservable modes,  and  discarding  the  corresponding  terms  in  (5.29). 

The  converse  also  turns  out  to  be  true:  if  a  state-space model  is  reachable  and  ob­
servable,  then  there  is no  lower order  state-space  system  that has  the  same  transfer 
function;  in  other  words,  a  state-space  model  that  is  reachable  and  observable  is 
minimal. 

Again,  an  entirely  parallel  development  can  be  carried  out  for  the  DT  case,  as  the 
next  example  illustrates.

Properties  of  LTI  State-Space  Models 

Since  the  transfer  function  has  only  one  pole  and  this  pole  is  inside  the  unit  circle, 
the  system  is  input-output  stable.  However,  the  system  has  two  modes,  so  one  of 
them  is  a  hidden mode,  i.e.,  does  not  appear  in  the  input-output  transfer  function. 
Hidden modes are either unreachable from the  input or unobservable  in the output, 
or  both.  To  explicitly  check which  is  the  case  in  this  example,  we  change  to modal 
coordinates,  so  the  original  description

Properties  of  LTI  State-Space  Models 

In  the  block  diagram  of  Figure  5.2  representing  the  state  equations  in  modal  co­
ordinates,  the  modes  are  individually  recognizable.  This  corresponds  to  the  fact 
that  the  original  A  matrix  has  been  diagonalized  by  the  coordinate  change.  From 
this  block  diagram  we  can  readily  see  by  inspection  that  the  unstable  mode  is  not 
observable in the output, since the gain connecting that mode to the output is zero. 
However,  it  is  reachable  from  the  input. 

Note  that  the  block  diagram  in  Figure  5.3  has  the  same  modes  and  input-output 
transfer  function  as  that  in  Figure  5.2.  However,  in  this  case  the  unstable  mode  is 
observable  but  not  reachable.

Evaluating  asymptotic  stability  of  a  linear,  periodically  varying  sys­

The  stability  of  linear  periodically  varying  systems  can  be  analyzed  by  methods 
that  are  close  to  those  used  for  LTI  systems.  Suppose,  for  instance,  that 

q[n + 1] = A[n]q[n]  ,  A[n] = A0  for  even  n, A[n] = A1  for  odd  n. 

Then

for  even  n,  so  the  dynamics  of  the  even  samples  is  governed  by  an  LTI model,  and 
the  stability  of  the  even  samples  is  accordingly  determined  by  the  eigenvalues  of 
the  constant  matrix  Aeven  = A1A0 .  The  stability  of  the  odd  samples  is  similarly 
governed  by  the  eigenvalues  of  the  matrix  Aodd  =  A0A1 ;  it  turns  out  that  the 
nonzero eigenvalues of  this matrix are  the  same as  those of Aeven ,  so either one can 
be  used  for  a  stability  check.
