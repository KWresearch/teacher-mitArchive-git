Transform  Representation  of  Signals 
and  LTI  Systems 

As  you  have  seen  in  your  prior  studies  of  signals  and  systems,  and  as  emphasized 
in  the  review  in  Chapter  2,  transforms  play  a  central  role  in  characterizing  and 
representing  signals  and  LTI  systems  in  both  continuous  and  discrete  time.  In 
this  chapter we  discuss  some  speciﬁc  aspects  of  transform  representations  that will 
play  an  important  role  in  later  chapters.  These  aspects  include  the  interpreta­
tion  of  Fourier  transform  phase  through  the  concept  of  group  delay,  and  methods 
—  referred  to  as  spectral  factorization  —  for  obtaining  a  Fourier  representation 
(magnitude  and  phase)  when  only  the  Fourier  transform  magnitude  is  known. 

3.1  FOURIER  TRANSFORM  MAGNITUDE  AND  PHASE 

The  Fourier  transform  of  a  signal  or  the  frequency  response  of  an  LTI  system  is  in 
general  a  complex-valued  function.  A magnitude-phase  representation  of  a  Fourier 
transform  X (jω)  takes  the  form 
X (jω) = |X (jω)|ej∠X (jω)  . 
In  eq.  (3.1),  X (jω) denotes  the  (non-negative)  magnitude  and  ∠X (jω)  denotes 
|
|
the  (real-valued)  phase.  For  example,  if X (jω)  is  the  sinc  function,  sin(ω)/ω ,  then 
|X (jω)| is the absolute value of this function, while ∠X (jω) is 0 in frequency ranges 
where  the  sinc  is positive,  and π  in  frequency  ranges where  the  sinc  is negative.  An 
alternative  representation  is  an  amplitude-phase  representation 

(3.1) 

A(ω)ej∠AX (jω) 

(3.2) 

in  which  A(ω) =  ±|X (jω)|  is  real  but  can  be  positive  for  some  frequencies  and 
negative for others.  Correspondingly, ∠AX (jω) = ∠X (jω) when A(ω) = + X (jω) , 
|
|
and ∠AX (jω) = ∠X (jω) ± π  when A(ω) = −|X (jω)|. 
This  representation  is  often 
preferred  when  its  use  can  eliminate  discontinuities  of  π  radians  in  the  phase  as 
A(ω)  changes  sign.  In  the  case  of  the  sinc  function  above,  for  instance, we  can pick 
A(ω) = sin(ω)/ω  and ∠A  = 0.  It  is  generally  convenient  in  the  following discussion 
for  us  to  assume  that  the  transform  under  discussion  has  no  zeros  on  the  jω -axis, 
so  that  we  can  take  A(ω) =  |X (jω)|  for  all  ω  (or,  if  we  wish,  A(ω) = −|X (jω)|  for 
all  ω).  A  similar  discussion  applies  also,  of  course,  in  discrete-time. 

In  either  a  magnitude-phase  representation  or  an  amplitude-phase  representation, 
the phase is ambiguous, as any integer multiple of 2π can be added at any frequency

without  changing  X (jω)  in  (3.1)  or  (3.2).  A  typical  phase  computation  resolves 
this ambiguity by generating the phase modulo 2π ,  i.e., as the phase passes through 
+π  it  “wraps  around”  to  −π  (or  from  −π  wraps  around  to  +π).  In  Section  3.2 
we  will  ﬁnd  it  convenient  to  resolve  this  ambiguity  by  choosing  the  phase  to  be 
a  continuous  function  of  frequency.  This  is  referred  to  as  the  unwrapped  phase, 
since  the  discontinuities  at ±π  are  unwrapped  to  obtain  a  continuous  phase  curve. 
The  unwrapped  phase  is  obtained  from ∠X (jω)  by  adding  steps  of  height  equal  to 
±π  or  ±2π  wherever  needed,  in  order  to  produce  a  continuous  function  of  ω .  The 
steps  of  height  ±π  are  added  at  points  where  X (jω)  passes  through  0,  to  absorb 
sign  changes  as  needed;  the  steps  of  height ±2π  are  added wherever  else  is  needed, 
invoking  the  fact  that  such  steps  make  no  diﬀerence  to  X (jω),  as  is  evident  from 
(3.1).  We shall proceed as though ∠X (jω)  is indeed continuous (and diﬀerentiable) 
at  the  points  of  interest,  understanding  that  continuity  can  indeed  be  obtained  in 
all  cases  of  interest  to  us  by  adding  in  the  appropriate  steps  of  height  ±π  or  ±2π . 
Typically, our intuition for the time-domain eﬀects of frequency response magnitude 
or  amplitude  on  a  signal  is  rather  well-developed.  For  example,  if  the  Fourier 
transform magnitude is signiﬁcantly attenuated at high frequencies, then we expect 
the  signal  to  vary  slowly  and  without  sharp  discontinuities.  On  the  other  hand,  a 
signal  in  which  the  low  frequencies  are  attenuated  will  tend  to  vary  rapidly  and 
without  slowly  varying  trends. 

In  contrast,  visualizing  the  eﬀect on a  signal of  the phase of  the  frequency  response 
of  a  system  is more  subtle,  but  equally  important.  We  begin  the  discussion  by ﬁrst 
considering several speciﬁc examples which are helpful in then considering the more 
general  case.  Throughout  this  discussion  we  will  consider  the  system  to  be  an  all-
pass system with unity gain, i.e.  the amplitude of the frequency response A(jω) = 1 
(continuous time) or A(ejΩ ) = 1 (discrete time) so that we can focus entirely on the 
eﬀect  of  the  phase.  The  unwrapped  phase  associated  with  the  frequency  response 
will  be  denoted  as  ∠AH (jω)  (continuous  time)  and  ∠AH (ejΩ )  (discrete  time). 

EXAMPLE  3.1 

Linear  Phase 

Consider  an  all-pass  system  with  frequency  response 
H (jω) = e−jαω 
(3.3) 
i.e.  in  an  amplitude/phase  representation  A(jω)  =  1  and  ∠AH (jω) =  −αω .  The 
unwrapped  phase  for  this  example  is  linear  with  respect  to  ω ,  with  slope  of  −α. 
For  input  x(t)  with  Fourier  transform  X (jω),  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  output 
is  Y (jω) = X (jω)e−jαω  and  correspondingly  the  output  y(t)  is  x(t − α).  In words, 
linear phase with a slope of −α corresponds to a time delay of α (or a time advance 
if  α  is  negative). 

For  a  discrete  time  system  with 
H (ejΩ ) = e−jαΩ 
|Ω| < π 
(3.4) 
the  phase  is  again  linear  with  slope  −α.  When  α  is  an  integer,  the  time  domain 
interpretation of the eﬀect on an input sequence x[n] is again straightforward and is

a simple delay (α positive) or advance (α negative) of  α .  When α is not an integer, 
|
|
the  eﬀect  is  still  commonly  referred  to  as  “a  delay  of  α”,  but  the  interpretation  is 
more  subtle.  If  we  think  of  x[n]  as  being  the  result  of  sampling  a  band-limited, 
continuous-time  signal  x(t)  with  sampling  period  T ,  the  output  y [n]  will  be  the 
result  of  sampling  the  signal  y(t) = x(t − αT )  with  sampling  period  T .  In  fact  we 
saw  this  result  in  Example  2.4  of  chapter  2  for  the  speciﬁc  case  of  a  half-sample

Note  that  the  phase  is  required  to  be  an  odd  function  of  ω  if  we  assume  that  the 
system  impulse  response  is  real  valued.  In  this  example,  we  consider  x(t)  to  be  of 
the  form 

(3.5) 
x(t) = s(t) cos(ω0 t + θ) 
i.e.  an  amplitude-modulated  signal  at  a  carrier  frequency  of  ω0 .  Consequently, 
X (jω)  can  be  expressed  as

For  this  example,  we  also  assume  that  S (jω)  is  bandlimited  to  ω <  Δ,  with  Δ

suﬃciently  small  so  that  the  term  S (jω − jω0 )ej θ  is  zero  for  ω <  0  and  the  term 
S (jω + jω0 )e−j θ  is  zero  for ω > 0,  i.e.  that  (ω0 − Δ) > 0.  The associated  spectrum 
of  x(t)  is  depicted  in  Figure  3.2.

With  these  assumptions  on  x(t),  it  is  relatively  straightforward  to  determine  the 
output  y(t).  Speciﬁcally,  the  system  frequency  response H (jω)  is 
½ 
Since  the  term  S (jω − jω0 )ej θ  in  eq.  (3.6)  is  non-zero  only  for  ω >  0,  it  is  simply 
multiplied  by  e−jφ ,  and  similarly  the  term  S (jω + jω0 )e−j θ  is  multiplied  only  by 
e+jφ .  Consequently,  the  output  frequency  response,  Y (jω),  is  given  by

3.2  GROUP  DELAY  AND  THE  EFFECT  OF  NONLINEAR  PHASE 

In  Example  3.1,  we  saw  that  a  phase  characteristic  that  is  linear  with  frequency 
corresponds  in  the  time  domain  to  a  time  shift.  In  this  section  we  consider  the

eﬀect  of  a  nonlinear  phase  characteristic.  We  again  assume  the  system  is  an  all-
pass  system  with  frequency  response 

H (jω) = A(jω)ej∠A [H (jω)]

with A(jω) = 1.  A general nonlinear unwrapped phase  characteristic  is depicted  in

As we  did  in Example  3.2, we  again  assume  that  x(t)  is  narrowband  of  the  form  of 
equation  (3.5)  and  as  depicted  in Figure  3.2.  We  next  assume  that Δ  in Figure  3.2 
is  suﬃciently  small  so  that  in  the  vicinity  of  ±ω0 ,  ∠AH (jω)  can  be  approximated 
suﬃciently  well  by  the  zeroth  and  ﬁrst  order  terms  of  a  Taylor’s  series  expansion,

∠AH (jω) ≈ ∠AH (jω0 ) − (ω − ω0 )τg (ω0 ) 
Similarly  in  a  small  region  around  ω = −ω0 ,  we make  the  approximation 
∠AH (jω) ≈ ∠AH (jω0 ) − (ω + ω0 )τg (−ω0 ) 
As  we  will  see  shortly,  the  quantity  τg (ω)  plays  a  key  role  in  our  interpretation  of 
the  eﬀect  on  a  signal  of  a  nonlinear  phase  characteristic.

We  recognize  HI (jω)  as  corresponding  to  Example  3.2.  Consequently,  with  x(t)

In  summary,  according  to  eqs.  (3.18)  and  (3.19a),  the  time-domain  eﬀect  of  the 
nonlinear phase for the narrowband group of frequencies around the frequency ω0  is 
to delay  the narrowband  signal by  the group delay,  τg (ω0 ), and apply an additional 
φ1
phase  shift  of  ω
to  the  carrier.  An  equivalent,  alternate  interpretation  is  that  the 
0 
time-domain envelope of the  frequency group  is delayed by the group delay and the 
carrier  is  delayed  by  the  phase  delay. 

. 

The discussion has been carried out  thus  far  for narrowband  signals.  To extend  the 
discussion  to broadband  signals, we need  only  recognize  that  any broadband  signal 
can  be  viewed  as  a  superposition  of  narrowband  signals.  This  representation  can 
in  fact  be  developed  formally  by  recognizing  that  the  system  in  Figure  3.6  is  an 
identity  system,  i.e.  r(t) = x(t)  as  long  as

By  choosing  the  ﬁlters  Hi (jω)  to  satisfy  eq.  (3.20)  and  to  be  narrowband  around 
center  frequencies  ωi ,  each  of  the  output  signals,  yi (t),  is  a  narrowband  signal. 
Consequently  the  time-domain  eﬀect  of  the  phase  of  G(jω)  is  to  apply  the  group

ωi ,  then  the  time  domain  eﬀect  is  for  diﬀerent  frequency  groups  to  arrive  at  the 
output  at  diﬀerent  times. 

As  an  illustration  of  this  eﬀect,  consider  G(jω)  in  Figure  3.6  to  be  the  continuous 
time  all-pass  system  with  frequency  response  amplitude,  phase  and  group  delay  as 
shown  in  Figure  3.7.  The  corresponding  impulse  response  is  shown  in  Figure  3.8. 

If the phase of G(jω) were linear with frequency, the impulse response would simply 
be  a  delayed  impulse,  i.e.  all  the  narrowband  components would  be  delayed  by  the 
same amount and correspondingly would add up to a delayed  impulse.  However, as 
we see in Figure 3.7, the group delay is not constant since the phase is nonlinear.  In 
particular,  frequencies  around  1200  Hz  are  delayed  signiﬁcantly  more  than  around 
other  frequencies.  Correspondingly,  in  Figure  3.8  we  see  that  frequency  group 
appearing  late  in  the  impulse  response. 

A  second  example  is  shown  in  Figure  3.9,  in  which  G(jω)  is  again  an  all-pass 
system with nonlinear phase and consequently non-constant group delay.  With this 
example,  we  would  expect  to  see  diﬀerent  delays  in  the  frequency  groups  around 
ω  = 2π  50,  ω  = 2π  100,  and  ω  = 2π  300  with  the  group  at  ω  = 2π  50  having

the  maximum  delay  and  therefore  appearing  last  in  the  impulse  response. 

In both of these examples, the input is highly concentrated in time (i.e.  an impulse) 
and  the  response  is  dispersed  in  time  because  of  the  non-constant  group  delay,  i.e.

a  channel  has  a  relatively  constant  frequency  response  magnitude  characteristic, 
nonlinear phase can result  in signiﬁcant distortion and other negative consequences 
because  of  the  resulting  time  dispersion.  For  this  reason,  it  is  often  essential  to 
incorporate  phase  equalization  to  compensate  for  non-constant  group-delay. 

As  a  third  example,  we  consider  an  all-pass  system  with  phase  and  group  delay  as 
shown  in  Figure  3.101 .  The  input  for  this  example  is  the  touch-tone  digit  “ﬁve” 
which  consists  of  two  very  narrowband  tones  at  center  frequencies  770  and  1336 
Hz.  The  time-domain  signal  and  its  two  narrowband  component  signals  are  shown 
in  Figure  3.11. 

FIGURE 3.10  Phase and group delay for all-pass ﬁlter for touch-tone signal example. 

The touch-tone signal is processed with multiple passes through the all-pass system 
of Figure  3.10.  From  the  group delay plot, we  expect  that,  in  a  single pass  through 
the  all-pass  ﬁlter,  the  tone  at  1336  Hz  would  be  delayed  by  about  2.5  milliseconds 
relative to the tone at 770 Hz.  After 200 passes, this would accumulate to a relative 
delay  of  about  0.5  seconds. 

In  Figure  3.12,  we  show  the  result  of  multiple  passes  through  ﬁlters  and  the  accu­
mulation  of  the  delays. 

3.3  ALL-PASS  AND  MINIMUM-PHASE  SYSTEMS 

Two  particularly  interesting  classes  of  stable  LTI  systems  are  all-pass  systems  and 
minimum-phase  systems.  We  deﬁne  and  discuss  them  in  this  section.

3.3.1  All-Pass  Systems 

An  all-pass  system  is  a  stable  system  for  which  the  magnitude  of  the  frequency 
response  is  a  constant,  independent  of  frequency.  The  frequency  response  in  the 
case  of  a  continuous-time  all-pass  system  is  thus  of  the  form 

Hap (jω) = Aej∠Hap (jω)  , 

(3.21) 

where  A  is  a  constant,  not  varying  with  ω .  Assuming  the  associated  transfer  func­
tion H (s)  is  rational  in  s,  it  will  correspondingly  have  the  form 
Y 
M s + a∗ 
k
Hap (s) = A 
s − ak
k=1 
Note  that  for  each  pole  at  s = +ak  this  has  a  zero  at  the  mirror  image  across  the 
;  and  if  ak  is  complex  and  the  system  impulse 
imaginary  axis,  namely  at  s 
=  −a
∗
k
response  is  real-valued,  every  complex  pole  and  zero will  occur  in  a  conjugate  pair, 
so  there  will  also  be  a  pole  at  s  +a= 
∗ and  a  zero  at  s  =  −ak .  An  example  of  a 
k 
pole-zero  diagram  (in  the  s-plane)  for  a  continuous-time  all-pass  system  is  shown 
in Figure  (3.13).  It  is  straightforward  to  verify  that  each  of  the M  factors  in  (3.22) 
has  unit magnitude  for  s = jω .

For  a  discrete-time  all-pass  system,  the  frequency  response  is  of  the  form 

Hap (ejΩ ) = Aej∠Hap (ejΩ )  .

The  poles  and  zeros  in  this  case  occur  at  conjugate  reciprocal  locations:  for  each 
pole at z = bk  there is a zero at z = 1/b∗k .  A zero at z = 0 (and associated pole at ∞) 
is obtained by setting bk  = ∞  in the corresponding factor above, after ﬁrst dividing 
both the numerator and denominator by bk ;  this results  in the corresponding factor 
in  (3.24)  being  just  z .  Again,  if  the  impulse  response  is  real-valued  then  every 
complex  pole  and  zeros  will  occur  in  a  conjugate  pair,  so  there  will  be  a  pole  at 
z  =  b∗ 
k  and  a  zero  at  z  = 1/bk .  An  example  of  a  pole-zero  diagram  (in  the  z 
plane)  for  a discrete-time  all-pass  system  is  shown  in Figure  (3.14).  It  is  once more

straightforward  to  verify  that  each  of  the  M  factors  in  (3.24)  has  unit  magnitude

The  phase  of  a  continuous-time  all-pass  system  will  be  the  sum  of  the  phases  as­
sociated  with  each  of  the  M  factors  in  (3.22).  Assuming  the  system  is  causal  (in

in  both  continuous- and  discrete-time,  the  frequency  response  of  a  causal  all-pass 
system  has  constant  magnitude  and  positive  group  delay  at  all  frequencies. 

3.3.2  Minimum-Phase  Systems 

In discrete-time, a stable system with a rational transfer function is called minimum-
phase  if  its  poles  and  zeros  are  all  inside  the  unit  circle,  i.e.,  have  magnitude  less 
than  unity.  This  is  equivalent  in  the  DT  case  to  the  statement  that  the  system  is 
stable  and  causal,  and  has  a  stable  and  causal  inverse. 

A  similar  deﬁnition  applies  in  the  case  of  a  stable  continuous-time  system  with  a 
rational  transfer  function.  Such  a  system  is  called  minimum-phase  if  its  poles  and

ﬁnite  zeros  are  in  the  left-half-plane,  i.e.,  have  real  parts  that  are  negative.  The 
system  is  therefore  necessarily  causal.  If  there  are  as many  ﬁnite  zeros  as  there  are 
poles,  then  a  CT  minimum-phase  system  can  equivalently  be  characterized  by  the 
statement  that  both  the  system  and  its  inverse  are  stable  and  causal,  just  as  we 
had  in  the  DT  case.  However,  it  is  quite  possible  —  and  indeed  common  —  for 
a  CT  minimum-phase  system  to  have  fewer  ﬁnite  zeros  than  poles.  (Note  that  a 
stable  CT  system  must  have  all  its  poles  at  ﬁnite  locations  in  the  s-plane,  since 
poles  at  inﬁnity  would  imply  that  the  output  of  the  system  involves  derivatives  of 
the  input, which  is  incompatible with stability.  Also, whereas  in the DT case a zero 
at  inﬁnity  is  clearly  outside  the  unit  circle,  in  the  CT  case  there  is  no  way  to  tell 
if  a  zero  at  inﬁnity  is  in  the  left  half  plane  or  not,  so  it  should  be  no  surprise  that 
the  CT  deﬁnition  involves  only  the  ﬁnite  zeros.) 

The use of the term ‘minimum phase’ is historical, and the property should perhaps 
more appropriately be termed ‘minimum group delay’, for reasons that we will bring 
out next.  To do this, we need a  fact that we shall shortly establish:  that any causal 
and  stable CT  system with  a  rational  transfer  function Hcs (s)  and  no  zeros  on  the 
imaginary  axis  can  be  represented  as  the  cascade  of  a  minimum-phase  system  and 
an  all-pass  system, 

Hcs (s) = Hmin (s)Hap (s)  . 

(3.25) 

Similarly,  in  the  DT  case,  provided  the  transfer  function  Hcs (z )  has  no  zeros  on

the  unit  circle,  it  can  be  written  as 

Hcs (z ) = Hmin (z )Hap (z )  . 

(3.26) 

The  frequency  response  magnitude  of  the  all-pass  factor  is  constant,  independent 
of frequency, and for convenience let us set this constant to unity.  Then from (3.25) 

|Hcs (jω)| =|Hmin (jω)|  ,  and 
grpdelay[Hcs (jω)] =grpdelay[Hmin (jω)] + grpdelay[Hap (jω)] 

(3.27a) 
(3.27b) 

and  similar  equations  hold  in  the  DT  case. 

We  will  see  in  the  next  section  that  the  minimum-phase  term  in  (3.25)  or  (3.26) 
can be uniquely determined  from  the magnitude of Hcs (jω),  respectively Hcs (ejΩ ). 
Consequently  all  causal,  stable  systems  with  the  same  frequency  response  magni­
tude  diﬀer  only  in  the  choice  of  the  all-pass  factor  in  (3.25)  or  (3.26).  However,  we 
have  shown  previously  that  all-pass  factors  must  contribute  positive  group  delay. 
Therefore we  conclude  from  (3.27b)  that  among  all  causal,  stable  systems with  the 
same  CT  frequency  response  magnitude,  the  one  with  no  all-pass  factors  in  (3.25) 
will  have  the minimum  group  delay.  The  same  result  holds  in  the  DT  case. 

(3.28) 

(3.29) 

We  shall  now  demonstrate  the  validity  of  (3.25);  the  corresponding  result  in  (3.26) 
for discrete time follows in a very similar manner.  Consider a causal, stable transfer 
function Hcs (s)  expressed  in  the  form 
QM1  (s − lk ) QM2  (s − ri )
Hcs (s) = A  k=1
i=1
QN 
n=1 (s − dn
)
where  the  dn ’s  are  the  poles  of  the  system,  the  lk ’s  are  the  zeros  in  the  left-half 
plane  and  the  ri ’s  are  the  zeros  in  the  right-half  plane.  Since  Hcs (s)  is  stable  and 
causal,  all  of  the  poles  are  in  the  left-half  plane  and  would  be  associated  with  the 
factor  Hmin (s)  in  (3.25),  as  would  be  all  of  the  zeros  lk .  We  next  represent  the 
right-half-plane  zeros  as

Y 
M2

Y
(s − ri ) = 
(s + ri )
(s + ri ) 
i=1 
i=1 
i=1 
Since  Re{ri }  is  positive,  the  ﬁrst  factor  in  (3.29)  represents  left-half-plane  zeros. 
The second factor corresponds to all-pass terms with  left-half-plane poles, and with 
zeros  at  mirror  image  locations  to  the  poles.  Thus,  combining  (3.28)  and  (3.29), 
Hcs (s)  has  been  decomposed  according  to  (3.25)  where

3.4  SPECTRAL  FACTORIZATION 

(3.34) 

The  minimum-phase/all-pass  decomposition  developed  above  is  useful  in  a  variety 
of contexts.  One  that  is of particular  interest  to us  in  later chapters arises when we 
we  are  given  or  have measured  the magnitude  of  the  frequency  response  of  a  stable 
system  with  a  rational  transfer  function  H (s)  (and  real-valued  impulse  response), 
and  our  ob jective  is  to  recover  H (s)  from  this  information.  A  similar  task  may  be 
posed  in  the  DT  case,  but  we  focus  on  the  CT  version  here.  We  are  thus  given 
|H (jω)|2  = H (jω)H ∗ (jω) 
or,  since H ∗ (jω) = H (−jω), 
|H (jω)|2  = H (jω)H (−jω)  . 
Now  H (jω)  is H (s)  for  s = jω ,  and  therefore 
¯¯¯s=jω 
For  any  numerator  or  denominator  factor  (s − a)  in  H (s),  there  will  be  a  corre­
sponding  factor  (−s − a)  in  H (s)H (−s).  Thus  H (s)H (−s)  will  consist  of  factors 
in  the  numerator  or  denominator  of  the  form  (s − a)(−s − a) = −s2  + a2 ,  and  will 
therefore  be  a  rational  function  of  s2 .  Consequently  H (jω) 2  will  be  a  rational 
|
|
function  of ω2 .  Thus,  if we  are  given  or  can  express  H (jω) 2  as  a  rational  function 
|
|
of ω2 , we can obtain the product H (s)H (−s) by making the substitution ω2  = −s . 
2
The product H (s)H (−s) will always have  its zeros in pairs that are mirrored across 
the imaginary axis of the s-plane, and similarly for its poles.  For any pole or zero of 
H (s)H (−s) at the real value a,  there will be another at the mirror  image −a, while 
for  any pole  or  zero  at  the  complex value  q ,  there will be  others  at  q∗ , −q  and −q∗ ,

forming  a  complex  conjugate  pair  (q , q∗ )  and  its  mirror  image  (−q∗ , −q).  We  then 
need  to  assign  one  of  each  mirrored  real  pole  and  zero  and  one  of  each  mirrored 
conjugate  pair  of  poles  and  zeros  to H (s),  and  the  mirror  image  to H (−s). 
If  we  assume  (or  know)  that  H (s)  is  causal,  in  addition  to  being  stable,  then 
we  would  assign  the  left-half  plane  poles  of  each  pair  to  H (s).  With  no  further 
knowledge or assumption we have no guidance on the assignment of the zeros other 
than  the  requirement  of  assigning  one  of  each  mirror  image  pair  to  H (s)  and  the 
other  to H (−s).  If  we  further  know  or  assume  that  the  system  is minimum-phase, 
then the  left-half-plane zeros  from each mirrored pair are assigned to H (s), and the 
right-half-plane  zeros  to  H (−s).  This  process  of  factoring  H (s)H (−s)  to  obtain 
H (s)  is  referred  to  as  spectral  factorization.

H (s)H (−s) = 
(s + 2)(−s + 2)(s + 3)(−s + 3) 
It  now  remains  to  associate  appropriate  factors  with  H (s)  and  H (−s).  Assuming 
the  system  is  causal  in  addition  to  being  stable,  the  two  left-half  plane  poles  at 
s = −2  and  s = −3  must  be  associated  with  H (s).  With  no  further  assumptions, 
either one of  the numerator  factors can be associated with H (s) and  the other with 
H (−s).  However,  if  we  know  or  assume  that  H (s)  is  minimum  phase,  then  we 
would  assign  the  left-half  plane  zero  to H (s),  resulting  in  the  choice 

(3.39) 

H (s) = 

(s + 1) 
(s + 2)(s + 3) 

(3.40) 

In the discrete-time case, a similar development leads to an expression for H (z )H (1/z ) 
from knowledge of  |H (ejΩ )|2 .  The  zeros of H (z )H (1/z ) occur  in  conjugate  recipro­
cal  pairs,  and  similarly  for  the  poles.  We  again  have  to  split  such  conjugate  recip­
rocal  pairs,  assigning  one  of  each  to H (z ),  the  other  to H (1/z ),  based  on whatever 
additional  knowledge  we  have.  For  instance,  if  H (z )  is  known  to  be  causal  in  ad­
dition  to  being  stable,  then  all  the  poles  of  H (z )H (1/z )  that  are  in  the  unit  circle 
are  assigned  to  H (z );  and  if  H (z )  is  known  to  be  minimum  phase  as  well,  then  all 
the  zeros  of  H (z )H (1/z )  that  are  in  the  unit  circle  are  assigned  to H (z ).
