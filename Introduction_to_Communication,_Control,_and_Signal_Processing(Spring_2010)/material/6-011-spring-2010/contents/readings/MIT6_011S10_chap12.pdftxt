12.1  PULSE  AMPLITUDE  MODULATION 

In Chapter  2, we  discussed  the  discrete-time  processing  of  continuous-time  signals, 
and  in  that  context  reviewed  and  discussed  D/C  conversion  for  reconstructing  a 
continuous-time  signal  from  a  discrete-time  sequence.  Another  common  context 
in  which  it  is  useful  and  important  to  generate  a  continuous-time  signal  from  a 
sequence is in communication systems, in which discrete data — for example, digital 
or quantized data — is to be transmitted over a channel in the form of a continuous-
time  signal.  In  this  case,  unlike  in  the  case  of  DT  processing  of  CT  signals,  the 
resulting  continuous-time  signal  will  be  converted  back  to  a  discrete-time  signal  at 
the  receiving  end.  Despite  this  diﬀerence  in  the  two  contexts,  we  will  see  that  the 
same  basic  analysis  applies  to  both. 

As  examples  of  the  communication  of  DT  information  over  CT  channels,  consider 
transmitting  a  binary  sequence  of  1’s  and  0’s  from  one  computer  to  another  over  a 
telephone  line  or  cable,  or  from  a  digital  cell  phone  to  a  base  station  over  a  high-
frequency  electromagnetic  channel.  These  instances  correspond  to  having  analog 
channels that require the transmitted signal to be continuous in time, and to also be 
compatible with  the bandwidth and other constraints of  the channel.  Such  require­
ments  impact  the  choice  of  continuous-time waveform  that  the  discrete  sequence  is 
modulated  onto. 

The translation of a DT signal to a CT signal appropriate for transmission, and the 
translation  back  to  a  DT  signal  at  the  receiver,  are  both  accomplished  by  devices 
referred  to  as  modems  (modulators/demodulators).  Pulse  Amplitude  Modulation 
(PAM)  underlies  the  operation  of  a  wide  variety  of  modems. 

12.1.1  The  Transmitted  Signal 

The  basic  idea  in  PAM  for  communication  over  a  CT  channel  is  to  transmit  a  se­
quence  of  CT  pulses  of  some  pre-speciﬁed  shape  p(t),  with  the  sequence  of  pulse 
amplitudes  carrying  the  information.  The  associated  baseband  signal  at  the  trans­
mitter (which is then usually modulated onto some carrier to form a bandpass signal

where  the  numbers  a[n]  are  the  pulse  amplitudes,  and  T  is  the  pulse  repetition 
interval  or  the  inter-symbol  spacing,  so  1/T  is  the  symbol  rate  (or  “baud”  rate). 
An  individual  pulse may  be  conﬁned  to  an  interval  of  length T ,  as  shown  in Figure 
12.1,  or  it  may  extend  over  several  intervals,  as  we  will  see  in  several  examples 
shortly.  The DT signal a[n] may comprise samples of a bandlimited analog message 
(taken  at  the  Nyquist  rate  or  higher,  and  generally  quantized  to  a  speciﬁed  set  of 
levels,  for  instance 32  levels);  or 1 and 0  for on/oﬀ or “unipolar” signaling;  or 1 and 
−1  for  antipodal  or  “polar”  signaling;  or  1,  0  and  −1  for  “bipolar”  signaling;  each 
of  these  possibilities  is  illustrated  in  Figure  12.1. 

The particular pulse shape in Figure 12.1 is historically referred to as an RZ (return­
to-zero)  pulse  when  Δ  < T  and  an  NRZ  (non-return-to-zero)  pulse  when  Δ  =  T . 
These  pulses  would  require  substantial  channel  bandwidth  (of  the  order  of  1/Δ) 
in  order  to  be  transmitted  without  signiﬁcant  distortion,  so  we  may  wish  to  ﬁnd 
alternative  choices  that  use  less  bandwidth,  to  accommodate  the  constraints  of  the 
channel.  Such  considerations  are  important  in  designing  appropriate  pulse  shapes, 
and  we  shall  elaborate  on  them  shortly.

Pulse  Amplitude  Modulation  213 

If  p(t)  is  chosen  such  that  p(0)  =  1  and  p(nT )  =  0  for  n  =  0,  then  we  could 
recover  the  amplitudes  a[n]  from  the  PAM  waveform  x(t)  by  just  sampling  x(t)  at 
times nT , since x(nT ) = a[n] in this case.  However, our interest is in recovering the 
amplitudes from the signal at the receiver, rather than directly from the transmitted 
signal,  so  we  need  to  consider  how  the  communication  channel  aﬀects  x(t).  Our 
ob jective  will  be  to  recover  the  DT  signal  in  as  simple  a  fashion  as  possible,  while 
compensating  for  distortion  and  noise  in  the  channel. 

12.1.2  The  Received  Signal 

When  we  transmit  a  PAM  signal  through  a  channel,  the  characteristics  of  the 
channel  will  aﬀect  our  ability  to  accurately  recover  the  pulse  amplitudes  a[n]  from 
the  received  signal  r(t).  We  might  model  r(t)  as 
r(t) = h(t) ∗ x(t) + η(t) 
corresponding to the channel being modeled as LTI with impulse response h(t), and 
channel  noise  being  represented  through  the  additive  noise  signal  η(t).  We  would 
still  typically  try  to  recover  the  pulse  amplitudes  a[n]  from  samples  of  r(t)  —  or 
from  samples  of  an  appropriately  ﬁltered  version  of  r(t) — with  the  samples  taken 
at  intervals  of  T . 

(12.2) 

The  overall  model  is  shown  in  Figure  12.2,  with  f (t)  representing  the  impulse 
response  of  an  LTI  ﬁlter  at  the  receiver.  This  receiver  ﬁlter  will  play  a  key  role  in 
ﬁltering  out  the  part  of  the  noise  that  lies  outside  the  frequency  bands  in  which 
the  signal  information  is  concentrated.  Here,  we  ﬁrst  focus  on  the  noise-free  case 
(for  which  one  would  normally  set  f (t) = δ(t),  corresponding  to  no  ﬁltering  before 
sampling  at  the  receiver  end),  but  for  generality we  shall  take  account  of  the  eﬀect 
of  the  ﬁlter  f (t)  as  well.

12.1.3  Frequency-Domain  Characterizations 

Denote the CTFT of the pulse p(t) by P (jω), and similarly for the other CT signals 
in  Figure  12.2.  If  the  frequency  response  H (jω)  of  the  channel  is  unity  over  the 
frequency  range  where  P (jω)  is  signiﬁcant,  then  a  single  pulse  p(t)  is  transmitted 
essentially  without  distortion.  In  this  case,  we might  invoke  the  linearity  and  time 
invariance  of  our  channel  model  to  conclude  that  x(t)  in  (12.1)  is  itself  transmit­
ted  essentially  without  distortion,  in  which  case  r(t)  ≈  x(t)  in  the  noise-free  case

that  we  are  considering.  However,  this  conclusion  leaves  the  possiblity  that  dis­
tortions  which  are  insigniﬁcant  when  a  single  pulse  is  transmitted  accumulate  in  a 
non-negligible way when  a  succession  of pulses  is  transmitted.  We  should  therefore 
directly  examine  x(t),  r(t),  and  their  corresponding  Fourier  transforms.  The  un­
derstanding  we  obtain  from  this  is  a  prerequisite  for  designing  P (jω)  and  picking 
the  inter-symbol  time  T  for  a  given  channel,  and  also  allows  us  to  determine  the 
inﬂuence  of  the  DT  signal  a[n]  on  the  CT  signals  x(t)  and  r(t). 
To  compute  X (jω),  we  take  the  transform  of  both  sides  of  (12.1): 
a[n] e−jωnT ´ 
³X 
P (jω)
n 
=  A(ejΩ )|Ω=ωT  P (jω) 
where  A(ejΩ )  denotes  the  DTFT  of  the  sequence  a[n].  The  quantity  A(ejΩ )|Ω=ωT 
that appears  in the above expression  is simply a uniform re-scaling of the frequency 
axis  of  the  DTFT;  in  particular,  the  point  Ω  =  π  in  the  DTFT  is  mapped  to  the 
point  ω = π/T  in  the  expression  A(ejΩ )|Ω=ωT . 
The  expression  in  (12.3)  therefore  describes  X (jω)  for  us,  assuming  the  DTFT  of 
the  sequence  a[n]  is  well  deﬁned.  For  example,  if  a[n] = 1  for  all  n,  corresponding 
to  periodic  repetition  of  the  basic  pulse  waveform  p(t),  then  A(ejΩ ) = 2πδ(Ω)  for 
|Ω| ≤ π ,  and  repeats  with  period  2π  outside  this  range.  Hence  X (jω)  comprises  a 
train of  impulses spaced apart by 2π/T ;  the strength of each  impulse  is 2π/T  times 
the  value  of P (jω)  at  the  location  of  the  impulse  (note  that  the  scaling property  of 
impulses  yields  δ(Ω) = δ(ωT ) = (1/T )δ(ω)  for  positive  T ). 

(12.3) 

In the absence of noise,  the received signal r(t) and the signal b(t) that results  from 
ﬁltering  at  the  receiver  are  both  easily  characterized  in  the  frequency  domain: 

R(jω) = H (jω)X (jω)  ,

B (jω) = F (jω)H (jω)X (jω)  . 

(12.4) 

Some  important  constraints  emerge  from  (12.3)  and  (12.4).  Note  ﬁrst  that  for  a 
general  DT  signal  a[n],  necessary  information  about  the  signal  will  be  distributed 
in  its  DTFT  A(ejΩ )  at  frequencies  Ω  throughout  the  interval  |Ω| ≤  π ;  knowing 
A(ejΩ )  only  in  a  smaller  range  |Ω| ≤  Ωa  < π  will  in  general  be  insuﬃcient  to 
allow  reconstruction  of  the  DT  signal.  Now,  setting  Ω = ωT  as  speciﬁed  in  (12.3), 
we  see  that  A(ejωT )  will  contain  necessary  information  about  the  DT  signal  at 
frequencies  ω  that  extend  throughout  the  interval  |ω | ≤  π/T .  Thus,  if  P (jω) =6
0 
for  |ω | ≤  π/T  then  X (jω)  preserves  the  information  in  the  DT  signal;  and  if 
H (jω)P (jω)  6=  0  for  |ω | ≤  π/T  then  R(jω)  preserves  the  information  in  the  DT 
signal;  and  if  F (jω)H (jω)P (jω) =6
0  for  |ω | ≤  π/T  then  B (jω)  preserves  the 
information  in  the  DT  signal. 

The  above  constraints  have  some  design  implications.  A  pulse  for  which  P (jω) 
was  nonzero  only  in  a  strictly  smaller  interval  |ω | ≤ ωp  < π/T  would  cause  loss  of 
information  in  going  from  the DT  signal  to  the PAM  signal x(t),  and would  not  be 
a  suitable  pulse  for  the  chosen  symbol  rate  1/T  (but  could  become  a  suitable  pulse 
if  the  symbol  rate  was  reduced  appropriately,  to  ωp /π  or  less).

Section  12.1 

Pulse  Amplitude  Modulation  215 

Similarly,  even  if  the  pulse  was  appropriately  designed  so  that  x(t)  preserved  the 
information  in  the  DT  signal,  if  we  had  a  lowpass  channel  for  which  H (jω)  was 
nonzero  only  in  a  strictly  smaller  interval  |ω | ≤  ωc  <  π/T  (so  ωc  is  the  cutoﬀ 
frequency  of  the  channel),  then  we  would  lose  information  about  the  DT  signal  in 
going  from x(t) to r(t);  the chosen symbol rate 1/T  would be  inappropriate  for this 
channel, and would need to be reduced to ωc/π  in order to preserve the information 
in  the  DT  signal. 

12.1.4 

Inter-Symbol  Interference  at  the  Receiver 

In  the absence of any channel  impairments,  the  signal values can be  recovered  from 
the transmitted pulse trains shown in Figure 12.1 by re-sampling at the times which 
are  integer multiples  of  T .  However,  these  pulses,  while  nicely  time  localized,  have 
inﬁnite  bandwidth.  Since  any  realistic  channel  will  have  a  limited  bandwidth,  one 
eﬀect of a communication channel on a PAM waveform is to “de-localize” or disperse 
the  energy  of  each  pulse  through  low-pass  ﬁltering.  As  a  consequence,  pulses  that 
may not have overlapped (or that overlapped only benignly) at the transmitter may 
overlap  at  the  receiver  in  a  way  that  impedes  the  recovery  of  the  pulse  amplitudes 
from  samples  of  r(t),  i.e.  in  a  way  that  leads  to  inter-symbol  interference  (ISI). 
We  now  make  explicit  what  condition  is  required  in  order  for  ISI  to  be  eliminated

from  the  ﬁltered  signal  b(t)  at  the  receiver.  When  this  no-ISI  condition  is  met,  we 
will  again  be  able  to  recover  the  DT  signal  by  simply  sampling  b(t).  Based  on  this 
condition,  we  can  identify  the  additional  constraints  that  must  be  satisﬁed  by  the 
pulse shape p(t) and the impulse response f (t) of the ﬁlter (or channel compensator 
or  equalizer)  at  the  receiver  so  as  to  eliminate  or  minimize  ISI. 
With x(t) as given in (12.1), and noting that b(t) = f (t) ∗ h(t) ∗ x(t) in the noise-free 
case,  we  can  write 
b(t) = X

g(0) = c ,  and  g(nT ) = 0  for  nonzero  integers  n, 

(12.7) 

where  c  is  some  nonzero  constant.  If  this  condition  is  satisﬁed,  then  if  follows  from 
(12.5)  that  b(nT ) = c.a[n],  and  consequently  the DT  signal  is  exactly  recovered  (to 
within  the  known  scale  factor  c). 

As  an  example,  suppose  that  g(t)  in  (12.6)  is

Then  choosing  the  inter-symbol  spacing  to  be  T  =

T ,  as  illustrated  in  Figure  12.4.

We  are  thereby  able  to  transmit  at  a  symbol  rate  that  is  twice  the  cutoﬀ  frequency 
of  the  channel.  From  what  was  said  earlier,  in  the  discussion  following  (12.3)  on 
constraints  involving  the  symbol  rate  and  the  channel  cutoﬀ  frequency,  we  cannot 
expect  to  do  better  in  general. 

More  generally,  in  the  next  section  we  translate  the  no-ISI  time-domain  condition 
in  (12.7)  to  one  that  is  useful  in  designing  p(t)  and  f (t)  for  a  given  channel.  The 
approach  is  based  on  the  frequency-domain  translation  of  the  no-ISI  condition, 
leading  to  a  result  that  was  ﬁrst  articulated  by  Nyquist.

12.2  NYQUIST  PULSES 

Section  12.2 

Nyquist  Pulses  217 

The  frequency domain  interpretation of  the no-ISI  condition of  (12.7) was  explored 
by  Nyquist  in  1924  (and  extended  by  him  in  1928  to  a  statement  of  the  sampling 
theorem —  this  theorem  then waited  almost  20  years  to  be  brought  to  prominence 
by  Gabor  and  Shannon). 

Consider  sampling  g(t)  with  a  periodic  impulse  train: 
g(t) = g(t)  X 
+∞
δ(t − nT )  . 
(12.10) 
b
n=−∞ 
Then  our  requirements  on  g(t)  in  (12.7)  imply  that  gb(t) =  c δ(t),  an  impulse  of 
strength  c,  whose  transform  is  Gb(jω) =  c.  Taking  transforms  of  both  sides  of 
(12.10),  and  utilizing  the  fact  that  multiplication  in  the  time  domain  corresponds 
to  convolution  in  the  frequency  domain,  we  obtain

Gb(jω) = c =

G(jω − jm

m=−∞ 
The  expression  on  the  right  hand  side  of  (12.11)  represents  a  replication  of  G(jω) 
(scaled  by  1/T )  at  every  integer  multiple  of  2π/T  along  the  frequency  axis.  The 
Nyquist requirement is thus that G(jω) and its replications, spaced 2πm/T  apart for 
all  integer m,  add up  to a  constant.  Some  examples of G(jω) = F (jω)H (jω)P (jω) 
that  satisfy  this  condition  are  given  below. 

The  particular  case  of  the  sinc  function  of  (12.8)  and  (12.9)  certainly  satisﬁes  the 
Nyquist  condition  of  (12.11). 

If  we  had  an  ideal  lowpass  channel  H (jω)  with  bandwidth  ωc  or  greater,  then 
choosing p(t) to be the sinc pulse of (12.8) and not doing any ﬁltering at the receiver 
— so F (jω) = 1 — would result in no ISI. However, there are two problems with the 
sinc  characteristic.  First,  the  signal  extends  indeﬁnitely  in  time  in  both  directions. 
Second,  the  sinc  has  a  very  slow  roll-oﬀ  in  time  (as  1/t).  This  slow  roll-oﬀ  in  time 
is coupled to the sharp cut-oﬀ of the transform of the sinc  in the  frequency domain. 
This  is  a  familiar  manifestation  of  time-frequency  duality:  quick  transition  in  one 
domain  means  slow  transition  in  the  other. 

It  is  highly  desirable  in  practice  to  have  pulses  that  taper  oﬀ more  quickly  in  time 
than a  sinc.  One  reason  is  that,  given  the  inevitable  inaccuracies  in  sampling  times 
due  to  timing  jitter,  there will be  some unavoidable  ISI, and  this  ISI will propagate 
for  unacceptably  long  times  if  the  underlying  pulse  shape  decays  too  slowly.  Also, 
a  faster  roll-oﬀ  allows  better  approximation  of  a  two-sided  signal  by  a  one-sided 
signal,  as  would  be  required  for  a  causal  implementation.  The  penalty  for  more 
rapid  pulse  roll-oﬀ  in  time  is  that  the  transition  in  the  frequency  domain  has  to 
be  more  gradual,  necessitating  a  larger  bandwidth  for  a  given  symbol  rate  (or  a 
reduced  symbol  rate  for  a  given  bandwidth). 

The  two  examples  in Figure 12.5 have  smoother  transitions  than  the previous  case, 
and  correspond  to  pulses  that  fall  oﬀ  as  1/t2 .  It  is  evident  that  both  can  be  made

to  determine  the  corresponding  pulse  transform  P (jω),  if we  ﬁx  F (jω) = 1.  In the 
presence  of  channel  noise  that  corrupts  the  received  signal  r(t),  it  turns  out  that  it 
is  best  to  only  do  part  of  the  pulse  shaping  at  the  transmitter,  with  the  rest  done 
at  the  receiver  prior  to  sampling.  For  instance,  if  the  channel  has  no  distortion 
in  the  passband  (i.e.,  if  H (jω)  =  1  in  the  passband)  and  if  the  noise  intensity  is

assuming  that  G(jω)  is  purely  real,  and  this  is  also  the  optimal  choice  of  receiver 
ﬁlter  F (jω).  We  shall  say  a  little  more  about  this  sort  of  issue  when  we  deal  with 
matched  ﬁltering  in  a  later  chapter. 

12.3  CARRIER  TRANSMISSION 

The  previous  discussion  centered  around  the  design  of  baseband  pulses.  For  trans­
mission  over  phone  lines,  wireless  links,  satellites,  etc.  the  baseband  signal  needs 
to  be  modulated  onto  a  carrier,  i.e.  converted  to  a  passband  signal.  This  also 
opens  opportunities  for  augmentation  of  PAM.  The  table  in  Figure  12.7  shows  the 
evolution of telephone  line digital modem standards.  FSK refers to  frequency-shift­
keying, PSK to phase-shift-keying, and QAM to quadrature amplitude modulation, 
each  of  which  we  describe  in  more  detail  below.  The  indicated  increase  in  symbol 
rate  (or  baud  rate)  and  bit  rates  over  the  years  corresponds  to  improvements  in 
signal  processing,  to  better  modulation  schemes,  to  the  use  of  better  conditioned 
channels,  and  to  more  elaborate  coding  (and  correspondingly  complex  decoding, 
but  now  well  within  real-time  computational  capabilities  of  digital  receivers). 

For  baseband  PAM,  the  transmitted  signal  is  of  the  form  of  equation  (12.1)  i.e. 
x(t) = X 
a[n] p(t − nT ) 
n 
where  p(t)  is  a  lowpass  pulse.  When  this  is  amplitude-modulated  onto  a  carrier, 
the  transmitted  signal  takes  the  form 
s(t) = X 
n 
where  ωc  and  θc  are  the  carrier  frequency  and  phase.

220  Chapter 12 

Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) 

In  the  simplest  form of  equation  (12.14),  speciﬁcally with ωc  and  θc  ﬁxed,  equation 
(12.14)  corresponds  to  using  amplitude  modulation  to  shift  the  frequency  content 
from  baseband  to  a  band  centered  at  the  carrier  frequency  ωc .  However,  since  two 
additional  parameters  have  been  introduced  (i.e.  ωc  and  θc )  this  opens  additional 
possibilities  for  embedding  data  in  s(t).  Speciﬁcally,  in  addition  to  changing  the 
amplitude  in  each  symbol  interval,  we  can  consider  changing  the  carrier  frequency 
and/or  the  phase  in  each  symbol  interval.  These  alternatives  lead  to  frequency-
shift-keying  (FSK)  and  phase-shift-keying  (PSK). 

12.3.1  FSK 

With  frequency  shift  keying  (12.14)  takes  the  form 
s(t) = X 
a[n] p(t − nT ) cos((ω0  + Δn )t + θc ) 
n 
where ω0  is the nominal carrier frequency and Δn  is the shift in the carrier frequency 
in  symbol  interval  n.  In  principle  in  FSK  both  a[n]  and  Δn  can  incorporate  data 
although  it  is  typically  the  case  that  in  FSK  the  amplitude  does  not  change. 

(12.15) 

12.3.2  PSK 

In  phase  shift  keying  (12.14)  takes  the  form 
s(t) = X 
a[n] p(t − nT ) cos(ωc t + θn ) 
n 
In  each  symbol  interval,  information  can  then  be  incorporated  in  both  the  pulse 
amplitude  a[n]  and  the  carrier  phase  θn .  In  what  is  typically  referred  to  as  PSK, 
information  is  only  incorporated  in  the  phase,  i.e.  a[n] = a = constant. 

(12.16) 

For  example,  with 

θn  =

2πbn
M 

;  bn  a  non-negative  integer 

(12.17) 

one of M  symbols can be encoded  in the phase  in each symbol  interval.  For M  = 2, 
θn  = 0  or  π ,  commonly  referred  to  as  binary  PSK  (BPSK). With M  = 4,  θn  takes 
π .

2 
To  interpret  PSK  somewhat  diﬀerently  and  as  a  prelude  to  expanding  the  discus­
sion  to  a  further  generalization  (quadrature  amplitude  modulation  or  QAM)  it  is 
convenient  to  express  equation  (12.16)  in  some  alternate  forms.  For  example, 
s(t) = X

Equation  12.19  is  referred  to  as  the  quadrature  form  of  equation  12.16  and  I (t) 
and  Q(t)  are  referred  to  as  the  in-phase  and  quadrature  components.  For  BPSK, 
ai [n] = ±a  and  aq [n] = 0. 
For  PSK  with  θn  in  the  form  of  equation  12.17  and M  = 4,  θn  can  take  on  any  of 
π .  In  the  form  of  equations  12.22  and  12.23  ai [n]  will

then  be  either  +a, −a,  or  zero  and  aq [n]  will  be  either  +a, −a,  or  zero.  However, 
clearly  QPSK  can  only  encode  four  symbols  in  the  phase  not  nine,  i.e.  the  various 
possibilities  for  ai [n]  and  aq [n]  are  not  independent.  For  example,  for  M  =  4,  if 
ai [n] = +a  then  aq [n]  must  be  zero  since  ai [n] = +a  implies  that  θn  =  0.  A  con­
venient way  of  looking  at  this  is  through what’s  referred  to  as  an  I -Q  constellation 
as  shown  in  Figure  12.8.

Each  point  in  the  constellation  represents  a  diﬀerent  symbol  that  can  be  encoded, 
and clearly with the constellation of Figure 12.8 one of four symbols can be encoded 
in  each  symbol  interval  (recall  that  for  now,  the  amplitude  a[n]  is  constant.  This 
will  change  when  we  expand  the  discussion  shortly  to  QAM).

(12.24) 

In this case, the amplitude modulation of I (t) and Q(t) (equations 12.20 and 12.21) 
can be done independently.  Modulation with this constellation is commonly referred 
to  as  QPSK  (quadrature  phase-shift  keying). 

In PSK as described above,  a[n] was assumed  constant.  By  incorporating  encoding 
in  both  the  amplitude  a[n]  and  phase  θn  in  equation  12.16  we  are  led  to  a  richer 
form of modulation referred to as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). In the 
form  of  equations  (12.19  - 12.21)  we  now  allow  ai [n]  and  aq [n]  to  be  chosen  from  a 
richer  constellation. 

12.3.3  QAM 

The  QAM  constellation  diagram  is  shown  in  Figure  12.10  for  the  case  where  each 
set  of  amplitudes  can  take  the  values  ±a  and  ±3a.  The  16  diﬀerent  combinations 
that  are  available  in  this  case  can  be  used  to  code  4  bits,  as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure. 
This particular constellation  is what  is used  in  the V.32ALT  standard  shown  in  the 
table  of  Figure  12.7.  In  this  standard,  the  carrier  frequency  is  1,800  Hz,  and  the 
symbol  frequency  or  baud  rate  (1/T )  is  2,400  Hz.  With  4  bits  per  symbol,  this 
works  out  to  the  indicated  9,600  bits/second.  One  baseband  pulse  shape  p(t)  that 
may  be used  is  the  square  root  of  the  cosine-transition  pulse mentioned  earlier,  say 
with  β  = 0.3.  This  pulse  contains  frequencies  as  high  as  1.3 × 1, 200  =  1, 560  Hz.

Section  12.3 

Carrier  Transmission  223 

After modulation of  the 1,800 Hz  carrier,  the  signal occupies  the band  from 240 Hz 
to  3,360  Hz,  which  is  right  in  the  passband  of  the  voice  telephone  channel. 

The two faster modems shown in the table use more elaborate QAM-based schemes. 
The V.32bis  standard  involves  128QAM, which  could  in principle  convey 7 bits per 
symbol,  but  at  the  price  of  greater  sensitivity  to  noise  (because  the  constellation 
points  are  more  tightly  clustered  for  a  given  signal  power).  However,  the  QAM 
in  this  case  is  actually  combined  with  so-called  trel lis-coded  modulation  (TCM), 
which  in  eﬀect  codes  in  some  redundancy  (by  introducing  dependencies  among  the 
modulating  amplitudes),  leading  to  greater  noise  immunity  and  an  eﬀective  rate  of 
6 bits per  symbol  (think of  the TCM as  in  eﬀect  reserving a bit  for  error  checking). 
The  symbol  rate here  is  still  2,400 Hz,  so  the  transmission  is  at  6 × 2, 400 = 14, 400 
bits/second.  Similarly,  the  V.34  standard  involves  1024QAM,  which  could  convey 
10  bits  per  symbol,  although  with  more  noise  sensitivity.  The  combination  with 
TCM  introduces  redundancy  for  error  control,  and  the  resulting  bit  rate  is  28,800 
bits/second  (9  eﬀective  bits  times  a  symbol  frequency  of  3,200  Hz). 

Demodulation  of  Quadrature  Modulated  PAM  signals: 
The  carrier  modulated  signals  in  the  form  of  equations  (12.19  - 12.23)  can  carry 
encoded data in both the I  and Q components I (t) and Q(t).  Therefore in demodu­
lation we must be able to extract these seperately.  This is done through quadrature 
demodulation  as  shown  in  Figure  12.11 

In  both  the  modulation  and  demodulation,  it  is  assumed  that  the  bandwidth  of 
p(t)  is  low  compared  with  the  carrier  frequency  wc  so  that  the  bandwidth  of  I (t) 
and  Q(t)  are  less  than  ωc .  The  input  signal  ri (t)  is 
ri (t) = I (t)cos 2 (ωc t) − Q(t)sin(ωc t)cos(ωc t)

(12.27) 

(12.28) 

Choosing the cutoﬀ frequency of the lowpass ﬁlters to be greater than the bandwidth 
of  p(t)  (and  therefore  also  greater  than  the  bandwidth  of  I (t)  and  Q(t))  but  low 
enough  to  eliminate  the  components  in  ri (t) and  rq (t) around 2ωc ,  the outputs will 
be  the  quadrature  signals  I (t)  and  Q(t).
