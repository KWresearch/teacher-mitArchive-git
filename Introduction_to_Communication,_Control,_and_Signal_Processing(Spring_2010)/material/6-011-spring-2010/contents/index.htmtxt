***** Course Description *****
This course examines signals, systems and inference as unifying themes in
communication, control and signal processing. Topics include input-output and
state-space models of linear systems driven by deterministic and random
signals; time- and transform-domain representations in discrete and continuous
time; group delay; state feedback and observers; probabilistic models;
stochastic processes, correlation functions, power spectra, spectral
factorization; least-mean square error estimation; Wiener filtering; hypothesis
testing; detection; matched filters.
