in the light of established facts.

REGIONAL MODEL 

Economic Model (for regional models, refer to regional above) 

An economic model attempts to abstract from complex human behavior in a way that 
sheds some insight into a particular aspect of that behavior.  This process inherently 
ignores important aspects of real-world behavior, making the modeling process an art 
as well as a mathematical exercise. 

The expression of a model can be in the form of words, diagrams, or mathematical 
equations, depending on the audience and the point of the model. 

The Classic Economic Models collection emphasizes the role of diagrammatic 
economic models in describing optimizing behavior. 

 

ECONOMIC BASE MODEL: 

 

 

How is economic base defined? 

What is a basic industry? 

(cid:132)  Approaches to estimating the basic content in each industry include 
–  assumption 
– 
location quotient 
–  minimum requirements  

How does the economic base model relate to a Keynesian model?  to an input-output 
model? to an econometric model? to a linear programming model?  to a simulation 
model? to a computable general equilibrium model?
