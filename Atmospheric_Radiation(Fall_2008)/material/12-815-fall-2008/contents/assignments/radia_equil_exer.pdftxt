RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM EXERCISE

 
Key Concepts: 
Radiative Flux 
Eddington’s Equation (2-stream approximation) 
Grey approximation to absorption coefficient 
Radiative Equilibrium 
Discontinuity in surface boundary condition 
 
Exercise: 
 

1.  Review the notes on “Approximate Solution for Planetary Radiation” and be sure to 
understand the physics and the mathematical derivations. 
 
2.  Under conditions of Radiative Equilibrium: 
 
a) Calculate the Mean or Effective Temperature of the Earth and explain its implication. 
b) Calculate the Surface Temperature, the Atmospheric Temperature just above the  
surface, and the Temperature at the Top of the Atmosphere and explain the meaning of 
these quantities, both in terms of the approximations involved and in terms of the real 
world. 
c) What is the temperature gradient at the surface?  What is the temperature gradient at 
the top of the atmosphere?  Examine and explain your results. 

 
3.  Please plan to hand in your responses to this exercise when we next meet. You should 
not have to spend more than 2-3 hrs on this exercise. Additional background material 
can be found in the Goody and Yung reference.
