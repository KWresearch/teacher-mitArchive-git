12.815 Fall 2006 

Problems 1, 2, 5 and 6 are required. Problems 3 and 4 are optional. 

1. Introduction 

This is a low-spectral-resolution, radiative transfer program. It can calculate 
radiances in any direction and at any height for an arbitrary structure of temperature 
and absorbers, including aerosol and clouds. It incorporates standard atmospheres 
and standard cloud models. You can invent your own structure if you wish. 

There are two low-resolution options, MODTRAN (down to 1 cm-1 resolution) and 
LOWTRAN (down to 20 cm-1 resolution). For this exercise, we will only use the 
MODTRAN code. The accuracy of MODTRAN is perhaps a few percent – good enough 
for many practical problems. 

The INTRODUCTION in the PCModWin manual (pp. 16-27) takes you through a test 
case. On p. 28 there are details of 28 other test cases. You may want to try some of 
these. Since they are all set up they do not take long to run. They illustrate a point. 
MODTRAN is not set up primarily for meteorologists, but rather for instrument design 
purposes. There is also the option for limb viewing at different tangent height. At the 
end of this course, you may wish to look at limb viewing and radiances generated 
over limited paths, but the following exercises only use upward and downward 
radiances, at the ground and at the top of the atmosphere. 

2. Getting Started 

Start from the ONTAR window.  Modtran Input, Model Atmosphere is the heart of 
the program. You can select one out of six model atmospheres or you can make your 
own. After you have made a run a file is created called MODOUT1 (Directory 
PCMODWIN) that contains all of the data used in the calculation. These data may be 
printed out by opening the MODOUT1 file in Wordpad. 

For all of our work you require Slant Path, and Radiance option (Radiance also 
calculates Transmission; both are Print options). Other options of interest are Temp 
at Boundary, in case there is a boundary later, and Surface Albedo. 

The next card contains cloud and aerosol options. Choose No Aerosol Attenuation, 
and Use Cloud only when you need it. The following cards may depend on your 
earlier selections. The last card sets the initial and final altitudes. The Initial Zenith 
Angle is the angle from the vertical (zenith) at which a detector would be placed to 
detect the pencil of radiation of interest. The Initial Altitude is the altitude at which 
the detector would be placed. 1 For example, to measure radiation at the ground 
coming straight down from above, set the Initial Zenith Angle and the Initial Altitude 
to zero. Looking down from space, the Initial Altitude must be more than 100 km, 
and the Initial Zenith Angle is between 90 and 270 degrees. 

The Path Length Type refers to tangent paths and is always Short for our purposes. I 
always work in wavenumbers rather than microns.

3 Exercises 

3.1 Exercise 1: Emission to space 

Use the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere, and a surface albedo of 0.0. Calculate the 
vertical, outgoing radiance at the top of the atmosphere from 1 to 1800 cm-1. No 
scattering by cloud or aerosol. Plot this result and also plot the path transmission 
(the transmission for a vertical path from bottom to top of the atmosphere). You 
may use the input file c:\pcmodwin\ex11.1tn as starting point. If the plot looks 
obviously wrong, make sure there are reasonable entries in the Modtran Input/Plot 
Cases and/or Plot/Edit Plot menus. ‘Auto-scale’ is a useful feature on these menus. 
Print the result sideways, that is, in Landscape Mode. This option can be found on 
the File/Print/Setup menu. 

3.1.1 Absorption and emission 

Think about the connection between emission from the top of the atmosphere and 
the atmospheric transmission. For example there are two regions in which the 
transmission is greater than 90%. From approximately what altitude do you think 
the outgoing photons in this region of the spectrum came? There are three spectral 
regions in which there is no detectable atmospheric transmission. Discuss level of 
origin of photons in these opaque regions. There is a feature centered on 1013 cm-1 
that transmits partially. Discuss the factors governing the radiance from this feature. 

3.1.2 Band identifications 

Identify as many absorbing and emitting features as you can. Use figures 1.1 and 
3.1 together with tabulated data in Chapter 3 of Liou (2002). 

3.2 Exercise 2: Brightness temperatures and emission levels 

For most spectral regions (ozone is an exception and you should be able to say why 
at the end of the course) the emission to space acts as if it comes from a single 
level, which differs for each frequency, and emits according to the temperature of 
that level. The location of this “layer” is determined by the transmission from there 
to space being e-1. The transmission depends on the absorption coefficient and the 
number of absorbers in the path. Thus, for large absorber densities and large 
absorption coefficients, the layer is high and vice versa. The spectral regions with low 
total path transmission will emit from high in the atmosphere; those with high 
transmission from low in the atmosphere, or from the surface. The temperature of 
the “layer” is known as the brightness temperature. Note that we have now 
associated a temperature with a layer the position of which can be determined, 
giving an elementary temperature profile. This simple idea, known as the Chapman 
layer, which we shall discuss later in the course, gives the practiced eye rapid 
insights into the outgoing radiance. 

 

 

3.2.1 The brightness temperature 

 
12.815, Atmospheric Radiation                                                                                                Exercise  
Prof. Ronald Prinn and Dr. Robert A. McClatchey                                                                   Page 2 of 5  

The temperature of the “layer” corresponds to the observed outgoing radiance. We 
may therefore determine the temperature by inverting the Planck or black-body 
radiance. The formula is equation (5.48) on page 148 of Principles of Atmospheric 
Physics and Chemistry by Goody. It has been used to form a plot of brightness 
temperature against frequency for a spectral region from 2100 to 2500 cm-1 in Fig. 
5.10. The “layers” corresponding to certain frequencies are shown in Fig. 5.11. 

3.2.2 Black-body radiances 

The program does not contain a sub-routine for calculating the brightness 
temperature, so we must do the best we can by plotting black-body curves and 
comparing them to the emitted radiances, using the same scales. Where the curves 
intersect, the brightness temperature of the radiance equals the black-body 
temperature. 

Superpose a set of black-body emission curves at 20K intervals from 200 to 300K in 
the spectral range from 1 to 1800 cm-1. To form the black-body curves, calculate the 
upward radiance at a height of 1 m above the ground. Even a 1 m path has some 
absorption. To avoid this you need to construct your own two-layer atmosphere with 
a temperature equal to the ground temperature (I couldn’t get a one-layer model to 
work). You may use the file c:\pcmodwin\ex12.1tn as a sample. With this input, a 
MODTRAN run will generate the output file c:\pcmodwin\ex12.fl7. This blackbody 
curve could be superposed with the radiance spectrum from Exercise 1, for example, 
by choosing the c:\pcmodwin\ex12.fl7 and c:\pcmodwin\ex11.fl7 files from the 
Plot/Multiple Files menu. In this exercise, I would like you to superpose all the 
blackbody emission curves listed above with the radiance spectrum from Exercise 1. 
To do this, generate all the appropriate blackbody *.fl7 files (each with different 
names), and select all of them from the Plot/Multiple Files menu. 

3.2.3 The height of the emission layer 

From the data in MODOUT1 find the altitude that is principally responsible for the 
emissions that you identified in Exercise 1. You will note an ambiguity. Pay particular 
attention to the three sharp spikes or Q-branches in the 15 μm CO2 band, one in the 
center of the band and two on the flanks. All three represent strong absorption 
features; the middle being much stronger than the flanking Q-branches. How and 
why do the radiances of the three spikes differ? Why is the central spike upwards 
and the side spikes downwards? 

3.3 Exercise 3: The 4.3μm CO2 band 

Figures 5.10, 5.11 and 5.12 in the Goody text are calculations for the 4.3μm band. 
For reasons that may not be clear yet, this band is the best band for remote sensing 
of meteorological parameters. 

Use MODTRAN to plot the outgoing radiance and path transmission as in Exercise 1, 
but in the spectral range from 2100 to 2500 cm-1. Together with the three figures in 
the text this gives you a lot of information against which to test the ideas developed 
in Exercise 2. Note the three prominent bands, two of CO2 and one of N2O. The two 
CO2 bands are identical except for a shift of 66 cm-1 caused by a different carbon 
isotope, and except for the different molecular densities of the two isotopes. They 
both differ from the 15 μm CO2 band in having no central Q-branch. That is to say 
that while the 15 μm band has a very sharp and strong absorption feature at the

Prof. Ronald Prinn and Dr. Robert A. McClatchey                                                                   Page 3 of 5  

center, the two 4.3 μm bands have a dip in the absorption, with consequences for 
the height of the emission level. 

Discuss the different appearances of the central regions of the three CO2 bands. 

3.4 Exercise 4: Comparison between model atmospheres 

Now that you understand the emission spectrum qualitatively, run the emissions as 
in Exercise 1 but for a tropical and a sub-arctic atmosphere (which can be chosen 
from the Model Input/Model atmosphere/Model Atmosphere menu). Discuss the 
differences in terms of the MODOUT1 data. 

3.5 Exercise 5: Cooling by thermal emission 

The radiation flux is related to the radiance by equation 1.1.8 in the Liou text. To 
avoid the angular integration, use an approximation that relates the flux to the 
radiance 57 degrees away from the vertical: 

F +,- ~ πI+,- (ζ = 57° or 123°) 

Where (+,-) represent upward and downward directed radiation streams. In other 
words use 57° for a downward-directed radiance, and 123° for an upward-directed 
radiance. You may start with the file c:\pcmodwin\ex15.1tn. 

Use the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere with no clouds, no aerosols, and zero albedo. 
Calculate radiances both at the surface and at 100 km. Estimate very roughly, the 
net upward flux at the surface and above the atmosphere. (The radiance in the 
MODTRAN plot is given in units of W cm-2 ster-1 wavenumber-1.) Alternatively, I+ and 
I-, and hence the approximate fluxes, may be extracted from the data in MODOUT1. 
What is the average time rate of change of temperature of the atmosphere due to 
thermal radiation in this example? (See Liou, section 3.5, and particularly, Eq. 
3.5.2.) 

3.6 Exercise 6: Effect of cloud on emission 

Repeat Exercise 1 but with a layer of altostratus cloud. (Altostratus cloud can be 
included with the Model Input/Aerosols/Use Cloud menu.) Print the radiance spectra 
with and without cloud on a single plot. Can you determine the cloud-top 
temperature and altitude? Why are some parts of the spectrum changed while others 
are not (in particular why is the 9.6 μm O3 band changed while much of the 15 μm 
CO2 band is unchanged)? You need to consider the path transmission in the absence 
of clouds to answer this question.
