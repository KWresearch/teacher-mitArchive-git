Discrete Ordinates 
 
Discussion 
 
For this exercise you will examine the effects of changing the single scattering 
albedo, a, and the asymmetry parameter, g, on the radiative fluxes through a plane-
parallel layer of scatterers using a two-stream approximation. Recall that the discrete 
ordinates method replaces the integral in the radiative transfer equation by a 
summation, where the dummy variable in the summation represents the direction of 
the radiation streams. For the two-stream approximation, the summation is 
truncated after the first term and the radiative transfer equation is solved for the 
upward and downward intensities. 
 
To run the code on a PAOC workstation (e.g., cirrus) copy the file 
/disk7/ddlucas/Disort.tar over to your directory. Untarring the file (tar xf Disort.tar) 
creates 8 files in a directory called Disort. The file descriptions are: (1) Compile_Run 
describes the process of compiling and running the source code for the exercise. (2) 
DISORT.doc is the documentation for the discrete ordinates code. (3) DISORTsp.f is 
the main subroutine which the user calls. (4) ErrPack_DISORT.f is the error-handling 
routine. (5) R1MACH.f and D1MACH.f define the machine constants. (6) LINPAK.fis a 
linear algebra package. (7) disotest.f is the sample driver for the discrete ordinates 
exercise. 
 
Only minor modifications to the driver are required for the exercise. The important 
driver inputs are: (1) PMOM (1, 1) is the asymmetry parameter. (2) DTAU (1) is the 
optical depth of the layer 1 (denoted b in the output). (3) UTAU (2) is the optical 
depth at which quantities are output. (4) SSALB (1) is the single scattering albedo 
for the scatterers in layer 1. The important outputs are: The Downward Diffuse flux 
(the flux of photons in the downward direction which have been scattered at least 
once) and the Upward Diffuse flux (the corresponding quantity in the upward 
direction). 
 
Exercise 
 
a.)  Using the discrete ordinates program, show how the single scattering albedo, a, 
and the asymmetry parameter, g, affect the reflection and transmission of sunlight 
for a stratified cloud deck.  Calculate the fluxes above and below the slab for the sun 
in the zenith, for τ = 10 and for a black surface below the cloud. Calculate the direct 
solar flux as a separate item. Calculate for at least the following values of 
parameters: a = 0.999, g = (1, 0) and a = 0.95, g = 0. Find qualitative reasons for 
your results. 
 
b.) Also investigate the results for a = 0.5, g = 0 and τ = 0.1 in order to synthesize a 
thin cirrus cloud and provide a qualitative analysis of your results.
