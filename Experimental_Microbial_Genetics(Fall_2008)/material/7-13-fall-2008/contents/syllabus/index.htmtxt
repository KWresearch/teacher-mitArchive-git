***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 5 sessions / week, 4 hours / session
***** Prerequisites *****
Before taking this course, students are expected to have completed:
Introduction to Experimental Biology and Communication (7.02), Genetics (7.03),
and General Biochemistry (7.05).
***** Description *****
Individual research projects in Project Lab will center on using molecular
genetics to examine the biology of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an
opportunistic pathogen often found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
Students will engage in independent projects to probe various aspects of P.
aeruginosa physiology such as antibiotic resistance, phase variation, toxin
production, secondary metabolite production, twitching motility, swarming
behaviors, and more. Projects will aim to discover the molecular basis for
these processes using both classical and new, cutting-edge techniques. These
include plasmid manipulation, genetic complementation, mutagenesis, PCR, DNA
sequencing, enzyme assays, and gene expression studies.
***** Overview *****
The course consists of these three key components: laboratory work, oral
presentations, and writing requirements. Because communication is an especially
important component of scientific research, this course aims to improve your
written and oral communication skills. Research "at the bench" will occupy the
bulk of your time; however, you are also responsible for making oral
presentations to the class and for writing up your research results in a format
suitable for publication in The Journal of Bacteriology.
***** Laboratory Work *****
The first two weeks of the course will be a Molecular Biology "Boot Camp" in
which the whole class will conduct a short project designed to help master some
basic techniques. Following that, students will pursue an independent research
project with a partner. The instructors and TAs work with students to choose a
project and will then coach each team through its execution over the course of
the semester, including the initial planning, the design of individual
experiments, data interpretation, and technical troubleshooting.
***** Oral Presentations *****
Once each week we will begin class with a group meeting during which we will
discuss issues of general or specific concern, explain protocols, and plan
experimental strategies. During these meetings you will have the opportunity to
hone your presentation skills through progress reports, journal club, and other
presentations.
***** Writing Requirements *****
Written communication has been the standard for disseminating scientific
achievements and new knowledge for centuries. Developing good scientific
writing skills is thus a critical component of this course. You will be
required to fulfill a number of writing assignments, culminating in a final
paper (~15 pages) that describes your own research.
***** Readings *****
To give you some background on how Pseudomonas aeruginosa acts in vitro and in
vivo, a list of relevant journal articles is provided.
***** Grading Policy *****
Grading will be based on your performance in the areas summarized below.
Although students in this course will typically work in groups of two, students
are graded independently.
                               Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                                          PERCENTAGES
Experimental design and interpretation, skill, effort, lab notebook 50%
and lab citizenship
GroupÂ meetings and oral presentations                            20%
Interim writing assignments (3)                                     10%
Final paper                                                         20%

***** Lab Hours and Attendance *****
You are expected to attend class every day during the regular lab hours. You
will receive a lower grade in this class if you do not show up on time.
You may find a need to stay late on occasion. With a prior notice, the TAs can
stick around so that students may complete the day's experiments. However, the
TAs will not look favorably upon you if you need to work late because you did
not arrive on time or wasted time during the normal hours. If this is
repeatedly the case, it will affect your final grade. Occasionally you may need
plates taken out of the incubator or cultures started over the weekend. A
member of the teaching staff can do these things for you at their discretion.
The more organized you are about your request the more likely we are to say yes
(e.g. prepare tubes with medium for us and label them clearly). Under no
circumstances will you be allowed to work in the lab when no member of teaching
staff is present.
***** Mid-term Evaluation *****
At mid-term, we will hand out a written evaluation of your progress to date.
The evaluation will give you an idea of your strengths and weaknesses. For
some, the evaluation will be a "wake up call" which will identify deficiencies
in experimental, technical, or communication skills. The grade will not be
recorded; it serves to provide you with an opportunity to improve going into
the second part of the term.
