Results & Discussion

And…

Illustrations
and
Abstract

In this order:

1. Results

2.

Illustrations

3. Discussion

4. Abstract

Results

Think of the Results as…
the news story

And the Discussion as

The commentary or editorial

Results

In the context of this class,
what constitutes
a result?

How should I order my results?

• The order should be logical rather than 
chronological.

In other words…
The order in which you present your 
results may differ from the order in which 
you did your experiments.

How should I proceed
in writing the Results?
• Begin by making figures.
• Lay out your figures in the best (most 
logical) order.
• For each figure, write a paragraph:  
describe what you see and draw your 
reader’s attention to what you think is 
important.

Remember…

All data that you refer to in the text must 
either be shown (in an illustration) or 
referred to as “data not shown”.

Results:  The Road Trip…

Now imagine that you 
are taking a trip and 
that your figures are 
pictures of the main 
attractions.

The Road Trip…

•

If this were Paris, you 
might have:  the Eiffel 
Tower, the Arc de 
Triumphe, Sacre Coeur, 
and Les Invalides.

• The descriptions of the 
figures would correspond 
to what you might write 
on the postcards showing 
the sites.

Mapping the journey

• Now use your 
writing to create 
the path you took 
from one site to 
another.

• The path is your 
experimental 
strategy

How do I create that “path”?

• Write transitions from one paragraph to the next such 
that your research seems to have proceeded in a logical 
manner.

• One experiment (or procedure) should seem to have led 
to another; there should be a reason for everything you 
did. 

• Use such phrases as:
Given that…
(cid:190)
Once it had been determined that…
(cid:190)
After verifying that the fragment we had cloned was… we next …
(cid:190)

Experimental research is messy…

There are detours 
and dead ends

Flickr.

Your Results section doesn’t 
need to reflect this!

Your Results section should 
essentially be
a “sanitized” version of your 
experimental work

Some important details

• Every illustration (table and figures) must be 
referenced, at least once in the text.

• Use past tense to report your results (as if 
you have done the experiment once).

• Describe results obtained with controls.

• Use third person.  Passive voice is 
acceptable, but use sparingly.

• Be selective in writing about your data, but 
do not ignore “sticky,” inconvenient, or 
anomalous data.

Tables

• Numbered I, II, III…
• Title, but no legend
• Number and title go on top
• Can include footnotes at bottom

Figures

• Numbered 1, 2, 3…
• Title often includes reference to the 
method used
• Include a legend: A brief explanation of 
how the data were obtained and what the 
symbols and abbreviations refer to. Should 
not be redundant with main text

Figures… continued

• Number, title, and legend go below
• In graphs, be sure to label axes
• Identify units

Figure 2. pJP10 carries the trc promoter (Ptrc), genes encoding the lacIQ
repressor, kanamycin resistance (KanR) and spectinomycin resistance (SpecR).  
RP4 mob permits conjugal transfer of the plasmid from E. coli S17-1, while the 
NG2 ori permits replication in both E. coli and Rhodococcus.  Gene products were 
ligated into the EcoRI and PstI sites.         [Courtesy of P. Lessard]

Discussion: Content
What do I need to cover?

• The Discussion should consist of a 
summary and analysis of the Results

• The more literature you can bring into the 
Discussion -- and the more connections 
you can draw to the literature -- the richer 
it will be

Discussion: Style

The modus operandi is—argumentation

(Remember the newspaper analogy?)

Imagine a graphic representation of 
the paper as an hourglass
The Discussion
section resembles
the Introduction in
its scope:
here, you reconnect
to the published
literature 

To develop your Discussion…

• Pay special attention to unexpected results
• Show the relevance of your work to previous 
published research: discuss related themes and 
observations of others
• Discuss any discrepancies with previous findings
• Point out how your results contribute to the next 
step in a larger project
• Create a cohesive story

Remember those detours
and dead ends?

• Meaningfully reflect on the project. From 
the problems you encountered, select 
those that are worthy of discussion.
• Consider whether other methods might 
have been used.

Discussion:
How do I proceed?

• Begin by briefly restating the aims of 
your study
• Consider organizing the Discussion so it 
shadows the Results
• Tie the results together, through 
analysis and interpretation

Common Problems!

• Focusing too narrowly 
on the data 
(“rehashing” details 
from the Results)
• Ignoring relationships 
to the literature
• Ideas brought up but 
not fully explained or 
explored 

Abstract

• A first (often the only) impression
• Therefore, it’s a stand-alone section
• Most frequently read
• 250 words or less
• Single spaced
• Should emphasize the original contribution
the paper makes
