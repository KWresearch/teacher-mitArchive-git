Written communication has been the standard for disseminating scientific
achievements and new knowledge for centuries. Developing good scientific
writing skills is thus a critical component of this course. You will be
required to fulfill a number of writing assignments, culminating in a final
paper (~15 pages) that describes your own research. During the semester you
will complete several intermediate writing assignments, described below, most
of which focus on a specific portion of your final paper.
   1. Mini-review: This paper (~5 pages) will explain the background of your
      research project and will be guided by your reading of the relevant
      literature (~6-10 articles, of which only one or two may be review
      articles).
   2. Introduction: This section (~3 pages) covers the background and
      significance of your research area, as well as a clear description of the
      goals and purpose of your research. Portions of your introduction may be
      derived from your mini-review.
Guidelines for writing the introduction to your paper (PDF)
   1. Materials and Methods: This section describes the procedural details of
      the experiments discussed in the paper.
   2. Results (including Figures and Figure Legends): This section describes
      the experiments carried out and the data collected.
   3. Discussion and Abstract: The final written section will be an insightful
      discussion, in which you interpret your data, formulate models to explain
      your observations, and relate your own work to that of other researchers
      in the broader scientific community. You will also prepare a short
      abstract (150 words or less) summarizing your results and conclusions.

and labeling figures (PDF)
***** Final Paper *****
You must submit a paper by the end of the term, describing the progress and
results of your experiments in this course. This paper should demonstrate a
strong level of understanding of the topic researched during the semester, and
should be based upon experimental data. It is neither the quantity of results
that counts in this paper nor their efficiency with which you advance the
project, but rather, how well you articulate your understanding of what you
actually did throughout the term. Your paper need not be an exhaustive
description of everything that was done or attempted during the semester. It
will be up to you to select your results that make for the most coherent story.
The final paper is worth 20% of your grade for the class. Grades will be based
on your demonstration of a firm understanding of the subject in question, the
clarity of the writing, and the mechanics of the presentation itself (use of
figures, writing style, reference to published research, etc).
Policy on collaboration in preparing written reports: Although we encourage
collaboration on experiments and discussion of data among partners and lab
mates, your final papers are your own. Identical tables of results and copies
of graphs are all right, but identical presentation of the results and word-by-
word identity in the conclusions are not. Clearly in most cases the
interpretations of your results will be the same as your partners, however,
each of you must express these ideas in your own words.
