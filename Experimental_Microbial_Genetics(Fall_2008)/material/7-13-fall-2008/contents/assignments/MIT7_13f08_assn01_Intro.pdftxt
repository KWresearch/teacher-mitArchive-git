Purpose of
the Introduction

• Establish your credibility as an author

• Provide background and context

• State scientific problem

• Give  a sneak preview: the basic outcome of 
experiments

In other words…

• What should you 
include?  How much 
detail should you go 
into?

• How should you 
begin?

That depends on…
your Audience

• What background knowledge can you 
assume?

• What do you need to explain and in how 
much detail?

Audience

For this paper—
assume that your audience 
is your classmates

Avoid…

(cid:190)Ever since the dawn of civilization, 
scientists have been interested in the 
structure of living things...

Think of the Introduction as 
having a funnel-like structure:
from general to specific

Ask yourself…

What does the reader need to know in 
order to understand the nature and 
importance of the scientific problem?

CITATIONS:
APA format

This system includes the author’s last name 
and date of publication in the text

Examples
(parenthetical at the end of the sentence)

In vitro, the Sonic hedgehog signaling molecule has been shown to 
induce developing neurons in the midbrain to differentiate into cells 
that produce dopamine (Hynes, 1995).

Bacterial restriction systems have been shown to prevent 
transformation, and several restriction enzymes have been identified 
in the Rhodococcus strains (Roberts and Macelis, 1997).

They have also proven to be of immense use in a range of 
biotransformations (Bell et al., 1998).

Also…you can include more 
than one citation

Two isolates, I24 and B264-I, have also been 
found to oxygenate a variety of indandiols
(Buckland et al., 1998; Chartrain et al., 1998).

You can integrate the citation into the 
sentence
Dabbs (1987) describes a generalized transducing
phage…

Desomer et al. (1991) exploited IR as a mutagenesis 
system…

Desomer and his colleagues exploited IR as a mutagenesis 
system… (Desomer et al., 1991).

…based on the method described by Hilleman et al. 
(1991).

You can even credit someone for 
information conveyed verbally

The lack of pO88 transformants in either 
configuration is consistent with unpublished 
observations (P. Lessard, MIT Dept. of Biology, 
personal communication).
