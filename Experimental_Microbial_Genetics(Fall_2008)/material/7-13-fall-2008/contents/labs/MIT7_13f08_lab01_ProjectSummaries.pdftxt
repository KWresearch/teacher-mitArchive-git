Project 1 : Determining whether phenazines can support intracellular iron 
acquisition 

One of the physiological functions that may be important for phenazines is their role in 
iron acquisition.  Through redox reactions with ferric iron, phenazines reduce ferric iron 
to ferrous iron, which is more bioavailable.  In strain PAO1, it has been shown that the 
ability of P. aeruginosa to acquire iron is critical for biofilm formation.  In PAO1 (which 
is compromised in phenazine production), iron acquisition is thought to be achieved 
mainly by siderophores (high-affinity iron-binding compounds), however, in strain PA14, 
both siderophores and phenazines appear to be important.  One way to test this is to 
determine whether phenazines affect the intracellular iron pool in PA14. pvdS (a gene 
involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore, pyoverdine) is activated by a 
transcription factor that senses intracellular Fe.  Students will make a transcriptional gfp 
fusion to pvdS, and express it both on a plasmid or in single-copy on the chromosome in 
different PA14 strains (e.g. wild-type, phenazine mutant, siderophore mutant, and phz/sid 
mutant).  Fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy will be used to monitor gene 
expression under different conditions.

Project 2:  Selecting and screening for mutations in Fur  

Fur is an iron-dependent transcription factor responsible for turning on the expression of 
genes involved in iron acquisition (including pvdS, see project 1).  Its activity appears to 
be influenced by phenazine production (i.e. in the presence of phenazines, Fur is 
silenced).  In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fur appears to be an essential gene (i.e. mutants 
that cannot make Fur die).  However, it is possible to isolate Fur point mutants that are 
defective in binding DNA yet still competent to bind iron.  In this project, students will 
select for spontaneous Fur missense mutants using a selective medium containing high 
manganese concentrations.  Any mutants that grow under these conditions will be 
screened for overproduction of siderophores (indicating a defect in Fe-sensitive 
regulation).  Mutants with this phenotype are likely to have a Fur point mutation, and will 
be sequenced.  If time permits, additional characterization of these mutants will be 
performed, including assaying their biofilm phenotypes under different conditions.

Project 3: Determining the mechanism of wrinking in response to phenazines 

Phenazine production affects P. aeruginosa in various ways.  One major effect is on 
community behavior: the architecture of biofilms is dramatically different in mutants that 
cannot make phenazines compared to the wildtype, or mutants that over-produce 
phenazines.  Whereas phenazine (over)producers make tight smooth colony biofilms, 
mutants that cannot make phenazines “wrinkle-up” and expand their surface area.  
Although it is clear that phenazines control this phenotype, we do understand how they 
do so.  In this project, students will attempt to unravel the mechanism by performing a 
genetic screen.  Starting with the phenazine null mutant (which makes wrinkled colony 
biofilms), students will generate a transposon library.  This library will then be screened 
for “smooth” colony biofilms.  Candidate mutants will be sequenced and analyzed further 
using bioinformatics as well as other phenotypic screens.

Project 4 : Screening different CF-lung isolates for phenazine production and 
identifying their SoxR regulon 

Phenazines are small, colorful, redox active molecules produced by Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa. While traditionally these molecules have been studied for their antibiotic 
properties, more recently, it has become clear that they have other, important 
physiological functions.  Phenazine production is known to occur in the lungs of CF 
patients, but whether this helps P. aeruginosa survive in the lung is unknown.  To 
determine whether phenazine production is a trait that is selected for in the lung, students 
will screen different lung isolates (isolated from different individuals over the course of 
several years) for phenazine production.  In strain PA14, the transcription factor SoxR 
regulates a small set of genes involved in phenazine trafficking. Thus, for strains found to 
produce phenazines, students will determine whether they contain the soxR gene, and if 
so, identify genes regulated by SoxR.

Project 5 : Identifying genes required for swimming motility 

One of the primary modes of locomotion for Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves flagellar 
motility, often termed swimming motility.  Flagellar-based swimming is a critical aspect 
of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa life cycle, enabling chemotaxis toward food as well as 
being important for biofilm formation and pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis patients.  Many 
of the genes encoding structural elements of the flagellum are known based on prior 
genetic screens and analysis of the genome sequence.  However, all of the genes that 
regulate the timing and positioning of flagellar assembly and activity are likely not 
known.  Notably, the Pseudomonas flagellum is specifically assembled at a single cell 
pole and the factors that ensure proper spatial positioning of the flagellum and polar 
asymmetry are not known.  Moreover, recent systematic analysis of deletion strains in E. 
coli led to the identification of dozens of new genes that affect flagellar motility, 
suggesting our understanding of swimming motility is incomplete. 

In this project, students will test the nearly comprehensive library of P. aeruginosa 
transposon mutants for swimming motility defects.  A plasmid library of genomic 
fragments will also be generated and examined to identify genes that affect motility when 
overexpressed.  Mutants identified will be subjected to secondary screens, including 
those developed in other projects, such as swarming behavior and biofilm formation.  
Mutants affecting multiple processes are of particular interest as these may help identify 
key regulatory genes.  Genes will be identified by verifying transposon insertion sites or 
sequencing plasmids.

Project 6 : Identifying genes required for twitching motility and pili biogenesis 

Type 4 fimbriae (also referred to as pili) are important cell surface structures produced by 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The pili mediate attachment to abiotic and biotic surfaces, are 
often the receptors for bacteriophage, mediate a form of locomotion called twitching 
motility, are required for biofilm development, and contribute to the virulence of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Many of the genes encoding pilus subunits have been 
identified, but the full suite of assembly factors and genes responsible for regulating pilus 
production, extension, and retraction is unknown.  This project will take advantage of the 
nearly complete, ordered PA14 transposon library to screen for genes required for pilus 
biogenesis, function, and regulation.  A plasmid library will also be built and screened for 
genes that, when overexpressed, affect pilus functions.  The screening procedures will 
take advantage of the previously reported observation (Hobbs et al 1993) that pili and 
twitching motility are necessary for Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form large, rough and 
flat colonies with a ‘ground glass’ border when grown on fresh, wet agar plates incubated 
in humid conditions.  Mutants identified will be subject to secondary screening, including 
phage PO4 resistance and assays developed in other projects such as swimming motility, 
swarming behavior, and biofilm formation.  Mutants affecting multiple processes are of 
particular interest as possible global regulators of diverse behaviors.  Genes will be 
identified by verifying transposon insertion sites or sequencing plasmids.

 Project 7 : Identifying genes required for swarming motility 

In addition to flagellar-based swimming motility and pili-based twitching motility, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has yet a third mode of motility, called swarming.  On semi ­
solid surfaces (0.5-0.7% agar) P. aeruginosa cells swim in a community-coordinated 
manner.  Swarming cells are typically elongated and contain multiple flagella instead of 
the usual single flagellum.  Swarming also requires growth on media where certain amino 
acids (glutamate, aspartate, histidine, or proline) are the only nitrogen source.  Although 
distinct from swimming and twitching motility, swarming also requires flagella and pili.  
Rhamnolipids, a biosurfactant, and cell-to-cell signaling pathways are also thought to be 
required for this community behavior.  In this project, students will screen the 
comprehensive transposon library for strain PA14 for additional mutants affected in 
swarming.  Additionally, a plasmid library will be built and screened for genes that, when 
overexpressed, affect swarming.  Mutants will be further characterized through other 
assays, including those developed in other projects, such as biofilm formation, twitching 
motility, swimming motility, and mucoid colony growth.

Project 8 : Identifying genes that contribute to antibiotic resistance and phenotypic 
variation 

Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern.  Like many pathogens, 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa can develop resistance to antibiotics making clinical treatment 
difficult.  Some bacteria also contain inherent resistance to a wide range of antibiotics.  In 
many cases, this is thought to be the result of genes that reduce permeability or stimulate 
drug efflux.  However, a comprehensive search for genes that contribute to the intrinsic 
antibiotic resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has not been conducted.  Students 
involved in this project will screen the entire PA14 transposon library for mutants that 
confer either reduced or increased antibiotic resistance.  By plating on media containing 
antibiotics that inhibit growth of wild-type PA14, mutants that increase resistance can be 
easily identified.  Conversely, by plating on media with antibiotics that permit growth of 
the wild-type strain, mutants that decrease resistance can be identified.  The antibiotics to 
try include tobramycin and tetracycline.  For mutants identified as hyper- or 
hyposusceptible, the gene responsible will be verified by sequencing of the transposon 
insertion.  Mutant strains will also be subjected to additional analyses, including 
measurement of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), examination of colony 
morphology, cross-protection against other antibiotics, and biofilm formation.
