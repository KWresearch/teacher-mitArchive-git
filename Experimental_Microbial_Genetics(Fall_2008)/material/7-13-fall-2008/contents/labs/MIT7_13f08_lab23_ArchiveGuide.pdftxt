7.13 Experimental Microbial Genetics

Archiving the tools you make this term:  

You and your fellow lab mates are doing real research.  The constructs and strains you are making will certainly be of use to the people in Profs. Laub and 
Newman’s labs and the better you archive your materials, the easier it will be for someone to follow up with your work and credit you for it!  In addition, 
by now you all now know that: 1) transforming a strain with a plasmid and verifying the plasmid is a procedure that takes several days and 2) cloning a 
gene is a procedure that can take several weeks.  If after making these strains and plasmids you do not make an archival stock, the time and money you 
spent performing these tasks is essentially wasted.  If those justifications aren’t motivation enough for you, how well you maintain your archives will also 
be a significant factor in your final grade!  Thus, archiving the strain and plasmids you construct this term is an incredibly important part of your 
responsibilities as a 7.13 student. 

Because this is so important, we will check your archive periodically throughout the term.  These dates will be announced later, but at this time we will 
ask to see your strain and plasmid lists (use templates below, the first lines serve as an example of how to correctly fill out the information) and your 
freezer boxes that contain the items on your lists.  These archive boxes should be kept entirely separate from your “everyday box” or the box that 
contains the things you use on a regular basis (you can get new freezer boxes in the cabinet by my office in 089). 

At the end of the term you should be prepared to provide your archived strain and plasmid stocks and send her your complete strain and plasmid lists as 
well as copies of your plasmid maps and sequence files via e-mail.  Please add your names to the file name.  You can also send this info bit by bit 
throughout the term if you want to show off your progress or if that helps you stay on top of things!  ☺ Below are some guidelines to help you with the 
archiving process.  If anything is unclear, please ask! 

Guidelines for how and what to archive: 

For each plasmid you receive this term you should: 
1. 	 make a frozen bacterial stock that carries a verified form of the plasmid 
2. 	 purify the verified plasmid by mini or maxi prep depending on your needs and label the plasmid stock with the concentration 
3. 	
record the strain and plasmid in your strain and plasmid lists 

For each plasmid construct you make this term you should: 
1. 	 make a frozen bacterial stock that carries a verified form of the plasmid 
2. 	 purify the verified plasmid by mini or maxi prep depending on your needs and label the plasmid stock with the concentration 
3. 	
record the strain and plasmid in your strain and plasmid lists 
4. 	 construct a map of the plasmid with the relevant restriction enzyme sites labeled and notes on how the plasmid was made  
***Note: If you label a restriction site on your map, label ALL places where that site cuts (e.g. if you note a single EcoRI site on a map, then we 
expect that to be a unique cut!) 
save a text file with the complete sequence of the construct, noting primer sequences used and indicating nucleotides added to maintain correct 
reading frame, ribosome binding sequence, stop codon, restriction sites, etc where applicable.  Model your files after the example posted on the 
Stellar site.
