Plasmid or Cosmid DNA Purification Using HiSpeed Plasmid Midi and Maxi Kits 

This protocol is for preparation of up to 200 μg of high- or low-copy plasmid or cosmid 
DNA using the HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit or 750 μg using the HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi 
Kit. A final DNA concentration of up to 0.4 μg/μl (Midi) or 1.5 μg/μl (Maxi) can be 
expected, if eluting a high-copy plasmid with 500 μl of Buffer TE. 

* For high-copy plasmids, expected yields are 100–200 μg for the HiSpeed Plasmid Midi 
Kit and 300–750 μg for the HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit. For low-copy plasmids, expected 
yields are 30–100 μg for the HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit and 50–250 μg for the HiSpeed 
Plasmid Maxi Kit using these culture volumes. 

Important notes before starting 
■ New users are advised to familiarize themselves with the detailed protocol provided in 
the HiSpeed Plasmid Purification Handbook posted at the 7.13 Stellar website.  In 
addition, extensive background information is provided on the Qiagen plasmid resource 
page: www.qiagen.com/goto/plasmidinfo. 
■ Optional: Remove samples at the steps indicated with the symbol ☞ in order to 
monitor the procedure on an analytical gel (see page 29 of the HiSpeed Plasmid 
Purification Handbook for analytical procedure) 
■ Blue (marked with a ▲) denotes values for the HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit; red (marked 
with a ●) denotes values for the HiSpeed Plasmid Maxi Kit. 

Things to do before starting 
■ Add the provided RNase A solution to Buffer P1 before use (check for P1 + RNaseA in 
the fridge first). Use one vial of RNaseA (centrifuge briefly before use) per bottle of 
Buffer P1, to give a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. 
■ Check Buffer P2 for SDS precipitation due to low storage temperatures.  If necessary, 
dissolve the SDS by warming to 37°C. 
■ Pre-chill Buffer P3 at 4°C. 
■ Optional: Add the provided LyseBlue reagent to Buffer P1 and mix before use. Use one 
vial LyseBlue (centrifuge briefly before use) per bottle of Buffer P1 to achieve a 1:1000 
dilution (Check to see if LyseBlue has already been added). LyseBlue provides visual 
identification of optimum buffer mixing thereby preventing the common handling errors 
that lead to inefficient cell lysis and incomplete precipitation of SDS, genomic DNA, and 
cell debris. For more details see “Using LyseBlue reagent” on page 16 of the HiSpeed 
Plasmid Purification Handbook.

Procedure 
1. Pick a single colony from a freshly streaked selective plate and inoculate a starter 
culture of 2–5 ml LB medium containing the appropriate selective antibiotic. 
Incubate for approx. 8 h at 37°C with vigorous shaking (approx. 300 rpm). 
Use a tube or flask with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture. 
2. Dilute the starter culture 1/500 to 1/1000 into selective LB medium. For high-copy 
plasmids inoculate ▲ 50 ml or ● 150 ml medium. For low-copy plasmids, inoculate 
▲ 150 ml or ● 250 ml medium. Grow at 37°C for 12–16 h with vigorous shaking 
(approx. 300 rpm). 
Use a flask or vessel with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.  The 
culture should reach a cell density of approximately 3–4 x 109 cells per milliliter, which 
typically corresponds to a pellet wet weight of approximately 3 g/liter. 
3. Harvest the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. 
Remove all traces of supernatant by inverting the open centrifuge tube until all medium 

has been drained.  

*If you wish to stop the protocol and continue later, freeze the cell pellet at –20°C. 

4. Resuspend the bacterial pellet in ▲ 6 ml or ● 10 ml Buffer P1. 
For efficient lysis it is important to use a vessel that is large enough to allow complete 
mixing of the lysis buffers. Ensure that RNase A has been added to Buffer P1.  If 
LyseBlue reagent has been added to Buffer P1, vigorously shake the buffer bottle before 
use to ensure LyseBlue particles are completely resuspended. The bacteria should be 
resuspended completely by vortexing or pipetting up and down until no cell clumps 
remain. 
5. Add ▲ 6 ml or ● 10 ml Buffer P2, mix thoroughly by vigorously inverting the 
sealed tube 4–6 times, and incubate at room temperature (15–25°C) for 5 min. 
Do not vortex, as this will result in shearing of genomic DNA. The lysate should appear 
viscous. Do not allow the lysis reaction to proceed for more than 5 min. After use, the 
bottle containing Buffer P2 should be closed immediately to avoid acidification from 
CO2 in the air.  If LyseBlue has been added to Buffer P1 the cell suspension will turn 
blue after addition of Buffer P2. Mixing should result in a homogeneously colored 
suspension. If the suspension contains localized colorless regions or if brownish cell 
clumps are still visible, continue mixing the solution until a homogeneously colored 
suspension is achieved. 
During the incubation prepare the QIAfilter Cartridge:  Screw the cap onto the 
outlet nozzle of the QIAfilter Midi or QIAfilter Maxi Cartridge.  Place the QIAfilter 
Cartridge into a convenient tube or a QIArack. 
6. Add ▲ 6 ml or ● 10 ml chilled Buffer P3 to the lysate, and mix immediately and 
thoroughly by vigorously inverting 4–6 times. Proceed directly to step 7. Do not 
incubate the lysate on ice. 
Precipitation is enhanced by using chilled Buffer P3. After addition of Buffer P3, a fluffy 
white precipitate containing genomic DNA, proteins, cell debris, and KDS becomes 
visible. The buffers must be mixed completely. If the mixture appears still viscous and 
brownish, more mixing is required to completely neutralize the solution. It is important to 
transfer the lysate into the QIAfilter Cartridge immediately in order to prevent later 
disruption of the precipitate layer. If LyseBlue reagent has been used, the suspension 
should be mixed until all trace of blue has gone and the suspension is colorless. A

homogeneous colorless suspension indicates that the SDS has been effectively 
precipitated. 
7. Pour the lysate into the barrel of the QIAfilter Cartridge. Incubate at room 
temperature for 10 min. Do not insert the plunger! 
Important: This 10 min incubation at room temperature is essential for optimal 
performance of the QIAfilter Cartridge. Do not agitate the QIAfilter Cartridge during this 
time. A precipitate containing proteins, genomic DNA, and detergent will float and form 
a layer on top of the solution. This ensures convenient filtration without clogging. If, after 
the 10 min incubation, the precipitate has not floated to the top of the solution, carefully 
run a sterile pipet tip around the walls of the cartridge to dislodge it. 
8. Equilibrate a ▲ HiSpeed Midi or ● HiSpeed Maxi Tip by applying ▲ 4 ml or ● 
10 ml Buffer QBT and allow the column to empty by gravity flow. 
Flow of buffer will begin automatically by reduction in surface tension due to the 
presence of detergent in the equilibration buffer. Allow the HiSpeed Tip to drain 
completely. HiSpeed Tips can be left unattended, since the flow of buffer will stop when 
the meniscus reaches the upper frit in the column.  
9. Remove the cap from the QIAfilter outlet nozzle. Gently insert the plunger into 
the ▲ QIAfilter Midi or ● QIAfilter Maxi Cartridge and filter the cell lysate into 
the previously equilibrated HiSpeed Tip. 
Filter until all of the lysate has passed through the QIAfilter Cartridge, but do not apply 
extreme force. Approximately ▲ 15 ml or ● 25 ml of the lysate is generally recovered 
after filtration. 
☞ Remove a ▲ 300 μl or ● 120 μl sample of the filtered lysate and save for an analytical 
gel (sample 1) in order to determine whether growth and lysis conditions were optimal. 
10. Allow the cleared lysate to enter the resin by gravity flow. 
☞ Remove a ▲ 300 μl or ● 120 μl sample of the flow-through and save for an analytical 
gel (sample 2) in order to determine the efficiency of DNA binding to the QIAGEN 
Resin. 
11. Wash the ▲ HiSpeed Midi or ● HiSpeed Maxi Tip with ▲ 20 ml or ● 60 ml 
Buffer QC. 
Allow Buffer QC to move through the HiSpeed Tip by gravity flow. 
☞ Remove a ▲ 400 μl or ● 240 μl sample of the wash fraction and save for an 

analytical gel (sample 3). 

12. Elute DNA with ▲ 5 ml or ● 15 ml Buffer QF. 

Collect the eluate in a tube with a minimum capacity of ▲ 10 ml or ● 30 ml. 

☞ Remove a ▲ 100 μl or ● 60 μl sample of the eluate and save for an analytical 

gel (sample 4). 

* If you wish to stop the protocol and continue later, store the eluate at 4°C.  Storage  

periods longer than overnight are not recommended. 

13. Precipitate DNA by adding ▲ 3.5 ml or ● 10.5 ml (0.7 volumes) room 
temperature isopropanol to the eluted DNA. Mix and incubate at room temperature 
for 5 min. 
All solutions should be at room temperature in order to minimize salt precipitation. 
14. During the incubation remove the plunger from a ▲ 20 ml or ● 30 ml syringe 
and attach the ▲ QIAprecipitator Midi Module or ● QIAprecipitator Maxi Module 
onto the outlet nozzle. Do not use excessive force, bending, or twisting to attach the 

7 . 1 3   F a l l   2 0 0 8

QIAprecipitator! 

Important: Always remove the QIAprecipitator from the syringe before pulling up 

the plunger! 

15. Place the QIAprecipitator over a waste bottle, transfer the eluate/isopropanol 
mixture into the ▲ 20 ml or ● 30 ml syringe, and insert the plunger. Filter the 
eluate/isopropanol mixture through the QIAprecipitator using constant pressure. 
Important: Complete the QIAprecipitator procedure (steps 16–21) within 10 min.  To 
prevent detachment of the QIAprecipitator and subsequent loss of DNA and alcohol, do 
not use excessive force when pushing liquid through the QIAprecipitator. 
16. Remove the QIAprecipitator from the ▲ 20 ml or ● 30 ml syringe and pull out 
the plunger. Re-attach the QIAprecipitator and add 2 ml 70% ethanol to the 
syringe.  Wash the DNA by inserting the plunger and pressing the ethanol through 
the QIAprecipitator using constant pressure. 
17. Remove the QIAprecipitator from the ▲ 20 ml or ● 30 ml syringe and pull out 
the plunger. Attach the QIAprecipitator to the ▲ 20 ml or ● 30 ml syringe again, 
insert the plunger, and dry the membrane by pressing air through the 
QIAprecipitator quickly and forcefully. Repeat this step. 
18. Dry the outlet nozzle of the QIAprecipitator with absorbent paper to prevent 
ethanol carryover. 
19. Remove the plunger from a new 5 ml syringe and attach the QIAprecipitator 
onto the outlet nozzle. Hold the outlet of the QIAprecipitator over a 1.5 ml collection 
tube. Add 1 ml of Buffer TE to the 5 ml syringe. Insert the plunger and elute the 
DNA into the collection tube using constant pressure. 
Ensure that the outlet of the QIAprecipitator is held over the collection tube when Buffer 
TE is poured into the syringe, as eluate can drip through the QIAprecipitator before the 
syringe barrel is inserted. 
Be careful, as residual elution buffer in the QIAprecipitator tends to foam when expelled. 
Alternatively, if a higher DNA concentration is desired and a reduction in yield of up to 
10% is acceptable, elute with 500 μl Buffer TE. Lower volumes of elution buffer are not 
recommended, since incomplete wetting of the QIAprecipitator membrane will lead to 
reduced DNA yields. 
Water or buffers commonly used to dissolve DNA (e.g., Tris, may also be used for 
elution). 
Note: TE Buffer contains EDTA which may inhibit downstream enzymatic or 
sequencing reactions. 
Note: Store DNA at –20°C when eluted with water as DNA may degrade in the absence 
of buffering and chelating agents. 
20. Remove the QIAprecipitator from the 5 ml syringe, pull out the plunger and 
reattach the QIAprecipitator to the 5 ml syringe. 
21. Transfer the eluate from step 19 to the 5 ml syringe and elute for a second time 
into the same 1.5 ml tube. 
This re-elution step ensures that the maximum amount of DNA in the QIAprecipitator is 

solubilized and recovered. 

Be careful, as residual elution buffer in the QIAprecipitator tends to foam when expelled.

Determination of yield 
To determine the yield, DNA concentration should be determined by both UV 
spectrophotometry at 260 nm and quantitative analysis on an agarose gel. For reliable 
spectrophotometric DNA quantification, A260 readings should lie between 0.1 and 1.0.
