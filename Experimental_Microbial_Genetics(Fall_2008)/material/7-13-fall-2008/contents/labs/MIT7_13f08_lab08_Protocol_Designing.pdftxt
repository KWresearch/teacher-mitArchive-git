Primer Design Guidelines for PCR Reactions 

General types of PCR reactions you may perform: 
- Gene amplification (with introduction of restriction sites for downstream cloning) 
- Point mutations 
- Deletions 

General considerations for primer design: 
- Primers should be roughly 17-35 bases in length 
- Tm (primer melting temperature) ~ 55-70°C 
•  most simply calculated as Tm = [4(G+C) + 2(A+T)]°C 

•  or use a web-based calculator (e. g. http://www.idtdna.com/SciTools/SciTools.aspx) 

- Primers should end (3’) in a G or C, or CG or GC 
improves efficiency of priming 
• 
- Avoid runs of three or more Cs or Gs at the 3'-ends of primers 
•  may result in mis-priming at G or C-rich sequences 
- Avoid primer self-complementarity (within a single primer such that 2° structures like hairpins 
form) 

- Avoid primer pair complementarities (primer dimers will form and be synthesised 
preferentially to any other product) 

- Avoid use of 4 or more consecutive Guanine nucleotides in primer (forms a significantly stable 
“cruciform” of “guanine tetraplex” 2° structure) 

Specific considerations for primer design: 
- Remember to maintain plasmid elements required for protein expression: 
In-frame fusions 
• 
•  Stop codons (reverse primer) 
•  Shine Dalgarno sequence (forward primer) 
- Always consider restriction sites available in the MCS (multiple cloning site) 
- When engineering restriction sites at ends of an amplified PCR product, always include a few 
additional bases after the restriction site
