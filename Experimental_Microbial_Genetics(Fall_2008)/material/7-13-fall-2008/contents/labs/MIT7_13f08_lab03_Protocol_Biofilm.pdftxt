BIOFILM ASSAY 


Materials 
-
o/n liquid culture  

- medium + antibiotic

1% crystal violet solution 

-
-
95% ethanol  


Method 
1)  Grow overnight cultures of strains to be assayed. 
2)  Add 150ul of medium (+ antibiotic if necessary) to a 96-well U-bottom Falcon plate (Falcon 
#3911). Inoculate 3ul o/n culture into each well. 
NOTE: Leave several wells of medium un-inoculated. These will serve as controls and 
should be treated exactly as the inoculated wells in the steps below. 
3)  Incubate on a rotating platform for 6-8 hours. 

4)  Discard supernatant and wash with water. This can be done in one the following ways: 

a.	 Submerge plate in tub of water. This will simultaneously discard the medium and wash 
the wells. 
b.	 With a pipette, aspirate supernatant from each well, gently wash with 200ul water and 
aspirate once again. A multichannel pipette can be used if needed. 
5)  Stain the cells that remain attached to the plate with 200ul of a 1% crystal violet solution. 
6)  Incubate on a rotating platform for 15 minutes. 
7)  Pipette off crystal violet and discard.  Wash wells once with water. Subsequent washes can be 
performed one of two ways as above. 
NOTE: Washing at this step may be easier with the tub submersion method. Multiple 
tubs of water are required for each plate due to the strength of the crystal violet dye. 
Wash plates in successive tubs of fresh water until minimal traces of dye are released 
after plate submersion. 
8)	 Add 200ul 95% ethanol to each well to dissolve the crystal violet. Incubate covered (to avoid 
ethanol evaporation) for 5 minutes. 
9)  Transfer 100ul to a flat-bottomed 96-well plate and read OD570 (including control wells)
