Dephosphorylating with CIP  and Ligation Reactions 

1. Preventing Vector Recircularization using Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase: 
Alkaline  phosphatase  catalyzes  the  removal  of  5´  phosphate  groups  from  DNA,  RNA, 
ribo-  and  deoxyribonucleoside  triphosphates.  Since  CIP-treated  fragments  lack  the 
5´phosphoryl termini required by ligases, they cannot self-ligate (1). This property can be 
used to decrease the vector background in cloning strategies. 

DNA ligase requires that one of the two pieces of DNA to be joined have a 5’-phosphate 
(donor). Vector DNA cut with a single enzyme will have two 5’-phosphate ends and two 
3’ hydroxyl ends. Since they are on the same molecule, there is nothing to stop these 
from rejoing during a ligation. In fact, this reaction will proceed quite well, since it is 
essentially unimolecular. In order to minimize this reaction and favor ligation of the 
insert DNA, one can treat the digested vector DNA with Alkaline Phosphatase prior to 
purification. This enzyme will remove the 5’-phosphate groups. Since the insert will still 
have 5’-phosphates, vector-insert ligation will occur but vector-vector ligation will not. 
This procedure is also suggested when double-digesting a vector when the two cuts are 
extremely close. When the two sites are close, analysis by gel electrohoresis will not 
enable one to assess the extent that both enzymes have worked. If the DNA consists of a 
pool of single and double cut DNA, the single cut DNA can easily religate if 5’- 
phosphate is present and a high background of vector religation may result, even if the 
vector is gel purified. 

Applications 
•  Removing of 5´ and 3´ phosphoryl groups from nucleic acids 
•  Preparing of templates for 5´ end labeling 
•  Preventing fragments from self ligating 
•  Dephosphorylation of proteins 

Reaction Buffer 
10X NEBuffer 3:[100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol 
(pH 7.9 @ 25°C)]. On thawing, DTT may precipitate, vortex to dissolve.  

Dephosphorylating with CIP: 
1. Suspend DNA in 1X NEBuffer (0.5 µg/10 µl).  
2. Add 0.5 unit/µg vector DNA. 
3. Incubate 60 minutes at 37°C.  
4. Purify DNA by gel purification immediately after step 3.  

Note 
1) Slightly lower activity may be observed in any reaction buffer containing a total salt 
concentration of less than 50mM, under these conditions a 2-fold excess of CIP is 
recommended.  
2) Since CIP treatment of vectors is the final vector preparation step before ligation it is 
better to gel purify the vector than use the PCR/enzyme clean up kit after CIP treatment. 
This will ensure that the cut vector is separated away from any uncut vector as well as

removing the CIP. Transformation with uncut vector occurs at a significantly higher 
efficiency than ligation reactions, and therefore must be removed before setting up 
ligations. 

2. Ligation of DNA: 
T4 DNA Ligase  catalyzes  the  formation of  a phosphodiester bond between  juxtaposed 5' 
phosphate  and  3'  hydroxyl  termini  in  duplex DNA  or RNA.  This  enzyme will  join  blunt 
end  and  cohesive  end  termini  as  well  as  repair  single  stranded  nicks  in  duplex  DNA, 
RNA or DNA/RNA hybrids. 

Applications: 
•  Cloning of restriction fragments 
Joining linkers and adapters to blunt-ended DNA 
• 

Reaction Buffer: 
T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer (10X) 

Setting up a Ligation Reaction: 
In  general,  use  a  1:1,  1:3  or  3:1  molar  ratio  of  vector:insert  DNA  when  cloning  a 
fragment  into  a  plasmid  vector. However,  if  you  have  plenty  of  cut  vector  and  insert  set 
up  four  ligation  reactions-  vector:insert  1:1,  1:3,  3:1  and  a  control  containing  vector  but 
no  insert  (always  set  up  this  control).  These  ratios will  vary with  other  types  of  vectors, 
for  example,  cDNA  and  genomic  cloning  vectors.  The  following  example  illustrates  the 
conversion  of  molar  ratios  to  mass  ratios  for  a  3.0kb  plasmid  and  a  0.5kb  insert  DNA 
fragment. 

ng of vector  x kb size of insert  x  molar ratio of insert = ng of insert 
 
                                        
vector 
kb size of vector 

Example: How much 0.5kb insert DNA should be added to a ligation in which 100ng 
of 3kb vector will be used? The desired vector:insert ratio will be 1:3. 

100ng vector x 0.5kb insert  x  3 = 50ng insert

3kb vector 
                 

The  following  ligation  reaction  of  a  3kb  vector  and  a  0.5kb  insert  DNA  uses  a  1:1 
vector:insert ratio. Typical ligation reactions use 100–200ng of vector DNA. 

1. Assemble the following reaction in a sterile microcentrifuge tube:
