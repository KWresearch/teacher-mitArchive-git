PCR with the Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity 

How PCR works: 
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a rapid procedure for in vitro enzymatic 
amplification of a specific segment of DNA. The applications of PCR are numerous. 
They include direct cloning from genomic DNA or cDNA, in vitro mutagenesis and 
engineering of DNA, genetic fingerprinting, and prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects. 
The theoretical basis of PCR is outlined in Figure 1, below. 
There are three nucleic acid segments: the segment of double stranded DNA to be 
amplified and two single stranded oligonucleotide primers flanking it. Additionally, there 
is a thermostable DNA polymerase, appropriate deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates 
(dNTPs), a buffer, and salts. 
The reaction is performed in a thermocycling machine which can be programmed 
to repeat the cycle of denaturing, annealing and extension many times. The primers are 
added in vast excess compared to the DNA to be amplified. They hybridize to opposite 
strands of the DNA (one to the top strand and one to the bottom strand) with their 3’ ends 
facing each other so that synthesis by DNA polymerase (which goes 5’ to 3’) extends 
across the segment between them. 
In the next cycle each one of the new products can hybridize to the primers and 
act as a template.  The amount of product doubles with every subsequent cycle of 
synthesis so that 30 cycles should result in a 270 million fold amplification of the exact 
desired fragment of DNA.

Description of the Platinum PCR SuperMix High Fidelity: 
Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity provides qualified reagents for high 
fidelity amplification of DNA templates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  It is 
effective over a large range of target sizes—up to 15 kb genomic DNA.  The mixture 
contains anti-Taq DNA polymerase antibody, Mg++, deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 
recombinant Taq DNA polymerase, and Pyrococcus species GB-D thermostable 
polymerase. Anti-Taq DNA polymerase antibody inhibits polymerase activity, providing 
an automatic “hot start” and permitting room temperature set-up (polymerase activity is 
restored after a denaturation step in PCR cycling at 94°C).  Antibody mediated hot starts 
improve PCR specificity and yield. Pyrococcus species GB-D polymerase possesses a 
proofreading ability by virtue of its 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity (3).  Mixture of the 
proofreading enzyme with Taq DNA polymerase increases fidelity approximately six 
times over that of Taq DNA polymerase alone. 

Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity is supplied at 1.1X concentration to allow 
approximately 10% of the final reaction volume to be used for the addition of primer and 
template solutions.  

Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity = 22 U/ml complexed recombinant Taq DNA 
polymerase, Pyrococcus species GB-D thermostable polymerase, and Platinum® Taq 
Antibody; 66 mM Tris-SO4 (pH 8.9); 19.8 mM (NH4)2SO4; 2.4 mM MgSO4; 220 μM 
dNTPs; and stabilizers. 

Storage Conditions: 
After thawing, Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity may be stored at 4°C for 3 
months or -20°C for 1 year.  Storage at 4°C avoids the necessity of thawing the mix 
before assembling the reaction.  There is no detectable decrease in enzyme activity or 
performance after storage for 3 months at 4°C, or after 15 freeze-thaw cycles. 

Recommendations and Guidelines: 
• Because PCR is a powerful technique capable of amplifying trace amounts of DNA, 
take all appropriate precautions to avoid cross-contamination.   
• Reactions may be assembled either at room temperature or on ice.  NOTE: this is not 
true for all PCR polymerases!!!  Always read up on the particular polymerase you are 
using because some lose activity if care is not taken to prepare the reactions on ice!!! 
• For multiple reactions, you can prepare a master mix of Platinum® PCR SuperMix 
High Fidelity and the component(s) common to all reactions. 

PCR Protocol: 
1. Add the following components in any order to each PCR tube (smallest tubes oyu have 
or the strip tubes): 
a. 45 μl Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity 
b. Primer solution (200 nM final concentration of each is recommended)* 
c. Template DNA solution (1–200 ng genomic DNA)*

*A standard 50-μl PCR reaction includes a combined primer and template volume 
of 5 μl; we have observed no decrease in product yield if the amount of primer 
and template solution is between 1 μl and 15 μl. 
2. Mix contents of tubes, centrifuge briefly to collect liquid at bottom of tube and cover 
with mineral or silicone oil if necessary. 

3. Cap tubes and load in thermal cycler. 

4. Incubate tubes at 94°C for 30 s to 2 min to completely denature the template and 
activate the enzyme. 

5. Design the appropriate parameters for your reaction and program them into the 
thermocycling machine according to the manufacturer’s instructions.  You can use the 
cycling parameters below as a starting point from which to perform your PCR 
amplification: 
1.  Heat denature 1 min. at 95°C 
2.  Denature 94°C for 15-30 s 
3.  Anneal 55°C for 15-30 s 
4.  Extend 68°C for 1 min per kb 
5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for 25-35 cycles 
6.  10 min. at 72°C. 
7.  4°C for infinite time (to hold until you come and get it) 

6. Check your PCR reaction on an agarose gel to check if the PCR reaction worked, if the 
amplified product is the right size and if the product is clean (no other amplification 
products). 

7. Clean up your insert by using either the QIAquick Gel Extraction (if you will be 
cloning your PCR product) or the QIAquick PCR purification kit (if you will be 
sequencing your PCR product) 

Tips: 
• If the PCR efficiency is not optimal, repeat the reaction with different primer 
concentrations from 100 to 500 nM, in 100 nM increments. 
• For longer genomic DNA targets (>15 kb), we recommend adding 1–1.5 U of 
Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase (Cat. no. 10966-018) to the reaction mix and increasing 
the extension time as specified (1 min per kb). 
• At higher volumes of primer and template, the MgSO4 concentration in the reaction 
will drop to suboptimal levels and yield will decrease. For combined primer-template 
volumes of >15 μl (in solution with 45 μl of Platinum® PCR SuperMix High Fidelity), 
we recommend adjusting the final MgSO4 concentration in the reaction to 2.2 mM.
