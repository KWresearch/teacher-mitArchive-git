Digital Optical Microscopy 

The  invention  of  the  microscope  revolutionized  biology  in  the  1700’s  by  permitting 
scientists  to  explore  the  world  of  microorganisms  and  details  of  cell  structure.  In  the 
1990s  the  microscope  has  continued  to  be  a  powerful  tool  for  biologists. We  can  watch 
subnanometer movements of cells or single molecules in cells with digital CCD cameras, 
measure  piconewton  forces  exerted  by  motor  proteins  with  optical  traps  formed  by  IR 
lasers,  reconstruct  the  3D  structure  of  a  cell  using  powerful  image  analysis  algorithms, 
follow  the  chemical  changes  in  a  cell  using  fluorescent  dyes,  or  determine  the  precise 
location  of  various  gene  products  that  are  tagged  with  antibodies,  enzymes,  or  light 
emitting  (fluorescent  or  luminescent)  proteins.  The  dynamics  of  cellular  responses 
captured  in  a  microscope  tell  us  about  the  lifestyle  and  life  span  of  a  structure.  The 
purpose of  the microscope module  in Project Lab  is  to familiarize you with  the operation 
of  a  state-of-the-art  digital  microscope.  The  microscope  system  consists  of  a  Nikon 
Optiphot  2  microscope,  a  Photometric  ImagePoint  CCD  camera,  and  a  MacIntosh  G3 
PowerPC  computer  for  data  acquisition  and  image  analysis.  With  this  system,  you  will 
observe the dynamics of fluorescently tagged proteins in cultured CAD cells. The manual 
will  illustrate  how  to  set  up  a  microscope  for  imaging  with  phase  contrast,  differential 
interference contrast, or fluorescence optics, and how to analyze the images using Spot or 
Photoshop software packages. 

Parts of a Microscope 
The microscope is divided into three parts: an illumination system, an optical system, and 
an  image  viewing  system. The  illumination  system  consists  of  the  lamp,  shutters,  filters, 
condenser,  and  field  diaphragm.  These  elements  deliver  and  focus  the  light  onto  the 
specimen.  The  optical  system  consists  of  the  objective  lens  and  various  prisms,  filters, 
and  magnifiers.  They  focus  the  image  onto  the  oculars  or  camera.  A  CCD  camera 
captures a digital image and the image is stored on a computer. 

The Microscope 
A  microscope  consists  of  an  illumination  system,  an  imaging  system,  and  a  detecting 
system. These  systems  focus  light  onto  a  specimen,  collect  light  from  the  specimen,  and 
record  the  magnified  image.  The  specimen  is  mounted  on  a  transparent  glass  slide  and 
positioned on the movable stage of the microscope. Light from a bright source is focused 
by  the  collector  and  condenser  lenses  onto  the  specimen.  Light  transmitted  through  the 
specimen is collected by the objective lens and focused on the focal plane of the objective 
lens,  creating  a  magnified  image  of  the  specimen.  The  image  is  then  further  magnified 
and projected by  the ocular  lens  (eyepiece) onto a detector, either  the human eye, a piece 
of  photographic  film,  or  imaging  chip  of  a  CCD  camera.  The  condenser  diaphragm  and 
the other apertures restrict the amount of light entering or leaving a lens.  

The  total  magnification  is  a  product  of  the  magnification  of  the  individual  lenses:  if  the 
objective  lens  magnifies  100-fold  (100X)  and  the  ocular  lens  magnifies  10X,  the  final 
magnification  recorded  (by  the  eye)  will  be  1000X.  The  magnification  recorded  on  the 
film  depends  on what  lenses  are  present  in  the  path  to  the  camera  (and  not  on  the  ocular 
lens).  The  resolution  of  a  microscope  lens  is  the  minimum  distance,  D,  between  two 

7 . 1 3   F a l l   2 0 0 8  	

P a g e  | 2 

distinguishable  objects  that  can  be  resolved  from  each  other:  the  smaller  the  value  of D, 
the  better  the  resolution.  D  depends  on  three  parameters:  the  angular  aperture,  a,  or 
halfangle  of  light  entering  the  lens  from  the  specimen;  the  refractive  index, N,  of  the  air 
or  fluid medium  between  the  specimen  and  the  objective  lens;  and  the  wavelength,  l,  of 
incident light: 

Decreasing the value of l or increasing either N or a will decrease the value of D and thus 
improve the resolution. 
1)  The  angular  aperture  depends  on  the  width  of  the  objective  lens  and  its  distance 
from the specimen. Moving the objective lens closer to the specimen will increase 
sin a and reduce D. 
2)  The  refractive  index  measures  the  degree  to  which  a  medium  bends  a  light  ray 
that passes through it; the refractive index of air is defined as N = 1.0. One way to 
decrease D  is  to  use  immersion  oil  as  the medium  between  the  specimen  and  the 
objective  lens. Since  the refractive  index of such oils  is 1.5,  the  resolution will be 
improved 1.5-fold.  
3)	 The  shorter  the  wavelength  of  incident  light,  the  lower  the  value  of D  and  better 
the resolution.  

Under the best conditions, with violet light (wavelength, l = 0.4 μm) and N sin a of 1.4, a 
limit  of  resolution  of  just  under  0.2  μm  can  theoretically  be  obtained  under  the  light 
microscope. 

Types of Light Microscopy 
A  typical  living  cell  is  transparent,  thus  nearly  invisible  to  the  eye.  To  “see”  a  cell  we 
must  either  stain  the  specimen  with  a  colored  or  fluorescent  dye  (described  in  sample 
preparation) or manipulate light so that interference caused by the cell generates contrast.  

Transmitted light microscopy  
•	 Bright field 
•	 Phase Contrast 
•	 DIC/Nomarski 

Epifluorescence light microscopy 

Bright field microscopy can only be used to view stained specimens since light is usually 
not  absorbed  by  unstained  specimen.  Histological  stains  such  as  hemotoxilin  and  eosin 
are  used  to  image  cytoplasmic  and  nuclear  structures  in  a  cell.  Because  enzymes  within 
cells  can  remain  active  under  precisely  controlled  conditions,  we  can  take  advantage  of 
this  activity  to  locate  the  enzymes  within  the  cell.  This  is  done  by  adding  a  substrate 
which  yields  a  colored  product  when  the  enzyme  acts  on  it.  However,  without  artificial 
means to generate color contrast, brightfield microscopy has limited usefulness. 

Phase-contrast microscopy  is  used  to  give  detailed  views  of  transparent,  live,  unstained 
cells and tissues. The brightness in a region of the sample depends on the refractive index 
of  that  region. Because  light moves more  slowly  in  a medium of higher  refractive  index, 

7 . 1 3   F a l l   2 0 0 8

the part of a light wave that passes through a specimen will be refracted and consequently 
will  be  out  of  phase  with  the  part  of  the  wave  that  does  not  pass  through  the  specimen. 
When  the  two  parts  of  the  light wave  are  recombined,  the  resultant  light will  be  brighter 
if  they  are  in  phase  and  less  bright  if  they  are  out  of  phase. Thus,  dense  or  thick  regions 
of the cell will appear darker than their surroundings. 

Incident  light  passes  through  an  annular  diaphragm, which  focuses  a  ring  of  light  on  the 
sample.  Light  that  passes  unobstructed  through  the  specimen  is  focused  by  the  objective 
lens onto the phase-retarding gray phase ring (on the surface of the objective lens), which 
absorbs  some  of  the  direct  light  and  alters  its  phase  by  one-quarter  of  a wavelength.  If  a 
specimen  refracts  or  diffracts  the  light,  the  phase  of  some  light  waves  is  altered  and  the 
light waves  are  redirected  through  the  thin,  clear  region of  the phase plate. The  refracted 
and  unrefracted  light  are  recombined  at  the  image  plane.  Structures  within  a  cell  are 
highlighted  by  the  light  and  dark  fringes  generated  by  constructive  and  destructive 
interference. 

Nomarski, or Differential  Interference Contrast  (DIC) microscopy, generates a  three-
dimensional  or  "relief"  image.  The  “shadow”  represents  a  difference  in  refractive  index 
rather than literal thickness. Contrast is very good and the condenser aperture can be used 
fully open,  thereby  reducing  the depth of  field and maximizing  resolution. A prism splits 
a beam of incident polarized light into two parallel beams: one passes through one region 
of  a  specimen  and  the  other  passes  through  a  closely  adjacent  region.  After  passage 
through  the  specimen,  the  beams  are  reunited  by  a  similar  prism  in  the  objective.  In  a 
homogeneous specimen, there is no difference between the two beams, and no contrast is 
generated. However, near a refractive boundary (e.g. a nucleus within the cytoplasm), the 
path difference between the normal and the reference beam will generate a relief.  A path 
difference  of  0  results  in  no  transmitted  light;  maximum  light  is  transmitted  if  the  path 
difference  is  half  the  wavelength.  By  these  means,  different  regions  of  the  specimen 
appear bright or less bright in contrast to the mid-gray background. 

Phase-contrast  microscope  is  useful  in  examining  the  structure  and  movement  of  larger 
organelles, such as the nucleus and mitochondria, in live cultured cells. The disadvantage 
of  this  technique  is  that  it  is  suitable  for  observing  only  single  cells  or  thin  cell  layers. 
The  Nomarski  technique,  in  contrast,  only  defines  the  outlines  of  the  large  organelles; 
however,  thicker  objects  can  be  observed  by  combining  this  technique  with  optical 
sectioning. 

Fluorescence  microscopy  relies  on  emission  of  light  by  the  sample  when  excited  by 
higher  wavelength  light.  Unlike  a  transmitted  light  microscope,  a  fluorescence 
microscope  illuminates  the  sample  through  the  objective  lens  (epi-illumination).  A 
specific  wavelength  of  ultraviolet  light  from  a  mercury  lamp  source  is  selected  by  the 
excitation filter. The excitation radiation is reflected by the dichromatic filter and focused 
by  the  objective  lens  onto  the  sample.  Fluorescent  molecules  in  the  sample  absorb  the 
light and emit light (fluoresce) at a longer wavelength. This light is collected and focused 
by  the  objective  lens.  An  emission  filter  blocks  any  residual  excitation  light.  Because 
most  of  the  excitation  light  passes  through  the  specimen,  epi-illumination  allows  us  to 

7 . 1 3   F a l l   2 0 0 8

detect  very  low  levels  of  fluorescent  light,  making  possible  the  detection  of  single 
molecules. 

Instructions for using the microscope and video camera with Spot software 

Cleaning the lenses 
The  optical  cleanliness  of  the  microscope  lenses  must  be  scrupulously  maintained  to 
obtain  clear,  high  contrast  images.  If  the  image  appears  blurred,  low  contrast,  or  spotty, 
then  the  system  is  dirty. Furthermore,  dirt  on  the  surfaces  of  lenses  is  a  sure-fire method 
to  scratch  the  lens.  Most  dirt  is  found  on  the  microscope  slide  or  cover  slip.  If  you  see 
diffuse  spots  or  circles  when  the  sample  is  in  focus,  then  check  the  glass  surface  of  the 
cover  slip  or  microscope  slide  for  fingerprints,  immersion  oil,  or  dried  tissue  culture 
media. If the spot moves, then check for air bubbles in the oil or in the liquid surrounding 
the specimen. 
•	 Water or grease on the objective lens will cause the image to appear dull or of low 
contrast and blurry at best focus. Clean the objective lens as described below. 
•	 Dirt in the plane of focus is usually on the surface of the field diagram lens (or on 
a glass surface in the same focal plane). 
•	 Check  the  surface  of  the  eyepiece. Grease  from  eyelashes will  obscure  the  image 
when viewed through the oculars but not when viewed through the CCD camera. 

The objective lenses should be routinely checked for cleanliness before use. Be extremely 
careful  to  handle  the  objectives  by  their  barrel  and  do  not  touch  the  lens  surface  with 
fingers. Dropping an objective will destroy it. (And lenses are VERY expensive) 
1.	 Moisten a piece of lens paper and gently touch it to the lens surface. Repeat with a 
dry piece of paper. 
2.	 Grease  and  immersion  oil  may  be  removed  by  moistening  a  piece  of  lens  paper 
with water, and gently touching the lens surface. Repeat with a dry piece of paper. 
If  still  dirty,  repeat  2  with  ethanol;  then  repeat  again  with  water.  Notify  the 
instructor.

Turning on the Microscope 
Always  turn  on  the  mercury  lamp  first  because  arcing  of  the  bulb  generates  an 
electromagnetic pulse  (EMP) which  can blow  the  computer. A  corollary  to  this  rule  is  to 
turn  on  the  computer  last.  If  you  want  to  view  the  image  using  the  CCD  camera  or 
capture  the  image  onto  the  computer,  then  you  must  turn  on  the  camera,  monitor,  and 
computer. 
1.	 mercury lamp (for fluorescence microscopy, ALWAYS TURN ON FIRST) 
2.	 Power strip: This will give power for microscope illumination (in the back, on the 
right) and the CCD camera 
3.	 Computer  (turn  on  LAST)  When  turning  things  off,  turn  off  the  computer  first, 
then  power  strip  and  then  UV  lamp.  Please  don’t  forget  the  power  strip. 
Otherwise, the video camera is still on. 

Finding and Focusing 
A. Start with the 10X objective and put your cells in focus. 

7 . 1 3   F a l l   2 0 0 8  	

P a g e  | 5 

•	 Carefully rack down the stage. The objectives should be swung out to the side. 
•	 Place specimen into the specimen holder. 
•  Swing the objective of choice into place. 
NOTE: The easiest way to find your cells is by using DAPI fluorescence  

Once  you  have  the  cells  in  focus,  just  close  the  shutter  to  the  UV  lamp  and  turn  up  the 
white  light.  If you  still can’t  see  them, adjust contrast. The easiest way  to  see cells under 
white light is by using the following filter combination (these apply to PHASE objectives 
only): 
•	 DIC filter beneath stage pushed in; DIC filter near eyepieces pulled out 
•	 Use Phase 3 filter in dial or Phase 4 in dial (depending on what objective you use) 
•	 May need to increase illumination 

B.  Set  up  for  Koehler  illumination.    For  optimal  imaging,  the  microscope  lens  and 
specimen slide must be clean and the system set up for Koehler illumination. Under these 
conditions,  the  specimen  is brought  into  focus  and  the  condenser  lens  is aligned with  the 
objective lens and positioned to fully illuminate the specimen.   
•	 Adjust the condenser to illuminate the specimen with an optimal amount of light 
•	 Adjust  the  intensity  of  the  lamp  with  the  slider  controls  at  the  front  of  the 
microscope base. A middle setting should be adequate for most applications. 
•	 Close the aperture (under stage) completely.  
•	 Bring  the  aperture  leaves  into  focus  (a  decagon  image)  by  using  the  condenser 
focus (knob below stage on left). 
•	 Align  the  decagon  to  the  center  with  the  alignment  knobs.  Centering  can  be 
checked  by  opening  up  the  field  diagram.  This  step  centers  the  condenser  lens 
within the optical and illumination path. 
•	 Open up  the condenser such  that  the edges of  the decagon are  just  inside  the edge 
of  the  tube.  This  ensures  the  specimen  is  fully  illuminated  but  prevents  excess 
illumination. 
NOTE: Every time you change the objective lens, the condenser may be put out of focus. 
You may need to focus the condenser each time you change the objective. 

C.  To  use  higher  magnification,  just  rotate  the  appropriate  objective  into  place.  If  the 
objective  requires  oil,  then  place  a  drop  of  oil  on  top  of  the  specimen  before  placing  the 
objective.  Remove  air  bubbles  from  the  oil.  Be  careful  not  to  get  oil  on  dry  (<60X) 
objectives. 

D. To use fluorescence: 
•	 DIC filter in condenser (beneath stage) pushed in; DIC filter near eyepieces pulled 
out (otherwise it will cut the fluorescence signal). It doesn’t matter about anything 
below  the  stage  under  fluorescence,  since  all  illumination  is  coming  from  above 
through the objective. 
•  Dim white light and open shutter to UV lamp 
When  looking  through  phase  objectives  (10x,  40x,  100x),  the  DIC  filters  should  not  be 
engaged (filter ring to ph3 or ph4, not DIC 1.4).

**The GFP  fluorescence  is  the most  important  feature of your cells,  so you  should  focus 
on that, then acquire all three of your images (i.e., GFP, DAPI, DIC) in the same plane of 
focus. 
To adjust illumination from the mercury bulb: slide in/out the neutral density (ND) filters 
in  the  back. The  filters  can  be  used  in  any  combination. Try  to minimize  illumination  to 
the  specimen  and  close  the  shutter  (or  slider) when not  examining  the  specimen  to  avoid 
bleaching.  

Select the filter set of choice.
