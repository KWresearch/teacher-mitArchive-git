Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and DNA Band Excision 

How it works: 
Agarose gel electrophoresis is a simple and highly effective method for separating, 
identifying, and purifying 0.5 to 25 kb DNA fragments. Voltage applied at the ends of an 
agarose gel generates an electric field with a strength defined by the length of the gel and 
the potential difference at the ends (V/cm). DNA molecules exposed to this electric field 
migrate toward the anode (positive end) due to the negatively charged phosphates along 
the DNA backbone. The migration velocity is limited by the frictional force imposed by 
the gel matrix. While charge and/or size can affect the rate at which macromolecules will 
pass through the gel, the charge to mass ratio is the same for DNA molecules of different 
lengths. It is the size of the DNA, therefore, that determines the rate at which it passes 
through the gel, thereby allowing an effective separation of DNA fragment-length 
mixtures by electrophoresis. To visualize the DNA, the gel is treated with ethidium 
bromide. This dye intercalates between the stacked bases of nucleic acids and fluoresces 
red-orange (560 nm) when illuminated with UV light (260 to 360 nm). 

Reagents and materials: 

50 X TAE buffer (agarose gel running buffer) 

Ethidium bromide 10 mg/ml (20,000x stock) - wear gloves when handling EtBr. 
Since it is a DNA-intercalating molecule, EtBr is a mutagen! Dispose of all tips etc in 
labeled receptacle in fume hood. 

6X Gel loading buffer 

Agarose gel: 
1. To an Erlenmeyer flask, add agarose to an appropriate weight to volume (see below).  
You will want the final gel to be about 8mm thick so calculate how much agar solution 
you will need.

2. Add appropriate amount of  1X TAE to the flask. **Do not make your agarose in 
water!**  Bring slurry to a boil in a microwave (heat about 1.5 minute on high power), 
swirl, and repeat as necessary until no "streaks" or chunks remain. 
* Be careful with molten agar and agarose. It can boil over suddenly and cause 
nasty burns.

3. Once agarose is completely dissolved, add ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml; a 10,000 X 
stock) to a final concentration of 0.1µg/ml (WEAR GLOVES!).  Swirl to mix. 
4. Pour molten agar into a gel box. 
5. The agar is completely set when it becomes opaque (< 20 min). 
6. If you prepare your gel ahead of time, wrap it in saran wrap and store it in the cold 
room. 
7. Add the loading dye to your DNA samples to a final concentration of 1X. 
8. Load the gel.  Remember to also load a molecular weight marker!!!  See end of this 
protocol for 1 kb and 100 bp molecular weight marker patterns. 
9. Run gel with an overlay of 1X TAE (about 5-8 mm deep above the gel) at 80-100V. 
10. The bromphenol blue in the loading dye will migrate with an apparent molecular 
weight of 500 bp and the xylene cyanol of 2 kb. 
11. When the gel has run far enough, so that your bands have clearly separated and you 
can tell what size they are, take a picture of the gel. 

Cutting out DNA band: 
Take the gel to the dark room and use a hand-held UV-light transluminator to visualize 
the DNA bands. In order to minimize damage to the DNA, use a long-wave UV light for 
as short a time as possible. Make sure to use protective glasses during this 
procedure since the UV light will burn your retina. Excise the desired band 
using a razor blade. Place the band in an eppendorf tube. Take a picture of the gel without 
the band in it to be sure the band is successfully recovered.

Note: 
During 2% agarose gel electrophoresis with tris-
acetate (pH 7.6) as the running buffer, bromophenol 
blue migrates near the 100-bp fragment.  The 100-bp 
band migrates behind the bromophenol blue marker on 
6% polyacrylamide gels with tris-borate (pH 8.0) as 
the running buffer. 

Part of the 600-bp band may migrate anomalously 
slowly in polyacrylamide gels (1,2,3). This band may 
appear as an extra band near or on top of the 700-bp 
band.

The  1636 bp  band  and  all  bands 
less  than  1000  bp  are  generated 
from pBR322. 

If the ionic strength of the sample 
is  too  low,  blurring  of  the  bands 
can occur.
