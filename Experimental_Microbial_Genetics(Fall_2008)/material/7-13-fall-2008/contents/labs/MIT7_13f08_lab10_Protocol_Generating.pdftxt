Generating and screening for mutants in Fur 

Concept 
Growth on manganese rich media has been shown in both E. coli and PAO1 to select for mutants with 
defects in iron acquisition.  The majority of these mutants are in the fur gene.  In Pseudomonas, Fur is 
essential for aerobic growth, so any mutants isolated are point mutations, rather than knockouts. 

Media 
LB 
1.  	 Add 25 g LB to 1 L deionized water.  For plates, add 15 g bacto agar. 
2. 	 Autoclave for 35 min on the fluid cycle.  
3.  Let cool, then add required antibiotic for selective media. If making plates, pour into petri dishes, let 
solidify, and refrigerate. 

Manganese plates: 
2 g Tryptone 
1.2 g NaCl  

   10mM MnCl2 

7.5 g agar 
   500 ml deionized water 
Autoclave and cool to 50oC, then add 
   50 uM desferral (desferroxamine) (make and filter sterilize a 25 mM stock solution.  Use 2 ul/ml) 
These plates must be made fresh – use within a week. 

BHI 
Add 37 g BHI to 1 L water.  For plates, add 15 g bacto agar. 
Autoclave for 35 min on liquid cycle.   

Protocol 
1.	 Grow liquid LB culture of wt PA-14 overnight.   
2.	 Dilute 1:10 and plate 25 μl onto manganese selection plates.  You may want to play with the 
concentrations of cells plated to achieve optimal results. 
3.	 Wrap plates in parafilm and incubate at 37oC for 1-2 days. 
4.	
If resulting colonies are well spaced on the plate, stamp to low and high iron CAS plates (see 
posted protocol), and to a BHI plate.   If the colonies are close together, pick each one with a 
 
sterile stick and transfer to low and high iron CAS plates and a BHI plate.  Be sure to spot a 
colony of wt PA-14 onto each plate as a control.  If stamping, be sure to mark the orientation of 
the plates, so you can identify colonies. 
Incubate at 30oC overnight. 
5.	
6.	 Screen for mutants based on the pictures provided in the CAS medium protocol. 

Based on PA14 genome, design primers to amplify and sequence the Fur gene to determine the nature of 
the mutation in the putative fur mutants you identify.
