PSEUDOMONAS ELECTROPORATIONS 

Materials: 
o/n culture of recipient strain 
-
-
plasmid for electroporation 
-
300mM sucrose (filter sterilized) 
- LB 
-
2 mm gap width cuvette

grow overnight culture of Pseudomonas strain in LB at 37°C 
(1ml/electroporation) 
transfer 1ml o/n culture into a microcentrifuge tube and spin for 1 minute at 
13,000 rpm 
carefully aspirate off supernatant and resuspend in 1ml 300 mM sucrose 
spin again at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute and repeat sucrose wash 
final spin at 13,000 rpm for 2 minutes, aspirate remaining liquid and 
resuspend in 100 ul sucrose 
if working with a replicative plasmid, add ~10 - 50 ng plasmid to 100 ul cell 
suspension.  If working with a non-replicative plasmid (i.e. suicide plasmid) 
add ~ 300 – 500 ng plasmid. 
slowly mix cell suspension several times by pipetting and transfer into a 2 mm 
gap width cuvette 
gently tap and/or flick cuvette several times until cell suspension settles at the 
bottom between the two metal plates 
insert cuvette into electroporation apparatus and slide cuvette holder all the 
way back until cuvette is in contact with the electrodes 
electroporation settings should be 2.5 kV, 25 uF, 200 Ω 
press and hold two red buttons simultaneously until tone sounds 
o 
time constant (displayed after electroporation) should be 4-5 msec 
immediately resuspend cells in 1 ml room temperature LB and grow at 37C in 
rotator for 1-1.5 hours 
transfer cells to a microcentrifuge tube, spin at 13,000rpm for 2 minutes and 
aspirate supernatant leaving the cell pellet in ~50 ul LB 
resuspend cells in remaining 50 ul LB and plate on LB + antibiotic plate, 
incubate plates overnight at 37°C 
o	
antibiotic should correspond to resistance conferred by plasmid
