Restriction digests 

There  are  two  basic  types  of  restriction  digests  that  you will  perform  during  this  course. 
An  analytical  restriction  digest  is  done  when  you  need  to  use  the  information  from  the 
digest  to  create  a  map  of  your  DNA  or  to  be  sure  that  you  have  the  correct  plasmid.  A 
preparative  restriction  digest  is  done  when  you  need  to  prepare  a  large  amount  of 
particular DNA  fragment. The key difference  is  scale. Generalized protocols  for both are 
described below. 

REAGENTS 

Restriction enzymes: 
Stored  in  -20°C. The  enzymes  are  very  expensive  and we  all must  share  the  same  stock. 
DO NOT CROSS-CONTAMINATE ENZYMES. ALWAYS KEEP THEM ON ICE. 

Enzyme buffers and 100x (10 mg/ml) BSA 
These  are  supplied  by  New  England  BioLabs  and  are  coded  into  4  different  types  of 
buffer. Refer to the NEB catalogue for the correct buffer for each enzyme. 

10 mg/ml RNase A 
A 1000X stock for digesting away the residual RNA present in DNA minipreps – be sure 
that the RNAseA is DNAse-free. If using RNAse A that is not specifically indicated to be 
DNAse -free, boil it for 10 minutes when preparing the stock. 

Guidelines

For analytical digests: 

1.	 Use a reaction volume of 20 μl. 
2.	 Digest about 0.5 μg of DNA - about 1-5 μl of miniprep DNA. 
3.	 Keep  the  volume  of  enzymes  <10%  the  volume  of  the  reaction  to  avoid 
interference  from  glycerol  in  the  enzyme.  Use  about  5  units  of  enzymes  per 
digest. 
4.	 To see small fragments (smaller than 500bp), include ribonuclease A at 1 μg/ml. 
5.	 The  best  resolution  on  agarose  gels will  be  for  fragments  between  250  and  about 
4,000  bases  (0.25-4  kb).  Try  to  design  a  digest  that  generates  fragments  of  this 
size since it is hard to see really small fragments. 
6.	 To decide on  the digestion  conditions  look up  the  enzyme(s)  in  the New England 
Biolabs Catalogue. This is not just a normal catalogue but is instead an invaluable 
reference  book. Different  enzymes  have  different  temperature  and  buffer  optima. 
Be  sure  to  check  the  temperature  of  digestion  and  the  recommended  buffer  for 
each enzyme you plan to use; include BSA if recommended. 
7.	 ALWAYS RUN SIZE MARKERS ON YOUR GEL! 
For preparative digests: 
1.	 Use a reaction volume of 50µl. 
2.	 Digest of 2- 5µg of DNA- depending on  the  size of  the  fragment you want.  (You 
need to digest more plasmid DNA to isolate a smaller fragment.) 
3.	 Use about 20 units of enzyme per digest.

4.	 Use  the  NEB  catalogue  to  determine  reaction  conditions.  For  double  digests 
(using two enzymes), check to see if you can do the reaction in the same buffer. If 
not  you  will  have  to  do  the  digests  in  sequence.  In  between  the  digests  you  will 
need to get rid of the first enzyme, and change buffers. 
5.	
Incubate reactions for about 1 hour. 
6.	 ALWAYS RUN SIZE MARKERS ON YOUR GEL!
