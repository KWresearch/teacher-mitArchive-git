MOTILITY ASSAYS


Twitching 
Concept 
- P. aeruginosa cells can adhere to and move across solid surfaces by extending and 
retracting type IV pili, a behavior known as ‘twitching’. 

Plates 

Assay 

Result 

-	 LB + 1% bacto-agar 
o	 pour as shallow a layer of LB/agar as possible; this will aid in visualizing the 
twitching zone

-

grow liquid culture o/n 
aspirate 2ul culture and insert pipette tip through the gel pad to the plastic/gel 
interface 
dispense 2ul culture into the interface 
o	 move pipette tip very slightly side to side until liquid volume is completely 
dispensed

incubate plates for 24h at 37C 


strains with functional pili will form a large, haze of growth surrounding a smaller, 
thicker colony 
o	 plates can be held up to light to aid in visualizing the twitching zone

Swimming 
Concept 
- P. aeruginosa cells swim in chemotactic rings through liquid channels in semisolid 
agar plates. This behavior requires functional flagellum and chemotaxis machinery. 

Plates 

Assay 

Result 

-	 LB + 0.3% bacto-agar 
o	 pour plates relatively thick to allow yourself a large area for inoculation 
o	 DO NOT INVERT; 0.3% agar is not sturdy and will collapse if plate is 
sufficiently disturbed

-

grow liquid culture o/n 
aspirate 2ul culture and insert pipette tip into the gel pad halfway between the bottom 
(plastic/LB interface) and top (LB/air) surfaces

dispense 2ul culture into the gel 

incubate plates for 12-14 hours at 30C or 24 hours at RT 


strains with functional flagella will grow into large circular colonies while flagellar 
mutant colonies will be greatly reduced in diameter

Swarming 
Concept 
- Under certain conditions, P. aeruginosa cells move in a coordinated manner on 
semisolid surfaces. This activity, known as swarming, is dependent on flagella, type 
IV pili and production of rhamnolipids. 

Plates 

Assay 

Result 

-

-
-
-

0.8% nutrient broth, 0.5% dextrose (D-glucose), 0.5% agar 
o  plates should be dried one overnight before assay 

grow liquid culture o/n 
aspirate 2ul liquid culture and dispense on top of the gel in the center of the plate 
incubate at 30C for 24h 

- The complex motility pattern known as swarming involves the extension of multiple 
tendrils, or colony sub-groups traveling in distinct directions
