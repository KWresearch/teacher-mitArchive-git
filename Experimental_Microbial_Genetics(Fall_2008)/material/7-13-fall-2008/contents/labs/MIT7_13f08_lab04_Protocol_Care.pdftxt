Care and Handling of PA01 fur mutants. 

Cultures are being sent to you as growing organisms on Brain Heart Infusion Agar. Streak them 
out as soon as they arrive and check their phenotypes as described below. Cultures of the 
mutants should be stocked in 12.5% glycerol in a nutrient broth such as BHI and frozen at -70C. 
Use a fresh overnight culture if possible for all your experiments. 

1.	 All of these fur mutants are point mutations and they can and do revert. They revert at a higher 
frequency in media rich in iron. Their phenotype should be checked as often as possible (i.e. 
whenever you are doing an important experiment). There are two ways to check them that are 
relatively easy. Their phenotype on CAS agar plates with high and low concentrations of iron 
should be consistent with the photograph enclosed. The formula for the CAS plates is on the 
following pages. They can also be checked by doing a disc diffusion assay with filter discs 
impregnated with Manganese Chloride. Make a suspension of a fresh culture from a plate or 
broth to an A600 ~.1-.2. Using a cotton swab thoroughly swab a Tryptone agar plate to make a 
uniform lawn for each organism to be tested. 4g Bacto Tryptone, 2.5 g NaCl, 16 g agar, 1L H2O. 
Make small filter paper discs ~7-8mm diameter. Put 15 μL of a 1M solution of MgCl2  on the disc. 
Put disc on Tryptone agar plate. Incubate 37C overnight. PA01 has a zone size of ~17 -18mm 
while the C6 mutant has a zone size of 10mm on these plates. You may come up with simpler 
variations of this method but basically the fur mutants will be more resistant to manganese than 
the wildtype. Note: do not use organisms from plates that contain MnCl2 for experiments 
since that may cause additional mutations. 
2.	 These fur mutants are not easily transformed with plasmids. One problem is that they do not 
seem to take up DNA very easily the other problem is that the manipulations that are required for 
mating or transformation are conditions that will select for reversions. We have not tried 
electroporation with these mutants. 

Remember: We have determined that a fur null mutation in P. aeruginosa is lethal and they 
do not like having a poorly functional fur either. What appears to happen is that revertants 
occur and then they seem to outgrow any of the fur mutants in the culture. However, we 
have successfully done RNase protection assays and we have gotten plasmids into them, 
but after you do so, you need to check the phenotype to be sure that you still have a  fur 
mutant. 

PA01wt


PA06261 anr°


PA06261-C6 anr° fur-6 (Mutation is Ala-10-Gly)


PA06261-C64 anr° -revertant of fur-6 to fur+ (Reversion is Gly-10-Ser)


PA01-C6Tc fur-6. This mutant was generated by cointegration of pSUP203 carrying a 

5’fragment of fur containing the C6 mutation. It has all the phenotypes of the PA06261 with

regard to Mnr  and Siderophore synthesis on CAS plates. 

The phenotype of C6 with respect to siderophore synthesis is that it constitutively 
produces siderophoers on CAS plates and it normally regulated for exotoxin A synthesis 
in 20% O2. This phenotype for exotoxin A does not have anything to do with the anr null 
mutation in PA06261 since the PA01-C6Tc mutant has the same phenotype. 

PA01 A2 fur-2 Mutation His-86-Arg. This seems to be a mild mutation since siderophore 
synthesis on CAS plates is still repressed with iron.


PA01 A4 fur-4 Mutation is His-86-Tyr. This mutation causes constitutive siderophore 

synthesis on CAS plates but exotoxin A synthesis is not affected.


Failure to follow these instructions may result in irreproducible results.


Note: Plates will look very similar at 37°C as well.
