QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol 

This protocol is designed to extract and purify DNA of 70 bp to 10 kb from standard or 
low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffer. Up to 400 mg agarose can be processed per 
spin column. Read through the QIAquick® Spin Handbook posted at the 7.13 Stellar 
website for in depth information about this protocol. 

Notes: 
• The yellow color of Buffer QG indicates a pH ≤7.5. 
•  Add  ethanol  (96–100%,  check  cap  to  see  if  it  has  already  been  added)  to  Buffer  PE 
before use (see bottle label for volume). 
• Isopropanol (100%) and a heating block at 50°C are required. 
•  All  centrifugation  steps  are  carried  out  at  13,000  rpm  (~17,900  x  g)  in  a  conventional 
table-top microcentrifuge. 
• 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, may be necessary. 

1. Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, razor. 
Minimize the size of the gel slice by removing extra agarose. 

2. Weigh the gel slice in a colorless tube. Add 3 volumes of Buffer QG to 1 volume of 
gel (100 mg ~ 100 µl). 
For example, add 300 µl of Buffer QG to each 100 mg of gel. For >2% agarose gels, add 
6 volumes of Buffer QG. The maximum amount of gel slice per QIAquick column is 400 
mg; for gel slices >400 mg use more than one QIAquick column. 

3.  Incubate  at  50°C  for  10  min  (or  until  the  gel  slice  has  completely  dissolved).  To 
help dissolve gel, mix by inverting the tube every 2–3 min during the incubation. 
IMPORTANT: Solubilize agarose completely. For >2% gels, increase incubation time. 

4. After  the gel  slice has dissolved  completely,  check  that  the  color of  the mixture  is 
yellow (similar to Buffer QG without dissolved agarose). 
If the color of the mixture is orange or violet, add 10 µl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 
and mix. The color of the mixture will turn to yellow. The adsorption of DNA to the 
QIAquick membrane is efficient only at pH ≤7.5. Buffer QG contains a pH indicator, 
which is yellow at pH ≤7.5 and orange or violet at higher pH, allowing easy 
determination of the optimal pH for DNA binding. Note: if your DNA is running with the 
bromophenol blue or xylene cyanol FF in the loading dye the QG buffer may turn blue, 
but probably no need to adjust the pH in this case. 

5. Add 1 gel volume of isopropanol to the sample and mix. 
For  example,  if  the  agarose  gel  slice  is  100  mg,  add  100  µl  isopropanol.  This  step 
increases  the  yield  of DNA  fragments  <500  bp  and  >4  kb.  For DNA  fragments  between 
500 bp and 4 kb, addition of isopropanol has no effect on yield.  

6. Place a QIAquick spin column in a provided 2 ml collection tube.

7. To bind DNA, apply the sample to the QIAquick column, and centrifuge for 1 
min. 
The maximum volume of the column reservoir is 800 µl. For sample volumes of more 
than 800µl, simply load and spin again. 

8. Discard flow-through and place QIAquick column back in the same collection 
tube. 
Collection tubes are re-used to reduce plastic waste. 

9. Add 0.5 ml of Buffer QG to QIAquick column and centrifuge for 1 min. 
This step will remove all traces of agarose.  

10. To wash, add 0.75 ml of Buffer PE to QIAquick column, leave for 2-5mins and 
centrifuge for 1 min. 

11. Discard the flow-through and centrifuge the QIAquick column for an additional 
1 min 
at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g). 
IMPORTANT: Residual ethanol from Buffer PE will not be completely removed unless 
the flow-through is discarded before this additional centrifugation. 

12. Place QIAquick column into a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 

13. To elute DNA, add 30-50μl H2O (depending on desired concentration of sample, 
generally inserts for ligation should be concentrated (elute in 30μl)) to the center of 
the QIAquick membrane, wait 1min, and then centrifuge the column for 1 min.  
IMPORTANT: Ensure that the water is dispensed directly onto the QIAquick membrane 
for complete elution of bound DNA (but don’t touch the membrane with your tip). The 
average eluate volume is 48 µl from 50 µl elution buffer volume, and 28 µl from 30 µl. 
Elution efficiency is dependent on pH. The maximum elution efficiency is achieved 
between pH 7.0 and 8.5. When using water, make sure that the pH value is within this 
range, and store DNA at –20°C as DNA may degrade in the absence of a buffering agent.
