The first two weeks of the course will be a molecular biology "boot camp" in
which the whole class will conduct a short project designed to help you master
some basic techniques.

1      Start 150 ml culture of E. coli + pMQ64 in LB+30 ug/ml gentamicin             Day 1 (PDF)
       Streak out PA14 from cryo-stock, put stock in own box in freezer
       Maxi prep of E. coli+pMQ64 culture
       Set up digest of pMQ64 with BamHI
2      Phosphotase cut vector, inactivate phosphotase, freeze vector at -20Â°C     Day 2 (PDF)
       (vector will be gel purified at same time genomic DNA inserts are gel
       purified)
       Start overnight wt PA14, incubate in roller drum at 37Â°C
3      Isolation of genomic DNA from PA14                                            Day 3 (PDF)
       Pour 2 agarose gels
       Get your DNA and it's concentrations from the teaching staff
       Set up your partial digest with BfuCI
       Load and run diagnostic gel
4      Image 1st gel, analyze                                                        Day 4 (PDF)
       Set up upscaled digests
       Louad and run upscale gel; also run cut vector from Day 2 on this gel
       Image gel and cut out correct fragment size band from gel. Freeze at -20Â°C
       Extraction of DNA from gel fragment
       Set up ligation: do 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1. Insert vector ratios, 2 no insert
       controls (one for each insert sample) &amp; a no vector control (9 ligations)
5      Transform ligations, do no DNA control here (cells only) (10 transformations) Day 5 (PDF)
       **Save the rest of ligation reaction in your freezer box**
       Spread x-gal on plates
       Plate 2x, 150 ul (20 plates/group)
       Look at plates, calculate blue to white ratio for each ligation reaction and
       how many plates you need to pool to get good representation of PA14 genome in
6      your plasmid prep.                                                            Day 6 (PDF)
       Pool colonies from appropriate number of plates and mini prep to purify
       plasmid mix. Freeze prep at -20Â°C.
       Set up PCR on plasmid prep
7      Pour gel for Day 8                                                            Days 7-8 (PDF)
       Play with DNAStar
8      Run gel to check results of PCR reaction and plasmid pool library
