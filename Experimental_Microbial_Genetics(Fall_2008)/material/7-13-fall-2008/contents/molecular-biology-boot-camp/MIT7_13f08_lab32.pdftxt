Bootcamp Day 4 – Partial digestion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 genomic DNA and Gel 

Electrophoresis


A.  PARTIAL DIGESTION OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA PA14 GENOMIC DNA 
Today’s goal is to isolate fragments of PA14 genomic DNA of the appropriate sizes to clone into a 
library.  You will be making two libraries: one with fragments ranging in size from 2kb-4kb, and one 
with fragments of size 4kb-8kb.  In order to create these fragments, you will do a partial digestion using 
the restriction enzyme BfuC1.   

Your tasks today will be to determine the optimal conditions for the restriction digestion in order to 
yield fragments of the appropriate size, and then to run a scaled-up digestion using those conditions to 
create a large amount of those fragments.  Later you will purify the correctly sized fragments and clone 
them into the vector pMQ64 that you linearized and dephosphorylated last week.  

In order to determine the appropriate conditions for the partial digestion, you will use a set amount of 
PA14 genomic DNA and vary the concentration of enzyme used to digest it.  

Before you begin, collect the following reagents from the TA’s: 
PA14 genomic DNA of a known concentration 
NEB Buffer 4 (10x stock) 
BSA, 10 mg/mL (100x stock) 
Diluent B 
BfuC1 restriction enzyme 
Stop solution 

Keep your reagents and mixes on ice at all times.  Remember, restriction enzymes are heat sensitive! 

Pilot digestion to determine appropriate conditions: 
1. Create a master mix of everything for the digestion except the enzyme.  This includes: 
-BSA to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml  
-PA14 genomic DNA: 20ug (you will have to calculate the volume based on the concentration of 
DNA you isolated last week) 
-NEB buffer 4 to a final concentration of 1X  
-Water (enough to bring the total volume to 220uL)

After adding all the components, vortex and centrifuge briefly.  Aliquot 20uL into the bottom of 
each of 10 tubes, labeled 1-10. (you should have about 20 ul of master mix left over).  These 10 
tubes will be used for the digestions. 

2. Create serial dilutions of enzyme BfuC1. 
•	 Aliquot 15uL Diluent B into the bottom of each of 9 tubes labeled 1-9.   
DO NOT GET THIS SET OF TUBES CONFUSED WITH THE FIRST SET OF TUBES!!!  It 
would be a good idea to label this set of tubes with a different color pen. 
•	 Add 15uL of BfuC1 to the diluent in Tube #1.  Mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down several 
times. 
When taking out enzyme, do not plunge the pipette tip father than absolutely necessary.  The 
enzyme is preserved in glycerol which is very sticky and viscous and sticks to the pipette tip.  
Because of this, the farther you put your pipette tip into the enzyme mix, the more likely you are 
adding MORE enzyme than you intend.   
•	 Transfer 15uL of this mix into the diluent inTube #2.  Again, mix thoroughly by pipetting up and 
down. 
•	 Transfer 15uL of this mix into the diluent in Tube #3, and continue diluting the enzyme this way 
all the way to Tube #9. 
•	 The BfuC1 stock concentration is 4 units per uL.  Make a note of the concentration in each of 
your dilutions. Again, be careful not to mix up your tubes!

*** Do step (#3) as quickly as possible, and keep your digestions on ice as much as possible!***  If 
you hold the tube excessively in your warm little mitt, the enzyme will being digesting your DNA!   

3. Add 1uL of the appropriate enzyme dilution to each of your aliquots of master mix.  Add the enzyme 
directly into the liquid that is already in the tube, not to the side of the tube. 
NOTE: Don’t use the first dilution (2 units/uL) for the first digestion—instead, use dilution 
#2 for digestions #1 and #2, but add 4uL of stop solution to digestion #1 immediately after 
adding enzyme. (Think: why is this an important control?) 
For digestion #10, use 1uL of water instead of enzyme. (Why is this an important control?) 

4. Vortex the digestion tubes briefly two at a time, and return them immediately to ice.  

5. 	 Set a timer for 30 minutes, and get a rack that will hold all 10 of your reaction tubes.  
Keep the reactions on ice as you walk to the 37°C room and once there transfer the tubes quickly 
from the ice to the rack.  Start your timer.

6. After 30 minutes, quickly transfer your tubes back to ice, and add 4uL stop solution to each tube.  Mix 
well.  The reaction is now quenched.  Relax and hold the reaction in your warm little mitt as long as 
your heart desires.  (Think:  How does the stop solution quench the reaction?) 

7. Load the medium sized analytical gel you prepared last Fri. with your reactions and with 10 ul of 1 kb 
DNA ladder in the lanes flanking them.  Load the entire reaction and run the gel (see more details below 
in the Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and DNA Band Excision section).  Visualize the gel and determine 
which conditions were best for creating 2kb-4kb fragments, and 4kb-8kb fragments.  Your gel should 
look similar to the gel below.  What reaction would you choose to upscale to isolate large amounts of 2 ­
4kb fragments?  4-8 kb? 

B.  SCALED-UP PARTIAL DIGESTION TO OBTAIN CORRECTLY SIZED FRAGMENTS: 
1.  Create two mixes, one to create 2-4kb fragments, and one to create 4-8kb fragments.  
Each mix should contain: 
-
20ug genomic DNA (How much is this compared to each pilot reaction?) 
- NEB buffer 4 to a final concentration of 1X  
- BSA to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml  
- An appropriate volume of the appropriate tube of diluted BfuC1 (How much do you 
need?  Remember, this time you are digesting more DNA) 
- Water (enough to bring the total volume to 200uL)

2.  Load a small 1% agarose gel with as much of the each of the two reactions as you can fit (without it 
spilling over into other wells!). Load the two reactions into separate wells of course!  Also, add an 
appropriate amount of 6x loading dye to your BamHI linearized, dephosphorylated, pMQ64 from last 
week, and load it all in a well on the same gel.  Again load 10ul of 1 kb DNA ladder in the lanes that 
flank your samples.  Run the gel at about 120V, visualize it, and carefully cut out and put into a tube the 
pieces of gel with appropriately sized fragments for gel extraction (see Agarose Gel Electrophoresis  and 
DNA Band Excision Protocols below for the details on how to do this properly!!).   

3. 	 Leave tubes with chunks of gel at –20C.  

C.  AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS 
How it works: 
Agarose gel electrophoresis is a simple and highly effective method for separating, identifying, and 
purifying 0.5 to 25 kb DNA fragments. Voltage applied at the ends of an agarose gel generates an 
electric field with a strength defined by the length of the gel and the potential difference at the ends 
(V/cm). DNA molecules exposed to this electric field migrate toward the anode (positive end) due to the 
negatively charged phosphates along the DNA backbone. The migration velocity is limited by the 
frictional force imposed by the gel matrix. While charge and/or size can affect the rate at which 
macromolecules will pass through the gel, the charge to mass ratio is the same for DNA molecules of 
different lengths. It is the size of the DNA, therefore, that determines the rate at which it passes through 
the gel, thereby allowing an effective separation of DNA fragment-length mixtures by electrophoresis. 
To visualize the DNA, the gel is treated with ethidium bromide. This dye intercalates between the 
stacked bases of nucleic acids and fluoresces red-orange (560 nm) when illuminated with UV light (260 
to 360 nm). 

Reagents and materials: 
50x TAE buffer (agarose gel running buffer) 
•	
•	 Ethidium bromide 10 mg/ml (20,000x stock) - wear gloves when handling EtBr.  Since it is a 
DNA-intercalating molecule, EtBr is a mutagen!  Dispose of all tips etc in labeled receptacle in 
fume hood. 
6X Gel loading buffer 

•	

1. After adding loading dye to your DNA samples to a final concentration of 1x, load the samples into 
the wells of the gel.  Remember to also load a molecular weight marker!!!  See end of this protocol for 1 
kb and 100 bp molecular weight marker patterns. 

2. Run gel with an overlay of 1x TAE (about 5-8 mm deep above the gel) at 100-120V. 

3. When the gel has run far enough, so that your bands have clearly separated and you can tell what size 
they are, take a picture of the gel. 
The bromphenol blue in the loading dye will migrate with an apparent molecular weight of 500 
bp and the xylene cyanol of 2 kb.

D. DNA BAND EXCISION: 
1.  Weigh as many Eppendorf or 15 ml Falcon tubes (depending on the size of the gel piece you expect 
to cut out, for bands >~400 mg use a Falcon tube) as you will have pieces to cut out—this will allow you 
to determine the mass of gel you cut, which is necessary to know for the DNA purification procedure. 

2.  Take the gel to the dark room and the UV-light transluminator to visualize the DNA bands. In order 
to minimize damage to the DNA, use a long-wave UV light for as short a time as possible. Make sure to 
wear a face shield mask during this procedure since the UV light will burn your retina and/or your 
skin.  Excise the desired band using a razor blade.  Minimize the amount of extra, non-DNA containing 
agarose that you cut out.  Place the band in an eppendorf tube (or 15 ml Falcon tube if it is >400 mg).  

3.  Take a picture of the gel without the band in it to be sure the band is successfully recovered. 

4.  Weigh each of the tubes with the pieces of gel in them, and calculate how much gel is in each one. 
For now, freeze the gel fragments at -20°C.  Make sure your tubes are well labeled!
