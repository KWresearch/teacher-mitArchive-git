Bootcamp Day 1 – Start a culture of E. coli + pMQ64 and streak Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 
for single colonies 

1. Start a culture of E. coli + pMQ64 for tomorrow’s maxi prep 
Dilute the starter culture of E. coli DH5α + pMQ64 you have been given 1/1000 into LB + 30 
ug/ml gentamicin medium. For high-copy plasmids like pMQ64, inoculate ● 150 ml medium. 
For low-copy plasmids, inoculate ● 250 ml medium. Grow at 37°C for 12–16 h with vigorous 
shaking (approx. 300 rpm). 
*Use a flask or vessel with a volume of at least 4 times the volume of the culture.  The 
culture should reach a cell density of approximately 3–4 x 109 cells per milliliter, which 
typically corresponds to a pellet wet weight of approximately 3 g/liter. 

2. Streak the cryostock of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 you have been given for single colonies to 
LB. 
•	 Obtain an LB agar plate (with antibiotic if appropriate). 
•	 Using a sterile wooden stick, touch the bacteria growing within the punctured area of the stab 
culture. 
•	 Run the stick lightly over a section of the plate, as shown in the figure, to create streak #1.  
•	 Using another sterile wooden stick, pass through streak #1 and spread the bacteria over a second 
section of the plate, to create streak #2.  
•	 Using a third sterile wooden stick, pass through streak #2 and spread the bacteria over the last 
section of the plate, to create streak #3. 
•	 For routine growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli, wrap the outer edges of the plate 
with parafilm and incubate the plate at 37°C overnight. 
In the morning, single colonies should be visible. If the bacterial growth is too dense, re-streak 
onto a new agar plate to obtain single colonies.
