***** Course Description *****
In this class, students engage in independent research projects to probe
various aspects of the physiology of the bacteriumÂ Pseudomonas aeruginosa
PA14, an opportunistic pathogen isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis
patients. Students use molecular genetics to examine survival in stationary
phase, antibiotic resistance, phase variation, toxin production, and secondary
metabolite production.
Projects aim to discover the molecular basis for these processes using both
classical and cutting-edge techniques. These include plasmid manipulation,
genetic complementation, mutagenesis, PCR, DNA sequencing, enzyme assays, and
gene expression studies. Instruction and practice in written and oral
communication are also emphasized.
