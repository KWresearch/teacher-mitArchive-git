***** Course Description *****
<p>This course is designed as an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of
Women's and Gender Studies, an academic area of study focused on the ways that
sex and gender manifest themselves in social, cultural, and political contexts.
The primary goal of this course is to familiarize students with key issues,
questions and debates in Women's Studies scholarship, both historical and
contemporary. This semester you will become acquainted with many of the
critical questions and concepts feminist scholars have developed as tools for
thinking about gendered experience. In addition, we will study the
interconnections among systems of oppression (such as sexism, racism, classism,
ethnocentrism, homophobia/heterosexism, transphobia, ableism and others.) In
this course you will learn to "read" and analyze gender, exploring how it
impacts our understanding of the world.<p>
