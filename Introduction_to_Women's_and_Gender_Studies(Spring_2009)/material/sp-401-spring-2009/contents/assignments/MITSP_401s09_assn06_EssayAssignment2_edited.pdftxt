SP.401 – Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies 
Essay Assignment #2 
 
Length: 5-7 pages, or approximately 1500-1800 words 
 
Using examples from at least three different assigned readings (and/or films shown in 
class), choose ONE of the following two topics and write a 5-7 page essay in response to 
it. You will need to draw examples from the texts we have read to support your points; 
use parenthetical citations to document the sources you use. Be sure that you are 
introducing your quotes adequately, creating smooth transitions between your own 
writing and that of your sources. Your essay should include a clear thesis statement in 
which you make an argument in answer to the question you choose. 
 
1.  Children experience socialization at a very early age. Drawing from the studies by 
Thorne and Twine, explain what the implications of these essays are for changing 
the way we view gender and race in society. How might the conclusions of these 
social scientists (and/or Lorber, Kimmel etc.) be in conflict with emerging 
biological findings by Fausto-Sterling, Kessler, and the failed outcome of John 
Money’s famous Reimer twins case? 

 
2.  Explain how intersex and transgender identities in particular challenge 
conventional notions of sex and gender. What do these cases tell us about how the 
binary sex/gender system is policed and maintained in North America? How are 
the political demands of the two groups different? What other alternatives to a 
binary system are there, and are they viable? You may wish to use the Franke 
article and outside research on intersex identities found on www.isna.org (Intersex 
Society of North America) to answer this question. 

 

 

3.  The representation of and cultural beliefs about women’s bodies have a profound 
impact on the way we view women in society. Working with readings assigned, 
give some examples of the ways in which women are portrayed or “read” and 
how that impacts body image, health and health policy, and/or consumerism. In 
what ways do class and race inform standards of beauty and femininity in addition 
to gender stereotypes?
