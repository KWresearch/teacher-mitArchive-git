 SP.401 – Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies 
Short Assignment #4 
 

 
Length: 1-2 pages, or approximately 300-600 words 
 
 
In a short essay, discuss the barriers affecting women in the workplace. What are they, 

and have they changed since the historical days Kessler-Harris discusses in her article 

“The Wage Conceived”?  How? Appropriate essays to draw from in this homework 

assignment include Kessler-Harris, Bose & Whaley, Reskin, Padavic & Reskin, Boris, 

Kang, or Hondagneu-Sotelo – a good strategy for a short response is to choose one and 

respond to it in light of the question(s) above. Don’t forget to include a coherent thesis 

statement and to support your argument with concrete examples from the text(s) you 

choose.
