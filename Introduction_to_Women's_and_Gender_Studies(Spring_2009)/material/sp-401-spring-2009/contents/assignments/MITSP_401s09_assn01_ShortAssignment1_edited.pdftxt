In a short essay, compare the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments with the Declaration 
of Independence. Why did Elizabeth Cady Stanton choose to model the document after 
Thomas Jefferson’s famous text? In your answer, explain how this choice was designed 
to appeal to a particular audience. Who was that audience? How does Stanton’s 
Declaration compare in tone and content with earlier feminist writers like Mary 
Wollstonecraft in A Vindication of the Rights of Women?
