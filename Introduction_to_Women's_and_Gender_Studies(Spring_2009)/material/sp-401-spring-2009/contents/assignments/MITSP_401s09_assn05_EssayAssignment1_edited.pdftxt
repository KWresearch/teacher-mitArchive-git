SP.401 – Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies 
Essay Assignment #1 
 
Length: 5-7 pages, or approximately 1500-1800 words 
 
Choose ONE of the following topics and write a 5-7 page essay in response to it. You will need 
to draw examples from the texts we have read to support your points; use parenthetical citations 
to document the sources you use. Be sure that you are introducing your quotes adequately, 
creating smooth transitions between your own writing and that of your sources. Your essay 
should include a clear thesis statement in which you make an argument in answer to the 
question you choose. 
 
1. Thinking about the suffrage campaign in the first wave of the women’s movement, consider 
how the analogy of sex and race was used to advocate for women’s rights. When does the 
analogy work? At what point does it break down? What happened in the women's suffrage 
movement that illustrates either of these outcomes? Using examples from the film Not For 
Ourselves Alone and the texts we have read, explain how women in the first wave campaigned 
for the vote. How did racial difference affect the movement?  
 
2. Compare the rhetorical strategies used by Mary Wollstonecraft, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
and/or Frederick Douglass (choose at least two of these) to argue for change. What did they do in 
their writing or speeches to convince the people they were addressing? Who was their audience? 
Explain what each writer you critique was trying to achieve and how they arguments they 
presented helped them accomplish their goal. 
 
3. Compare the historical events of the 1860s surrounding the debate between women’s vs. 
Negro suffrage to what happened in the 2008 Democratic primary in the standoff between 
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Explain how race and gender were understood as politically 
distinct categories, and where this left African American women in each case.  
 
4. Consider the historical diagnosis of “neurasthenia” and the “hysterical woman.” How did this 
“disease” (and its cure) reflect and reinforce cultural values surrounding women of the 19th 
century? What forms of resistance are exhibited by Gilman’s narrator in “The Yellow 
Wallpaper”? What message can we take from this short story? Does it still have relevance today? 
In thinking about contemporary implications, you may wish to make a comparison between the 
historical themes in Gilman’s story and Fausto-Sterling’s “Hormonal Hurricanes” article, or the 
reactions & resistance to cultural norms expressed in Zanele Muholi’s photography.
