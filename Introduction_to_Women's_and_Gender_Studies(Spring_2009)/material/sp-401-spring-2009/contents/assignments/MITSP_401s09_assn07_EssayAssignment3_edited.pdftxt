SP.401 – Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies 
Essay Assignment #3 
 
 

 
Length: 5-7 pages, or approximately 1500-1800 words 
 
Using examples from at least three different assigned readings (and/or films shown in 
class), choose ONE of the following topics and write a 5-7page essay in response to it. 
You will need to draw examples from the texts we have read to support your points; use 
parenthetical citations to document the sources you use. Be sure that you are introducing 
your quotes adequately, creating smooth transitions between your own writing and that of 
your sources. Your essay should include a clear thesis statement in which you make an 
argument in answer to the question you choose. 
 

 

 

 

1.  What issues do women face in the workplace? How does the cultural association 
of women with motherhood impact their relationship to employment? Answer this 
in terms of hiring practices, job retention/promotion, and women’s decisions 
about childcare. 

 
2.  What is the cultural message for girls and women about sex and sexuality? How is 
it different for boys and men? How does this relate to the notion of “consent” and 
why does it foster a climate conducive to violence against women? 

3.  What are some problems associated with cultural biases about women and their 
bodies? How does sexism, racism, religious belief, and/or homophobia filter our 
view and understanding of the female body? Consider the implications of these 
biases for medical approaches to disability, illness, and reproductive health. 

4.  What is the state of feminism today? How do global (and economic) issues impact 
feminism in the 21st century? Put your argument in context of the history of the 
women’s movement as discussed by Taylor, Whitter, & Fabrizio Pelak. 

5.  Discuss the cultural implications of marriage and the social construction of the 
family as it impacts our perceptions of gender roles and economic opportunities 
for women and men.  What do cultural conventions surrounding weddings and 
marriage proposals tell us about how gender is viewed in different societies and 
cultural contexts? How does this shape or prescribe outcomes for women’s lives?
