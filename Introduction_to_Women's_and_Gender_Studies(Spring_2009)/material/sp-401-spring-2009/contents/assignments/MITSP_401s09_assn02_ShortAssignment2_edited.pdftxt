SP.401 – Introduction to Women’s and Gender Studies 
Short Assignment #2 
 
 

 
Length: 1-2 pages, or approximately 300-600 words 
 
 
 
In a short essay, explain what socialization is and how it relates to the nature-nurture 

debate. Where does our sense of gender and race come from? What is the impact of 

social and cultural settings on these identities? Use examples from at least one article (or 

film) we have discussed (e.g. Thorne, Kimmel, Twine, Lorber, Kessler, Fausto-Sterling, 

Taylor & Rupp). A good strategy to follow in this short assignment is to define terms 

and focus your argument on a close reading of a single source. What is at stake in this 

debate for feminists? Don’t forget to include a coherent thesis statement and to support 

your argument with concrete examples from the text(s) you choose.
