represented differently for people of different races? classes? ethnicities? You may wish 

to consider how conventional standards of beauty relate to the representation of women 

in the media and popular culture, or the effects of cultural beliefs about women on health 

or sexuality. Appropriate essays to draw from in this homework assignment could include 

Gimlin, Thompson, Smith, Richardson, Taylor, Banks,  Le Espiritu, or Hill Collins – a
