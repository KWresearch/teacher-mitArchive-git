Rhetoric Tool Chest   

 

 
 “Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available 
means of persuasion.”—Aristotle 
 
Three Major Types of Rhetorical Appeal 
•  Logos (appeals to logic) 
•  Pathos (appeals to audience’s emotions) 
•  Ethos (appeals based on the rhetor’s personality).  
1.  There are 2 types of ethos: 
(cid:131)  situated ethos: a speaker/writer’s character, position in society, or 
good reputation 
invented ethos: the impression that one is knowledgeable and of 
good character 
2.  There are 3 ways to demonstrate ethos: 
(cid:131)  By displaying sagacity (one’s knowledge of the issues, wisdom, 
expertise).  
(cid:131)  By demonstrating your moral character (moral excellence, 
credibility, justice, self-control, common sense) 
(cid:131)  By showing good will (having concern for audience’s survival and 
growth needs)  

(cid:131) 

 
Canons of Rhetoric 
In addition, rhetoric has traditionally been broken down into 5 canons: 
1.  Invention: methods for finding or creating ideas 
2.  Arrangement: ways of ordering your discourse 
3.  Style: saying things well 
4.  Memory: information and methods for accessing information. Also methods for 
reminding readers of what they have already read (e.g., forecasting and continual 
forecasting and other internal pointers or repetitions in the text that help serve to 
orient readers through a dense text). 
5.  Delivery: ways of presenting your ideas in various media 

 
Elaboration on Canons 
 

 

Invention 

The early Greeks, including Sophists and Aristotle, and later rhetoricians 
developed a series of questions (called “common topics” and “special topics”) to help 
their students think through a topic. They divided the universe into 4 things—objects, 
events, abstract concepts, and propositions. This handout offers a simplified and 
modernized version of those questions to help you think about speech and essay 
subjects. 
This approach helps you discover material by asking questions about your topic. 
The questions direct your attention to each aspect of a topic, thus preventing you from 
forgetting some aspect in your thinking about that topic. Writing a paragraph (or more) 

 

1 

response to each question in the appropriate set(s) will deepen your insights into your 
topic. Often you will need to use more than one set of questions to explore your topic. 
 
Questions to Ask About Any Physical Object (e.g., a computer) 
1.  What are its physical characteristics? 
2.  What sort of structure does it have? 
3.  What other object(s) is it similar to? 
4.  How does it differ from things that resemble it? 
5.  Who uses it? For what? 

 
Questions to Ask About Any Event (e.g., the assassination of Lincoln) 
1.  Exactly what happened (who, what, when, where, why, how)? 
2.  What were the causes of the event? 
3.  What were the consequences of the event? 
4.  How was this event like or unlike similar events? 
5.  To what other events was it connected? 
6.  How might the event been altered or avoided? 

 
Questions to Ask About Any Abstract Concept? (e.g., fairness, love, justice)  
1.  How has the term been defined by others? 
2.  How do you define the term? 
3.  What other concepts have been associated with it? 
4.  In what ways has this concept affected the lives of people? 
5.  How might this concept be changed to work better? How might it be applied to be 
more useful? 

 
Questions to Ask About Any Proposition (e.g., “The death penalty is immoral.”) 
1.  What must be established before readers will believe the proposition? 
2.  What are the meanings of the key words in the proposition? (Note that here you 
might need to go back to “Questions to Ask About Any Abstract Concept”—e.g., 
in the example, the concept immoral must be defined). 
3.  By what kinds of evidence can the proposition be proved or disproved? 
4.  What counter-arguments must be confronted and refuted? 
5.  What are the practical consequences of the proposition? 
 

 

Arrangement 
 
The essay must have an effective, clear, and logical structure. It must use transitional 
words, phrases, and devices to make explicit connections between ideas and between 
paragraphs. The organization exists to present your ideas in the most effective manner 
possible to your readers. 
•  All academic essays have a beginning, middle, and end-- but that fact is not 
particularly useful in helping us organize our ideas.  
It helps if we think in terms of sections.  
In ancient rhetorical terms, your essay should have the following sections (in 
specific cases, some might be omitted or combined, depending upon your topic 

•

and audience). Unless you have a good reason for altering the order, however, 
you should probably follow this basic rhetorical structure developed by Cicero and 
Quintilian: 
o  Exordium (Introduction): The exordium is intended to make the audience 
willing to listen. Modern rhetorical theory says that, if possible, the 
introduction should do several things:  
It should establish some connection between audience and rhetor 
(cid:131) 
(i.e., it should "predispose" audience to listen via ethos).  
It establishes a sense of kairos for the readers (urgency).  
It should hook the readers' attention.  
It should announce your topic (the question your essay will answer or 
the issue that it will explore).  
It should reveal what your approach to the topic will be.  
It should establish what your primary tone will be.  
It should usually start very close to your thesis (never start with 
"Since the beginning of recorded history....").  
It often establishes the nature of the larger issue (your topic is an 
example of this larger issue-- e.g., the larger issue for the topic of 
abortion might "What are the limits of government intervention in our 
private decisions?" or it might be "How do we decide whose rights 
are more important when there is a conflict between the rights of 
different individuals?" or it might be "Do the ends always justify the 
means?"). When you establish this in the introduction, you will return 
to this larger issue in your conclusion.  
It often forecasts what the organization of the essay will be.  
(cid:131) 
o  Narratio (Background of the Issue)-- this section: 
It gives your readers the relevant background information that they 
(cid:131) 
will need in order to understand the issue before you start the 
argument.  
It includes up-to-date information about the current situation (e.g., 
pending legislation, proposed solutions).  
It defines key terms that you will use and that readers might not 
know.  
It explains why this situation/issue is a problem and for whom, 
explains any key concepts that are needed to understand the 
complexity of the issue, and it defines any key terms your readers 
might not know.  
It states your position (thesis/claim).  
(cid:131) 
o  Confirmatio (Proof)-- This section gives evidence to prove the claims made 
in the narratio:  
(cid:131) 
It states your reasons for supporting your position.  
It gives your evidence for each reason.  
(cid:131) 
It anticipates your opponents' objections to your reasons and 
(cid:131) 
respond to those objections.  
o  Confutatio or Refutatio (Refutation)-- This section answers the 
opposition's counter arguments:  

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

(cid:131) 

 

3 

(cid:131) 

It explains your opponents' main reasons and evidence for 
supporting that position.  
(cid:131) 
It refutes (or occasionally concedes) those reasons and evidence.  
(cid:131)  Some modern rhetoricians advocate a dramatic, back-and-forth 
presentation of pros and cons rather than saving all the refutation for 
the last major body section.  
o  Peroratio (Conclusion) -- This section demonstrates again the "full 
strength" of your argument. Modern rhetorical theory suggests that your 
conclusion should never be only a summary or repetition of your major 
points, although often you might touch on the major points you've made. 
Your conclusion should always include a "discovery," an opening up toward 
the world beyond the limits of your argument essay:  
(cid:131)  an explanation of some interesting implication of your position/thesis 
that you haven't yet discussed explicitly.  
(cid:131)  and/or an indication of what future thinking must be done.  
(cid:131)  and/or a suggestion of what new issues arise if your solution/position 
is adopted.  
(cid:131)  and/or an exploration of the implications of your argument and thesis 
for the larger issue that you mentioned in the introduction.  

 
 
Diachronic and Synchronic Reading 
•  A text can be read, analyzed, and understood either diachronically or 
synchronically 
•  The diachronic approach says that the text was created by a particular person 
at a particular time which had particular historical and cultural pressures and 
assumptions.  
1.  When we read a text diachronically, we look at it as, at least in part, a 
historical document, as a document that reveals something about the time 
and place and author. 
2.  So we might read a text (e.g., the Bible, a novel by Hawthorne) to learn 
about other eras. 
•  The synchronic approach says that, regardless of the history of the text, that 
text exists now and affects current readers.  
1.  When we read a text synchronically, we read it, at least in part, for its 
impact on us—as a means of explaining life or the world, of giving us 
guidance, of giving us amusement.  
2.  So we might read a text (e.g., the Bible, a novel by Hawthorne) to learn 
how to deal with a current problem (e.g., guilt, sin, a sense of being 
alienated). 

 
Rhetorical Situation 
 
Who is speaking? Who is reading or listening? Is this a “known” audience or an 
“estimate” of the intended audience? How do you know? What kind of text has been 
produced?

Rhetor 
(Writer, 
Speaker) 

Audience 

 

 
What is the context? Who has the power to speak?  

 
 
Key Terms 
 
1.  Rhetor = the speaker or writer, someone who creates discourse that is intended to 
affect community thinking or events [Crowley 436] 
2.  Rhetorician = someone who studies or teaches the art of rhetoric [Crowley 436) 
3.  Rhetorical critic = someone who analyzes discourse using rhetorical tools 
4.  Unit of Analysis = is one significant rhetorical element or rhetorical strategy. Often 
in discussions (and in this course), “unit of analysis” is a blanket term that covers all 
the concepts in this handout. 
a.  A unit that is incredibly significant for one text might be totally insignificant for 
another text.  
i.  For instance, for a free verse poem, the unit “rhyme” would be useless 
since, by its very definition, a free verse poem does not rhyme.  
ii.  For a text which displays little literary impulse or craft, using the unit 
“memorable phrasings” or “parallel structure” would not reveal much 
about the text. Using “memorable phrasings” or “parallel structure” to 
analyze an essay by Bacon or Dillard, however, would be very 
productive. 
b.  In other words, it is up to you to select units of analysis that are significant for 
the text you analyze. 
5.  Rhetorical strategy = a plan or series of maneuvers to achieve a specific 
persuasive goal. The strategy will usually combine a particular approach (e.g., 
narration) or approaches (e.g., narration plus exposition) and will use several units of 
analysis. Often one or two strategies will predominant in a text (although many might 
appear). We think about which strategies are most emphasized and are most 
distinctive. 
6.  Rhetorical maneuver or rhetorical move = an action (within a text) that is intended 
to achieve a rhetorical purpose—e.g., after a somewhat neutral description of an 
environmental problem, the rhetor suddenly states, “And you have caused this 

 

5 

problem.” This sudden change of tone is intended to shock readers out of their 
current assumptions and attitudes and force them to ask themselves, “Am I really 
responsible?”  
7.  Kairos = The propitious moment or window of opportunity for addressing a particular 
issue and a particular audience. Most issues (e.g., gun control) are often “back 
burner issues” until a moment occur when they become “hot issues” (e.g., the 
shootings at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007). Later (and often quickly) the window of 
opportunity closes as other issues blaze forth. When occasions do not create kairos 
for us, we have to create it for our audiences. When an issue is “hot,” we do not 
have to do to convince audiences to listen (e.g., simply mentioning the Virginia Tech 
shootings). However, often issues are not yet “hot” (consider the decades-long effort 
to get Americans to pay attention to global warming) and therefore we have to create 
kairos. In short, we have to ask “Why should my audience (e.g., members of 
21W.747) care about this particular topic at this particular time (e.g., in the middle of 
this semester)?  
Kairos raises the following questions for us: 
1.  “Have recent events made the issue urgent right now, or do I need to show its 
urgency or make it relevant to the present? Will a history of the issue help? 
2.  “What arguments seem to be favored by what groups at this time? That is, 
which communities are making which arguments? How are their interests 
served by these arguments?  
3.  “What venues give voice to which sides of the issues? Does one group or 
another seem to be in a better position—a better place—from which to argue? 
In other words, what are the power dynamics at work in an issue? Who has 
power? Who doesn’t? Why? 
4.  “What lines of argument would be appropriate or inappropriate considering 
the prevailing needs and values of the audience? 
5.  “What other issues are bound up with discourse about this issue right now, in 
this place and in this community? Why?” (Crowley 52)  
6.  “Which arguments receive more attention? 
7.  “Who is making these arguments? 
8.  What arguments receive less attention? 
9.  Who is making these arguments?” (Crowley 61) 

 
Stasis Theory = A method of asking questions to aid invention and to help decide 
exactly what is being argued (in trials, we’d say “what is the point at issue?”). Stasis 
questions help the debaters come to that agreement. The four questions are: 
•  Fact (Conjecture): Did the act happen? Does the thing exist? 
•  Definition: How can the act be defined?  
•  Quality: How serious is the act? 
•  Policy: Should this act be submitted to some formal procedure? 

 
Here is an example: 
•  Question of Fact: “Did Brutus, as has been alleged, kill Caesar?”  
•  Question of Definition: “If it is granted that Brutus did kill Caesar, was the act 
murder or self-defense? 

 

6 

•  Question of Quality: “If it was in fact murder, was Brutus justified in murdering 
Caesar?” 
•  Question of  Policy: “If Brutus was not justified in murdering Caesar, should we 
punish Brutus?” 
  
Elaboration on Stasis Questions 
•  Questions of Fact (Conjecture, Inference): Cicero says  
o  Does it exist? Is it true? 
o  “If it exists, what is it?  
o  What is its origin?  
o  What is its cause—who or what or who produced it?  
o  Can it be changed? 
•  Questions of Definition 
o  What kind of thing or event is it? 
o  To what larger class or things does it belong? 
o  What are its parts? How are they related? 
•  Questions of Quality 
o 
Is it a good or bad thing? Is it right or wrong? 
o  Should it be sought or avoided? 
o 
Is it honorable or dishonorable? 
o 
Is it better or worse than something else? 
o 
Is it more or less desirable than any alternatives? 
o 
Is it more or less right (or wrong) than any alternatives? 
•  Questions of Policy  
o  Should some action be taken? 
o  What actions are possible? Desirable? 
o  How will proposed actions change the current situation? Make it better or 
worse? How? In what ways? For whom? 
o  Should some state of affairs be regulated (or not) by some formalized 
policy? 
o  Which policies can be implemented? Which cannot? 
o  What are the merits and defects of competing proposals?  
o  How is my proposal  better than others? Worse? (Crowley 86-92) 

 
 

UNITS OF ANALYSIS 

 
One grouping of units of analysis is Appeals 
 
Appeal to Logos (Rational Argument, Appeal to Logic)—relies on evidence and 
reasoning. You should identify the main arguments in the text, the different types of 
reasoning used, and the kinds of support used to back up the arguments. Three sub-
categories exist: 
1.  Evidence-oriented argument: There are at least 8 different kinds of evidence: 
a.  The testimony of experts or authorities or eye witnesses 
b.  The rhetor’s personal experiences 

 

7 

c.  Statistics 
d.  Examples 
i.  Real life (e.g., current events) 
ii.  Historical 
iii.  Hypothetical  
iv.  Fictional (e.g., from novels, movies, plays) 
e.  Comparisons such as analogies and metaphors 
f.  Logical demonstration 
g.  Legal documents and concepts (e.g., the Constitution) 
h.  Codes of conduct (e.g., Hippocratic oath) 
2.  Enthymematic argument—the rhetor hopes audience will fill in the missing 
premises, evidence, or support for his/her claim 
3.  Refutative argument—the rhetor answers opponents’ objections to his/her 
position as well as explaining why his/her position is better than the opponents.’ 
4.  Engagement with the opposition. The rhetor anticipates and tells his/her 
audience what the opposition will say about his/her point, then counters that 
opposition point with an answer. (Strang)  
5.  Narrative—rhetor tells a story 
a.  Usually narrations appeal, in part, to pathos because the rhetor makes the 
scene and action vivid. 
b.  Narratives might use dialogue and vivid descriptions. 
 
Appeal to Pathos – techniques are used to make audience feel various emotions—
e.g., sympathy, anger, patriotism, fear, pride 
 
Appeal to Ethos—Ethos belongs to the rhetor (we do not talk about the audience’s 
ethos).  There are two types of ethos. 
1.  The rhetor’s external authority and reputation (e.g., the Pope, the president, a 
famous scientist)  
2.  The rhetor’s ethos from within the text itself 
3.  Because we are interested primarily in how to become better rhetors, we do not 
focus on the external authority and reputation.  
4.  Instead, we analyze texts to discover the techniques rhetors use within the text  
to make audiences believe in their credibility and in their sincerity and in the 
accuracy of their statements and positions. 
 
Appeals to Values—basic societal values and attitudes (e.g., equality for all, freedom, 
fairness)--also a source of pathos. Here too explicit appeals to ethical theories and 
ethical analysis can be very effective.  
 
Appeals to Commonplaces: Commonplaces are part of the dominant discourse 
community (i.e., they seem to be “plain commonsense” and “so obvious that they don’t 
need to be named, let alone examined”). For instance, an American commonplace is 
“all men are created equal.”  
 

 

8 

Appeals to Needs-- essential human needs (e.g., the need for security, food, shelter). 
Sometimes these appeals are to pathos. 
 
Appeals to Symbols—societal symbols (e.g., the flag, a rose) or symbols created 
within the text itself (e.g., the child in the cellar in LeGuin’s “Omelas” or the horse in 
Alice Walker’s “Am I Blue?”). Sometimes these appeals are to pathos. 
 
A second grouping of units of analysis is Figures of Language  
 
A “figure of language” (Crowley’s term, 432) is any artful use of language. Language is 
used to make a point vivid and/or to make a conclusion more understandable and 
memorable, and/or to add emphasis. Figures of language can augment ethos, logos, or 
pathos. There are several types of figures of language (Rowland 123 ff) 
1.  forms of comparison such as metaphor, simile, analogy (2 key dimensions) 
a.  degree of development 
b.  literal (e.g., comparing 2 presidents) or figurative distinction (comparing a 
lion to a president)  
2.  antithesis (“not this, but that”) 
3.  parallel structure and repetition 
4.  rhetorical questions (questions that the rhetor believes the audience will 
answer the same way he/she does—i.e., the rhetor assumes the audience 
shares his/her assumptions, or questions to which the rhetor assumes there is no 
answer) 
5.  depiction or vivid description 
6.  personification 
7.  definition and redefinition 
8.  allusion (indirect reference to a work of literature, rhetoric, or history) 
9.  label or slogan (e.g., “X is a terrorist,” “X is a freedom fighter,” “if you outlaw 
guns, then only outlaws will have guns”) 
10. irony (explicitly saying X but meaning Y) 
11. memorable phrasings 
12. sound strategies (often more important in poetry than in prose) 
a.  alliteration and assonance 
b.  rhythm and rhyme 
c.  onomatopoeia 

 
GLOBAL ISSUES TO CONSIDER WHENEVER ANALYZING A TEXT 
 
1.  The Rhetorical Situation—where the text was first published or the speech 
delivered, what type of real-life audience was there, what was the context of the text, 
what was the occasion.  
a.  For speeches, the rhetorical situation is always crucial. 
b.  For a lot of published texts, however, this information is often only mildly 
important  
c.  As Wayne Booth points out, the ultimate rhetorical success of a text should 
not be judged by how well it was received when first delivered or published 

 

9 

 
2.  The Text’s Tasks—these are the tasks that the rhetor tries to accomplish with and 
within the text. For many texts (and especially for speeches), we can distinguish two 
primary types of tasks (Strang) 
a.  Internal tasks: what the rhetor is trying to accomplish within the text itself 
i.  e.g., consider a State of the Union address 
ii.  its internal tasks are 
1.   to trumpet the accomplishes of the president over the last year 
2.  at times to justify decisions made in the past year 
3.  to suggest what will be accomplished in the coming year 
b.  External tasks: the effect(s) that the rhetor hopes to create in the audience 
via the text  (Strang) 
i.  e.g., consider a State of the Union address again 
ii.  its external tasks are 
1.  To gain or maintain support for the president (Strang) 
2.  To gain support for the president’s plans for the upcoming year 
(Strang) 
3.  If it is an election year, to convince people to vote for the 
president or the candidates from the president’s party 
4.  In short, the external tasks are about influencing or affecting the 
audience in some way, either a call to action or an attempt to 
change opinions or to give information (Strang)  
5.  Although we can usually deduce the external tasks quite easily, 
there is rarely a way to discover if they were actually 
accomplished 
a.  How did the audience react to the speech?  
i.  Immediately after hearing the speech?  
ii.  A week later?  
iii.  A year later?  
iv.  How can we know?  
b.  Is our own response to the speech/text really 
representative and how can we know that? (Strang) 
c.  It is important to keep these two tasks separate because beginning critics 
often focus only on the external tasks and hence miss the more important 
point of the text 

 
3.  The Text’s Goal(s) or Purpose(s)—the aim(s) stated or implied in the text 
(comparable to the internal tasks).  
4.  We infer the goal from the rhetoric itself, not from knowledge of the rhetor or the 
subject. Occasionally a rhetor will simply state his/her goal. Rarely, however, is a 
stated goal the only goal of the text.  
5.  The Text’s Thesis—the main point of the text 
a.  The thesis can usually be stated by rhetorical critics in one sentence 
b.  But we may have to infer the thesis if the rhetor only implies it or never states 
it succinctly  
6.  The Text’s Theme(s)—main threads/ideas that run throughout the text 

 

10 

7.  The Text’s Requested Action—what the rhetor wants accomplished and what the 
rhetor wants the audience to do in order to achieve that aim (Rowland 18). 
8.  The Text’s Organization—always examine organization (it reveals emphasis)—It is 
usually a good idea to outline the text paragraph-by-paragraph (doing so not only 
gives you control over the ideas and the flow of ideas, but it is also an effective way 
to discover various rhetorical strategies and devices as well--Strang). 
a.  The Text’s Introduction—usually the Introduction and Conclusion are 
proportionally more important than the Body. Among other things, the 
Introduction establishes the rhetor’s credibility and gains attention of audience 
(Rowland 19). 
b.  The Text’s Main Body—identifies the “overarching organizational pattern” 
and reveals what the rhetor intends to emphasize (Rowland 20)—usually the 
most important idea is developed last (all other things being equal) (Strang). If 
you have three main points, often begin the Body with your second best idea, 
follow it with your weakest point, then conclude with the best point. But as 
with all things rhetorical, the nature of your audience and of the rhetorical 
situation determine what order you use (Strang). 
c.  The Text’s Conclusion—summarizes the argument, calls on the audience to 
act, uses some sort of “illustrative material” to maintain the audience’s 
attention (Rowland 20). Usually the Conclusion includes both a summary and 
a “discovery” that makes explicit something that was only implicit in the text: 
This discovery might be the call to action or it might be the revelation of an 
implication of the thesis/theme (Strang). 

 
9.  The Role of Rhetor—the role assumed by the rhetor strongly limits what the rhetor 
can say, and the role influences the way the audience evaluates the rhetor’s 
credibility. 
a.  Implied relationship between rhetor and audience: peer-to-peer, superior-to-
inferior, and inferior-to-superior (the types of evidence cited, the 
references and allusions that are explained, and the moral tone of the rhetoric 
are key clues). 
b.  The specific role played (if any) by the rhetor—e.g., moral leader, mourner, 
cheerleader (Rowland 22).  

 
10. The Text’s Linguistic or Aesthetic Tone—the “feel of the language” and symbols, 
the rhetor’s attitude toward the subject and/or toward the audience. For example, the 
tone might be sarcastic, mournful, sad, humorous, satiric, professional, angry, 
happy, objective, subjective, tongue-in-cheek, businesslike, etc. (Rowland 22). An 
inappropriate tone might make a text ineffective—e.g., jokes in a funeral oration 
(Strang)  

 

 

i.  The original audience is those people who actually heard the speech or 
read the text in the journal etc. in which it was first published. The nature of 
this audience (their starting attitudes, beliefs, etc.) help the rhetor decide on 
his/her purpose. The rhetor usually at least partially tailors the delivery and 
approach for this audience (although not necessarily the message). The 
rhetorical critic can discover who the original audience for a speech through 

11 

research. But the critic can never really know the long-term effect of the 
speech was—the critic can know that many people in the original audience 
applauded loudly or that they booed, but even that initial reaction cannot be 
completely trusted. Many of us have been to performances or speeches at 
the end of which several people stand and applaud and slowly most of the 
rest of the audience follows suit. Research will show that it takes a very small 
critical mass of people standing up initially (particularly if they are clumped 
together) to cause most of the others to stand as well. Also, giving a standing 
ovation is often a sign of convention rather than actual response. 
ii.  The intended audience is people whose attitudes the rhetor thinks he/she 
knows. These are the people the rhetor is trying to communicate with. These 
are the people to whom he consciously tailors his/her message. Sometimes 
(perhaps even many times) the original and intended audiences are the 
same. Sometimes, though, the rhetor misjudges the attitudes or beliefs of the 
people he/she is addressing.  
iii.  The incidental audience (SMS) are people who hear or see recordings of 
the speech or who read reprints of the speech or text (e.g., in anthologies or 
assigned for classes). The rhetor has not designed purpose, approach, 
language, delivery, message, etc. for this audience since he/she cannot 
anticipate who they will be 
iv.  The ideal audience is people who would be most influenced by the speech 
or text (influenced in the way the rhetor wishes). Since no rhetor is perfect in 
his/her judgment or ability and since no message can be effectively fine-
tuned to work perfectly on an audience of more than one person and since no 
one person can understand the complexities of a bunch of humans gathered 
together to hear a speech (and less can understand not only the people but 
also the circumstances under which individuals will pick up a journal and read 
an article), the ideal audience and the original audience will never be an 
exact match. 
1.  To discover who the ideal audience is, we have to focus internal 
evidence—diction, allusions, the way ideas are developed and 
supported, the variations of tone, the use of logos and pathos, the 
ethos of the rhetor, etc. External factors do not matter here. 
2.  To prove who the ideal audience is, say something like “Author X’s 
thesis, along with his/her use of units q and y, indicates that the ideal 
audience for this text would be people who already agree with him/her 
[or “people who are skeptical about his/her thesis” or “people who do 
not initially see the relevance of the thesis to themselves” or “people 
who are curious” or “people who share characteristics K and V with 
the author, etc.”)  
v.  Sometimes the intended and ideal audiences are, of course, similar—
sometimes, not. 
vi.   At times the rhetor might use the occasion to deliver a message the 
audience doesn’t want to hear but which the rhetor feels they must her—
imagine, e.g., a minister or rabbi denouncing the previous week’s activities of 
his congregation, or a politician telling the public that  

 
11. The Text’s Implied Audience—this is the audience for whom the rhetoric is best 
adapted as a work of persuasion (it is NOT necessarily and, in fact, is often not the 
real audience).  

 

12 

a.  We infer the nature of the implied audience by considering the complexity of 
the message, the knowledge the rhetor assumes the audience has, any 
values or principles that rhetor assumes the audience accepts, and the 
linguistic patterns in the rhetoric (a speech about Astronomy for 3rd  graders 
differs from one for college sophomores seeking a major--Strang).  
b.  NO text is “written for everyone.”  Every text is written (consciously or not) for 
a particular audience. When rhetors say they are writing for everyone, what 
they really mean is that they are writing for people who are part of the 
dominant discourse community or for people who are like themselves, people 
whom they mistakenly believe are “everyone” (Strang). 

 
12. Accommodation of audience—includes establishing common ground with 
audience in the Intro (and carrying it on throughout the text) as well as indicating the 
rhetor’s understanding and appreciation of the opponents’ points (even though the 
rhetor disagrees with them) (Strang) 

 
GENRE 
A genre is a category of texts.  Categories can be based upon such things as a text’s 
subject (e.g., nature poems), the time, place or occasion when the text was presented 
(e.g., a Fourth of July speech, an inaugural address at a presidential inauguration), or 
the situation (an employment interview).  
a.  Knowledge of the genre of a text helps us analyze and evaluate the text.  
13. With such a variety of possible genres, it is important to select appropriate (and 
useful) genres. For instance, the genre of “job interview” provides us with several 
conventions with which to discuss the text and to evaluate it (e.g., appropriate 
dress, demeanor, diction). The genre “New England rhetoric,” on the other hand, 
would probably not be very useful since there are no clear conventions associated 
with it (Rowland 203).  
14. The Perceived Strategic Constraints on the Form, Content, Substance and Style 
of the Genre (Rowland 206). Consider the job interview as an example of a text 
(actually several texts—the written texts and the actual interview itself) 
a.  Recurrent problem (e.g., the rhetor’s need to get a job) 
b.  Purpose of the rhetor (e.g., to get a job) 
c.  Societal limitations on acceptable rhetoric (e.g., the candidate is not 
encouraged to threaten the life of the potential employer if she/he doesn’t give 
the job to the rhetor) 
15. Format of the genre (e.g., for the job interview, for a resume, a job application letter, 
an interview) 
16. Type of content appropriate for the genre (e.g., for the job interview, emphasizing 
your strengths, downplaying and/or explaining any weaknesses) 
17. Substance and style of the genre (e.g., for the job interview, dress appropriately for 
interview, use accepted format for resume and letter, avoid slang, emphasize your 
strengths) 

 
More About Genre 

 

13 

1.  According to Alan McKee, “Genre is a powerful tool for making sense of texts. 
Genres work by providing conventions which allow efficient communication between 
producers and audiences” (95).  
2.  Understanding the genre of a text is one way of determining the text’s context 
(Strang). The kind of speeches given at a “celebrity roast” (humorous, sarcastic) 
would be grossly inappropriate at that same celebrity’s funeral (where the genre of 
eulogy would be appropriate and the genre of stand-up comedic routine would not 
be) (Strang). 
3.  Modality--Modality is a concept from linguistics that refers to verb inflections that 
express how the action or state is conceived by the speaker. “Texts with a high 
modality are expected to offer information and ideas that can be applied to other 
parts of our lives” (McKee 97). For instance, a news report will give us information 
that will help us decide how to vote in the next election, and a traffic report gives us 
information that will help us decide which route to take.  
a.  Texts with low modality, on the other hand, do not give us info or ideas that 
can apply to other parts of our lives.  
i.  For instance, being bitten by a radioactive spider will probably not turn 
us into superheroes, although it worked well for Peter Parker who 
became Spider-Man (Strang).   
ii.  Dropping an anvil on someone’s head in a Roadrunner cartoon 
ultimately causes no damage and has no consequences. If we applied 
that idea in real life, however, we would probably kill the anvil-receiver 
and would probably end up in prison (Strang).  
b.  In other words, some genres “are perceived to be strongly related to reality 
(such as news, current affairs, and documentaries), while others are strongly 
distanced from it (cartoons, musicals)” (McKee 97). Problems obviously occur 
when those with low modality are thought to be genres with high modality—
e.g., kids jumping off buildings thinking that they can fly like Superman 
(Strang). 
c.  Unless readers misperceive the modality of a text, modality is rarely a 
concept to be pursued in an analysis.  

 

 

For Evaluation 
 
1.  Evaluation means an “internal form of evaluation” since it is very difficult to 
discover the actual effect a text had on the actual audience. So we ask, “Does 
the rhetor present strategies that are well-designed to overcome the rhetorical 
barriers (and maximize the rhetorical advantages) in order to achieve his/her 
purpose?” (Rowland 44).  
2.  Part of determining the advantages and barriers the rhetor faced is considering 
the rhetorical situation (e.g., the situation the rhetor faced) 
3.  Rational Argument—does the evidence actually support the claims? What types 
of evidence are used—examples, statistics, comparisons, expert testimony. 
(Rowland 61) 

 

14 

4.  Narrative Argument—vividness, identification of audience with characters, plot, 
theme, and scene (Rowland 86) 
5.  Credibility (Ethos)—the rhetor’s expertise/experience, good character, good 
will, charisma (Rowland 101). Two types--extrinsic and intrinsic credibility 
a.  Extrinsic credibility means rhetor has well-known credentials and is the 
more powerful of the 2 forms 
b.  But intrinsic credibility --rhetor demonstrates his/her competence, honesty, 
etc.--is more important and is the one that rhetorical critics focus on 
(Strang) 
c.  What techniques does the rhetor use to establish credibility and ethos? 
6.  Figures of language—what figures of language call attention to themselves? 
Which work on a more subtle level? (Strang) 
7.  Genre—to evaluate a text in terms of its genre, it is crucial that you first be sure 
that it fits most (if not all) of the criteria of that particular genre (e.g., inaugural 
speeches, prize acceptance speeches, eulogies, full-fledged arguments).  Then 
you evaluate how well the text works at fulfilling all the requirements of that 
genre.  
a.  At times, of course, a rhetor intentionally steps beyond the criteria of a 
genre to shock us (Strang).  
b.  Sometimes (and only sometimes) that strategy works. At other times, it 
backfires (Strang). 

 
 
To Analyze and Evaluate Rhetoric: We always need to first analyze a text fully before 
we can evaluate its effectiveness as an act of persuasion. To analyze effectively, we 
need tools to deconstruct the text and to examine the effect of those “pieces.” Invention 
is crucial if we ourselves consider what arguments are available for the topic before we 
start analyzing a particular text. Then, as we examine that text, we can see what was 
left out--and often what was left out is at least as important as what was included.
