ETHICS and MORALITY 

 
The words ethics/ethical and morality/moral are often used interchangeably in 
conversation. In reality,  
•  Morality (moral) is a first-order set of beliefs and practices about how to live a good 
life and refers to an individual’s actions or character as good or bad in terms of 
particular codes of conduct. 
 Ethics (ethical) is a second-order set of beliefs and includes conscious reflection on 
the adequacy of our moral beliefs. It also refers to the formal study of those codes 
and their underlying principles, often referring to professional codes of behavior.  
 

• 

Two Types of Values 

 
Value is a morally neutral term that merely indicates preference and can be quite banal. 
  
Non-moral Values include good health, aesthetic values, reputation, money, power, 
fame, national integrity and solidarity. Group behavior is more often motivated by non-
moral values than is individual behavior (Boss, Ethics, 226). 
 
Only Moral Values carry the force of the "ought" or "should" and thus take precedence 
over the non-moral values.  When making moral decisions, we use descriptive 
statements about the world and human nature (e.g., "I saw Mommy kissing Santa 
Claus") along with prescriptive statements about moral values (e.g., "Mothers ought 
not/should not kiss men who enter houses through the chimney").  Good intentions are 
insufficient to guide our moral decisions. 
 
The Underlying Principle of Most Moral Systems: Respect for Persons 
At least one important principle underlies almost all ethical systems: the principle of 
respect for persons. As philosopher Errol E. Harris explains, this principles has three 
requirements: 
 

First, that each and every person should be regarded as worthy of sympathetic 
consideration, and should be so treated; secondly, that no person should be 
regarded by another as a mere possession, or used as a mere instrument, or 
treated as a mere obstacle, to another's satisfaction; and thirdly, that persons are 
not and ought never to be treated in any undertaking as mere expendables.

("Respect for Persons," Daedalus, Spring, 1969, p. 113) 

 
 
As Vincent Ryan Ruggiero, professor emeritus at SUNY, Dehli, and author of many 
books on thinking and ethics, points out, however, 
 

This is not to say that respect for persons is always interpreted in the same way 
or that it is always given precedence over other values.  In some cultures person 
is defined not broadly, as “all members of the species Homo sapiens,” but 
narrowly, as “a member of our tribe” or “one who enjoys the rights of citizenship.” 
In the tribal languages of some headhunters and cannibals, the word used to 
denote a person is the tribal name; to be outside the tribe is thus, by definition, to 
be a nonperson. (73) 

 
Thus the practice of slavery in Roman society and in American history is based on such 
an interpretation. Likewise, many people may endorse the principle of respect for 
persons, but have lapses in its observance, or may at times subordinate it to other 
values, such as the good of society as a whole. 
 

Ethical Analysis 

 
Ethical analysis is a complex process. It involves thinking deeply about: 
•  Ethical criteria (obligations, ideals, and consequences) 
•  Types of ethics 
•  Types of ethical theories 
•  Levels of thinking 
 
Ethical Analysis--Criteria 
The following 3 criteria are for thinking about and making moral decisions. The trick is 
not to settle for the first response or the easy response, but to really think about the 
issues. They are obligations, ideals, and consequences. 
 

1. Obligations  
Obligations of Fidelity (formal bond of faith to people or institutions, e.g., friendship, 
 citizenship, business, professional relationships). 
Obligations of Reparation (we should amend wrongs we've committed by removing as  
many harmful consequences caused by those wrongs as possible). 
Obligations of Gratitude (we should demonstrate our appreciation for the 
 Considerations that others show us) 
Obligations of Justice (we should give each person equal consideration without  
 
Showing partiality to anyone's interests including our own; differences in  
treatment should be in proportion to differences in what the facts show each 
 
 person deserves). 
Obligations of Beneficence (we should do good acts for their own sake). 
 

2. Ideals 
Ideals are notions of excellence, goals that bring greater harmony in your own self and 
between your self and others. In ethics, Ideals are specific concepts that assist us in 
applying the principle of respect for persons (e.g., fairness, tolerance, compassion, 
loyalty, forgiveness, amity, and peace.

3. Consequences 

Consequences include: 
•  Direct effects on all the people touched by the action 
Indirect effects on others 
• 
•  Direct and indirect effects on you (the person performing the action) 
•  Psychological effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 
•  Emotional effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 
Immediate effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 
• 
•  Delayed effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 
•  Short-lasting effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 
•  Long-lasting effects on you, on others, on society as a whole 

 
To determine consequences, use this approach: “If X, then the consequences would 
be Y on Q.” Think about the situation from several different points of view. Use your 
imagination to see deeply into the consequences and potential consequences of the 
action(s) contemplated.  
 
Please notice that: 
•  The most moral action is the action that most fully honors the obligations, ideals, and 
consequences involved 
•  Different moral systems give different weight to these criteria (e.g., some might 
emphasize obligations over consequences, or ideals over obligations) 
•  Usually, nothing is easy since two different criteria might be in conflict 
o  When such conflicts occur, the best we can do is to consider the relative 
importance of each and give preference to the more important one. 
o 
If both criteria can be partly served, then they should be (rather than serving 
one fully and ignoring the other entirely) 
•  One standard criterion is: chose the action  
o 
that leads to the greater good 
o  or, if there is no good, select the action that leads to the lesser evil 
Four Types of Ethics--Personal, Interpersonal, Social, & Environmental 

 
Personal Ethics: the most basic level, concerned with us as individuals--our own growth 
as virtuous people and our search for the good life. Almost all ethicists stress the 
importance of cultivating a virtuous character and developing proper self-esteem. 
 
Interpersonal Ethics: day-to-day relationships with other people, the rightness or 
wrongness of particular actions, the nature of our obligations toward others and their 
obligations toward us. 
 
Social Ethics: As we mature, our "moral community expands from our immediate family 
to our peers to humanity in general (i.e., the moral community includes all those beings 
who have moral worth or value in themselves … we include more as members of our 
tribe). 
 
Environmental Ethics: Two approaches to environmental ethics.  
•  Most Western philosophers and theologians maintain that only humans can be 
members of the moral community, so our only obligation to the environment and 
animals is to preserve them for the benefit of humankind.

•  Others--e.g., Buddhists, Jainists (Janism is an India philosophy/religion), many 
Native American philosophers--argue that the environment itself has moral worth so 
the integrity of environment ought to be preserved for its own sake. (Boss 12) 

 

 

 

Types of Ethical Theories 

 
1.  Relativist Theories—These theories state that there are no independent moral 
values; morality is created by humans. 
•  Ethical subjectivism: moral truth is a matter of individual opinion or feeling 
•  Cultural relativism: morals are created not by individuals but by groups of 
humans, and morality differs from society to society; each society has its own 
moral norms that are binding only on members of that society -- and each society 
also defines who is and who is not a member of that society 
•  These two are mutually exclusive--either the individual or the society creates the 
moral norms 

 
2.  Universalist Theories—These theories state that there are universal moral values 
that apply to all humans and, in some cases, beyond the human community. Morality 
is discovered by humans (not created by them); i.e., the basic standards of right 
and wrong are derived from principles that exist independently of the individual or of 
societal opinion. Different types of universalist theories overlap (they are not mutually 
exclusive)--each emphasizes one particular aspect of morality rather than providing a 
comprehensive picture. Almost all ethicists include aspects of more than one 
universalist theory in their moral philosophy. 
 
Three Levels of Thinking--Experience, Interpretation, Analysis 

 
1.  Experience: We simply describe our experiences or give accurate information. 
"I felt angry when Cathy lied to me." 
• 
• 
"The average annual income of men is higher than that of women." 
2.  Interpretation involves trying to make sense of our experience in light of our other 
experiences. This includes individual interpretations and collective or cultural 
interpretations.  Taken together, interpretations form a worldview. Our worldview 
regarding a particular aspect of our experience (e.g., science, ethics) is a paradigm. 
"What Cathy did to me was wrong." 
• 
• 
"Men are more competent than women and thus receive higher incomes." 
3.  Analysis critically examines our worldview. It draws on other disciplines (e.g., 
psychology, sociology, literature, natural sciences) and on fundamental moral 
intuitions, moral sentiments, and collective insights. Analysis raises our level of 
consciousness and refuses to accept narrow interpretations of our experience. 
Analysis often begins with questions about the assumptions underlying our 
interpretations. 
"Is lying always wrong? Was Cathy’s lying justified in those circumstances? Did 
• 
something I said or some attitude of mine encourage or even force her to lie?" 
"Are the facts regarding unemployment and competency correct? If they are, 
does any of compensation really indicate the degree of competence? Is it fair or 
just to pay less based on gender?" 
Pluralistic View of Ethics 

• 

Ethical Tool Chest

Assumptions:  
• 
“We should attempt to live successfully with all other persons” (Birsch 174) 
•  To live successfully with others, people need “ethical guidelines that enable them 
to maintain their special relationships with particular persons” (Birsch 177) 
•  To be successful in solving ethical problems with particular groups of people, an 
ethical theory must: 
o  Produce ethical guidelines 
o  Demonstrate that some guidelines are better than others 
o  Prohibit the “unlimited pursuit of self-interest”(Birsch 175) 
o  Produce effective solutions to ethical problems 
•  Birsch thus eliminates theories of divine command, ethical egoism and 
subjectivism, and ethical relativism (175) 

Types of Ethics 
 
There are several different types of ethical theories. 
 
A General Way of Thinking About Ethics 
 
1.  Greatest good for greatest number (we need to know consequences to be able to 
judge)--utilitarianism 
2.  Equal respect and the Golden Rule 
a.  Every person is an object of intrinsic worth 
b.  Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity and quality 
c.  The Golden Rule—be consistent (treat others as you want to be treated) 
3.  Relationship 
a.  Relationships are intrinsically valuable (friendship, companionship, caring, 
loving, affection, etc.) 
b.  Judge actions on their potential to build or hinder meaningful relationships 
4.  Community 
a.  A community can be a network of relationships. In this case, actions that 
damage relationships between community members are unethical 
b.  Or a community can be structured groups (e.g., teams) that allow people to 
pursue shared goals and values. In this case, any action is unethical that is 
inconsistent with the values a community serves and that thus weakens 
members’ feeling of shared beliefs and common goals 
5.  Character growth 
a.  do our actions make us more or less like the ideal person we want to be? 
b.  Behaving unethically will eventually harm us in some way 
c.  Could ignoring evil (or merely unpleasant behavior) make you more evil or 
unpleasant yourself? 
 

A More Specific Way to Think About Ethics 

 
Virtue Ethics 
 
1.  Virtue is a quality of character by which individuals habitually recognize and do “the 
right thing.” 
2.  Virtue ethics emphasizes right being over right action. The theory is that the type 
of person we are constitutes the heart of our moral life.  

Ethical Tool Chest 

 

5 

a.  More important than the rules or principles we follow is our character. 
b.  A moral virtue is an admirable character trait or disposition to habitually action 
in a manner that benefits oneself and others. 
c.  The actions of virtuous people stem from a respect and concern for the well-
being of themselves and others—e.g., compassion, courage, generosity, 
loyalty, honesty. 
d.  Virtue is more than a collection of individual traits, however. Virtue is the 
“overarching quality of goodness or excellence that gives unity and integrity 
to a person’s character” (Boss 402) 
e.  Virtue ethics and theories of right action complement each other; they are not 
alternatives to each other. 
f.  As Aristotle says, “We are not concerned to know what goodness is, but how 
we are to become good men, for this alone gives the study [of ethics] its 
practical value.” (Nicomachean Ethics, Bk. 2, Ch. 2). 
2.  The 4 classical virtues (from Aristotle): 
a.  Prudence (practical wisdom) 
b.  Justice (includes fairness, honesty, keeping promises) 
c.  Fortitude (courage to pursue the right path despite great risks) 
d.  Temperance (self-discipline--the control of human passions, sensual 
pleasures, anger, frustration, food, drink, sex)  
3.  The Greeks added  
a.  Loyalty  
4.  The Hebrews added 
a.  Obedience to God 
5.  Christianity added 3 theological virtues + 1 for Catholic sainthood: 
a.  Faith 
b.  Hope 
c.  Charity 
d.  Humility 
6.  And philosophers such as Nel Noddings added 
a.  Compassion and caring 
b.  Care ethics regards feeling rather than reason or formal moral principles as 
the foundation of ethics.  
c.  Noddings says that “morality is an ‘active virtue’ that requires two feelings: (1) 
the sentiment of natural caring and (2) love, which our response to the 
remembrance of caring” (Boss 417). 
7.  Thus, an ethical person is someone who through repeated good acts achieves an 
appropriate balance of these virtues in his/her life. 
8.  Good character comes from living in communities—family, neighborhoods, religious 
and civic institutions—where virtue is encouraged and rewarded. 
9.  Aristotle suggested that youth imitate the actions and attitudes of people 
acknowledged to be ethical in order to learn ethical behavior and ideas. 
 
Utilitarianism  
 
1.  Utilitarianism is oriented toward a particular goal: the greatest net happiness for all. It 
emphasizes right action over right being. Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill 
are 2 major architects of utilitarianism. 
2.  Actions themselves are neither intrinsically right or wrong 
3.  The rightness or wrongness of an action is determined solely by its consequences—
in other words, the ends justify the means” 

Ethical Tool Chest 

 

6 

4.  “The greatest good for the greatest number.” 
5.  And every person’s happiness counts equally (including the agent’s—the person 
performing the act cannot count his/her own gain in happiness as more important 
than the happiness of anyone else) 
6.  Utilitarian calculus had several elements that had to be considered when judging 
whether to act or not (Bentham and Mill), including  
a.  Intensity: How strong is the pleasure?  
b.  Duration: How long will the pleasure last?  
c.  Certainty or uncertainty: How likely or unlikely is it that the pleasure will 
occur?  
d.  Propinquity or remoteness: How soon will the pleasure occur?  
e.  Extent: How many people will be affected?  
7.  For a satiric version of utilitarian calculus, see 
http://swiftmagazine.com/backissues/swift-1-3-9.pdf ) 

 
Egalitarian ethical theories 
1.  Egalitarian ethical theories say that everyone is a moral equal 
a.  Kantian ethics—our ethical treatment of different people in similar situations 
must be consistent (182).  
b.  Moral rights theory—avoid violations of the moral rights of others 
2.  Kantian and Moral Rights both establish a “moral minimum” (183) with regards to 
persons in general. 
3.  Birsch prefers Moral Rights Theory because it is clearer and more precise than 
acting from personal rules that we could conflict into universal laws (183) 
Which types of ethics best apply to the various  
types of relationships we have? 

 

 
Relationships with Family and Friends 
•  Ethics of care because it recognizes that the most relevant moral factor is our 
special relationships with these people, giving them more attention, etc 
•  To use this ethics, we must “apprehend the other’s reality and promote his or her 
welfare” (178)—According to Boss, abortion is not unethical if it allows you to 
continue to be successful as “a one-caring (to oneself and to others)” (Boss 178) 

 
Relationships with Colleagues, Teammates, and Members of Organizations  
•  Virtue ethics because the “most relevant moral factor …is that the members of 
these collectives share a common goal or purpose” (Boss 179)—the goal 
substitutes for Aristotle’s “human function” as the foundation of virtue ethics 
•  A “well-lived life in the corporate or organizational context, is one in which a 
person thrives as an individual but also is successful at supporting the corporate 
or organizational mission” (Boss 179)   
•  The significant virtue varies with the group, but teamwork and hard work are 
virtues for any group 
•  Virtue ethics will not be 100% successful, but it’s better than any of the other 
ethical theories. Yet it will not help us evaluate the group’s goal itself. 

 
Relationships with Members of the Same Ethic Group, Gender, Nation 
•  Virtue ethics because, although these people are bound by “accidental factual 
connection,” many within the group share the same goals (as with organizations), 

Ethical Tool Chest 

 

7 

so common goal is the most relevant moral factor (180) (e.g., many women 
share the feminist goal of eliminating male domination) 
•  Patriotism and civic duty are 2 virtues related to being American (181) 
 
Relationships with People as “Persons” 
•  Egalitarian ethical theory because the most relevant moral factor is that everyone 
is a moral equal 
•  The best can’t be utilitarianism because it sacrifices the minority to the majority 
and our goal is to treat everyone as morally equal person 
•  Kantian ethics—our ethical treatment of different people in similar situations must 
be consistent (182). This theory could work 
•  Moral rights theory—avoid violations of the moral rights of others would work as 
well 
•  Kantian and Moral Rights both establish a “moral minimum” (183) with regards to 
persons in general 
o  Birsch prefers Moral Rights Theory because it is clearer and more precise 
than acting from personal rules that we could will into universal laws (183) 

Implications of Pluralistic View of Ethics 

1.  We need first to identify the relationships(s) with the person(s) involved and use 
the appropriate ethical theory theories. (184) 
2.  Sometimes we face conflicting obligations or possess limited resources and must 
decide who will receive them 
3.  Two types of conflicts: 
a.  Conflicting moral obligations to two (or more) persons that allow us to act 
in accord with only one of them but without violating the ethical guidelines 
of the other theory (kayaking with a friend or taking kids to ball game) 
(184) 
b.  Or acting in accord with the obligations generated by one theory 
associated with one person would violate the ethical guidelines of another 
theory connected with another person (taking kids to ballgame while rest 
of my office struggle to meet a crucial deadline) 
c.  Birsch opts for privileging closer relationships but also of balancing 
obligations so that the demands of each are satisfied to a degree 
sufficient to maintain the relationships (185) 
d.  “The key is to act in ways that minimize conflict among the various ethical 
obligations connected to the different persons and, when conflicts are 
inevitable, to try to obtain an overall balance regarding the fulfillment of 
the obligations generated in connection with all of them.” (186) 

Moral Arguments 
 
1.  An implicit, unstated premise or belief is an assumption   
2.  An argument is a set of statements or propositions that perform two different but 
related functions 
•  States the conclusion (or thesis or position being argued for)—usually stated in 
a single (often very complex) declarative sentence  

 

 

 
 

Ethical Tool Chest 

 

8 

•  Provides reasons (called premises) supporting that conclusion—these are 
usually expressed in declarative sentences 
3.  An argument has two or more premises and one conclusion 
4.  We move from the premises to the conclusion through a process of inference. 
5.  Truth or falsehood of a proposition can be based on 
•  Empirical facts (descriptive statement)--"AIDS is currently one of the leading 
causes of death of young adults in the US" 
•  Lexical definition of a key term (descriptive statement)--"Lying is any intentionally 
deceptive message that is stated" is such a definition. 
•  Moral prescriptive statements --"it is wrong for us to hurt others for our own 
amusement." 

 
Steps for Constructing a Moral Argument (Boss, Ethics 56) 
 
1.  List your premises. In a good argument, the premises will be relatively 
uncontroversial and should be acceptable to all or most reasonable people. It is 
important to identify relevant moral principles, obligations, ideals, and consequences. 
It is important to get the facts straight.  
2.  Eliminate irrelevant or weak premises. Resist the impulse to eliminate premises 
that disagree with your particular opinion regarding the issue. Make sure there are no 
obvious gaps in the list of premises. 
3.  Come to a conclusion. Your conclusion should take into account the info contained 
in the premises but should not state more than is in them. 
4.  Try out the argument on others. 
 
Analyzing Issues 
 
1.  Consider details of the situation carefully--are there any circumstances that set this situation 
apart from otherwise similar cases (circumstances do alter cases). If you don't have enough 
details, speculate about possible answers. 
Identify the specific criteria that are relevant to the case--i.e., are there any obligations (and to 
whom)? what ideals are involved? what are the possible consequences? 
3.  Decide where the emphasis should lie--e.g., sometimes the emphasis should be on 
obligations, sometimes on consequences. Often, of course, the force of all 3 are very nearly 
equal. 
4.  Determine all possible choices of action that are (or, in the case of a past action, were) 
available. 
5.  Then decide which action is most ethical/moral.

Analyzing a Particular Situation 

 
1. Agatha, a married woman with 3 children, is in the habit of often seeing her unmarried 
minister alone. Since the relationship began several years ago in a mutual interest in 
intellectual and social issues, it has grown and expanded.  Agatha's daily visits to the 
minister's home and his frequent visits to hers, sometimes when her husband is at home 
but often when he is not, have become the subject of community gossip and are 
threatening both their reputations.  There has been no overt sexual dimension to the 
relationship; it has remained platonic. Lately, however, Agatha has begun to have sexual 
thoughts about the minister. Is it morally wrong for her to continue the relationship? 
 
Step 1.  Details we don't know: how old are the children? How solid and mutually 
nourishing was Agatha's relationship with her husband before she began her relationship 
with the minister? If there have been problems in her marriage, has she discussed them 
with her husband? Have they made any progress in solving them? Has Agatha 
discussed with her minister the direction in which their relationship seems to be 
heading? If so, what was his reaction? What other possibilities does Agatha have for 
social life and intellectual fulfillment? 
 
Step 2. Relevant criteria:  
 
Obligations 
•  Agatha has obligation to herself to exercise her intellect and realize her potential 

Ethical Tool Chest 

 

10 

(cid:137) 

•  She has obligation of fidelity (as a wife) to her husband (as he does to her) to 
build and nurture a mutually satisfying physical and emotional relationship 
•  She has obligation of fidelity (as mother) to her children to provide a home and 
atmosphere conducive to children's phsyical, emotional, moral, and intellectual 
development 
•  The minister has obligation of fidelity (to his church) to serve his congregation's 
religious and spiritual needs, to set a good example 
Ideals 
•  Marital fidelity 
•  Honesty with self and friends 
Consequences of continuing the relationship 
It is unlikely that Agatha's marriage will be strengthened--in fact, the 
(cid:137) 
reverse is much more likely (at the very least, more tension in the 
marriage, perhaps infidelity, perhaps divorce) 
It will likely damage the minister's vocation--destroy his effectiveness, 
jeopardize his job 
Step 3. Alternative Courses of Action 
•  Agatha could end the platonic relationship 
•  She could see the minister less frequently and never alone with him in his or her 
house (this would be more effective if combined with attempts to renew her 
relationship with her husband and find other social and intellectual outlets) 
Step 4. Weigh the various criteria. 
•  Obligations, ideals, and consequences are of pretty equal force here 
Step 5. Decide on the most moral course of action. 
•  Most of the criteria suggest that Agatha should not continue the relationship with the 
minister in its present form--it does cause harm now and will likely cause more harm 
in the future 
If her relationship with husband was reasonably sound before she met the minister, 
then she should end the relationship with the minister 
If her relationship with her husband had already begun to deteriorate before she met 
the minister and is beyond rebuilding, then she should consider leaving him--the age 
of her children might be a factor in this decision 
If she does leave husband, the possible effects of scandal on the minister should 
influence her decision of whether to continue the relationship after leaving her 
husband  

•

• 

 
Please note: the above is not a complete analysis of the whole situation--it analyzes 
what Agatha should do.  Certainly other factors are involved here--e.g., the obligations of 
justice and beneficence, the ideal of loyalty, and numerous consequences (direct and 
indirect).  In addition, the minister's situation and possible decision are not taken into 
account. 
 
 

Some Situations for Moral Analysis 

 
 1. A scientist signs a 2-year contract with Big Lab for $75,000/year.  Four months later 
she is offered a 2-year contract by Bigger Lab (a competitor of Big Lab) for 
$150,000/year.  She tells Big Lab that she is breaking her contract and signing with 
Bigger Lab. The courts can deal with the legality of her decision.  Examine the morality 
in terms of obligations, ideals, and consequences.

2. Same scenario except that the scientist has discovered during the first 4 months with 
Big Lab that her husband has quit his job and run off to places unknown with another 
woman and has started divorce proceeding.  He has made it clear to her that he and his 
girlfriend will live in the wilderness somewhere living off the land; he will have no money 
with which to pay child support and he has legally turned all responsibility for their 3 
children to her. 
 
Background for #3 
Hans Jonas has suggested that in considering the ethical character of scientific 
experiments we should distinguish between "averting a disaster" and "prompting a good" 
("Philosophical Reflections on Human Experimentation," Daedalus, Spring 1969, 229f).  
In the first, where the goal is saving society, Jonas concedes that extraordinary means 
may be used. However, in the latter, where the goal, improving society, is less urgent, 
such means should not be tolerated.  According to Jonas, 
 

Our descendants have a right to be left an unplundered planet. They do not have 
a right to miracle cures. We have sinned against them if by our doing we have 
destroyed their inheritance--which we are doing at full blast; we have not sinned 
against them if by the time they come around arthritis has not yet been 
conquered (unless by sheer neglect). And generally, in the matter of progress, as 
humanity had no claim on a Newton, a Michelangelo, or a St. Francis to appear, 
and no right to the blessings of their unscheduled deeds, so progress, with all our 
methodical labor for it, cannot be budgeted in advance and its fruits received as a 
due.  Its coming about at all and its turning out for the good (of which we can 
never be sure) must rather be regarded as something akin to grace. (229)

3. David D. Rutstein made the following assertions about the selection and design of 
scientific experiments. Do you agree? 
"In selecting a question for human experimentation, the expectation of benefit to the 
• 
subject and to mankind must clearly far exceed the risk to the human subject" ("The 
Ethical Design of Human Experiments," ," Daedalus, Spring 1969, 529) 

 "It may be accepted as a maxim that a poorly or improperly designed study involving 
human subjects--one that could not possibly yield scientific facts (that is, 
reproducible observations) relevant to the question under study--is by definition 
unethical ....  Any risk to the patient, however small, cannot be justified.  In essence, 
the scientific validity of a study on human beings is in itself an ethical principle" (524). 

 
3. Throughout history, it has been the practice in many countries to use convicts in 
scientific experiments. If, e.g., researchers develop a chemical that preliminary 
exploratory work indicates will cure a fatal disease, they may seek volunteers from 
prison populations, administer the chemical to them, and determine its effect on the 
human body. Or a psychologist studying the effects of extreme variations in climate on 
the human body may subject consenting prisoners to such variations and test their 
reactions. Though such experiments are usually very carefully designed to minimize the 
risk to participants, an element of risk always remains. The participants may become ill 
or even die of unexpected physical or emotional effects. Because of this danger, 
volunteers are usually promised special privileges during the course of the experiment 
and even a reduction of their prison sentences. In cases involving unusual risk, full

pardons may be promised. Is it ethical to use prisoners for such experiments? Is it 
ethical to provide such inducements to volunteers?  
 
3.1. Sometimes medical school professors encourage their students to volunteer for 
research experiments--the only reward being the emotional satisfaction of having 
contributed to progress and perhaps some brownie points). Is such encouragement 
ethically permissible? 
 
4. Given the threat that nuclear weapons pose for humanity, it is ever morally acceptable 
for scientists to engage in research and development work on such weapons? Discuss 
the conditions, if any, under which it would be acceptable. 
 
5. Given the threat that biological weapons pose for humanity, it is ever morally 
acceptable for scientists to engage in research and development work on such 
weapons? Discuss the conditions, if any, under which it would be acceptable 
 
 

Moral Situations and Dilemmas 
 
1.  Because medical resources are limited for such thing as organ transplants and 
expensive cancer treatments, we must decide how they should be allocated. If a 
person knowingly engages in behavior that could jeopardize her health, should this 
be taken into consideration when allocating scare resources? What about the 
person’s age? Occupation?  
a.  How is your answer influenced by your attitude toward free will vs. 
determinism? 
2.  Discuss how your current government policies toward vulnerable populations (the 
homeless, children, prisoners, families living in poverty) are influenced by a 
philosophical view of human behavior as free or determined. 
3.  Select a simple experience--a man holding a door open for a woman, a student 
giving a dollar to a beggar on the street. Discuss different interpretations of the 
experience.  
4.  Using the three-tiered (experience, interpretation, analysis) model of thinking, 
discuss the following:  
a.  Fact--Social scientists have found that a person is more likely to help those 
who are most like them.  
b.  Situation--Professor Q has blue eyes and blonde hair. She offers out-of-
class extra help and tutoring only to students who are blond and blue-eyed. 
Answer the following questions: 
i.  Is it morally right for Prof. Q to give preference to students who look 
like her? Why or why not? 
ii.  Would it make any difference if she believed that she was right to do 
so? 
iii.  What if her intentions are good? For example, what if she genuinely 
believed that only blue-eyed blond students had intellectual potential 
and believed that it was unfair to give tutoring to non-blue-eyed non-
blond people and thus give them the false hope that they might be 
able to succeed in college?  
iv.  Or what if she believed that blue-eyed blond students were the ones 
who were least likely to understand the material?
