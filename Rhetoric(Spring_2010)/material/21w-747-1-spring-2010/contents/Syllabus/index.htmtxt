Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Course Description *****
This course is an introduction to the theory, the practice, and the
implications (both social and ethical) of rhetoric, the art and craft of
persuasion. This semester, many of your skills will have the opportunity to be
deepened by practice, including your analytical and critical thinking skills,
your persuasive writing skills, and your oral presentation skills. In this
course you will act as both a rhetor (a person who uses rhetoric) and as a
rhetorical critic (one who studies the art of rhetoric). Both write to
persuade; both ask and answer important questions. Always one of their goals is
to create new knowledge for all of us, so no endeavor in this class is a "mere
exercise."
***** Course Structure *****
**** Writing ****
Essays consist of the following:
   1. RRR (Ready-Ready Revision) for Workshop
   2. Mandatory Revision
   3. Optional Revision
   4. A Postwrite
Posts consist of writings once a week (~100-250 words each). These are informal
writings.
**** Oral Components ****
   1. Class participation - You should be saying meaningful things in every
      class (I keep track).
   2. Debate - You should demonstrate preparation, practice, command of the
      topic, and your ability to think on your feet.
   3. Informative and Persuasive Speeches - You should demonstrate careful
      preparation and practice as well as the ability to makes appeals to
      ethos, pathos, and logos.
***** Attendance *****
   1. I donât distinguish between excused and unexcused cuts.
   2. There are 3 free cutsâsave them for illness, job interviews, religious
      holidays, etc. (Please note, however, that, even when taking a free cut,
      you are not participating in classâso your class participation grade is
      reduced a bit.
   3. Cuts 4 &amp; 5 each reduces your course grade by 1 whole grade, so an
      original AâB (with 4th cut)âC (with 5th cut)âF (with 6th cut).
   4. The 6th cut reduces your course grade 2 additional whole grades (so an A
      becomes an F) -- automatic failure for course regardless of reasonâno
      exceptions.
   5. Do not take this course this semester if you will have to regularly
      arrive late to class or leave early.
   6. Two late arrivals or early departures equal 1 cut.
***** Grading *****
I grade on a 12-point scale (and I do not round final grades upwards):

***** Statement on Plagiarism *****
Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available at the Writing_and_Communication_Center and the MIT_Web
site_on_Plagiarism.
