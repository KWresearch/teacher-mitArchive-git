Debates 
 
Note: It is the responsibility of the 2 teams debating to select or create a 
proposition that has relevance for the particular audience you are addressing. 
You need to establish kairos explicitly. Each topic can only be debated once. 
Some text-related topics are listed under particular debates. But if you are doing, 
say, Debate 4, and you really like the topic for Debate 3, and if that topic were 
not debated earlier, you can debate it in Debate #4. But those in an earlier 
debate cannot poach a topic from a later debate (e.g., those doing Debate #3 
cannot do a topic listed fro Debate #5) without prior written permission from those 
in Debate #5 (a permission cc-ed to me). 
 
Date Due:  
•  Debate # 1, SES #9 
o  The proposition: “Using Martin Luther King’s definitions in “Letter 
from Birmingham Jail,” it is clear that unjust laws still exist in 2010 
America and that each of us has practical and moral obligations to 
actively oppose those unjust laws.” 
o  Your own topic 
 
•  Debate # 2, SES #11 
o  The proposition: Although it may sound selfish, Hardin is right 
when, in “Lifeboat Ethics,” he says that, “For the foreseeable future, 
our survival demands that we govern our actions by the ethics of a 
lifeboat, harsh though they may be.” 
o  The proposition: Singer’s “Famine” essay is correct: “If it is in our 
power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby 
sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, 
morally, to do it.” 
o  Your own topic 
 
•  Debate # 3, SES #13 
o  The proposition: We have a moral obligation to free the child in 
LeGuin’s “The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas” regardless of 
the consequences to everyone’s happiness.” 
o  The proposition: For both practical and ethical reasons, we have to 
take personal responsibility for the results of our actions. 
o  Your own topic 
 
•  Debate # 4, SES #14 
o  The proposition:  For both practical and moral reasons, we should 
avoid using rhetoric because it is an immoral activity that ends up in 
manipulation and deception. 
o  The proposition:  For both practical and moral reasons, we should 
use rhetoric because it distributes power among many people and 
hence performs a practical and moral good.

dangerous genre and should be avoided by both writers and 
readers.

Process 
•  For the debate, you will work in teams of two—one team will argue the 
Affirmative and one will argue the Negative. Like good sophists, you do 
not have to believe the case you are argue — you only have to argue it 
convincingly. 
•  The debates follow a Strangian format—its purpose is to give each 
speaker 1 occasion for a relatively prepared speech and 1 occasion for 
thinking on his/her feet    

 

Structure of the Debate (50-60 minutes) 
 

1st Round (Opening Cases) 
 

•  1st Affirmative (AFF) speaker (5 minutes):  
o  Read the proposition 
o  Define its key terms 
o  Establish kairos for this particular audience (why should we, 
members of this particular 21W.747 class, care about this topic at 
this particular time) 
o  Forecast your main reasons for supporting the proposition 
o  Develop 1 or 2 of your main reasons (give evidence, state ethical 
principles you are invoking etc.) 
o  Give your conclusion for your part (indicating that your partner will 
pursue these and other points further) 

 
•  1st Negative speaker (5 minutes) 
o  State your position  
o  Agree with the terms as defined or disagree 
If you disagree, you need to offer alternate definitions and 
(cid:131) 
justify using them instead of those offered by the AFF 
o  Agree or disagree with the kairos offered by  the AFF 
o  Forecast your main reasons for supporting your position 
o  Develop 1 or 2 main reasons (give evidence, state ethical principles 
you are invoking etc.) 
o  Give your conclusion for your part indicating that your partner will 
pursue these and other points further)

Elements of the debate 
 
These are primarily values debates, not policy debates. You should use the 
language of ethical analysis (obligations, ideals, consequences) and argue that a 
particular ethical theory/theories is the most appropriate to apply to this particular 
proposition as you defend your position and attack the opposition’s. 
 
Definitions: define any key terms--e.g., if the topic proposal were “Jack should 
not trade the cow for the seeds that end up growing the beanstalk that leads to 
the giant’s castle,” one key term would be should not (and you might say “the 
term should not means is morally obligated not to and the ethical system being 
invoked is virtue ethics because…”).  
 
Moral principle(s),social values and personal virtues: State explicitly the 
principles and values you will be using to justify your position and then explain 
explicitly how they apply: 

 

4 

•  Social values include 
o  Democracy 
o  Security 
o  Human Rights 
o  Competitiveness 
o  Stability 
o  Justice 
o  Equality 
o  Self-reliance 
o  Social Responsibility (e.g., help others) 
o  The Common Good 
o  Globalism 
o  Freedom 
o  Obligations 
o 
Ideals (e.g., mercy, compassion, honesty) 
•  Personal virtues include 
o  Prudence (practical wisdom) 
o  Justice (includes fairness, honesty, keeping promises) 
o  Fortitude (courage to pursue the right path despite great risks) 
o  Temperance (self-discipline, the control of human passions and 
sensual pleasures, moderation in anger, food, drink, sex, etc.) 
o  Loyalty 
o  Obedience to God and/or country and/or some ethical code 
o  Faith 
o  Hope 
o  Charity 
o  Humility 
o  Compassion 
o  Self-reliance 
 
Successful speakers will address the specific questions and points, stay on 
topic, respond thoughtfully and well to their opponents’ points, show flexibility in 
adapting their points to answer their opponents, display poise and knowledge, 
and be effective presenters (e.g., good eye contact, gestures for emphasis, good 
voice projection). 
 
Unsuccessful speakers will simply give their points as though they were stand-
alone speeches instead of part of a dialogue with the other team and will not be 
effective presenters. 
 
Your Tasks  
1.  Get together well ahead of time to decide what topic you will debate.  
2.  It’s probably a good idea for the 2 teams to meet with me as soon as you 
have selected a topic to discuss it and strategy. 
3.  To be a good debater, you need to anticipate and prepare for possible 
points that the opposition will raise (as well as preparing your own case). 

 

5 

In other words, you need to anticipate not only the points the opposition 
will make for his/her case (and how you would rebut or concede them) but 
also the counter-arguments he/she will raise against your points (and how 
you will answer those). 
4.  For the debates, you are sophists—you do not have to believe the 
position you argue for … you simply have to argue it well. 

 
Often, the particular topic will be an example of a larger ethical issue. Many 
times, that underlying issue is this: “The ends justify the means.” In other words, 
if the end (goal) is good (morally, practically), then it is morally all right to use 
immoral means to achieve that goal. Often, connecting the particular issue to the 
larger issue is an effective strategy for convincing your audience. 
 
TOPICS -- Any topic must be set up as a proposition (an assertion—not as a 
question—see the examples below for a model) and the topic must be 
controversial—a controversy is any topic about which intelligent, well-informed 
people of goodwill can disagree. If your team cannot agree on a topic, here are 
some suggestions (but coming up with an original topic is neither a plus nor a 
minus in terms of your grade—the point is a spirited, interesting, and well argued 
debate). If the suggestions don’t help, come to see me (together) and we’ll find a 
topic: 
1.  The proposition: “The World is not dangerous because of those who do 
harm but because of those who look at it without doing anything.” --Albert 
Einstein. 
2.  The proposition: For practical and moral reasons, political assassination 
is sometimes necessary. 
3.  The proposition: No action is too extreme in the defense of freedom. 
4.  The proposition:  The United States is just like the Titanic. 
5.  The proposition:  The past is a foreign country; they do things differently 
there.--Lesley Poles Hartley (The Go-Between) 
6.  The proposition:  It is better to be lucky than smart. 
7.  The proposition:  Society has become too dependent on technology. 
8.  The proposition: Beauty is better than brains. 
9.  The proposition:  Batman is a greater superhero than Superman. 
10. The proposition:  Achilles should refuse to go fight in the Trojan War. 
a.  Background: Achilles has learned from a completely reliable source 
(the gods) that he has two possible fates: (1) he can refuse to join the 
rest of the Greeks as they go to war with Troy, in which case he will 
live a long and happy life—but after he is dead, history will not 
remember him; or (2) he can go to Troy and win great glory that will 
live in history through the centuries, but he will die an early death and 
not know the joys of being married, having children, etc.   
11. The proposition:  In politics, the ends do justify the means—i.e., a 
morally good goal (end) justifies the use of methods which are morally 
questionable, immoral, or even illegal.

12. The proposition:  For both practical and moral reasons, it makes sense 
to sacrifice individual rights for the safety of society. 
13. The proposition: For both practical and moral reasons, voting in national 
elections should be compulsory. 
14. The proposition: MIT has a moral obligation to prohibit hate speech. 
15. The proposition: Because human life is sacred, there is never a good 
reason for killing another human being. 
16. The proposition: Religious beliefs have done more harm than good. 
17. The proposition: Inaction in the face of injustice makes an individual 
morally guilty. 
18. The proposition: It is better to be a liberated pauper than a wealthy slave. 
19. The proposition:  Because free speech can lead to three undesirable 
things (to violations of national security, to hate speech, and to the 
expression of unpopular or even treasonous ideas), the Constitution 
should be amended to put clear limits on free speech. 
20. The proposition: In Stephen Crane’s poem that follows, the man who 
fears he might find a victim is the wiser of the two. 

                 Poem # 56 
 
A man feared that he might find an assassin; 
Another that he might find a victim. 
One was more wise than the other.  

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

21. The proposition: If we on the island in Lost at the end of this season, we 
would not risk losing all that we had learned and felt in order to return 
everything to the way it was before Oceanic 815 Flight crashed. (to refresh 
your memories-- http://beta.abc.go.com/shows/lost/timeline)
