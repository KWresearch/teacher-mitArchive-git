Requirements for all Essays (PDF)
***** Assignment Description *****
Essays consist of the following:
   1. RRR (Ready-Ready Revision) for Workshop
   2. Mandatory Revision
   3. Optional Revision
   4. A Postwrite
More details are given below:
   1. Reader-Ready Revision (RRR) for Workshop (a complete version): I do not
      comment on this version.
   2. Mandatory Revision incorporates any suggestions from your workshop group
      and from the Writing Center that you find useful. I grade the Mandatory
      Revision.
   3. Optional Revision: If you wish, you may revise any Mandatory Revision
      once more, BUT
         a. if and only ifyou consult with the Writing Center before turning
            the Optional Revision in to me. No exceptions.
         b. The Optional Revisionâs grade will replace the Mandatory
            Revisionâs grade.
   4. A Postwrite accompanies the Mandatory and Optional Revisions. It is your
      opportunity as a rhetor to explain what rhetorical approaches,
      strategies, and techniques you incorporated into your essay in order to
      make it persuasive, thus demonstrating your conscious understanding of
      the art of rhetoric and of your audience.
   5. Criteria for Evaluating Your Essays: Your essays will be evaluated for
         a. Clarity, Coherence and Consistency
         b. Interesting, insightful, and relevant content
         c. Originality and depth of thought in analysis and persuasion
         d. Appeals to logos, ethos, and pathos
         e. Nuanced discussion of ideas
         f. Explicit use of rhetorical strategies, techniques, and style
         g. Explicit explanation of assumptions (yours and theirs)
         h. Explicit use of ethical concepts
         i. Active engagement with ideas and with oppositionâs counter-
            argument
         j. Awareness of your audience (i.e., the audience is accommodated,
            kairos is established)
         k. Prose that is varied, clear, accurate, concise, interesting, and
            essentially error free
         l. Adherence to formatâe.g., use headings when requested, use MLA
            documentation
         m. Always your goal should be to create new knowledge.
***** Format *****
Following directions is part of accommodating your reader
   1. All essays must have page numbers and meaningful titles
   2. All essays must have Acknowledgements of Workshop and Acknowledgment of
      Writing Center, a Works Cited, in-text citations and a Postwrite.
   3. For details on MLA format, see Purdue's
***** Posts *****
   1. Everyone has to write one post each week (~100-250 words each). These
      posts are informal writing -- I will read these for content without
      worrying about style.
      Â 
   2. Possible things you might write about in your posts:
         a. Ideas that didnât get expressed in class about texts, debates, or
            class discussions or that you want to explain more fully or that
            you want to argue for or against
         b. Comments on the rhetoric beyond our classâthe rhetoric of
            websites, texts from your other classes or elsewhere (e.g.,
            articles or letters in the Tech, the Globe, in professional
            journals)
         c. Provocative ideas about ethical or rhetorical issues that you want
            to raise
         d. Responses to comments on our Stellar forum made by fellow students
            or me
         e. Responses to articles on Harlot:_A_Revealing_Look_at_the_Art_of
            Persuasion--or new articles of your own.
         f. Any other topic to which you can connect rhetoric and/or ethics in
            interesting ways.

Extra Credit Possibilities: There are 4 extra credit possibilities. Each will
add 0.1 point to your final point total. Although this might not sound like
much, I do not round grades upâso, if you have a 10.9 average, you get a B+
for the course. If you did 1 extra credit thing, I'd add 0.1 and then your
average would be 11.0, an A- for the course.
   1. For each time you consult the Writing Center (for this course) for other
      than the 1st mandatory consultation, I will add 0.1 points
   2. For a total of 13 Stellar posts (i.e., 3 additional posts beyond the
      required 10), I will add 0.1 point (i.e., no extra credit for only 12
      posts)
   3. Read an article in a rhetoric journal and write an essay (250-500 words)
      in which you (1) first summarize the article and then (2) explain how it
      applies to rhetoric youâve seen in class or in the world. The journals
      are Rhetoric Review, Quarterly Journal of Speech, Kairos:_A_Journal_of
      Rhetoric,_Technology,_Pedagogy, Poroi: An Interdisciplinary Journal of
      Rhetorical Analysis and Invention,Pretext, Rhetorica analysis and
      commentary about media ethics and rhetoric.
