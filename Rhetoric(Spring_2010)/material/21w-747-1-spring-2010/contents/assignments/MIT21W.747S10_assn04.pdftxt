3rd Speech—Final Speech, Performed 
 

 Due: SES #21 and SES #22 
 
Spoken Length: 5-6 minutes  
 
Goal: To give an interesting speech—either persuasive or informative  
 
Delivery: You may either  
(cid:190)  deliver your speech extemporaneously  
(cid:190)  or you may read it.  
o 
If reading it, however, remember that eye contact, gestures, and 
establishing rapport with the audience is more difficult. 

 
Your Audience: Members of the class and me—several of whom are skeptical about 
your thesis and the relevance of your topic for them.  
 
Topic and Approach: The only restriction on topic—don’t address a topic that might be 
offensive to some members of the class (when in doubt, ask me). You may use 
whatever approach you wish—serious, satiric, humorous, etc. 
 
Suggested Topics: 
(cid:190)  Some idea, organization, or cause you are interested in 
(cid:190)  Rhetoric 
(cid:190)  Freedom  
(cid:190)  Nature 
(cid:190)  The value of (or the danger of) 
o  Worrying 
o  Thinking 
o  Being in love 
o  Being happy 
o  Not being happy 
o  Writing essays 
o  Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter 
o  Your major 
o  Change 
o  Etc. 
(cid:190)  Some local issue (on campus, in Cambridge, etc.) 
(cid:190)  Some national or international issue 
(cid:190)  Some other topic that interests you 

 
Structure of Speech: The speech should have an introduction, a body with 2 or 3 main 
points, and a conclusion.  
Introduction: An opening that is 2-5 sentences, including 
• 
o  An attention getter 
o  A forecast of your main points 
•  Body (2 or 3 main points): 
o  Main point 
(cid:131)  Example, anecdote, or evidence 
o  Main point 
(cid:131)  Example, anecdote, or evidence 
o  Main point 
(cid:131)  Example, anecdote, or evidence 
•  Conclusion-- Your ending should incorporate a sentence or two that sounds like 
an ending (e.g., say "In conclusion"). 
o  Summary of main points 
o  Final thought 
o  Say “Thank you” 
Stylistic devices that can be heard (e.g., a balanced sentence, alliteration) will improve 
your ethos ... but save the pyrotechnics for key points 
 
Preparation: As part of your preparation, if you are delivering your speech 
extemporaneously, you should write out completely the intro and the conclusion because 
those are the major parts of the speech for your listeners (but you won’t read them when 
you give the speech). You also should write out key phrases or ideas on either a sheet 
of paper or on a 4 x 6 note card (which is much less distracting to your audience than a 
full sheet of paper) and take that mini-outline with you to the front of the room when you 
give your speech.
