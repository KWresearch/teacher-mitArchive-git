Your Task: Write a persuasive essay. It might be: an analysis of a speech; an analysis of a 
text; a genre analysis; an argument on some controversy that is appropriate to members of 
21W.747 (giving both sides); an argument with a text; a satire; a Platonic dialogue —the only 
requirements are: 
1.  it must be persuasive 
2.  it must demonstrate your command of ethos, pathos, logos, style, and at least an implicit 
knowledge of ethics  
3.  it must demonstrate your rhetorical ability (after all, this is your last chance to showcase 
what you have learned) 
4.  it must be directed at us (members of this class and me), your audience 
a.  any needs or values etc. that you appeal to have to be those that you believe 
your classmates and I have 
b.  you must establish kairos (why should we members of this 21W.747 class care 
about this topic at this particular time) 

 
Your Audience: Members of the class and me. As always, assume that some of us are initially 
skeptical about your thesis and major points. 
 
Goal: To demonstrate your understanding of rhetoric and ethics by using the rhetorical appeals 
and techniques (ethos, pathos, logos, style) that we’ve encountered to convince your readers 
that your ideas are valid.

Analysis of a Speech or Text 
 
 

• 
• 

Task: Find a text that is worth close rhetorical analysis—if in doubt, check with me about it 
ahead of time. Our web site has several suitable texts that have not been assigned for class. 
•  You might analyze one  
o  e.g., Obama’s speech 
•  or bounce compare and contrast the arguments of two 
•  democratic style—Aune, Beadsley, Ivie, Merciera, and O’Gorman have different 
visions 
the rhetorical situation—Bitzer, Consigny, and Vatz disagree 
If you select a text assigned for this class, you must go significantly beyond what we 
said in class in order to score higher than a “C”—if in doubt about what was said in 
class, select a text not assigned for class. 

 
Details: Write a coherent, thoughtful, and thorough analysis either 
•  of 1 (one) unit of analysis taken from the Rhetoric Tool Chest (ethos, logos, pathos, 
figurative language, etc.).  
•  OR of one significant passage in the text  
•  Your essay should follow the directions and headings that were given for Essay #1, the 
CRA. 

 
 
Genre Analysis  
 
Task:  
1.  Select (or create) a genre (e.g., sonnets, horror movies, superhero comics, sitcoms, Cubist 
paintings, Facebook pages, Art Deco buildings). Select 3-5 examples of the genre to write 
about. Your essay must use Foss’s concepts (situational requirements, stylistic and 
substantive characteristics) and use the format she recommends. 
a.  If it is pre-existing genre, use our library’s Vera-Multi-Search: Articles to locate an 
article that you can quote for a definition of the genre and its characteristics 
b.  If you are creating a genre (might be more difficult to do than you think), define this 
particular genre, identifying the major similarities and characteristics that justify its 
being called a “genre” 
i.  if you are creating your own genre (or can’t find a satisfactory pre-existing 
definition), use the criteria that we have seen in class as a way of defining 
and explaining your genre 
 Once the genre has been defined, use analysis to explore the major elements that 
make one of the texts you’ve chosen individual (unique).  
i.  For example, after visiting Great Britain, Our-Friend returns and tells us there 
is a genre called “English castles.” To define the genre, Our-Friend explains 
in depth what the characteristics of “English castles” are (e.g., moats, towers 
and battlements, made of stone, big, built for defense). Then we ask, “Okay, 
so once you’ve seen one example of this genre English castles, why bother 
to go see any other examples? Aren’t they all the same?” Our-Friend 
answers by analyzing Warwick Castle.  
d.  As always, more about less is the goal when it comes to differentiating the 
individual text from the genre).  
e.  Here’s an example (for sake of illustration, let’s say you are looking at blogs as a 
genre):  

c.

i.  think of a genre that is close to (similar to) blogs (e.g., personal essays, or 
journals, or diaries, or letters to the editor, or newspaper opinion columnists—
those are the ones that come to my mind, but you might think of others) 
ii.   pick the one that seems closest to blogs (or perhaps, to the subgenre of 
blogs that you are investigating) 
iii.  Ask yourself, “What makes a blog different from x” (for the sake of illustration, 
I’ll say “What makes blogs different from personal essays)?  
iv.  Then you would say something like “Although personal essays and blogs 
share characteristics A, B and C, blogs differ from personal essays because 
they have characteristics F and W.” That would do it. 
v.  Having established the genre of blogs, then focus on one blog and show how 
it both fulfills the criteria of “blog” and also transcends the genre in some way 
vi.  As far as citation is concerned, treat blogs the way MLA treats blogs (here’s 
an example): 
Miller, Carolyn R. and Dawn Shepherd. Blogging as Social  
Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog.” Into the  
Blogosphere. http://blog.lib.umn.edu/  blogosphere/ blogging_as_social_action.html.
Web. 1 May 2009. 

 

(cid:131)  Where 1 May 2009 is the date I accessed it. Some blogs have a post 
date (which, if this blog had one, would go right after Into the 
Blogosphere). 
2.  Follow the structure used by Sharon M. Varallo in her essay on family photographs (at the 
end of Foss’ essay on Genre). Use headings (Varallo’s headings are fine, but you might 
create different headings, depending on the genre). 
3.  Here are some possible genres:  
a.  3-5 different people’s pages from Facebook or from MySpace (to make it a 
believable genre, those 3-5 people should have some significant criteria in 
common—e.g., age, occupation) 
b.  any kind of website genre (e.g., 3-5 writing center websites, university websites, MIT 
department websites, celebrity websites) 
c.  3-5 texts for a genre of a type of visuals—e.g., photographs, paintings,  buildings  
d.  3-5 texts for a genre of speeches, or of graphic novels, or of movies, or music, or 
poems (e.g., sonnets, or poems about love, poems about war) 
e.  One of the genres we’ve examined (commencement addresses, satire, presidential 
inaugurals)—use what we developed in class to set the context  
f.  whatever genre interests you 
g.  Assume that some members of your audience are not familiar with the genre, so you 
need to define it clearly and fully. 

 
Task-specific Goals:  
•  To use what you have learned this semester to write a rhetorically sophisticated essay 
•  To describe a genre (either a genre that is already acknowledged as existing or creating 
your own) 
•  To prove that a particular text both belongs to that genre but also is an individual within 
that genre

Argument on a Controversy 
 

   

Your Task: Write a coherent persuasive essay on a controversial topic that is appropriate for 
us (the members of 21W.747)—i.e., you need to establish believable kairos for us; if you 
cannot, select another topic. It must explicitly use ethical concepts as well as appeals to ethos, 
pathos, and logos to make a case that your position is valid. A controversy is anything about 
which knowledgeable, intelligent people of goodwill can disagree. An argument gives the best 
points of the opposition (and either refutes or concedes them) as well as building a case for your 
position.  
 
Topics: Two topics are prohibited—stem cell research and cloning.  
 
Argument with a Text 
 
Your Task: Select an essay whose position you disagree with. Write an argument against that 
text’s position, answering that text’s major points and building a case of your own. 
 
A Satire 
 
Details: Satire and humor can be very persuasive—or they can bomb out big time. For these 
two forms, consult with me about your topic.  
 
Platonic Dialogue 
 
Details: This form can be a cool way to make an argument. For it work effectively for us, 
though, both speakers should have good points (unlike “The Allegory of the Cave” which is 
somewhat unusual in Plato’s canon in that Glaucon is more an admiring listener rather than an 
adversary). Think of this approach as giving the pro arguments to speaker A and the con 
arguments to speaker B and then having them speak.  
 
Some Other Approach 
 
 Task: If you have some other approach you’d like to take, come see me and we’ll discuss it. 
 
Requirements for all Essays 
 
Meaningful titles (at least in an academic setting and in this class) have a colon and a subtitle. 
For example, 
•  King’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail”: A Critical Rhetorical Analysis 
•  Walking Away from Omelas: The Rhetoric of Happiness 

 
A Postwrite (100-250 words) is required for each Mandatory Revision and for each Optional 
Revision. It is your opportunity as a rhetor to explain to me what rhetorical approaches, 
strategies, and techniques you incorporated into your essay in order to make it persuasive. It is 
the way you demonstrate a conscious understanding of the art of rhetoric and to explain your 
conception of your audience’s beginning attitudes towards your topic, your thesis, and yourself 
as rhetor. It must use these boldfaced headings: 
•  My Thesis 
o  Copy and paste your thesis statement here 
•  My Audience 
o  Before they read your essay, what were your audience’s probable attitudes 
towards your topic and your thesis? What makes you think so?

o  Before they read your essay, what was their attitude toward you as rhetor? You 
need to be specific here—you need to seriously consider the role(s) you have 
played in class discussions, workshops, etc. Which of your beliefs have you 
actively expressed? How “visible” have you been so far in class? Will you need to 
“repair” your ethos or simply build on it?   
o  Specifically explain how you dealt with their attitudes in your essay. 
•  How I used Ethos (Aristotle) 
o  What ethos were you trying to project? 
o  Give a specific list of things you did to enhance your ethos 
o  e.g., how did you establish your sagacity (wisdom, expertise), goodwill (having 
concern for audience’s survival and growth needs), character (moral excellence, 
credibility, justice, self-control, common sense, etc.)? 
•  How I used Pathos  
o  What specific emotions were you trying to invoke in your audience? 
o  A la Aristotle--What specific emotions did you try to stir or change—anger into 
calm, or calm into anger, revenge into mercy or mercy into revenge, etc.? 
o  Give a specific list of things you did to appeal to your audience’s emotions 
•  How I used Logos 
o  List specific places where you used logos 
o  What types of evidence did you use? 
•  How I used Style 
o  List specific stylistic things that you did 
 
Workshop Acknowledgements: (this section is included only in the Mandatory Revision). Here 
you tell me explicitly who gave what good advice, who didn’t give good advice, etc. Here is a 
brief sample: 
•  Student X advised me to use more quotations to prove my points. blah blah 
•  Student Y pointed out that…etc. 
•  Student W didn’t really give any useful advice 
 
Writing Center Acknowledgements (this section is included only in the Mandatory Revision). 
If you didn’t consult with the Center, simply say “Did not consult” under this heading. If you did 
consult with the Center, tell me explicitly who you worked with in the Center and what advice 
she/he gave. Here is a brief example: 
•  Amanda asked me questions that helped me see some other implications of the rhetor’s use 
of…, particularly x and y . She also…. 
•  Although I asked Eric to help with my organization, all he focused on was grammar, so he 
wasn’t really much help. 
Note: for both Workshop and Writing Center Acknowledgements, it is important to say who was 
not helpful as well as saying who was helpful. 
 
 Documentation Format: 
•  Quotations should be introduced and then commented upon. For each quotation or 
reference to a text, use MLA in-text citations  
o  According to Doe, “blah blah” (34). 
o  Supporting this idea is “blah blah” (Doe 34). 
•  At the end of your essay, you need a Works Cited: here you list the texts you used in your 
essay; and list the sources alphabetically by author’s last name.

So the 1st page of your all versions of your essay (RRR and Mandatory Revision and Optional
Revision) should look like this: 
 

A Meaningful Title: A Meaningful Subtitle 

 
After the last sentence of your essay, skip 3 lines and then give Works Cited, etc. Here is what 
he last page of the Mandatory Revision looks like this:

Your Name + email address 
 
Date 
 

 
Then skip 2 lines and start your essay.  
 

 
Last sentences of your essay Blah blah. 
 
Works Cited 

Blah blah  
 
Workshop Acknowledgement: blah blah 
 
Writing Center Acknowledgement: blah blah 
 
Postwrite: blah blah
