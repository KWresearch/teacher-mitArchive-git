Abraham Lincoln’s 2nd Inaugural Address: What He Didn’t Say 

Introduction 

 
Abraham Lincoln, America’s 16th and perhaps most famous president, 
 
gave several important speeches during his lifetime, speeches such as the 
“Gettysburg Address” and the “Cooper Union Address.” Although the occasion of 
his first inauguration as president presented him with significant rhetorical issues 
such as the fact that seven Southern states had seceded from the Union when 
he was elected, the rhetorical situation he faced at his second inaugural was 
equally thorny although different. As he stood before the audience on that rainy 
March 4, 1865, he faced an audience that felt confident that the Civil War was 
fast drawing to a close, an audience of people thirsty for revenge against the 
rebels who had dragged the nation into the bloodiest war in its history, an 
audience far from committed to accepting former slaves as equals in the 
workplace or in the voting booth, an audience eager to hear his plans for the 
post-war era. In general terms, we can ask, “How can a rhetor give a speech that 
does not fulfill his audience’s expectations while preparing them for at least a hint 
of his overall intended policy?” And, perhaps more profoundly, “How does a 
rhetor give a speech that reaches across a century-and-a-half when the occasion 
essentially demands that the speech be time-bound and place-specific?” Such 
questions resonate for us today since we face situations in which we must deliver 
difficult ideas to unwilling listeners, both in our private and in our professional 
lives. Examining two rhetorical aspects of his speech will give us a sense of 
Lincoln’s strategies, namely, his tone and his ethos. 
 

Summary of the Speech 
 
 
It is not difficult for us to imagine what Lincoln’s audience expected from 
his speech because we expect the same things from Obama’s inaugural speech. 
They and we want assurances that things will get better, we want to hear, in 
broad strokes, what policies the president will  put into effect to make those 
things better. Given the nature and attitude of his audience, Lincoln had to walk a 
very thin line in his speech. For instance, if he explained any specific policies, 
there might have been immediate dissent and perhaps even violence. Therefore, 
he opted to give a speech that emphasized the lack of control humans have over 
events. Only after “softening up” his listeners with repeated themes that stress 
the fact that everyone shares guilt in some way for the war and that stress 
humans’ inability to predict the outcome of any action--only then did Lincoln 
make somewhat explicit his thesis, namely, that the victors should treat the 
losers without malice and with charity in order to bind up the wounds that had 
been inflicted on the nation. His purpose, then, was to humble his audience, to 

 

1

make them receptive to the policies which he was envisioning but which he was 
not ready to reveal. 
 
In his first two paragraphs, Lincoln points out contrasts between the 
occasion of his first inaugural and his second. At the first, he had to give a 
lengthy address that spelled out his polices in case the impending rebellion came 
to fruition. But four years’ of announcements about the progress of the war and 
major policies changes such as the Emancipation Proclamation left little new to 
be said about the war.  
 
In the final three paragraphs, Lincoln gives a brief summary of the start of 
the war and the fact that both sides declared they wanted no war, yet 
Southerners were starting the war even as he was giving his first inaugural 
address. He points out that his government had not advocated ending slavery but 
only restricting its spread. Then he speaks at great length about the inability of 
either side to imagine the length and severity of the war or its unintended 
outcomes. He states that everything that happens is God’s will. He ends with his 
thesis. 
 

Definition 

I will use ethos as my major unit of analysis. According to Hart and 
Daughton, ethos is “the rhetor’s credibility or authority—the right to address an 
audience” (152). More can be said about ethos than that, however. For example, 

Ethos names the persuasive appeal of one's character, especially 
how this character is established by means of the speech or 
discourse. Aristotle claimed that one needs to appear both 
knowledgeable about one's subject and benevolent. Cicero said 
that in classical oratory the initial portion of a speech (its exordium 
or introduction) was the place to establish one's credibility with the 
audience. (Burton “Ethos” screen) 

Further, as Edward P.J. Corbett notes, 

The ethical appeal is exerted, according to Aristotle, when the 
speech itself impresses the audience that the speaker is a person 
of sound sense (phronesis), high moral character (arête), and 
benevolence (eunoia). Notice that it is the speech itself that must 
create this impression. (80) 

It is always difficult when dealing with such an iconic figure as Lincoln to separate 
the myth from the man, the historical personage from the person revealed only in 
the speech. One way of at least partially achieving that separation is by 
examining what the speech actually says and reveals.

Analysis 
 
 
After an examination of Lincoln’s ethos in general, I will do a close reading 
of the fourth and fifth paragraphs, for nowhere in the speech is that ethos more 
textured than in that passage.  
 
Ethos 
 
Lincoln’s refusal to address those most pressing topics is almost off-
handed, stated as though the audience does not even expect him to address 
those topics. For instance, after noting that “public declarations have been 
constantly called forth” (par. 1) about the war, he says “little that is new could be 
presented” by him during this speech (par. 1). This statement is disingenuous at 
the very least. Even in 2010 with all the instantaneous and on-the-spot news 
outlets at our disposal--e.g., newspapers, magazines, 24-hour news broadcasts 
on radio and on television and the Internet-- it is impossible to get all facts and 
accurate interpretations of the meaning of those facts. Imagine how much more 
difficult it was for audiences in 1865 to have accurate and up-to-date information 
about the war (or anything else).  Further, as with our news sources today, 
reports were inevitably biased, either on purpose or simply because humans are 
imperfect recorders of events or interpreters of their significance. Hence Lincoln’s 
audience was thirsting for the latest and most official information about the 
progress of the war, but Lincoln says, using the passive voice, that “little that is 
new could be presented” (par. 1).  In fact, he even denies having any additional 
information, saying that the “progress of our arms … is as well known to the 
public as to myself” (par. 2).  Using the passive voice again, Lincoln ends this 
section of his speech by saying “no prediction in regard to it [the war] is ventured” 
(par. 2). 
This use of the passive voice signals another amazing aspect of Lincoln’s 
rhetoric and ethos in this speech. After the second paragraph, he uses no first-
person pronouns. Inaugural speeches are an occasion for an incumbent 
president to trumpet his accomplishments and to get the audience on board with 
his plans for the next four years. And Lincoln had some heady accomplishments, 
not the least of which was the Emancipation Proclamation and the impending 
end of the war (five weeks after this speech, Lee surrendered and the war was 
over). Yet there is none of that here. 
The most notable aspect of Lincoln’s ethos, though, is his sense of what 
might be called powerlessness or his sense of God’s will. Perhaps four years of 
being president and seeing the war drag on and seeing the blood lust build up in 
the Congress with its desire for revenge on the South, perhaps four years of 
maneuvering policies into place only to have them gelded or misapplied or 
ignored or, worst of all, of seeing those policies enacted with unexpected and 
contrary results, perhaps four years of having power but not being able to bend 
events to his will—perhaps four such years changed Lincoln into a man who had 
to acknowledge that the flow of events was beyond his control, beyond human 
control. Who can know for sure? 

 

3

 

What we can know, though, is that the ethos in this speech is not a 
triumphant victor glorifying his own accomplishments. The personality that comes 
through this speech is tired, sad about the turn of events, and profoundly aware 
of the fact that neither side is without guilt.  
 
Close Reading 
 
For my readers’ convenience, here are the fourth and fifth paragraphs: 

Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has 
already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease when, or 
even before the conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a 
result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same 
God, and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men should 
dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s 
faces, but let us judge not that we be not judged. The prayer of both could not be 
answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. 
Woe unto to the war because of offences, for it must needs be that offences come, but 
woe to the man by whom the offence cometh. If we should suppose that American 
slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but 
which having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that 
He gives to both North and South this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the 
offence came, shall we discern there any departure from those divine attributes which the 
believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently do we 
pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet if God wills that it 
continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be 
paid by another drawn by the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must 
be said, that the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. 
 
With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God 
gives us to see the right, let us finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, 
to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphans, to do 
all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all 
nations.  
 
After pointing out the irony of the fact that no one expected the war to last 
very long and the irony of the fact that Northerners and Southerners both pray to 
the same God, Lincoln seems to make the North’s case for seeing God on its 
side, but then seems to quickly retreat from that idea. He says, “It may seem 
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their 
bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not that we be not 
judged” (par. 4). Let’s consider that statement for a moment. The “It may seem 
strange” is notable for its use of the word may, a word that already signals that 
Lincoln’s final pronouncement will deny that “it is strange.” They may is his 
accommodation of his audience, indicating to them that he understands their 
position before hearing his point.  His statement “but let us judge not that we be 
not judged” changes the Bible’s word ye to we (“judge not that ye be not judged” 
[Matt 7:1]), thus turning the speaking situation from a superior-to-inferior 
(president-to-citizens) to a “peer-to-peer” situation (Strang 3). Lincoln thus 

 

4

suggests that he himself cannot understand the reason, but he is wise enough to 
know that neither he nor his listeners are in a position to be judges. This strategy 
reinforces his earlier statement that he knows no more about the progress of the 
war than his listeners do--on one level that is obviously false (as I noted above), 
but, on a more metaphysical level, it is true because Lincoln is acknowledging 
the very great limits on human ability to actually know anything. 
In fact, the whole fourth paragraph reveals and deepens our sense of 
Lincoln as a man who no longer believes that humans control events. As he 
says, “The Almighty has His own purposes” (par. 4). Even more significantly, 
Lincoln eliminates one of the standard defenses of anyone who is put on trial for 
war crimes, namely, that the situation “made him do it.” Lincoln says, “Woe unto 
the war because of offences,” meaning, that the war is horrible and causes 
serious moral crimes to be committed. But the end of that sentence issues a 
warning to individuals—“but woe to the man by whom the offence cometh” (par. 
4). This line could be interpreted at least two ways. First, “you Southerners 
caused the war and hence will suffer.” Second, and the way I think Lincoln meant 
it (and this borne out by the ending of the speech), “neither you Southerners nor 
we Northerners will be exempt from punishment for this war.”  
Puzzled by the fact that an all-powerful God could allow slavery in the first 
place but not willing to say so, Lincoln instead resorts to a conditional if clause—
“If we should suppose that American slavery is one of those offences which, in 
the providence of God, must needs come” (par. 4).  In other words, although he 
cannot fathom God’s reasons for allowing slavery, he is going to assume that 
God might or must have good reasons.  He then hypothesizes that slavery has 
continued “through His appointed time” and that God now wants slavery to end 
and so is punishing both North and South with the war. If that is the case, Lincoln 
says, who are we mere humans to suggest that God’s plan deviates at all from 
his “attributes” of being all good, all powerful, and all-knowing. I suggest that 
Lincoln is indeed doubting God’s plan here and that his language reveals this 
aspect of his ethos even though it was no doubt not clear to a listening audience.   
Once Lincoln has established the “fact” that God’s plan cannot be 
questioned, he says that if there has to be a complete balancing of the books, if 
every drop of slave’s blood that was shed has to be compensated for by drops of 
blood of Union and Confederate soldiers, then we still cannot doubt that “the 
judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether” (par. 4). What he 
strongly implies is that we cannot understand those judgments either. 
The final aspect of Lincoln’s ethos, and the most important, is revealed in 
the speech’s powerful last sentence which constitutes the whole of the fifth 
pargraph: 
With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the 
right as God gives us to see the right, let us finish the work we are 
in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphans, to do all which 
may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among 
ourselves and with all nations.  

 

5

This sentence reveals a man of amazing compassion, a compassion that was 
established in the fourth paragraph by his willingness to quiet his own doubts and 
questioning with a reliance on a belief in God’s plan. Instead of devoting long 
paragraphs to explaining policies that would allow the Southern states back into 
the Union, he simply says, “With malice toward none, with charity for all”—in 
other words, he is trying to forestall the revengeful blood lust that raged in the 
Northerners, to turn it into Christian charity and compassion. He knows that “the 
work we are in” (i.e., the war) must be finished, and he knows that victory is 
imminent. The rest of the sentence deepens and alters the meaning of “the work 
we are in”; suddenly the work is transformed into binding up “the nation’s 
wounds.” With another rhetorical move, he turns the binding up of the nation’s 
wounds into the personal, for Lincoln tells us that we must take care of the 
soldiers, and we must take care of the widows and orphans of those soldiers who 
died in the war. And he is not distinguishing between Northern and Southern 
soldiers or their dependents. He is thus revealed as a man of compassion who 
sees both the big picture (the nation’s wounds) and the individual’s agony, who 
see the nation’s needs and the individual’s. As a nation and as individuals, 
Lincoln says, we must “do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting 
peace among ourselves and with all nations.” In this last sentence we can see 
Lincoln’s vision for the post-war period. Not reparations and revenge, but helping 
and healing, justice and peace. 
 
The ethos that is revealed in this speech, then, is complex—a leader who 
has come to see that human power is essentially an illusion, a leader who cannot 
fathom but still believes in God’s just purposes, a leader who does not trumpet 
victory but advocates charity and forgiveness. 
 
Insight into Rhetoric 
 
 
This speech is important not only diachronically as the last major speech 
given by one of our greatest presidents at a crucial moment in our history, but 
also synchronically because it shows us how a rhetor can disappoint his 
audience’s expectations and still deliver a powerful speech.  Further, the speech 
reveals how a rhetor can give a speech whose content is usually dictated by the 
occasion and the genre (inaugural addresses) in such a way that it transcends 
the limitation of that occasion and genre. 
 
What my approach has demonstrated is the complexity of ethos that can 
exist in such a short text. By using classic invention, it is possible to think about 
all the topics that might have been covered in a text. With just a little bit of 
historical background (often found in the speech or in the rhetorical situation 
itself), it is then possible to imagine which of those topics would most likely be 
included. Then, when we look at the text itself, we discover whether those likely 
topics have indeed been addressed. If they haven’t, we are forced to ask 
ourselves, “Why weren’t they covered? Are there clues in the rest of the text that 
suggest explanations or possible reasons?” What a rhetor leaves out often 
reveals much about the rhetor and/or the situation.

As I set out to examine Lincoln’s “Second Inaugural Address,” I asked the 
following research questions: “How can a rhetor give a speech that does not fulfill 
his audience’s expectations while preparing them for at least a hint of his overall 
intended policy?” and “How does a rhetor give a speech that reaches across a 
century when the occasion essentially demands that the speech be time-bound 
and place-specific?”  
 I think my analysis has revealed the answer quite clearly: The rhetor first 
dismisses the audience’s expectations in an almost off-handed manner and then 
moves somewhat swiftly to much larger, more metaphysical issues. He dwells 
not on “how will we punish the South” but rather on “Who is not guilty in this 
war?” He contemplates not “What punishment shall we inflict on the South?” but 
rather “Who but God has the right to judge any human endeavor?” He asks not 
“Why does the South want to spread slavery?” but rather “How can God allow 
slavery in the first place?”  Only then, after he has humbled his listeners into 
realizing that events are moved by powers far greater than theirs and motivated 
by intentions far beyond their ken, only then does he hint at his policy, a policy 
that seems to have grown out of that humility and out of that belief that we cannot 
know what lies ahead. He hints that his policy will be one of charity and mercy 
and that his goal will not be to punish but to heal.  
Herein lies the answer to the second research question I asked. By 
dismissing the specific issues of the moment and by raising profound and eternal 
questions, Lincoln was able to write a speech that is more important 
synchronically than it is diachronically.  
How is this so? 

 
Reflection 
 
I often wonder what American history would have been like if Lincoln had 
not been assassinated and had had a chance to enact his policies. Perhaps he 
could have ended or at least mitigated the animosity between North and South. 
Perhaps African Americans could have been made full citizens much more 
swiftly. Perhaps racism itself might have been lessened. 
Or perhaps not.  
Perhaps we would have ended up where we are anyway, since Congress 
and the Northerners were so intent on revenge. Perhaps they would have added 
more proof to Lincoln’s conviction that humans don’t really control events and 
that some other force with different motivations and visions controls us. Perhaps 
Lincoln would have ended his second term a totally disheartened man, bitter at 
the failure of people to live up to even the most basic of Jesus’ commands to 
“love our neighbors as ourselves” and to embrace Lincoln’s own vision of “with 
malice toward none, with charity for all.”  
We can be certain of one thing: We Americans still have not learned the 
lesson that Lincoln tried to teach us. We Americans did not even learn any 
lessons from the Reconstruction period that followed Lincoln’s death, as the 
same type of policies after World War I led to the conditions that fostered the rise 
of Nazis and World War II. And certainly we did not learn any lessons about 

 

7

leaping into a war without considering the long-range consequences, as 
America’s ill-advised sallies into Vietnam and Iraq continue to prove. Perhaps 
“speeches for the ages” cannot, in the end, teach people because we are always 
caught up in the moment’s fear and rage. 
When I first started this project, I selected Lincoln’s speech simply 
because it was relatively short and because I have always admired Lincoln. 
Having done this analysis in order to answer my research questions, however, I 
have to say that I find this a profoundly moving speech, one that is rhetorically 
sophisticated and effective, and one that was well worth the effort of examining it, 
one whose lesson is still left to be learned—be wary of what we begin since once 
it is begun, it will have dire consequences that we did not imagine and can not 
control.

 My workshop partners Mike, Yi, and Sarah gave some good initial feedback. 
Both Sarah and Carlos were confused by my original expression of ideas about 
Ethos, and they pointed out some places that needed clarification. Yi pointed out 
that I needed to explain the connection between my thesis and the quotations I 
used. Mike got me to use forecasting in the sections to make the organization 
clearer. Except for Sarah’s suggestion that I add another unit of analysis, I used 
all their suggestions. Thanks to them, this essay is stronger than it would have 
been. 
 
Writing Center Acknowledgement 
I visited the Center twice for this essay—once before workshop and once 
afterwards. I am grateful to Writing Center consultant Amanda whose 
suggestions helped me get deeper into Lincoln’s tone. Her repeated questioning 
helped me discover several of the ideas that I later developed in my Reflection 
section, specifically blah and blah.. I am grateful to Bob for pushing me to say 
explicitly for my readers what I thought was obvious about Lincoln’s ethos. In 
particular, blah and blah. Thanks to them, this essay is stronger than it would 
have been. 
 
 

Postwrite 

 

My Thesis 
•  Lincoln’s “Second Inaugural Address” reveals a complex intertwining of 
situational irony with the ethos of a leader who admits to not 
understanding the ways of God but who is adamant about putting into 
political practice the Christian idea of forgiving one’s enemies.  

 
My Audience 
•  Before they read my essay, my audience probably had some clear ideas 
about the speech since we were all assigned to read it, but I can not 
assume that any of them have analyzed it. Also, since I’m a peer rather 
than an expert in rhetoric or Lincoln, they might be hesitant to accept what 
I say as authorative. 
•  Before they read my essay, my readers’ attitude toward me as rhetor was 
probably based on what I’ve said in class. For instance, blah blah blah 
•  My major strategy for dealing with my audience’s initial attitudes was to 
sound knowledgeable. 
•  Since this essay is a CRA, I doubt my readers were expecting much of 
appeal to their emotions. I think my “Reflection” section, though, might 
have surprised them because blah blah blah 

 
How I used Ethos (Aristotle) 
•  The ethos was trying to project was one of blah blah blah 
•  The strategies I used to enhance my ethos were: 
o  My sagacity by blahing 

 

9

o  My goodwill by blahing 
o  My character by blahing 
o  Blah  
 
How I used Pathos  
•  The specific emotions I was trying to invoke in my audience were blah 
blah 
•  Specifically, I wanted to change their blah into blah-2  
•  To accomplish that, I used the following to appeal to my audience’s 
emotions 
o  Blah 
o  Blah 
o  Blah 
 
How I used Logos 
I  used logos in the following places: 
• 
o  Par. # when I said blah 
o  Par. # when I referred to blah and then blah2 
•  My major types of evidence were blah and yaddy-ya 
 
How I used Style 
• 
I used 3 specific stylistic devices 
o 
In pars. # and # and #, I used blah 
o 
In pars. # and # I used yaddy-ya 
o  Throughout the essay, but most noticeably, I used whatyamacallit 
and thingamajig  

 
 
Note: you should not consider the “blahs,” “thingamajig,” “whatyamacallit” or 
“yaddy-ya” as models for your assignment. I will be talking my Postwrite to you 
as we work our way through the essay in class.
