Excerpts from Aristotle 
 
This online version of Aristotle's Rhetoric (a hypertextual resource compiled by Lee 
Honeycutt) is based on the translation of noted classical scholar W. Rhys Roberts. 

Book I - Chapter 1  

Rhetoric is the counterpart of Dialectic. Both alike are concerned with such things as 
come, more or less, within the general ken of all men and belong to no definite science. 
Accordingly all men make use, more or less, of both; for to a certain extent all men 
attempt to discuss statements and to maintain them, to defend themselves and to attack 
others. Ordinary people do this either at random or through practice and from acquired 
habit. Both ways being possible, the subject can plainly be handled systematically, for it 
is possible to inquire the reason why some speakers succeed through practice and 
others spontaneously; and every one will at once agree that such an inquiry is the 
function of an art.  

. . . 

It is clear, then, that rhetorical study, in its strict sense, is concerned with the modes of 
persuasion. Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully 
persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. The orator's 
demonstration is an enthymeme, and this is, in general, the most effective of the modes 
of persuasion. The enthymeme is a sort of syllogism, and the consideration of 
syllogisms of all kinds, without distinction, is the business of dialectic, either of dialectic 
as a whole or of one of its branches. It follows plainly, therefore, that he who is best able 
to see how and from what elements a syllogism is produced will also be best skilled in 
the enthymeme, when he has further learnt what its subject-matter is and in what 
respects it differs from the syllogism of strict logic. The true and the approximately true 
are apprehended by the same faculty; it may also be noted that men have a sufficient 
natural instinct for what is true, and usually do arrive at the truth. Hence the man who 
makes a good guess at truth is likely to make a good guess at probabilities. 

. . . 

Rhetoric is useful (1) because things that are true and things that are just have a natural 
tendency to prevail over their opposites, so that if the decisions of judges are not what 
they ought to be, the defeat must be due to the speakers themselves, and they must be 
blamed accordingly. Moreover, (2) before some audiences not even the possession of 
the exactest knowledge will make it easy for what we say to produce conviction. For 
argument based on knowledge implies instruction, and there are people whom one 
cannot instruct. Here, then, we must use, as our modes of persuasion and argument, 
notions possessed by everybody, as we observed in the Topics when dealing with the 
way to handle a popular audience. Further, (3) we must be able to employ persuasion, 
just as strict reasoning can be employed, on opposite sides of a question, not in order 
that we may in practice employ it in both ways (for we must not make people believe

what is wrong), but in order that we may see clearly what the facts are, and that, if 
another man argues unfairly, we on our part may be able to confute him. No other of the 
arts draws opposite conclusions: dialectic and rhetoric alone do this. Both these arts 
draw opposite conclusions impartially. Nevertheless, the underlying facts do not lend 
themselves equally well to the contrary views. No; things that are true and things that 
are better are, by their nature, practically always easier to prove and easier to believe 
in. Again, (4) it is absurd to hold that a man ought to be ashamed of being unable to 
defend himself with his limbs, but not of being unable to defend himself with speech and 
reason, when the use of rational speech is more distinctive of a human being than the 
use of his limbs. And if it be objected that one who uses such power of speech unjustly 
might do great harm, that is a charge which may be made in common against all good 
things except virtue, and above all against the things that are most useful, as strength, 
health, wealth, generalship. A man can confer the greatest of benefits by a right use of 
these, and inflict the greatest of injuries by using them wrongly.  

It is clear, then, that rhetoric is not bound up with a single definite class of subjects, but 
is as universal as dialectic; it is clear, also, that it is useful. It is clear, further, that its 
function is not simply to succeed in persuading, but rather to discover the means of 
coming as near such success as the circumstances of each particular case allow. In this 
it resembles all other arts. For example, it is not the function of medicine simply to make 
a man quite healthy, but to put him as far as may be on the road to health; it is possible 
to give excellent treatment even to those who can never enjoy sound health. 
Furthermore, it is plain that it is the function of one and the same art to discern the real 
and the apparent means of persuasion, just as it is the function of dialectic to discern 
the real and the apparent syllogism. What makes a man a "sophist" is not his faculty, 
but his moral purpose. In rhetoric, however, the term "rhetorician" may describe either 
the speaker's knowledge of the art, or his moral purpose. In dialectic it is different: a 
man is a "sophist" because he has a certain kind of moral purpose, a "dialectician" in 
respect, not of his moral purpose, but of his faculty.  

Let us now try to give some account of the systematic principles of Rhetoric itself -- of 
the right method and means of succeeding in the object we set before us. We must 
make as it were a fresh start, and before going further define what rhetoric is. 

Book I - Chapter 2 

Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available 
means of persuasion. This is not a function of any other art. Every other art can instruct 
or persuade about its own particular subject-matter; for instance, medicine about what is 
healthy and unhealthy, geometry about the properties of magnitudes, arithmetic about 
numbers, and the same is true of the other arts and sciences. But rhetoric we look upon 
as the power of observing the means of persuasion on almost any subject presented to 
us; and that is why we say that, in its technical character, it is not concerned with any 
special or definite class of subjects.

Of the modes of persuasion some belong strictly to the art of rhetoric and some do not. 
By the latter I mean such things as are not supplied by the speaker but are there at the 
outset -- witnesses, evidence given under torture, written contracts, and so on. By the 
former I mean such as we can ourselves construct by means of the principles of 
rhetoric. The one kind has merely to be used, the other has to be invented.  

Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. The 
first kind depends on the personal character of the speaker; the second on putting the 
audience into a certain frame of mind; the third on the proof, or apparent proof, provided 
by the words of the speech itself. Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal 
character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. We believe 
good men more fully and more readily than others: this is true generally whatever the 
question is, and absolutely true where exact certainty is impossible and opinions are 
divided. This kind of persuasion, like the others, should be achieved by what the 
speaker says, not by what people think of his character before he begins to speak. It is 
not true, as some writers assume in their treatises on rhetoric, that the personal 
goodness revealed by the speaker contributes nothing to his power of persuasion; on 
the contrary, his character may almost be called the most effective means of persuasion 
he possesses. Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech 
stirs their emotions. Our judgements when we are pleased and friendly are not the 
same as when we are pained and hostile. It is towards producing these effects, as we 
maintain, that present-day writers on rhetoric direct the whole of their efforts. This 
subject shall be treated in detail when we come to speak of the emotions. Thirdly, 
persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an 
apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.  

There are, then, these three means of effecting persuasion. The man who is to be in 
command of them must, it is clear, be able (1) to reason logically, (2) to understand 
human character and goodness in their various forms, and (3) to understand the 
emotions-that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in 
which they are excited. It thus appears that rhetoric is an offshoot of dialectic and also 
of ethical studies. Ethical studies may fairly be called political; and for this reason 
rhetoric masquerades as political science, and the professors of it as political experts-
sometimes from want of education, sometimes from ostentation, sometimes owing to 
other human failings. As a matter of fact, it is a branch of dialectic and similar to it, as 
we said at the outset. Neither rhetoric nor dialectic is the scientific study of any one 
separate subject: both are faculties for providing arguments. This is perhaps a sufficient 
account of their scope and of how they are related to each other.  

. . . 

A statement is persuasive and credible either because it is directly self-evident or 
because it appears to be proved from other statements that are so. In either case it is 
persuasive because there is somebody whom it persuades. But none of the arts 
theorize about individual cases. Medicine, for instance, does not theorize about what 
will help to cure Socrates or Callias, but only about what will help to cure any or all of a

given class of patients: this alone is business: individual cases are so infinitely various 
that no systematic knowledge of them is possible. In the same way the theory of rhetoric 
is concerned not with what seems probable to a given individual like Socrates or 
Hippias, but with what seems probable to men of a given type; and this is true of 
dialectic also. Dialectic does not construct its syllogisms out of any haphazard materials, 
such as the fancies of crazy people, but out of materials that call for discussion; and 
rhetoric, too, draws upon the regular subjects of debate. [1357a] The duty of rhetoric is 
to deal with such matters as we deliberate upon without arts or systems to guide us, in 
the hearing of persons who cannot take in at a glance a complicated argument, or follow 
a long chain of reasoning. The subjects of our deliberation are such as seem to present 
us with alternative possibilities: about things that could not have been, and cannot now 
or in the future be, other than they are, nobody who takes them to be of this nature 
wastes his time in deliberation.  

Book I - Chapter 3 

Rhetoric falls into three divisions, determined by the three classes of listeners to 
speeches. For of the three elements in speech-making -- speaker, subject, and person 
addressed -- it is the last one, the hearer, that determines the speech's end and object. 
[1358b] The hearer must be either a judge, with a decision to make about things past or 
future, or an observer. A member of the assembly decides about future events, a 
juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator's skill are 
observers. From this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory-(1) political, (2) 
forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display.  

Political speaking urges us either to do or not to do something: one of these two 
courses is always taken by private counsellors, as well as by men who address public 
assemblies. Forensic speaking either attacks or defends somebody: one or other of 
these two things must always be done by the parties in a case. The ceremonial oratory 
of display either praises or censures somebody. These three kinds of rhetoric refer to 
three different kinds of time. The political orator is concerned with the future: it is about 
things to be done hereafter that he advises, for or against. The party in a case at law is 
concerned with the past; one man accuses the other, and the other defends himself, 
with reference to things already done. The ceremonial orator is, properly speaking, 
concerned with the present, since all men praise or blame in view of the state of things 
existing at the time, though they often find it useful also to recall the past and to make 
guesses at the future.  

Rhetoric has three distinct ends in view, one for each of its three kinds. The political 
orator aims at establishing the expediency or the harmfulness of a proposed course of 
action; if he urges its acceptance, he does so on the ground that it will do good; if he 
urges its rejection, he does so on the ground that it will do harm; and all other points, 
such as whether the proposal is just or unjust, honourable or dishonourable, he brings 
in as subsidiary and relative to this main consideration. Parties in a law-case aim at 
establishing the justice or injustice of some action, and they too bring in all other points 
as subsidiary and relative to this one. Those who praise or attack a man aim at proving

him worthy of honour or the reverse, and they too treat all other considerations with 
reference to this one.
