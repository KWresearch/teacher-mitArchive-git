How New Technology and Ideas Could Have Led to  
Shorter Work Days for Low Income Earners 

 
 
 

The time period from 1890-1991 saw a huge shift in the length of work day vs. 

wage for workers in the United States (Costa, 2000).  In 1890, low income earners 

worked longer days than high income workers and by 1991, these two groups had 

switched positions.  Costa presents several arguments for this phenomenon, including 

increased coordination of work activities within and across firms and a labor supply 

response in which workers take a shorter workday because income effects were larger 

than substitution effects.  In this paper, I will look at one reason why this labor supply 

response was higher for people earning lower incomes than it was for people with high 

incomes. 

 

Over the last century, the ways in which Americans spend their leisure time has 

changed drastically.  Most of this change is technological based change that has been a 

result of mass produced consumer goods.  Some of it comes from new ideas such as new 

sports, music, and dances.  These consumer goods have been widely available to people 

across all incomes.  This paper is based on the assumption that in 1890, the leisure 

available required more money and therefore was biased more towards high income 

people. 

 

We see the trend of more widely available leisure in the graph in figure 1.  

Between 1900 and 1970, the share of income spent on non-necessities in the US 

increased from 20% to 50%.  This increase was likely a result of the combination of

necessities.

To understand how the changing prices of consumer goods can affect labor 

supply, we look at a simple labor supply model.  Consider a model where consumption is 

based on total income

where c is consumption, w is wage, l is hours worked, and i is income not associated with

labor.  Plugging this boundary condition into the Slutsky equation, we get:

The left side of the equation is the change in work hours with a change in wage.  The first

term on the right is the change in work hours with a change in wage holding utility 

constant.  This is the substitution effect.  The second term on the right side of the 

equation is the change in work hours given a change in non labor income.  This is the 

income effect.  As wage goes up, working hours go up in the substitution effect and as 

non labor income goes up, working hours go down in the income effect.  Thus the 

substitution effect is positive and the income effect is negative. 

 

We will consider a change in the availability and price of consumption goods 

equivalent to an increase in non labor income.  Consumers feel richer, but not as a direct 

result of increased wage or longer work hours.  According to this equation, if non-labor 

income increases, the number of hours worked will decrease.  Thus we expect that if the 

price of consumption goods drops, people will end up working less and spend more time 

on leisure.  However, if wage alone increases, then we would expect in to see workers 

work more hours.  The increase in wage and decrease in working hours over the last

hundred years therefore points to an income effect dominated the substitution effect in 

the Slutsky equation. 

 

The Morris County Library provides data on different the prices of different 

recreation and amusement goods from 1900 to 2009.  We can assume that most 

recreational goods advertised for in a newspaper are goods that are supposed to appeal to 

the mass public.  In 1900, the advertised recreation and amusements are camera products 

and a meal ticket at a restaurant.  It is difficult to imagine someone running home from 

work to use his camera.  In 1920, we see that there are more amusements available to the 

general public, including movies, dancing, and music.  Going through the century, we see 

that more and more consumer goods become available, including televisions, sports, and 

most recently, video games, ipods, and sophisticated home entertainment.

The conclusion that more widely available leisure goods led to lower income 

earners working fewer hours than higher income earners is based on the assumption that 

in 1900, most leisure goods were only available to the rich and therefore were not 

advertised in the newspaper.  These leisure goods could have included activities such as 

 

6

hunting, horseback riding, and human chess sets, activities that required a lot of capital 

and also took up time (preventing the rich from working more).  It must be noted that the 

conclusions reached in this paper do not necessarily provide a causal relationship 

between working hours and the availability of consumption goods.  To find such a 

relationship, more rigorous consumption data and statistical analysis would be necessary.
