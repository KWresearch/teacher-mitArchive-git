***** Description *****
This course is a survey of world economic history,Â and itÂ introduces
economics students to the subject matter and methodology of economic history.
It is designed to expand the range of empirical settings in students' research
by drawing upon historical material and long-run data. Topics are chosen to
show a wide variety of historical experience and illuminate the process of
industrialization. The emphasis will be on questions related to labor markets
and economic growth.
***** Prerequisites *****
The prerequisites are 14.04 Intermediate Microeconomic Theory and 14.06
Advanced Macroeconomics .
***** Organization *****
The class will be organized around a discussion of assigned readings; thus,Â it
is essential that the readings be completed by the date indicated on the
reading list. In addition to discussion of the readings, classes will include a
discussion of students' research ideas and/or interesting research questions
and how one might go about addressing those questions. Students are encouraged
to attend the Harvard Economic History Workshop and/or the Harvard Economic
History Tea. If there is enough attendance, we may discuss the papers presented
there.
Requirements are participation in class discussions, two short research
proposals (detailing the question, setting/data, and methodology) and two oral
presentations. The first research proposal is due by Ses #12. The first oral
presentation will be on Ses #13. The second proposal is due 1 week prior to the
final oral presentations, which are going to be scheduled in the last weeks of
class.
