WEEK 9 INTRODUCTION TO READING 

Karl Marx, excerpt from Capital, Vol. 1 (1867) 

Born in 1818 to a middle-class family in the city of
Trier, in the western part of the German Confederation,
Marx studied law, philosophy, and history at the
universities of Bonn and Berlin.  At first, the young Marx
hoped to secure a professorship, but he abandoned this idea
in the 1840s.  Instead, he began writing articles for
newspapers of the political opposition in Germany and in
France.  During this early period, he developed a
materialist analysis of history that stressed the
importance of systems of economic production in determining
the shape of societies.  In 1848, when revolutions swept
across Europe, Marx and his lifelong collaborator Friedrich
Engels published the Communist Manifesto, the most
accessible of Marx’s writings.  After the failure of those 
revolutions, Marx and Engels continued to develop a
revolutionary economic and social analysis of their
capitalist societies.  Both lived in political exile in
England.  Both also played leading roles in founding
international socialist organizations of workers.  In 
Capital, arguably Marx’s greatest work, he set out to
analyze in depth the origins and workings of the capitalist
economic and social system.  Marx died in London in 1883. 

Iwasaki Yataro, “Letter to Mitsubishi Employees” (1876) 

Iwasaki Yataro was born in 1835, the son of a poor
farmer.  In the mid-1860s, he was employed as an
administrator for the aristocratic Tosa family.  The Tosa 
family was heavily indebted as a result of its massive
buildup of military supplies in the preceding years, but
the family also owned substantial business assets.  In 
settling the family’s debts, Iwasaki arranged for the
family to liquidate assets by transferring to him the
ownership of eleven steamships and the family’s business
interests in silk, coal-mining, tea, and lumber.  Thus 
began the Mitsubishi Company. 

One of Iwasaki’s early successes was in controlling
the transportation of goods along the Japanese coast.  The 
following letter was written to employees in his steamship
company after he had cut fares by one half and wages by one
third. 
WEEK 9  QUESTIONS 

Karl Marx, excerpt from Capital, Vol. 1 (1867) 

1.  What is a commodity?  (There are a number of answers to
this question throughout the reading.) 
2.  Is every useful thing a commodity, according to Marx? 
3.  What is a use-value? 
4.  What is exchange-value? 
5.  On p. 45, Marx writes:  “A use-value, or useful
article, therefore, has value only because human labour in
the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it.”  In 
this sentence, does the “value” following “therefore” mean
“use-value” or “exchange-value”? 
6.  Why does Marx emphasize that “labour time” must be
understood as that amount which is “socially necessary”? 
7.  What does Marx mean by the “fetishism of commodities”? 
8.  Look up “fetish” in the Oxford English Dictionary. 
What is the historical meaning of the word? 
9.  What difference does it make when labor is “social” 
instead of “individual” (like Robinson Crusoe’s)?

10.  Iwasaki promotes “singleness of heart” between himself
and his employees.  On what basis does he claim this unity
with his employees? 

11.  Iwasaki encourages those he addresses to think about
the national interest.  Who is served by this conception of
the national interest?
