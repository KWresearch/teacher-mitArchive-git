WEEK 12 INTRODUCTION TO READINGS 

W.E.B. DuBois, “The Concept of Race” (1940) and “The
Damnation of Women” (1920). 

William Edward Burghardt DuBois was born in 1868 in
Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He attended Fisk
University in Nashville, Tennessee, then Harvard
University. He wrote a Ph.D. thesis on the impact of the
Haitian Revolution on the antislavery movement in the
United States, and in 1895 became the first African-
American to take a doctorate there. As a public figure
early in the twentieth century, DuBois advocated full and
immediate racial equality. He therefore opposed the ideas
of Booker T. Washington (the founding director of the
Tuskegee Institute), who argued that African-Americans
should not seek political and social equality until after
“improving” their own condition and gaining economic
independence. In 1909, DuBois co-founded the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
DuBois edited the NAACP magazine, The Crisis, until 1932.
DuBois’s best-known work is probably The Souls of Black
Folk (1903), a collection of essays which eloquently
records both the cruelties of white racism and the 
resistance of African-Americans to it. DuBois died in Ghana 
in 1963.
