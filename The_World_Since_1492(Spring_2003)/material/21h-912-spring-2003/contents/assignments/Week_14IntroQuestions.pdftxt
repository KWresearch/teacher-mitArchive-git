Week 14 
Introduction to Reading 
Patrick Buchanan, excerpt from Death of the West (2002) 
Although during his 1992, 1996, and 2000 runs for the
presidency conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan touted
himself as an “outsider”, he has lived and worked in
Washington, DC nearly all of his life—-for three
presidents, as well as for the media. He has gotten a great
deal of attention for his “America first” views,
challenging trade, immigration, and foreign policy. He has
been accused of racism, fascism, and anti-semitism by his
critics-—you can judge for yourselves. Last year as I was
gathering materials for teaching 21H.912, Buchanan was on
the talk-show circuit promoting this book, which seemed to
challenge my approach to history. Therefore, it seemed a
logical conclusion to the semester. For more information on
Buchanan, you can visit www.theamericancause.org or 
www.buchanan.org to see the archives from his last 
presidential run.
