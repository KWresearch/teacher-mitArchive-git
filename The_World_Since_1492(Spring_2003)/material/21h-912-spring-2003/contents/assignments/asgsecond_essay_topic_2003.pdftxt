--Remember that your three essays have to add up to 20 pages. 

--This essay question asks you to draw on lectures and on Locke, but ONLY the assigned sections of Locke.  Do not 
seek out secondary scholarship on Locke.  You will receive absolutely no credit for any reference to other 
scholarship on Locke.  Make sure you answer all parts of the actual questions posed. 

--I've divided the question up into the four parts for easier reading, but your essay should be an integrated essay, not 
individual answers to each part. 

--If you can work in any key terms, please do so. 

The second essay topic is: 

Locke holds that the earth’s resources were, at the beginning of human existence, the common 
property of all.  At the same time, he argues that private ownership can be just, fair, and 
legitimate.  Explain Locke’s account of the formation of legitimate private property.  In other 
words, how is it, according to Locke, that a person’s ownership of something can be fair and 
just? 

In explaining Locke’s account of legitimate ownership, be sure to consider and discuss both the 
ownership of land and the ownership of persons.  How, according to Locke, is it possible for a 
person to own land legitimately?  How, according to Locke, is it possible for a person to own 
another person legitimately? 

In what ways are Locke’s ideas about legitimate ownership of property consistent with the 
perspective and interests of Anglo settlers in New England? 

In what ways are Locke’s ideas about legitimate ownership of property consistent with the 
perspective and interests of the emergent bourgeoisie in England?
