WEEK 11 INTRODUCTION TO READINGS 

Ivan Turgenev, excerpt from Fathers and Sons, Chs. 1-10
(original Russian edition 1861; this translation 1867) 

Ivan Turgenev was born in 1818 to a landowning family
in Russia. He later recalled the family estate as exemplary
of an unjust social system, recalling for example that his
grandmother had once lost her temper and killed a young boy
serf by smothering him with a pillow. Turgenev studied at
the University of Berlin and became a critic of Tsarist
Russia. From 1850 onward he published fiction that was
widely read. (Incidentally, the young Lenin loved to read
Turgenev, including Fathers and Sons).
In this novel, Turgenev explored the dilemma of
Russian intellectuals regarding how to modernize Russian
society. Contemporary debates arising from the “problem of
backwardness” concerned every realm of social life, from
sexuality to technological and economic development. There
were many factions in the debates; two were the
“Slavophiles” and the “Westernizers.” Both confronted the
issue of how to react to the greater technological and
productive power of states to the west of Russia. While the
Slavophiles advocated, for example, a political formation
of “democratic autocracy” that drew, they claimed, upon a
distinctively Russian past, Westernizers proposed to borrow
Western ideas and create a synthesis of Russian and Western
ways. “Nihilism” was the term given to some adherents of
the latter faction—a term which itself suggests the
complexity of efforts to transform Russian thought and
life. 
Because his writing was often critical of serfdom,
Turgenev was arrested in 1852 and imprisoned for one and
one-half years. After Fathers and Sons was published, the
harassment of Turgenev was so great that he left Russia to
live in Germany for most of the rest of his life. He died
in Paris in 1883. 

Vera Figner, excerpt from memoirs 

Vera Figner was one of thousands of Russians who
became involved in revolutionary populism from the 1870s
onward. About 15% of those arrested for such activities 
were women. The emancipation of serfs in 1861 had not
solved the crisis of agrarian life in Russia, because the
former serfs still often lacked title to any, or sufficient
land, and they were still under the control of their former
landlords. As a result, peasant revolts continued the older
pattern of serf revolts. Populists believed that the
peasants were not only unjustly oppressed, but also that
they, the peasants, held the key to the revolutionary
transformation of Russia. There were many groups in Russian
radical politics of those years; Figner was part of one
called “People’s Will,” a group which carried out the
assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881. In the 1920s,
her memoirs were published in English as Memoirs of a
Revolutionist; this excerpt comes from another
autobiographical manuscript.
