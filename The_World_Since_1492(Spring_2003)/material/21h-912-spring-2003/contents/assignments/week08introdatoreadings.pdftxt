Note: The quality of some of these copies is poor, due to
faulty film exposure in the microfiches from which these
were made. The original volumes were not available. Just
read as much as you can. 

In response to labor protest and to middle-class
demands for reform, various parliamentary committees
investigated the working and living conditions of British
workers in the first half of the nineteenth century. The
proceedings of the committees, particularly those relating
to child labor, shocked the British middle classes. In 1833
and 1842, parliamentary acts placed restrictions on the use 

of child and female labor for the first time in British 
history. The laws of 1833 restricted the number of hours
women and children could spend at work in textile mills,
and the 1842 laws prohibited women and boys (defined as
males under the age of thirteen) from working underground
in coal mines. The laws did not improve working conditions
substantially. 

William Blake, “Chimney Sweeper,” “London,” “The Human
Abstract,” all from Songs of Experience (1794) 

Born in 1757, Blake’s father was a London shopkeeper.
As a poet and painter, Blake had intermittent commercial
success in his own lifetime. Posthumously, Blake has had
great critical success, and today most college surveys of
English literature include some of his works. 
The Songs of Experience were written to accompany an
earlier collection, the Songs of Innocence. As in the case 
of another collection, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (ca.
1789-1790), Blake’s poems were created in the form of hand-
colored etchings.
