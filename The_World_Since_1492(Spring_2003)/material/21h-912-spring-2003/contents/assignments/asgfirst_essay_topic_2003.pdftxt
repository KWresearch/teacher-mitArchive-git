Week 1 

First essay topic 

Like all HASS-D’s, this class requires at least 20 pages of revisable writing. 

Since the purpose of the requirement is to improve writing skills, the focus for these essays will 
not be recall of lecture material, but rather an open-ended exploration of the particular readings 
assigned. 

Write carefully. It is boring to be corrected about things you already know. Wherever you are as 
a writer, that is where we will start. The goal is improvement over the course of the semester. 

In your e-reserves, you will find weekly study questions on each of the assigned readings. These 
questions are not the same as the assigned essay topics. However, if it is appropriate you can 
work parts of your weekly responses to those study questions into your essays. 

The topic for the first essay is: 

Many works of fiction use the device of the “unreliable narrator.” The reader realizes during the 
narrative that the narrator’s version of reality is not necessarily accurate. 

This reading (by an unnamed author) is not a work of fiction. Yet are we also dealing here with 
an “unreliable narrator”? Why do you think so? If so, how does that affect what you learn from 
this text?
