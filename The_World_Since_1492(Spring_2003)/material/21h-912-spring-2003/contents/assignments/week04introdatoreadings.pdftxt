WEEK 4 INTRODUCTION TO READINGS 

Documents on witchcraft persecutions (1486-1631) 

Between about 1560 and about 1670, witch-hunts were
common throughout Christian countries, in Catholic and
Protestant communities alike. They have been studied in
terms of religious change during the Reformation and
Counter-Reformation; the spread of state authority into
remote local areas; tensions within local communities;
changes in thinking about the place of women in society;
and new ways of thinking about the place of the poor in
society, which in turn led to new conflicts between rich
and poor. 
In the Holy Roman Empire alone, there were 30,000
trials between 1560 and 1670. And in the area we now call 
Europe, about 100,000 people were put on trial for
witchcraft, of which about 30,000 were executed. 
While reading the following selections, keep in mind
possible distinctions between what townspeople or peasants
thought they were doing when they practiced or accused
others of practicing witchcraft, and what state authorities
thought they were doing. Historian Richard Horsley has
argued: “Left to themselves, the peasants may well have
lynched a few suspects—such as the two Austrian women
burned for ‘causing’ a hail storm in 1675—but they would
never have produced the great witch hunts in which hundreds
of thousands were burned.”1
