WEEK 1 INTRODUCTION TO READINGS 

Nzinga Mbemba (Affonso I), “Letters to the King of
Portugal” (1526) 

When Portuguese navigators and explorers reached
central West Africa in the 1480s, the Kingdom of Kongo, was
ruled by King Nzinga a Kuwu. In 1491, he and his heir,
Nzinga Mbemba, were baptized as Catholics. Mbemba, who
received the Christian name Affonso, succeeded his father
in 1506 and ruled for nearly three decades as Affonso I.
His own son, Henrique, was educated in Portugal and became
the first West African bishop in the Roman Catholic Church.
However, by the end of the sixteenth century, the Church
held that only whites were fit to hold priestly offices.
Under Affonso’s rule, the Kongo kingdom was open to trade
in firearms, horses, and cattle from Christendom, as well
as new food items from the Americas. In this case, openness
to the world led not to prosperity, but to political
disintegration and disorder. In 1526, Affonso wrote the
following letters to King João III of Portugal, in an
attempt to modify and ameliorate the relationship of the
Portuguese to his kingdom.

WEEK 1 QUESTIONS 

Nzinga Mbemba (Affonso I) 

1. What does the word “factor” mean as used in King
Affonso’s letters? (Note: the dictionary you have at hand
may or may not have the definition of “factor” that fits
this text. The best dictionary of the English language is
probably the Oxford English Dictionary, and it is
especially useful for learning about archaic meanings of 

words found in historical documents, such as this one. It
is available on the MIT Libraries website: Resources -> 
Virtual Reference Collection -> Dictionaries -> OED). 
2. On what ground or grounds does King Affonso object to
slavery? Would you object to slavery on the same grounds?
