was to confirm or refute allegations of atrocities by the

What kinds of evidence does Casement use to verify the

2. What activities of this Anglo-Peruvian rubber consortium
appear to be contrary to economic rationality? 
3. How does Casement explain these activities? 
4. Casement provides accounts of erratic—if not absurd—

5. What do you the “payments” and “advances” may have meant
