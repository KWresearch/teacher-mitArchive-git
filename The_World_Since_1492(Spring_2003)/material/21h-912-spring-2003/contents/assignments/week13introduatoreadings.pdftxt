WEEK 13 INTRODUCTION TO READINGS 

V. I. Lenin, excerpts from “The Immediate Tasks of the
Soviet Government” 

Vladimir Ilyich Ulianov was born in 1870 in Sembirsk.
His father was a successful physics and mathematics teacher
who was descended from serfs; his mother was descended from
German bourgeois. He took the pen name of Lenin in 1901.
From the late 1880s, while a law student at the University
of Kazan, Lenin became involved in illegal student groups
(in fact, all student groups at the time were illegal) that
engaged in revolutionary politics based on Russian radical
traditions. From about 1892, he became in interested in
Marxism. Lenin spent two periods in prison, then lived in
exile in Switzerland until 1917. 
In February 1917, the Tsar was deposed during the
first phase of the Russian Revolution, which emerged from
broad-based opposition to the hardships of the First World
War in Russia as well as older grievances. In April 1917,
Lenin returned to Russia, traveling in a sealed train
across Germany (Russia’s opponent in the First World War)
by special agreement with the German army high command. He
immediately became involved in the ongoing revolution, and
in November (October by eastern calendar used in Russia)
1917, his party, the Bolsheviks, seized control of the
revolution and established the Soviet (“council”) state.
Lenin withdrew Soviet Russia (which was renamed the “Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics,” USSR, in the 1920s) from
the First World War, but the country was soon embroiled in
a civil war, which the Bolsheviks won within a couple of
years. Lenin was disabled by a series of strokes and died
in 1924. 

Miklós Haraszti, excerpts from A Worker in a Worker’s State
and “The Culture of Censorship” 

Miklós Haraszti was born in 1945 in Jerusalem, where
his parents lived as refugees from Nazism. His parents were
Communists who returned to Hungary in 1948. The next year,
a state socialist government was established in Hungary and 

remained until 1988/1989. As a student in the 1960s,
Haraszti organized a group in support of North Vietnam in
the Vietnam War. This led to his expulsion from the
university at Budapest. He began a series of odd jobs while
writing poems and short pieces. In 1968, he was placed
under police surveillance on suspicion of Maoist
sympathies. He continued to write satirical and other
critical pieces, and he was arrested in 1970 and placed
again under police surveillance. During this time he took a
job at the Red Star Tractor Factory, which he describes in
A Worker in a Worker’s State. He argued that, while
capitalism did not exist in Hungary, neither did socialism.
When he and colleagues petitioned against their police
surveillance, he was arrested again in 1971 and went on a
hunger strike. After his release, he finished the
manuscript to A Worker and obtained its acceptance at a
leading social science journal in Hungary. The editor of
the journal lost his job, and Haraszti was arrested in 1973
for incitement against the state. He was jailed, went again
on a hunger strike, and given a suspended sentence and
fine. He remained a dissident, publishing his writings and
editing Beszelő, an opposition journal, as samizdat (“self-
publication,” or underground press).

Miklós Haraszti, excerpts from A Worker in a Worker’s State
(first published in German 1975; this English translation
1977) 

5. What is a “piece rate”? 
6. On the basis of Haraszti’s text, describe how decisions
are made about how high the rates should be and what
supplementary wages should be paid. 
7. According to Haraszti, how does the piece rate system
cheat the worker? 
8. Last spring, the New York Times reported about a factory
in Ohio that operates on piece rates and merit pay.1 The 
article profiled a worker there who has worked weekends,
holidays, and overtime at an exceptionally high pace and
high quality for years. His annual salary exceeds $100,000.
Do you think that the Ohio factory and the experience of
that worker would convince Haraszti that the piece rate
system is not necessarily bad? Why or why not?
