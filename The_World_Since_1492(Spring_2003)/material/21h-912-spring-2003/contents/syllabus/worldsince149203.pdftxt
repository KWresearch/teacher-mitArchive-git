Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
21H.912: The World Since 1492—HASS-D 
Spring, 2003 

Course Description: This course explores the last 500 years of world history. 
Rather than trying to cover all regions for all periods of time, we will focus on four 
related themes: the struggles between Europeans and colonized peoples; the global 
formation of capitalist economies and industrialization; the emergence of modern states; 
and the development of the tastes and disciplines of bourgeois society. 

Course Organization 

Lectures: The general format of this course will be lectures on Mondays and 
Wednesdays, and discussion on Fridays. Since we will not be using a textbook, lectures 
and handouts will serve as your primary source of information about what happened 
when and where since 1492. Thus, regular class attendance and, for most students, 
energetic note-taking are required. I am a firm believer that listening and note-taking are 
important and overlooked skills in the educational experience. For each lecture, I will 
identify a number of key terms, which should help to highlight the most significant 
points of the lecture. These terms, taken cumulatively, are the building blocks of 
important analytical skills. You should be able to give concise and cogent explanations 
for all of key terms, and you will be tested on them. During lecture, you are encouraged 
to ask questions. Remember, my expertise does not cover the entire world, and the class 
as a whole may work together to reach some answers. If you miss a lecture, then you 
need to copy the notes from one of your classmates and arrange a time to go over the 
material. Students who miss more than four class meetings should probably drop the 
course. 

Readings: Rather than a textbook, we will be using an online course reader, managed 
through e-reserves at Hayden Library, which contains a series of primary sources. In a 
nutshell, a primary source is a document, letter, story, etc. that comes from the time 
period under study. Historians use primary sources to compose historical accounts that 
appear in journals, monographs, and surveys. For each week’s assignment, there is an 
introduction to the author/readings and a set of reading questions—you will find these at 
the class website. You are required to answer these questions (typed), and turn them in 
weekly on Wednesday (see below for exceptions). I will return them to you on Friday for 
our discussion. These responses will receive no letter grade, but rather a check (+ or -). I 
will not accept late responses. Finally, there are two books available. 

John Locke, Second Treatise of Government 
• 
•  William Blake, Songs of Experience 

Questions: Given the format of the course and lack of a textbook, you might find that 
you need to contact me outside of class. In addition to my regular office hours, I am 

available by appointment most days of the week. You can also reach me by email, which 
will allow you to get answers more quickly. If your question is such that the entire class 
might benefit from the response, then I will CC it to the entire class. Feel free to mark 
your question as private, and I will not do a mass mailing response. Obviously, questions 
relating to absences, grades, etc. are private matters. 

Course Requirements 

Participation: This component of your grade includes regular class attendance, weekly 
responses, and Friday discussion. Failure to attend class, turn in responses, and/or 
participate in discussion will result in a deduction from your final grade. Students must 
also facilitate discussion at least once during the semester—students will sign up for a 
week after the first week of class. Facilitating discussion is not summarizing the readings. 
Presumably your classmates will have completed all assigned readings and will not want 
to hear a rehash. You should use the weekly questions and supplementary handouts as 
guides for discussion. Facilitators may also want to spend some time discussing current 
events if pertinent to the week’s discussion. Students should bring their reading notes 
and/or readings to class for Friday discussion. With respect to weekly responses, these 
are due every Wednesday, except when a longer written assignment is due, during the last 
week of classes, and one additional week of the student’s choice. Thus, you must turn in 
8 sets of responses by the end of the semester. Participation is the single biggest 
component of your final grade, representing 35%; and it requires vigilant attention. 

Written Assignments: According to the criteria for HASS-D subjects, there should be 
“frequent and substantial writing exercises.” In addition to our weekly responses, you 
will have two take home essays [see below] and one project related to the film series [see 
below]. Each of these assignments will be 6-8 pages (you must have a total of 20 pages). 

Essays: The essays will be based on both readings and lecture, and the questions will be 
distributed the week before they are due. While I encourage students to discuss these 
issues before writing, these essays must be wholly your own work. Students are 
encouraged to rewrite/revise papers. Revisions must be returned, along with the marked 
original and comments, within two weeks of receiving the corrected draft. The two essays 
represent 30% of your final grade. 

Film Project: Students will be required to write a 6-8 page paper in which they compare 
three films [see film series below] and evaluate to what extent they tell about the period 
in which they were made and to what extent they tell about the time period covered by 
the film. Most of the films listed in the film series will be eligible for review. You will 
receive a separate sheet describing this assignment in detail. This project represents 15% 
of your final grade. 

Final Examination: During finals week, you will have an examination that encompasses 
the entire semester’s work. The final will include a map, key terms (see above), some 
short essay questions, and a long essay question. During the last two weeks of class you 

will receive a study guide to help you prepare for the final. All of the sections will have 
some element of choice. The examination will represent 20% of your final grade. 

Semi-Optional Film Series: Students are required to view at least three of the films 
listed on the syllabus. With the exception of Week 2, all of these films will be on reserve 
in the film office during the week that they are suggested. Students in need of extra credit 
may write a one page reaction paper for each film that they view. 

Academic Honesty: While I always encourage collaboration and discussion among my 
students, the work that you submit for this class must be your own. In recent years, the 
history department has been troubled by a range of behaviors that range from the careless 
and ignorant to “first degree” plagiarists. All cases involving such issues will be directed 
to the Committee on Discipline. Please do not put me in this position. Any questions 
regarding plagiarism should be answered by the following link:

questions about issues related to academic honesty, please see Prof. before the 
assignment in question is due.
