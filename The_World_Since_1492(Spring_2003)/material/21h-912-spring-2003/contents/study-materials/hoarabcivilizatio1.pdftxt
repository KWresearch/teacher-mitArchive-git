Arab Civilization 
The Arabs were originally the people of the Arabian desert. Converted to Islam in the 7th 
century A.D., they conquered the Middle East from the Sassanian and Byzantine empires 
and established a succession of Arab-Islamic Middle Eastern empires from Spain to 
Central Asia and from the Caucasus to India. More profoundly, Islam, as well as its laws 
and doctrines, became the universally accepted religion and culture of the Persians, 
Turks, and many other peoples. What is referred to as Arab Civilization is a combination 
of certain classical Arab values [see Arab], Islamic culture and institutions, the inherited 
knowledge of the great civilizations of the Old World, and the unity provided by the 
Arabic language. The Arabs preserved and built upon existing knowledge in the realms of 
government, literature, philosophy, history, art and architecture, music, physical and 
mathematical sciences, biology, medicine, engineering, navigation, and commercial law. 
Although Arab control over Islamic empires proved ephemeral, Islam continued to 
flourish as a religion and civilization of the Middle East. Currently, one fifth of the 
world’s population is Muslim, and Islam has become the second largest religion in both 
Europe and North America. 

Pre-Islamic Arabia 
Arabia was the cradle of Islam and of Arab civilization. In the 6th century A.D., it was a 
region with some sedentary agricultural and commercial life in the south (Yemen) and on 
the borders of Syria and Iraq, but the harsh interior was the domain of camel-raising 
nomads (bedouins). The bedouins were polytheists whose gods did not take the shape of 
humans or animals, but rather were amorphous spirits usually associated with specific 
geographic features, particularly those that gave comfort or shelter such as caves or 
watering holes. Their gods also dwelled in the skies. Additionally, they believed in jinns 
or spirits which could be good or bad and which came to the world in the form of 
animals. The socio-political unit of organization was the tribe [see Arab]. Among the 
various tribes of the peninsula, there were numerous disputes over water and pasturage. 
Culturally, the Arabs relied on poetry as a form of news, entertainment, and history. 

The Arabian peninsula was surrounded by two more advanced civilizations, the 
Byzantine and Sassanian Empires, which were frequently at war with one another. While 
the peninsula was somewhat insulated from the superpower disputes, they were aware of 
military techniques, weapons, material goods, and notions of monotheism emanating 
from spreading settlements, itinerant preachers, and contacts with converted border 
peoples. 

By the 7th century A.D., the most advanced Arab communities were at the oases of 
Mecca and Medina. Mecca was a sanctuary settled in the 5th century A.D. by the Quraysh 
tribe. Its shrine, the kaaba, was a center of pilgrimage and trade for pagans, Christians, 
and Jews. The base of the shrine was a black meteor above which a cabinet-like structure 
was built—according to legend with some connection to Abraham. The kaaba housed a 
number of different idols, but it was mainly associated with the local god of Mecca, 
Hubal. There was also some association with Allah, the god of divinity. Allah was the 
same word used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews to refer to their God. The kaaba 
and the nearby well of Zamzam stimulated the Meccan economy, and a service industry 

developed to cater to the food, housing, and clothing needs of the pilgrims. Medina, a 
town about 200 miles north of Mecca, was an agricultural oasis plagued by feuds 
amongst its tribes, which included both pagans and Jews. 

Arab Empires and Islamic Civilization 

Life and Teachings of Muhammad 
Muhammad was born in Mecca circa 570 A.D. and earned his living in the caravan 
trading business of his wife Khadija. Muhammad was troubled by the disparities among 
certain clans within his tribe and the changes that had taken place in Meccan society with 
the development of its economy. He used to retreat to a cave on Mt. Hira to meditate, and 
during one of these sessions around the year 610, the archangel Gabriel appeared and 
asked Muhammad to recite. After some initial confusion Muhammad found himself 
reciting. Muslims believe that he directly received the word of God. It was only after 
Muhammad’s death that these revelations were organized and recorded in the Quran. The 
earliest verses of the Quran were pithy, ear-catching messages regarding the power and 
goodness of Allah (literally the God), man’s duty to Him, the coming of a Day of 
Judgment, and the role of Muhammad as a prophet. 

Initially Muhammad’s message did not necessarily contradict the pagan belief system nor 
did he attract much attention. The existence of an all-powerful God did not mean that 
there could be no lesser gods. Furthermore, there were numerous itinerant preachers and 
soothsayers spouting various belief systems, including Christianity and Judaism. 
Muhammad’s first followers were members of his own household, but soon the message 
began to appeal to the less influential clans of the Quraysh, the younger generation of 
some of the more powerful clans, slaves, and others, who like Muhammad, were 
disturbed by the social order in Mecca. 

The message of strict monotheism became completely clear after the revelation of the 
“Satanic verses”. Monotheism would threaten not only the social order, but also the 
economy of a city that depended upon pagan pilgrim traffic. Muslims believe that Satan 
deceived Muhammad and he received some verses referring to the intercession of three 
goddesses. Nevertheless, when he recanted the verses, opposition among the powerful 
clans of the Quraysh became intense. In 619 Muhammad suffered two losses, the deaths 
of his wife Khadija and his uncle Abu Talib. This uncle was the leader of his clan 
(Hashim), and Abu Talib had used his position to protect Muhammad. As opposition 
grew among the wealthier clans, notably the Umayyads and the Makhzum, and death 
threats mounted, Muhammad moved his community of believers (umma) to Medina in 
622. This event, the hijra, marks the beginning of the Muslim calendar. 

In Medina, Muhammad used his charisma, wisdom, and belief in God to settle the 
longstanding feuds among the tribes and clans. In the “Constitution of Medina” he 
formed a confederation of his transplanted umma with the city’s tribes, spelling out the 
obligations among them.  Pagans were allowed to remain pagan, but they accepted a 
lesser status than those that converted to Islam or remained Jewish. The revelations that 
Muhammad received at Medina differed from those of the early Meccan period. No 

longer was revelation aimed at converting the non-believer, it articulated a way of life, 
discussing issues e.g. marriage, inheritance, and divorce. By this point revelation more 
clearly expressed Muhammad’s role not only as a prophet, but as the final prophet in a 
series that begin with those of the Old Testament. 

The mid-620s were a time of struggle for Muhammad as he found himself battling both 
the Quraysh of Mecca and the Jews of Medina, the latter of which tired of supporting 
Muhammad’s battles against the former. Ultimately the Jews of Medina were expelled, 
and the powerful Meccans agreed to capitulate and accept Islam. In the process of 
conducting these battles, Muhammad’s leadership skills attracted the attention of 
neighboring tribes, who then converted to Islam and joined the Muslims in their battles. 
Many of these alliances were cemented by marriage. Muhammad even married the 
daughter of his biggest Meccan opponent, Abu Sufyan (of the Umayyad clan), in 629. 

In 630 Muhammad took the keys to the kaaba and cleansed it of its pagan idols, and when 
he returned in 632 he did so during the traditional (pre-Islamic) pilgrimage time and 
established the rituals for pilgrimage that exist to this day. By the time of his death in 632 
virtually all of the tribes of the peninsula had joined Muhammad’s confederation. 
Nevertheless, various levels of commitment to the new religion remained. 

Orthodox Caliphate 
Muhammad’s death in 632 was a test of survival for the Muslims. The powerful among 

the clans of Medina, as well as the earliest followers from Mecca, sought to preserve the  

integrity of the religion and the political bonds of the confederation by electing Abu Bakr 

as a successor (caliph) to Muhammad. There would be no other prophet for the Muslims, 

but there was a need for someone to fill the many functions that Muhammad had served

during his lifetime. Abu Bakr, an early convert, loyal follower, and father-in-law to 

Muhammad, was a logical choice. Some of the tribes refused to accept his leadership and 

stopped paying mandatory alms to the central treasury. Abu Bakr sent loyal Arab troops 

to reign in the rebelling tribes, initiating the so-called Wars of Apostasy. Tribes in flight, 

or seeking compensations for their losses, soon breached both the Iraqi-Sassanian and the 

Syrian-Byzantine frontiers. Abu Bakr encouraged raids into Palestine, where success

emboldened the Arab tribesmen to merge forces and defeat a Byzantine army near Gaza 

in 634. From then on, sporadic incursions became invasions. The immediate causes of the 

Arab conquests were pressures and opportunities generated by wars among the Arabs 

themselves. Religious motives were in the background. The impoverishment and violence 

of life on the peninsula was the tinder for the spark caused by the Wars of Apostasy. 


The Arabs quickly seized the rest of Syria by 641. Egypt was taken in 641-42, but the 

conquest of North Africa, begun in 634, required the remainder of the century. In Iraq the 

armies of the Sassanian Empire were destroyed at the Battle of Qadisiya. Upper 

Mesopotamia was taken by 641, most of western Iran by 644, Fars by 649, and Khurasan 

by 654. Imperial armies were not adequate to check the Arab invaders, and many people 

readily accepted the victors. 

Establishing an orderly government was the work of the second caliph, Umar (634-44). 

Like Abu Bakr, Umar was an early convert, loyal follower, and father-in-law to 


Muhammad. His basic principle was that the Arabs were to be a military ruling caste. 
They were not to settle or mix with the conquered people but were to be garrisoned in all-
Arab cities—some created, some adapted for the purpose—where they could be 
organized for war and the distribution of stipends. The stipends were paid from the 
central treasury according to how early one had converted and what type of service had 
been provided in the name of Islam. Masses of Arabs settled permanently throughout the 
Middle East. According to the “Pact of Umar”, the conquered peoples were left entirely 
undisturbed in their (monotheistic) religion, community life, and property on the 
condition that they pay a tribute. Pagans were not afforded such rights. In return, the 
Arabs offered protection and more reasonable taxes than their predecessors. The rights 
and obligations spelled out in the “Pact of Umar” would remain the model for 
relationships between Islamic governments and minority communities until the 19th 
century. In governing the provinces, the Arabs merely removed the top layer of 
leadership, replacing it from among their own, and they utilized the bureaucrats and 
functionaries that were already in place. These individuals had familiarity with the 
territory and the people that the Arabs lacked. Conversion was not forced, nor even 
encouraged, since it would diminish taxes and blur the line separating the Arab (Muslim) 
military elite. The Middle East was not conquered to spread Islam, but to be ruled by 
Muslims. People did convert to Islam; however, the new Muslims were not treated as 
equals, but rather as clients, or second class citizens, by the conquering Arabs. 

A discontented Christian slave, who reputedly resented the tax levied upon non-Muslims, 
stabbed the caliph Umar in 644. On his death bed, Umar consulted a council of his 
companions and instructed them to choose a successor amongst themselves. It was this 
group that elected Uthman, a son-in-law of Muhammad, caliph. Like the previous 
caliphs, Uthman had been an early convert to Islam and was linked to the prophet by 
marriage. Nevertheless, he was from the Umayyad clan, the wealthy clan which had 
given Muhammad so much trouble during his lifetime. Uthman became the focus of 
much discontent. The pious resented the increasing secularization of the caliphate, as well 
as its forays into military and administrative affairs. Uthman in true clan fashion 
conferred high positions to his kinsmen. In doing so, he often replaced highly capable 
individuals with less qualified ones. Medinans resented this nepotism and his unfair 
distribution of lands. Meanwhile the empire that had expanded so rapidly was 
experiencing growing pains. The Sassanian Empire was not toppled until 651 and pockets 
of resistance remained. Meanwhile, tribesmen in the provinces resented the authority of 
the central administration, its inability to pay wages in a timely fashion, and the decline 
in booty with the slow down of expansion. 

In 656 Uthman’s ineptitude led to his assassination by disgruntled Arab troops that had 
been stationed in Egypt. The assassins declared Ali, Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law, 
caliph. Ali had been passed over for the position three times, and there were many that 
felt that he should not only succeed Uthman, but perhaps he should have been elected 
earlier. The death of Uthman led to a three way struggle for power, culminating in a five 
year civil war. The prophet’s beloved wife Aisha (daughter of Abu Bakr), joined forces 
with two other companions of the prophet, Talha and Zubayr, forming a Triumvirate to 
challenge Ali’s bid for the caliphate. They represented the interests of the old Meccan 

families and early converts to Islam, and they had some support from troops in Iraq. Ali 
and his supporters from among troops stationed in Egypt and, more importantly, Iraq 
easily defeated the Triumvirate. Talha and Zubayr died in battle, and Aisha was sent 
home in disgrace, thus providing later theologians with a justification for why women not 
to become involved in politics. 

Muawiya, the son of Muhammad’s former enemy Abu Sufyan, also refused to recognize 
Ali’s authority on the grounds that he did nothing to avenge the death of his kinsman and 
fellow Umayyad Uthman. Muawiya had risen to power quickly after the Meccan 
capitulation to Muhammad. He served as a secretary to the prophet during the last years 
of his life, and he became governor of Syria in the mid-630s. Thus, he had a longstanding 
power base and seasoned troops under his command, in addition to the power and wealth 
of his clan. In late 657 the forces of Ali met the forces of Muawiya in the battle of Siffin. 
Ali had the advantage of the offensive and of greater numbers, but Muawiya’s troops 
were more disciplined. The result was a long, bloody battle which Ali appeared to be 
winning by early 658. Some of Muawiya’s troops hoisted portions of the Quran on their 
spears, calling for arbitration. Ali’s agreeing to negotiate created yet another group of 
adversaries in the civil war, the Khawarij, those from among Ali’s supporters who did not 
agree with this move and withdrew their support. 

At issue in the negotiations was whether or not the assassination of Uthman was justified. 
If it was, then Ali would clearly be in the right; and if it was not, then there would need to 
be a council called to elect another caliph. By 659 the negotiators took the latter position. 
Meanwhile, the Khawarij had determined that neither candidate should be caliph. Instead, 
it should be up to the members of the community to choose the best man among them. 
They conspired to assassinate both Muawiya and Ali. Ali and his supporters were 
successful in hunting down all but a handful of the Khawarij, and it was one from this 
group, who managed to assassinate Ali in 661. This turn of events left the caliphate open 
for Muawiya, who had already anointed himself as caliph the previous year. Muawiya 
moved the capital to Damascus, marginalizing the formerly prominent Mecca and 
Medina. This move reflected his power base, as well as his military and commercial 
interests. 

While the origins of the various sects of Islam date back to this period, it is important to 
remember that at the time that the events were taking place there were no doctrinal 
differences among the participants, but rather people supported one candidate over 
another one. Over the next two hundred years, this split would become permanent, 
involving serious doctrinal differences and views of religious authority. Sunnis (from ahl 
al-sunna or those who follow the tradition of the prophet) accept the consequences of 
succession and this civil war (and others that followed), and they later develop the notion 
that religious authority would rest in the hands of the caliph, who was advised and 
informed by a consensus of leading religious authorities. Shiites (from shicat Ali or 
partisans of Ali), believe in the existence of charismatic leadership following the blood 
line of Ali and his descendents. Rather than depending upon a consensus of scholarly 
opinion, Shiites value particular individuals whose talent for interpretation is notable. As 
Shiism evolved, it became necessary to create some type of ranking for interpreters of 

law (mujtahids). Mujtahids strive to achieve the status of “source of emulation,” a title 
known more commonly in the past one hundred years as “the eye of God” or ayatollah. 
Finally, the Khawarij believe that authority should rest with the most capable and should 
have nothing to do with blood lines or lineage. In the years after its inception, Kharijism 
never coalesced into unified movement, and its most lasting impact was on North Africa. 

Umayyad Dynasty 
Muawiya’s reign (661-680) marks the beginning of the Umayyad dynasty, sometimes 
referred to as the Arab Kingdom due to the prominent role played by Arabs. Umayyad 
rule also marks the beginning of the hereditary principle for the caliphate, a principle that 
would remain until the dissolution of the caliphate in 1924. It should be noted, however, 
that although the first four caliphs followed an elective principle, it was a rather narrow 
group that participated in the election. 

Muawiya’s leadership represented an amalgam between Byzantine and traditional Arab 
elements, and it built upon the success that he had established as governor. He secured 
his son Yazid’s place as caliph, a move which he nonetheless buttressed with an oath of 
allegiance from the leading tribes. 

Despite these efforts a second civil war broke out between 680 and 692. Yazid (r.680-
683) did succeed his father, but not without opposition from the next generation of the 
same groups that had opposed his father. Husayn, the son of Ali and Muhammad’s 
daughter Fatima, had quite a following in Iraq and posed a formidable challenge. 
Nevertheless, due to circumstances beyond his control, he was left with only 72 warriors 
to fight Yazid’s army, and a horrible massacre took place at Karbala in 680. Shiites 
commemorate this day every year as a day of mourning when Husayn and a number of 
other members of the prophet’s family were killed. It is during this era that Shiism brings 
together not only those who support Ali and his descendents for the caliphate, but also 
those who are disgusted with Arab privilege, in general, and Umayyad privilege, in 
particular. Thus, many non-Arab converts to Islam were attracted to Shiism for this 
reason. 

The other contender for power was Zubayr’s son Abdullah, who had a following in the 
Hejaz (Western Arabia) as well as by some in Iraq after Karbala. As these battles were 
raging, the Umayyads had some dynastic misfortunes with the death of three caliphs by 
natural causes between 683 and 685, when Abd al-Malik (r. 685-705) became caliph. 
Furthermore, another Shiite contender entered the fray, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, the 
son of Ali by another woman (not Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad). Abdullah’s 
forces put down the Shiite threat, which aided the Umayyad forces as much as it did his 
own. By 692 Abd al-Malik could focus on the Hejaz, where his forces quelled the 
uprising, slew Abdullah, and ended the second civil war. 

The civil war episode was a turning point in the history of the caliphate. Caliphs from 
Abd al-Malik to Hisham (r. 724-743) generally relied less on the Arabs and built up the 
powers of the state and the forces of Syria. Administrative centralization began in 
earnest. The Arab conquests were resumed. Spain, Transoxiana (roughly present day 

Uzbekistan), and the Byzantine Empire were all invaded. The translation of 
administrative records into Arabic, the minting of a new Arabic coinage, and monumental 
constructions, e.g. the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, dramatized the prestige of the 
caliphate and its services to Islam and the Arabs. 

Despite this centralization of power, tribal disputes remained a latent threat to the 
stability of the caliphate. In addition, the gradual assimilation of the Arabs and their 
subjects to one another undercut the basic principles of Umayyad government. Arabs 
became landowners, merchants, and peasants. Non-Arabs converted to Islam in larger 
numbers, becoming clients of the Arabs in the garrison towns. These converts began to 
demand equality in pay and equal fiscal privilege. Their claims, which were vehemently 
opposed by the Arabs, could not be ignored. Converts played a vital part in 
administration and an increasing role in the Arab armies, as well as in religious and 
cultural life. Again it should be emphasized that what made Arab civilization great was 
its ability to draw on the talents of its subject population. Nevertheless, the caliphate was 
trapped between conflicting demands from different segments of its supporters. 

Umar II (r. 717-720) sought to resolve these difficulties by embodying the principle of 
equality of all Muslims in reforms that stressed equal pay for military service and tax 
reforms that made land and property, rather than caste, the basis of fiscal obligations. 
Later caliphs made similar reforms, but they were only halfhearted and were obstructed 
by local Arab and bureaucratic interests. 

Compounding problems for the Umayyads was the rise of a truly devout umma. During 
Muhammad’s lifetime and the early expansion, many followers were more attracted by 
military success rather than by the principles of the religion. Nevertheless, after the 
passage of three or four generations of Islamic rule, many individuals in the empire grew 
up following, adhering to, and firmly believing in the principles of Islam. The Umayyads, 
known for their wine drinking, hunting retreats, dancing girls, and so on, did little to 
impress their pious subjects. Their strategy of external conquest to stifle internal 
problems was a short-sighted solution to much larger structural problems. 

The grievances of both Arabs and non-Arabs with the caliphate were exploited by the 
Abbasid family, which claimed a legitimate title to the caliphate as descendents of the 
prophet’s uncle Abbas. They used Shiism to further their aims, claiming that the family 
of Muhammad ibn Hanifiyya had bestowed leadership to them, and that they had been 
carrying on the secret movement for several decades. The Umayyads were exhausted by 
years of external military efforts in Anatolia, Central Asia, North Africa, and 
Southwestern Europe. Internally, they were sucked into renewed tribal disputes, bedouin 
rebellions, Shiite revolts, and Khawarij outbursts. Thus by 749 Umayyad power had 
effectively collapsed, and the Abbasids easily removed them from power. Abul-Abbas al-
Saffah was then declared the first caliph of a dynasty that was to rule for the next 500 
years (750-1258). 

Abbasid Caliphate—Golden Age of Arab Civilization 

The new Abbasid dynasty enacted a revolution in the Arab Empire. The Abbasids 
accepted the equality of all Muslims, and privilege was no longer based upon Arab blood 
but on service to Islam and the empire. Not surprisingly, there were widespread 
conversions during this period. Although the Abbasids embraced Shiite sentiment in 
bringing down the Umayyads, once in power they turned to more orthodox elements to 
run the administration. Indeed the caliphate now made defense of Islam a state priority 
and attempted to stamp out all vestiges of heresy. The Abbasids showed much more 
compassion to its Christian, Zoroastrian, and Jewish communities, which were allowed to 
thrive and in fact had a strong influence on the development of Islam. Arabic, the official 
language of the empire, was the language of religion and government. Although many in 
the subject population retained their language, e.g. the Persians, the literate, urban 
population was often bilingual. 

In Abbasid government the Arabs had to share power and privilege with non-Arabs, and 
the caliphate no longer relied upon a solely Arab army. Arabs remained important as 
governors, generals, courtiers, and in religious life, but Persian scribes were the backbone 
of an enormously strengthened bureaucracy. While the Umayyads followed Byzantine 
tradition, the Abbasids followed Persian models of leadership. The Barmecid (Barmakid) 
family of viziers (chief ministers) headed the government from about 750 to 803. In some 
of the provinces the caliphs appointed their own governors, but in others, local princes 
and notables continued to rule as vassals or tributaries. The empire was not rigidly 
organized; it adjusted flexibly to the realities of power in all provinces. The ultimate 
objective of government organization was taxation, and on the local level, government 
staffs, with assistance from local notables, taxed the peasants. Abbasid government was 
thus based upon the support of Arab populations and elites, the administrative classes, 
landowning and local ruling notabilities of every race and religion, the commercial 
classes who benefited from territorial unification, and finally, on the culama’ , the 
religious establishment. The vast empire was connected by an updated version of the old 
Persian postal system. To compare it with some institutions from American history, it 
combined a pony express system with an FBI/CIA type of intelligence gathering network. 
The Abbasids also utilized a system of flares and mirrors, creating a pre-modern 
telegraph network. In the ninth century a message could travel from Baghdad to Tunis in 
24 hours. It would be another 1000 years before this method could be surpassed. 

The Abbasids were great architects and city builders, the most noteworthy being their 
new capital, Baghdad, constructed during the reign of al-Mansur (r. 754-775). The 
location of the capital on the Tigris river where it flows closest to the Euphrates reflected 
both the eastward orientation of the leadership and the significance of trade. Baghdad was 
created as a circular city, with the caliphal residence at the center, homes of the caliph’s 
sons in the first layer, followed by the various departments of government in the second 
layer. Mosques, schools, artisanal workshops, commercial districts, and residential 
quarters were located in the outer layers. The city was fortified by walls and access 
limited by four gates, reflecting the city’s connection to various trade routes: Syria, 
Khurasan, Basra, and Kufa. While commerce had been significant under the Umayyads, 
it grew by leaps and bounds during Abbasid rule, since there was no longer significant 
warfare conducted against the Byzantines. It would be the wealth from trade that would 

finance the efflorescence of Arab civilization. Furthermore the existence of this trade led 
to other developments: greater unity among the subject population due to uniformity of 
consumer goods available throughout the empire, dissemination of knowledge, and 
advances in shipbuilding, navigation, cartography, geography, as well as commercial law 
and institutions. Arab traders are responsible for promoting the use of bills of exchange 
(the English word check comes from the Arabic sakk meaning document or deed), the 
joint stock company, and forms of venture capital. As Europeans adopted these ideas and 
institutions in the late medieval period, commerce greatly expanded. 

The Abbasid state’s sponsorship of religion and law allowed all aspects of civilization to 
advance. Education in the empire, as in Europe during the same period, was a religious 
education. Islam as a religion encourages all adherents to seek knowledge. Students’ first 
experience was usually memorization and recitation of the Quran, as well as the learning 
the traditions of the prophet Muhammad recorded in hadith. Only after mastering these 
subjects would a student move on to study the other Islamic sciences, jurisprudence (fiqh) 
and theology (kalam). Once grounded in these subjects one might then study what were 
referred to as the “sciences of the ancient ones,” including medicine, philosophy, 
astronomy, biology, physics, engineering, etc. The notion of divisions between these 
latter fields of knowledge did not exist. Indeed, some of the best philosophers were also 
the best physicians. Medical training took place in working hospitals located in major 
urban centers. Such hospitals housed lecture halls, laboratories, libraries, pharmacies, 
quarantine wards, wards for male and female patients, a resident physician, and 
sometimes even musicians to play soothing music for the patients. Disparities between 
the more advanced Islamic medicine and European medicine were made apparent during 
the Crusades. Arab chroniclers report that indigenous physicians were healing utilizing 
methods e.g. clinical observation, while Europeans practiced exorcism and blood-letting. 
By 1200, i.e. about 100 years after the start of the Crusades, one begins to see hospitals, 
as institutions solely for caring for the ill, in Europe. Nevertheless, Europeans did not 
adopt the idea of a resident physician nor of clinical instruction within hospitals until the 
16th century. 

Arabic was the international language of science and learning. Through the medium of 
Arabic, medieval Islamic scholars preserved the knowledge of the ancient world by 
translating and compiling huge treatises in all fields, thus enabling further advances. The 
caliph Mamun (r. 813-833) founded Bayt al-Hikma (House of Wisdom) specifically for 
this purpose. Arabic, as the language in which the Quran was revealed, achieved special 
significance, and its grammar was regularized. Under the Abbasids, Arabic literature was 
profoundly influenced by the precedents of their subject populations’ literature: Hellenic, 
Persian, and Indian.  Although some of these trends had their beginnings under the 
Umayyads, it is under the Abbasids that they truly flourish, e.g. the setting of poetry to 
music. The rhythmic lyrics of Arabic poetry were now set to Byzantine/Persian forms of 
instrumentation and performance. The Arabic language was also the inspiration for great 
art since Islam prohibits human representation. Calligraphy and ornamental design 
reached great heights during this era. 

Even as Abbasid learning and culture was still just beginning to reach its heights, the 
central administration was plagued with civil strife, as early as the reigns of al-Mansur (r. 
754-775) and al-Mahdi (r. 775-785). The latter began the systematic persecution of 
heretics, an institution that would be a hallmark of the Abbasids, who sought to use their 
self-defined version of Islam as the social glue for the empire. Under Harun al-Rashid (r. 
786-809), the empire, as defined by caliphal authority, had reached its apogee. 
Nevertheless, Harun sowed the seeds of destruction when he deposed the Barmecids and 
made a complicated succession arrangement calling for the division of the empire 
between two of his sons, al-Amin and al-Mamun, a situation that ultimately led to civil 
war. The victory of al-Mamun in alliance with Tahir ibn Husyn, a Persian, led to the 
alienation of Arab populations who resented what they viewed as Persian domination. 

Al-Mamun (r. 813-33) sought to regain popular support by manipulating religious beliefs. 
Nevertheless, his efforts tended to alienate the religious establishment rather than to 
buttress support for his rule. As compensation for helping him to win the war against his 
brother, al-Mamun granted Tahir ibn Husayn the hereditary governorship (820-873) of 
the wealthy province of Khurasan, establishing the precedent of decentralization of 
power. 

Further difficulties stemmed from the efforts of al-Mamun and his successor al-Mutasim 
(r. 833-842) to counterbalance Tahirid power. The caliphs recruited Central Asian 
regiments and Turkish slaves for a new army, but the new regiments became the masters 
rather than the servants of the caliphate. Between 833 and 870 they virtually destroyed 
the empire. Pursuing their own interests, the praetorian guards seized control of the 
caliphs and usurped control of the central administration. Chaotic fighting for spoils 
reduced the central government to impotence. Efforts by al-Mutawakkil (r. 847-861) to 
find new military supporters and to revive popular support failed. By 870 the caliphate 
was at a nadir of power and influence. 

Decline of Center 
Decline of caliphal authority meant neither the dissolution of empire nor the diminution 
of the high level of culture and civilization. Instead, competing centers of power 
emerged, some of which maintained an alliance cemented by tribute to the Abbasids and 
some of which challenged Abbasid authority and Sunni orthodoxy. In Egypt under the 
Tulunids (r. 868-905), power fell into the hands of Turkish officers who established their 
own dynasties. The Saffirids led a popular rebellions, and they ended up controlling most 
of eastern Iran from 861-900. There was even a slave revolt in the salt extraction marshes 
in southern Iraq whereby rebels created a small state (868-883) in which private property 
was forbidden and possessions distributed communally. The caliphate did contrive to 
restore order by 905, but a total collapse of the imperial system was only postponed. 
Corruption of the central administration, the division of the bureaus into factions 
exploiting the government in their own interests, loss of control over taxable rural lands, 
and loss of revenue meant that military victories could no longer be followed up by 
routine government. Independent principalities and warlords burgeoned. In the early 10th 
century the Samanids controlled Khurasan and Transoxiana; the Buwayhids, Western 
Iran; the Hamdanids, Upper Mesopotamia, and the Ikhshidids, Egypt. Ultimately the 

Buwayhids seized Baghdad in 945, and full governmental powers, both military and civil, 
were vested in them. The caliphate, deprived of all effective power, remained for 
centuries the legitimate fount of all authority and the symbol of religious unity, but the 
empire as a single Middle Eastern political entity was lost. Nevertheless, despite the lack 
of political unity, there existed the notion of dar al-Islam, i.e. the abode of Islam, 
meaning a unity of among those states whose people profess Islam. 

Fragmentation and Decentralization 
The demise of the unified empire meant the succession of a number of independent 
provincial dynasties. The Samanids continued to control Transoxiana and Khurasan until 
999, when they were defeated by the Karakhanids, who took over Transoxiana, and the 
Ghaznavids of Afghanistan, who took control of Khurasan. Western Iran and Iraq were in 
Buwayhid hands until 1055. The Fatimids ruled Egypt (969-1171) and parts of Syria. 
Other petty princes ruled in Syria and Mesopotamia. These dynasties were relatively 
unstable and short-lived. They suffered from family quarrels, civil wars, a general decline 
of bureaucratic organization in all regions except Egypt, and the decentralization of 
control over the land and its taxable resources in favor of the leading army officers. 
Instead of centrally controlled revenues and salaries, land was granted to the soldiers, 
many of whom had little experience in agriculture, in return for military service. This 
arrangement supported armies composed largely of slaves, usually Turkish in origin, who 
became the ruling elite. Slavery in the ancient world and in the medieval Middle East was 
quite unlike New World slavery. Rather than being a permanent status that involved no 
possibility for upward mobility, slavery was often a temporary status that, if one were 
serving a powerful individual, could lead to a position of great power and wealth. 

Political decentralization was accompanied in many places by economic regression. 
Exploitation of the peasantry and neglect of irrigation in Iraq and Iran led to severe losses 
in agricultural capacity. Long before the Mongol invasions the Middle East was losing 
productive resources. 

Intense religious and social changes also began in the 10th century. The 10th and 11th 
centuries were a period of Shiite preeminence under the officially Shiite Fatimid, 
Buwayhid, and Hamdanid dynasties. This period witnessed the consolidation of Muslim 
orthodoxy in the form of the Muslim schools of law and the emergence of the ulama as 
the social and political chiefs of Muslim communities. They often served as the bridge 
between the multiplicity of princes/petty rulers and the subject populations. As the 
Abbasids and the ulama defined a legalistic form of Islamic orthodoxy, individual 
believers sought a more meaningful relationship with Allah through Sufism, a form of 
Islamic mysticism. During this period Sufism flourished, crossing lines of gender, 
location, class, and sect. In Iran and Central Asia, Zoroastrian and pagan peoples were 
converted to Islam, often intermingling forms of Sufism with their previous belief 
systems. 

Turco-Mongolian Invasions 
These important internal changes were all furthered by the Seljuk (Saljuq) invasions. 
These nomadic Turkish (Turkoman) pastoralists from Central Asia overran the Middle 

East in the middle of the 11th century, and they swept away the Ghaznavids, the 
Buwayhids, and some lesser Syrian principalities, establishing the largest empire in the 
region since early Abbasid times (1040-1193). They posed the first major threat to the 
Byzantines since the time of the Umayyads. The Battle of Manzikert in 1071 opened up 
Anatolia for Turkish settlement. In other words, what we now refer to as “Turkey” was 
not the original homeland of the Turks. 

The invasions introduced substantial Turkish populations into parts of the Middle East, 
furthering the decline of agriculture and contributing to political instability. The 
invasions, however, did little to disturb Islam as a religion or the local communities built 
around it. Their conquest superimposed a new Turkish military elite over the Persian and 
Arab bureaucratic functionaries, who continued to administer taxation and carry on local 
government. The Seljuk regime, based on an alliance of Turkish soldiers with native 
scribes and ulama, was passionately orthodox. Originally pagans, with a belief system 
similar to pre-Islamic Arabs, the Turks readily adopted Islam before reaching the Middle 
East. The Seljuks repressed Shiism, and they founded numerous schools to train scholars 
and scribes, helping to standardize Sunni orthodoxy. After centuries of evolution, Sunni 
Islam was consolidated into its lasting form and was made the prevailing religion of the 
Middle East. 

Despite these important cultural contributions, there were family disputes, usurpations by 
governors and a decentralization of fiscal power that resulted in the fragmentation of the 
Seljuk Empire. Nomadic incursions into the Middle East by Turkic-Altaic speaking 
peoples from Central Asia continued. The Mongols, although similar to the Turks in 
lifestyle, language, and belief system, did not adopt Islam before entering the Middle 
East. Genghis Khan, after uniting the Mongol tribes in 1206, expanded into Transoxiana, 
Afghanistan, Iran, and southern Russia. After Genghis’ death in 1227 his empire was 
divided amongst his sons. Genghis’ grandson Mongke sent his brother Hulagu to 
northern Iran in 1253. Five years later, leaving a trail of terror and destruction, Hulagu’s 
forces marched on Baghdad, bringing down the Abbasid dynasty.  For a time, in one 
place or another, the Mongols threatened to extinguish Islamic civilization. Nevertheless, 
by the fourteenth century, most Mongols that remained in dar al-Islam had converted to 
Islam. 

Egypt and Syria 
In other parts of the Middle East, the same tendencies toward political fragmentation, 
economic regression, and religious ferment, followed by consolidation of Islamic 
orthodoxy, were manifest. Egypt was a partial exception to these trends. Shiite 
missionaries of an Ismaili sect conquered Egypt in 969, after half a century of expansion 
from present day Tunisia. The Fatimids appropriated the title of the caliph and sponsored 
an Ismaili missionary movement throughout the Islamic world to further their own 
ambitions for a universal Muslim empire. These missions had little success, and the 
Fatimid regime remained an Egyptian state with African, Syrian, and Hejazi possessions. 
The Fatimid state was supported by Berber and other foreign armies, buttressed by a 
powerful centralized administration. After a century or so, the Fatimids lost portions of 
their African and Syrian possessions, and they were undermined in their Egyptian capital 

by strife among their various army regiments. Deprived of effective power by their 
generals, divided by schisms within the Ismaili movement, and threatened by European 
crusaders, in 1171 the Fatimids were easily removed from power by Saladin, a Kurdish 
general serving a Turkish ruler in Syria. It should be pointed out that notions of national 
identity did not exist at this time, and loyalty was based upon a variety of other factors. 

From the decentralization of the Abbasids until the rise of Saladin, Syria had been 
divided into small and contending principalities. The Fatimids controlled southern Syrian 
and Damascus until 1076. The Byzantine Empire, three centuries after the Arab 
conquests, reconquered Antioch and northern Syrian, and the stand-off between the major 
contenders allowed small tribal states, independent cities, and sectarian communities to 
flourish. The Seljuks, invading in the latter half of the 11th century, brought Syria under 
their rule, but they were unable to provide any lasting unity, as the territory was divided 
among Seljuk princes. Princes who were too young to rule might be provided with a 
tutor/regent (atabeg) who would marry their widowed mother and rule in their place. 
Thus, the province of Syria remained divided and exposed to further invasions. 

While the Middle East and its various Islamic principalities were reeling from 
fragmentation and invasion, another threat loomed on the horizon: Crusaders from 
Europe. The Crusades were a product of papal and Byzantine politics, Norman ambitions, 
and European social unrest. Crusading armies seized Antioch, Edessa, Tripoli, Jerusalem, 
and most of Palestine between 1098 and 1109. It should also be noted that the Crusades 
were not merely Christian Europe against the Muslim Middle East. Vast constellations of 
alliances shifted back and forth, often crossing lines of religion. The Christian 
populations of the Middle East received a double blow. They were viewed as traitors by 
the rulers whom they generally supported, and they were inflicted with the same 
punishments as Muslims by the European Crusaders. Not surprisingly, it is during the era 
of the Crusades that another wave of conversion to Islam takes place. The two centuries 
during which the Crusades took place allowed Europeans to witness the advances of Arab 
civilization, and they brought those advances back to their homelands. 

The Muslims were at first too divided to repulse the invaders, but throughout the 12th 
century both Muslim power and determination to resist increased. Despite the frustrations 
of constantly shifting alliances, the Seljuk atabeg Zangi of Mosul, managed to seize 
Aleppo in 1128 and Edessa in 1144. His son, Nur al-Din, defended Damascus against the 
Second Crusade in 1147. Several times during the 1160s, Nur al-Din sent his general 
Shirkuh, and Shirkuh’s nephew Saladin, to defend the weak Fatimid state from 
Crusaders. Shirkuh became grand vizier to the Fatimid caliph in 1168, and upon his death 
in 1169 Saladin took the title. Within two years, all traces of Fatimid leadership dissolved 
and a new dynasty, the Ayyubids, emerged. 

Saladin’s seizure of Egypt began a new epoch. In 1183 he accomplished what his 
predecessors could not: the unification of Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and the Hejaz into 
one state. At the Battle of Hittin in 1187, he defeated the Crusaders’ armies and 
recaptured Jerusalem, as well as most of Palestine. His victories were built on widespread 
Muslim support rallied by vigorous espousal and patronage of Muslim orthodoxy. 

When he died in 1193, Saladin was succeeded by a family coalition that would last until 
1249. His successors reversed some of his policies. For example, the Ayyubids 
temporized relations with the Crusaders in an effort to maintain the lucrative trade that 
had been advanced over the course of the Crusades. 

In 1249 the Ayyubid house was extinguished in Egypt, owing to a bizarre set of 
circumstances revolving around yet another European Crusade (7th). Louis IX of France 
had warned the Ayyubid ruler, al-Malik al-Salih, of his impending arrival. Louis 
managed to take Damietta and was continuing to advance southward. In the midst of 
planning the next battle, al-Malik al-Salih died. One of his wives, Shajarat al-Durr, 
conspired with the generals of his slave soldiers (Mamluks) to keep the death a secret 
until his son, by another wife, could return from abroad to replace him. The conspiracy 
was successful, Louis was defeated, and the last Ayyubid sultan arrived to take power; 
however, he failed to pay the Mamluks their proper respect, and they assassinated him, 
proclaiming Shajarat al-Durr their leader. The caliph in Baghdad, who was no more than 
a figurehead yet still the suzerain, told the Mamluks to find a man to do the job or he 
would send one. Instead, Shajarat al-Durr married one of the generals, Aybak (Aybeg), 
and they became co-rulers. In 1257, either due to greed, jealousy, or both, Shajarat al-
Durr assassinated Aybak. In turn, the Mamluks engineered her death—by some accounts 
it involved her being clubbed to death by members of her own retinue, who were 
wielding wooden bath sandals. 

The Mamluks continued to rule Egypt, and they legitimized their government by 
establishing a shadow Abbasid caliphate in Cairo after the fall of Baghdad. They also 
earned the respect of the subject population by having repelled the Crusaders and later 
(1260) by defending Syria (and points beyond) from the Mongol threat. By 1291 they 
expelled the last of the Crusaders from Acre, in Palestine, and thus they cemented their 
reputation as protectors of the people. There followed a long period—the Bahri Mamluk 
regime (1250-1382)—of relative stability and security for the populations of Egypt and 
Syria. Nevertheless, the bubonic plague which arrived between 1347 and 1349 brought 
the same devastation and economic repercussions to the Middle East that it did to Europe. 
In 1382 a new series of mamluk rulers, the Burgi Mamluks, came to power. They differed 
from their predecessors by their Circassian and Greek origins as well as in their fiercely 
meritocratic form of rule. 145 years of Burgi mamluk rule saw 23 different sultans, of 
which 6 ruled 103 years. During these years Egypt and Syria suffered from the long term 
consequences of the plague, including economic decline and social turmoil. 

From the 7th to the 15th centuries, the Arabs founded a series of empires that served to 
create a new Islamic Middle Eastern civilization. The first two hundred years of this 
period saw the widespread sedentarization and urbanization of the Arabs, who mixed 
with the subject population, and created a strong merchant middle class. The urban 
middle class continued to prosper up until the 11th century. It was this class that fostered 
the high level of culture associated with Islamic rule. 

At the same time that the middle class was rising, a military class was also in ascension. 
Initially this class was formed by the conquering Arab armies, but over time came to be 

dominated by slave armies of Turkish and Circassian origin. The military class supported 
itself from large estates, and as the cost of warfare rose, it began to look for new ways to 
tax the urban middle class, which in turn searched for ways to protect its wealth. The 
latter began investing in religious endowments, which were not subject to taxation, to 
protect their wealth. Yet another class was a beneficiary of this process, the religious 
establishment, since they administered the religious endowments. 

Urban culture and civilization declined. This decline was not complete, nor did it occur 
evenly. For example, during the period of extreme decentralization and in the wake of 
incursions by European Crusaders and Central Asian nomads, some of the greatest 
political philosophy and history was written by Arab scholars attempting to explain their 
current predicament. Abd al-Rahman ibn Khaldun (1332-1406), often credited as the 
father of sociology, wrote an amazing introduction to his study of world history. In this 
introduction he laid out the factors by which human character evolves and political 
institutions develop. 

Other realms of learning and knowledge did not fare as well. By the late 10th century a 
consensus of Sunni scholars had determined that the great thinkers of the previous 
centuries had discerned a body of jurisprudence that needed only to be imitated. Although 
a great deal is made of this “closure of the door of interpretation,” it should be 
remembered that individual judges still had great leeway in rendering their decisions. 

In conclusion, invasions by outsiders, the plague, and the decline of urban culture mark 
the years from the 11th century onward. The Ottoman invasion of the early 16th century 
was no exception to this rule. 

The Arabs Under Ottoman Rule 
In many respects the Ottoman conquests did not involve substantial changes in Syria, 
Egypt, the Hejaz, and the parts of Iraq under Ottoman rule. Ottoman domination 
substituted one elite for another, though in Egypt, the Mamluks continued to serve under 
Ottoman stewardship. However, Ottoman rule brought the Arab world into the historical 
rhythm of the larger empire. In the 16th and part of the 17th century, the Ottoman fostered 
irrigation and agricultural developments, repressed Bedouin violence, and managed a 
relatively equitable system of taxation. 

By the 18th century, however, the decline of central authority within the Ottoman Empire 
undermined the security of the Arab provinces. Local governors established their 
effective independence from Istanbul. Factional and communal interests degenerated into 
fratricidal struggles. Bedouin violence grew unchecked. Agriculture declined. Taxation 
became rapacious and heedless of the security of the peasantry. Throughout much of the 
Middle East, Muslim religious and cultural life stagnated. Nevertheless, the autonomy 
achieved by the 18th century allowed Egypt to thrive. 

North Africa and Spain 
The history of Muslim North Africa and Spain forms a separate chapter in the history of 
the Arab world. The Arab conquests proceeded slowly in this region, and only after the 
establishment of Qayrawan (Kairouan) in Tunisia in 670 was the whole of North Africa 

as far as the Atlantic brought under Muslim rule. Despite the slow conquest, it should be 
pointed out that the Berber tribesmen of North Africa, perhaps owing to a similar lifestyle 
and belief system as the Arabs, converted rapidly to Islam. Arab and Berber forces 
invaded Spain in 711, but their advances in Europe were checked at the Battle of Tours in 
732. 

The power of the caliphate in western North Africa (the Maghreb) and Spain was never 
fully established. In the 8th century, Arab rule was resisted by the Berbers of the 
Maghreb, who not surprisingly embraced the Kharijism. The Idrisids, descendents of Ali 
by his son Hasan, established an independent Moroccan Berber kingdom lasting from the 
8th to the 10th centuries. In what is now Tunisia and Algeria, the Aghlabid governors (r. 
800-909), originally from Khurasan, balanced the needs of both the Arab settlers and the 
Berber tribesmen.  Although the Aghlabids were effectively independent, technically they 
were still vassals of the Abbasids. Although removed from power in the central lands 
after the Abbasid revolution, an Umayyad family in Spain established independent rule in 
756. 

At the beginning of the 10th century the Fatimids, appealing to Berber support for their 
Shiite claims to the caliphate, destroyed the Aghlabids and conquered most of North 
Africa and Egypt. Like the Fatimid ruler in Egypt and the caliph of Baghdad, the Spanish 
Umayyad ruler Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912-961) also claimed the title Commander of the 
Faithful, and he contested Fatimid influence in Morocco. His reign was a period of 
cultural efflorescence for both the Muslim and Jewish communities. Achievements in 
Quranic interpretation and hadith studies, as well as poetry and literature, prompted the 
Jewish community to pursue Biblical/Talmudic studies and Jewish law, in addition to 
Hebrew poetry and prose. Christians also participated in public life through positions in 
government and prominence in the arts. Abd al-Rahman III’s capital at Cordoba had 
running water, paved streets, and city lighting. 

In little more than a century both the Fatimid and the Umayyad states declined. The Zirid 
dynasty in Tunisia declared its independence from the Fatimids, while numerous Berber 
tribal states controlled Morocco and Algeria. Umayyad Spain collapsed into a multitude 
of tiny principalities, and the Christians began to conquer territory in Spain from the 
Muslims. Beginning in the 11th century, North Africa and Spain were overwhelmed by 
waves of Bedouin invasions. The banu-Hilal (Beni Hilal) from the east destroyed most of 
Tunisia and Algeria. From the Sahara, Sanhaja Berber tribes united by the Almoravid 
religious movement led by Yusuf ibn Tashfin conquered both Morocco and Muslim 
Spain, starting in 1053. The political unification of Morocco and Spain checked the 
Christian advances and permitted Hispano-Muslim culture to seep into North Africa. The 
Almoravids, however, were succeeded by a Bedouin confederation and empire, the 
Almohads. Inspired by the religious reforms of Muhammad ibn Tumart, the Almohads 
united most of North Africa and Spain between 1130 and 1269, when this empire rapidly 
dissolved on all fronts. Despite the overall Arabization of North Africa by the 13th 
century, three Berber dynasties emerged to rule former Almohad territories in North 
Africa. The Marinids inherited Morocco, which they ruled from the 13th to the 15th 
century, the Zayyanids ruled Algeria until the arrival of the Ottomans in the 16th century, 

and the Hafsids ruled in Tunisia from 1229-1574. The three Berber states lived in near 
constant competition, each trying to revive the unity of the Maghreb at the expense of the 
others. 

The decline of the Almohads in Spain cost the Muslims control of the country. By 1248 
the Christians had recaptured both Cordoba and Seville, reducing Muslim possessions to 
the kingdom of Granada, which survived until 1492. Despite Christian pressure on North 
Africa, Tunisia and Algeria came under Ottoman domination. Morocco was ruled by two 
successive dynasties that claimed descent from the prophet Muhammad and were 
successful at repelling both Portuguese and Ottoman attempts at control. The latter of 
these dynasties, the Alawites, still rules Morocco today.
