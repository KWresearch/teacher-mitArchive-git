Since ancient times, black slaves had been traded in North Africa and the E 
Mediterranean—used as servants, soldiers, and in fields. In the later Middle Ages 
some slaves reached Muslim Spain and Portugal from Africa. 
In the second half of the 15th century the Portuguese began searching for gold along 
African coastline, and when they found little, they made do with men and 
women—some kidnapped and some for whom they bartered. 
Ferdinand of Aragon and Charles V allowed for the first passages of slaves to the New 
World. 
This labor force would not have been available to Europeans if African kings, merchants, 
and noblemen had not been involved. There were relatively few instances of 
Africans opposing the nature of the traffic. 
Occasionally, the Europeans procured the slaves themselves, but more commonly it was 
Africans selling their distant neighbors. Most of the slaves that were shipped from 
Africa were not part of an established slave population. 

Excerpts from The African Slave Trade by Basil Davidson 
The Portuguese broke the monopoly of North African slave trade. Slaves were not the 
only commodity with which the Portuguese were concerned—gold, wrought iron, 
ivory, tortoiseshell, pepper, and even textiles. 
Davidson attributes the growth of the trade to demand for labor in the New World that 
was not met by either native Americans or by indentured servants. 
Slaving became a royal enterprise in the case of Spain—a lot of money to be gained. 
They don’t want to enslave Black Christians or Moors (N African Muslims--make 
anti-Christian propaganda)—focus on Guinea Coast. There was the birthplace of 
the ‘Great Circuit’ in which goods from Europe were used to purchase slaves who 
were then exchanged for minerals and foodstuffs from the NW, which were then 
sold in Europe. Three separate profits were made. 
The slave trade of the 16th century was essentially a Spanish-Portuguese monopoly. The 
Dutch, English, French, Prussians, and Scandinavians followed. 
In the 17th century—trade in men is the only trade that matters for the African chiefs—the 
coastline was divided into regions considered slow or fast in their delivery of 
slaves. “African chiefs found that the sale of their fellow men was indispensable 
to any contact or commerce with Europe … Trapped in this unforeseen and fatal 
circumstance, pushed by their desire for European goods (and firearms often 
became essential to chiefly survival), or blackmailed by the fear that what one or 
two might refuse their rivals would consent to give, the rulers of coastal Africa 
surrendered to the slave trade.” 
Europeans paid tribal chief for the human goods not in coins, but in tobacco, rum, 
firearms, iron, copper, brass wares.

Islam had heavily influenced African slavery. African rulers justified enslavement with the Muslim argument 
that prisoners of war could be sold; and since captured peoples were considered chattel, they could be used in 
the same positions that prevailed in the Muslim world. 
Bulliet, et. al. The Earth & Its Peoples 
Comparing European and Islamic Contacts—p. 516-519 
Fewer slaves crossed the Sahara than crossed the Atlantic, but their numbers were substantial. It is estimated 
that between 1600 and 1800 about 850,000 slaves trudged across the desert’s various routes. A nearly equal 
number of slaves from sub-Saharan African entered the Islamic Middle East by way of the Red Sea and the 
Indian ocean. 

Although Islam forbade the enslavement of Muslims, some Muslim states south of the Sahara did not strictly 
observe that law. 
How did the European and Islamic slave trade affect sub-Saharan Africa: 
(1) the effect of slave exports could not have been large when measured against the population of the entire 
continenet, but (2) losses in regions that contributed heavily to the slave trade were severe. 

Although both foreign Muslims and Europeans obtained slaves from sub-Saharan Africa, there was a significant 
difference in the numbers they obtained and thus in the overall effects of the two slave trades. Between 1550-
1800 some 8 million Africans were exported into the Atlantic trade, four times as many as were taken from sub-
Saharan Africa to North Africa and the Middle East.

The Slave Trade Continues 
Allegations of the existence of slavery in the Sudan—Arabs from the North enslaving 
Christian and animist Dinkas in the South—continue. Christian Solidarity International 
has paid thousands of dollars to buy the freedom of slaves. Detractors of this program 
charge that rather than insuring the freedom of those bought, it encourages the continued 
enslavement of others. The program pays $100/person or 3 cows/person. 

The Prostitution Research & Education project (www.prostitutionresearch.com) estimates 
that the global trade in women as commodities for sex industries is estimated to be 
between 7 and 12 billion annually—much lower risk than trading in drugs or arms. See 
Donna Hughes, “The Natasha Trade: The Transnational Shadow Market of Trafficking in 
Women,” Journal of International Affairs 53,2, Spring 2000: 625-51. 

In Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy Kevin Bales argues that there 
may be more than 27 million slaves in the world today. In this study he examines sex 
slavery in Thailand, chattel slavery in Mauritania, charcoal-makers in Brazil, brick-
makers in Pakistan, and farmers in India.
