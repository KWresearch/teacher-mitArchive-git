The Development of Backwardness 
Europe itself was not uniformly wealthy and powerful. 
Relatively poorer and weaker states, as well as regions within states, e.g. Romania, Ireland, S 
italy, and Poland were unable to participate in imperialist ventures. Indeed, they were 
themsevles vulnerable at times to the empire-building of other European states—see 
maps. 
Russia was a special case in that it was both an imperial, expanding state, yet it was distinctly 
backward. Agriculture and industry are being carried out according to methods that are 
no longer “socially necessary” as Marx would say or in other words, not using the most 
advanced methods in practical use at the time. Agriculture and industry are labor-
intensive rather than capital intensive. 
As we talked about in the first lecture, long-distance and local trade, urbanization and the ability 
to feed non-food producers are all required to form cities, and that extensive 
bureaucracies existed in the world long before the development of capitalism. We can 
indeed point to the industrial revolution as creating backwardness—in other words, 
slowness to change was the norm worldwide. In the context of world history over the last 
500 years, the exceptional thing is the Industrial Revolution and the dynamics of 
industrial capitalism—yet if we examine media, textbooks, etc., we see that most people 
in the West explain “backwardness” as being the exceptional condition which requires 
explanation. 
This brings us to a second definition of backwardness: An ideological view of certain normal 
areas in the world as peripheral or backward and the contrasting areas of intense 
industrialization as “normal”. 
Industrialization and backwardness are both outcomes of developing capitalism. Along the same 
lines, one can think of “backward” agricultural areas with labor-intensive, 
undercapitalized production methods as part of the same system as capital-intensive, 
mechanized production. 

The ideological inversion of what was “normal” and what was “exceptional” is as old as the 
Industrial Revolution itself. Its leading theory of free trade, Adam Smith, claimed, against 
the mercantilists, that economic growth was natural for societies. In societies, individual 
pursued rational self-interest. If economic growth was not taking place, Smith argued, 
then some external factors must be stopping it. 
Smith assumed that producers have the desire to commoditize all or most of their output in 
response to the possibility of trade … [and] that the producers will have the ability and 
the liberty to allocate their resources as they see fit. 

The conundrum of the IR is still with us: what is it that causes economic growth and what 
political solution ought people tolerate in the quest to overcome slow economic growth? 
Russia & Backwardness 
Russia like all places we might investigate as “backward” had its own historical conditions that 
shaped its confrontation with the IR in W Europe. Its own IR did not take place until the 
1890s after 20 years of halting efforts. 
In the years after the Fr Rev, Russia established a name for itself as the most reactionary power in 
Europe. The tsars of the early 19th c, part. Nich. I, developed a police state so rigid that in 
1848 when revolutionary movements spread across all the rest of Europe, Russia 
remained untouched. 
Nich I’s own sever rejection of any W influences whatsoever was shaped by his experience of 
coming to power in the wake of a nobles’ revolt in 1825—Decembrist Revolt. Between 
1848 and the Crimean War, there were more than 100 peasant revolts—however, the 
army was able to suppress them. 
It was the Crimean War in 1854-56 that finally forced on almost all Russians, including the new 
tsar Alexander II, the need for change. The Crimean War was the result of British and 
French efforts to keep Russia from gaining control of the Balkans and Constantinople— 
see Map. 
The reasons for Russia’s utter failure in this war, which was fought much closer to its own soil 
and to which Britain and France devoted only a fraction of their own military power, 
were manifest to all: inefficiency, crippling lack of skills among the army, which was 
manned mostly with serfs, and technological inferiority. Russia would have to change or 
face losing its status as a great power. 
Reform 
The way in which reform actually took place illustrates one of the oddities of Russian politics that 
specifically related to backwardness: a despot and a progressive were likely to be one and 
the same person. Alex II, who put through major reforms, was himself no liberal. He 
imposed his reforms as an autocrat, as an absolute ruler. He stated to the nobles in 
Moscow: 

The existing order of serfdom cannot remain unchanged. It is better to abolish serfdom from above than to wait 
until the serfs begin to liberate themselves from below. 

There was no dialogue with Russians interested in the problem of reform, no forum for exchange, 
and certainly the majority of the Russian people whose lives were the object of reform 
efforts were never consulted: the serfs. 
The most important of Alex II’s reform was the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. Bureaucrats 
drew up the edict, then Alex II forced it on Russian nobles. It provided for the state to 
purchase land from the nobles, and for the land to then be distributed by the state to the 
freed serfs. Serfs now had the freedom to marry without the lord’s permission, to seek 
justice in the courts instead of having to receive it from the lords, were freed from the 
most cruel kinds of corporal punishment that had been lords’ prerogative, and supposedly 
worked their own land. 
However, the freed serfs remained bound to the land because another part of the arrangement was 
that they had to pay off the state for the parcels that had been bought from the lords. The 
basic decision to compensate the lords therefore crippled serf emancipation from the 
beginning. There was not enough land to go around, and peasants were not free to go 
elsewhere. 
To make sure that peasants paid their debt to the state, they were organized into a structure that 
was traditional to Russian society, but now was under the direct authority of the state, 
rather than the lords: the mir, or village council. Peasants lived in peasant communes 

which were governed by the mir. The decision to keep peasants under the control of the 
mir was not inevitable, some had opposed. The mir decided how to allocate land for 
changing needs: if a couple had lots of kids they might get allocated more land which 
would be taken from people whose children were adults. Only if a peasant gave up 
his/her land could he or she leave the village commune. Those who left and moved to the 
cities became part of the small urban proletariat—they were the least skilled and the most 
desperate. 
Because of the mir organization and the ongoing shortage of land for an increasing peasant 
population—Russia’s population doubled in the second half of the 19th c from 67-126 
million—serf emancipation did not create an independent, conservative peasantry. The 
serfs’ old economic and political grievances remained. 
Moreover, innovation in methods of production did not result, because the large supply of labor 
meant that employers found it cheaper to hire more workers, rather than to use 
technology to make each worker more productive. 
In addition to the serf emancipation, Alex II also imposed judicial reforms and army reforms. His 
reforms increased literacy for Russian peasants, which was important for their 
politicization. 
Reform efforts in the 19th c took place, but under a repressive regime. No strikes were allowed— 
striking workers were fined, sent to Siberia or imprisoned. Thus, there was little chance 
for a labor movement to develop as was happening elsewhere to the W. 
Response to Reform 
Since legal outlets for activism were not allowed, illegal political activism became the norm. 
Terrorism was far more “normal” political practice than elsewhere in Europe—e.g. 
assass. of Alex II. 
The reforms were crippled at the outset by the sheer enormity of the problem and the unsuitability 
of the Russian bureaucracy. They took place in a context cut off from the people they 
were aimed at: the peasants. 
Because there was no possibility for open discussion, Russian social thought in this period 
developed as abstract, philosophical discussion rather than as practical political programs. 
Revolutionaries and reformers tended to be an assorted group of intellectuals (intelligentsia) from 
the social classes of petty officials and landowners, both noble and non-nobleThe 
parameters of the debate were first set in the 1830s and 40s between slavophiles and 
westernizers—debate renewed and intensified after the Crimean War. 
According to the slavophiles the big issue was how Russia should relate to W Europe. The West, 
in their estimation, was not something that ought to be imitated. Russia, by contrast, had 
a more social, communal nature. The mir encouraged a form of hierarchical consensus. 
Slavophiles placed a positive value on tsarist absolutism—Russians called upon the tsar 
to free them from the burden of politics. They thought the first big mistake in Russia’s 
history came with Peter the Great’s reform around 1700. 
The Westernizers were a less unified assortment of intellectuals who opposed the slavophiles 
during the 1840s. They admired Peter the Great, and desired the development of 
individual and rational thought. For the Westernizers, the mir was not the bastion of 
Russian culture, but rather the obstacle to its progress. The undeniable divide between the 
masses and society would eventually be closed, the Westernizers claimed, by raising the 
masses to the level of educated society. A bourgeoisie on the W model would help to 
achieve these development. In the 1860s, the Westernizers split into populist and liberal 
branches, with the latter concerned about protecting the privileges of the nobility. 
Out of the whole slavophile-westernizer controversy emerged other political movements, e.g. 
revolutionary populism embodied in the Russian socialism of Alexander Herzen (1812-
70). Herzen noted that capitalism seemed to be in crisis in W Europe and he wanted 
Russia to follow a different path. He urged intellectuals to overcome the divide separating 

them from the peasants by literally “going to the people”. In the 1860s, hundreds of 
students walked to remote villages and attempted to live with peasants. The result was 
mass arrests and even attacks by the peasants on the intellectuals; the peasants had no 
reason to trust urban people who were acting so strangely. Nevertheless, the Populists 
continued to maintain that the peasant masses ought to dominate the educated elite. The 
main danger according to the Populists was capitalism. Populism overlapped with 
anarchism, a movement which aimed at the abolition of the state. One leading anarchist 
was Peter Kropotkin, who wrote a book on mutual aid among animals and humans that 
was intended to show that competition was not natural. 
Nihilism, was another intellectual movements. It rejected all established authorities and claimed 
to believe nothing that could not be proven by rational argument and natural science. 
Society, family, and religion all placed irrational bonds on the individual. Nihilism was 
politically moderate. It sought to reform the individual intellectual rather than to 
transform all of society thru revolution. 
Interestingly enough, Marxism did not become popular in Russia until the 1890s. The first 
Marxist party, the Russian Social-Democratic Workers’ Party was founded in 1898. In 
1903, a split occurred in the party into a Bolshevik—majority faction supporting Lenin 
and the Menshevik, minority faction which was skeptical of Lenin and his methods. 
Lenin’s program had little to do with Karl Marx. His thought was rooted in Russia’s historical 
experience and his own experience as a revolutionary intellectual. 
Russia’s Industrialization 
Efforts to industrialize were spear-headed by Sergei Witte, the Minister of Finance bet. 1892-
1903: 

Russia remains even at the present essentially an agricultural country. It pays for all its obligations to foreigners 
by exporting raw materials, chiefly of an agricultural nature, principally grain. It meets its demands for finished 
goods by imports from abroad. The economic relations of Russia with W Europe are fully comparable to the 
relations of colonial countries with their metropoles. The latter consider their colonies as advantageous markets 
in which they can freely sell the products of their labor and of their industry and from which they can draw with 
a powerful hand the raw materials necessary for them. 

By that time, Witte, program of developing heavy industry was already underway. He wanted to 
use state-directed investment, foreign capital, and tariff protections to develop Russian 
industry. He attracted foreign capital, esp. French capital, to build RRs, develop mining, 
and build factories. 
Witte cut imports, increased exports—peasants were not much a market for products, and taxed 
items of everyday consumption heavily to raise money from peasants. This top-down 
industrialization and foreign investment produced a sort of neo-colonialism in Russia, as 
well as in other E European states where it was applied. 
Russian factories borrowed W technology, and were therefore often more “modern” than older 
plants in W Europe; yet, certain phases of production remained unskilled. 
Only after 1890 did factory production finally overtake cottage and manual production. 
Still around 1900, there were only about 2 million industrial workers in Russia, concentrated in 
small areas around St. Petersburg and Moscow, as well as in Lodz, Warsaw, 
Kiev/Ukraine, Ekaterinenburg/Urals, and Baku/Azerbaijan (oil). 
Although industrialization was taking place, agricultural methods were not reformed. 
Creation of a Revolutionary Proletariat 
The Russian industrial proletariat, whose working conditions were far worse than those of W 
European workers, were readier than the peasants for radical political activism because 
they lived in a few concentrated areas. 
Around 1900, Russian industry experienced its first downturn, which together with losing the 
Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905, led to a revolution in 1905. The tsar was forced to 

grant a constitution and create a parliament—limited powers and he could call/recall at 
whim. 
Between 1905 and WWI, however industry continued to expand. 
The First World War, as the first total war, demanded complete mobilization of not only the 
military, but the entire economy. 
In Feb. 1917, a revolution toppled the absolutist rule of tsar Nicholas II, and a liberal, 
parliamentary republic was established. However, this republic failed to get Russia out of 
the war. Later that year, the Bolsheviks with their slogan of Peace, land, and bread were 
able to capture control in key industrial population centers and replace the parliamentary 
republic with a dictatorship of the Bolshevik Party.
