Labor, Violence, & Democratization in England 

The following years saw extensive labor-related violence in England: 
1811-1813 -- “Luddites” purposefully smashed new textile machines as a protest for the 
mechanization that was displacing more traditional weaving methods. They were 
also protesting the sped-up, intensified working conditions of industrial workers 
1815-1817 
1819 -- “Peterloo Massacre.” In the summer of 1819, 60,000 men, women and children, 
many of them weavers, gathered to demonstrate peacefully at St. Peter’s Fields 
near Manchester. The local government authorities allowed them to do so. But 
once they had gathered, those authorities, the magistrates, lost their nerve seeing 
such a mass of protesters, even if they were peaceful. They ordered police to 
charge on horses into the crowd to force it to disperse; the police also used sabres 
freely. The resulting stampede killed eleven demonstrators (including two 
women); hundreds of men and over a hundred women were injured. Afterwards, 
the government in London praised the magistrates for that action without even 
investigating whether it was justified. This episode, of deadly force used on 
peaceful demonstrators, convinced many workers that they were living in a state 
of war with their government. It also shocked many bourgeois, who were 
disgusted with the conservative (Tory) government and determined to find new 
solutions to the “Social Problem” of workers’ lives under industrialization.

1829-1835 

1832-1844 

1846-1848 

Between 1838 and 1848, Chartism, a workers’ movement calling for democratization,  

swept England. In 1832, the British Reform Bill expanded the number of men who were  

able to vote. Everyone who paid ten pounds in taxes was eligible to vote. This 

enfranchised more of the middle classes in towns, but it excluded workers. The Chartists 

wanted to expand that suffrage further, and they held mass meetings and collected 

signatures on petitions. Their “6 Points” of “The People’s Charter” were: 

--universal male suffrage 

--annual meetings of Parliaments (instead of less frequent convenings) 

--salary for members of Parliament (so that men who were not independently wealthy 

could run) 
--vote by secret ballot 
--equal electoral districts, to account for population shifts caused by industrial revolution 
--abolition of property qualifications for members of parliament 

You will recognize these as some basic liberal demands--but they nevertheless seemed 
very radical to Britain’s bourgeoisie. The Chartists failed. It took until the First World 
War to gain these demands.
