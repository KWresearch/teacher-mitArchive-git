Reagan Critique of Carter, 1980: “America’s defense strength is at its lowest ebb in a generation, 
while the Soviet Union is vastly outspending us in both strategic and conventional arms. … Is 
America stronger and more respected now than it was three-and –a-half years ago? It is the 
responsibility of the President of the US in working for peace, to insure that the safety of our 
people cannot successfully be threatened by a hostile foreign power. … We always seek to live in 
peace … But neither can we be naïve or foolish. … Can we doubt that only a Divine Providence 
placed this land … as a refuge for all those in the world who yearn to breathe free? I’ll confess that 
I’ve been a little afraid to suggest what I’m going to suggest. I’m more afraid not to. Can we begin 
our crusade joined in a moment of silent prayer? God bless America.”3

1 Sandinistas were a broad group of revolutionaries and reformers who took their name from Augusto Cesar 

Sandino, who led the opposition to US forces in Nicaragua from 1927-32. They received aid from Cuba 

and the Soviet Union.

Reagan Doctrine, 1985: “We must stand by all our democratic allies. And we must not break faith 
with those who are risking their lives—on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua—to 
defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth. The 
Sandinista dictatorship of Nicaragua, with full Cuban-Soviet bloc support, not only persecutes its 
people, the church, and denies a free press but arms and provides bases for communist terrorists 
attacking neighboring states. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense and totally consistent 
with OAS and UN Charters. It is essential that the Congress continue all facets of our assistance to 
Central America. I want to work with you to support the democratic forces whose struggle is tied 
to our own society.”4

The multi-faceted Narrative: 
The Iranian Revolution shocked both the US public and US-policy makers, and the taking of 
American hostages was a horrifying reminder of failed US policy in the past and the threat of an 
unknown future. Carter’s botched rescue effort meant continually destabilizing relations between 
the emerging government in Iran and the US—American TV viewers watched the evening news 
and counted the days of the crisis (444 days total). Carter’s chances in the 1980 election were 
rapidly decreasing. In the meanwhile, Iranian officials approached the Reagan-Bush team about 
the possibility of obtaining arms, which were now a necessity given the opportunity that had been 
seized by Saddam Hussein. The timing of the release of the hostages occurred just after Reagan 
was sworn into office. 

The story might have ended there, but arms continued to flow to Iran by joining this initiative 
with another, the situation in Nicaragua. Reagan wanted to reverse the Nicaraguan revolution; 
however, he was keen on not starting a Central American “Vietnam.” He preferred aiding the 
Contras, who were conducting a guerilla war against the Sandinistas. The Democratic-controlled 

4  Ibid., 682-683. 

Congress, however, was not so keen on providing this funding and passed legislation to prohibit 
either DoD or CIA efforts to aid the Contras. By joining these interests Reagan hoped to make 
inroads with Iranian “moderates” and to achieve the release of American hostages that were being 
taken by various pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon. To avoid pitfall of either Defense or CIA the 
administration used the National Security Council. Robert McFarlane and John Poindexter raised 
private and foreign funds for the Contras. Publicly, the US spear-headed an arms-embargo to 
Iran, while privately funneling millions of dollars worth of arms to Iran.

While arms were flowing to Iran and profits heading toward the Contras, there were also elements 
within the Reagan administration, most notably VP Bush, who viewed Saddam Hussein as the 
lesser of the evils of the region. BNL-Atlanta, relying on government-backed loans, provided 
some $5 billion in assistance to Iraq between 1985-1989. This money purchased agricultural 
supplies, but also machinery and notably dual-use technology. Bush, Schultz, and Weinberger 
pressured the CCC and the Ex-IM bank to extend credit and materials to Iraq. The full story here 
is yet to be uncovered. 
Cast of Characters Now: 
•	 Robert McFarlane: CEO of Global Energy Investors, Director of International Center for 
Religion and Diplomacy, Co-founder and Vice-Chairman of America-China Society, sits 
of board of Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and is an active participant in the 
National Prayer Breakfast movement. He was also in Afghanistan meeting with 
opposition leader Abdul Haq, before 9/11—this leader was later ambushed and executed. 
John M. Poindexter: Before being appointed as the Director of the newly created 
Information Awareness office [created by Pentagon Agency DARPA, to gather 
intelligence from internet, phone, and fax lines], he was Vice President of Syntek 
Technologies, a government contractor, which created a sophisticated electronic 
surveillance system. 
•	 Cap Weinberger: Prior to serving under Nixon and Reagan, Weinberger was a senior 
official at Bechtel, a large government contractor. Escaped any major linkage to Iran-
Contra affair and went on to become Chairman of Forbes, Inc. Currently he is a news 
analyst for Fox news, among others. 
•	 George Bush, Sr: Prior to serving as VP for Reagan, Bush held positions in the Drug 
Interdiction Task Force and the Counterterrorism Task Force, in addition to serving as 
director of CIA (1976-77)—although there are some allegations that his ties to CIA go 
back to the early 1960s and anti-Castro efforts. He staunchly maintained that he was “out 
of the loop;” however, memos with subject headings would reveal at least some 
knowledge. After his failed run for a second term in 1992, he became a senior advisor to 
the Carlyle Group, a major defense contractor. 
•	 Oliver North: Reportedly sold over $16 million in arms to Iran, but managed to funnel 
less than $4 million to the Contras. After his convictions were overturned, he founded 
Guardian Technologies International, a company which supplies protective gear to Law 
enforcement. He also serves as an analyst and news commentator for Fox and has his 
own “War Stories” series. 
•	 George Schultz: [MIT alumnus]—Prior to serving Nixon and Reagan, he worked for 
Bechtel—he is currently on the latter’s board, as well as a number of other companies 
and financial conglomerates. 
•	 Ronald Reagan: Like George Bush Sr., he claimed to be “out of the loop,” although 
North’s testimony indicated knowledge by both Bush Sr. and Reagan. He has remained 
out of public life since disclosing his Alzheimer’s Disease. 
John Negroponte: Ambassador to Honduras during the Iran-Contra years, now is the US 
representative to the United Nations.
