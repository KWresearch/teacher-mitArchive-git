World War II—Extra Handout 

Economic Context:  Refer to lecture and handouts for WWI-WWII—problem of the 
Versailles Peace and subsequent world economic crisis. Remember this is at the same 
time that Stalin in forcing collectivization on Russia and Japan imposing its will on 
China. On Oct. 24, 1929 the US stock market took a dive, losing half the value of stocks 
in a matter of days—and they continued to drop for another 3 years—leading to a world 
wide depression. Prof. Russell’s father, e.g., tells of it costing more money to transport a 
sheep to market than the price that the sheep would fetch on the market. In this 
atmosphere US banks called in European loans and put up high import tariffs to protect 
US goods. Britain and France have their colonial empires to fall back upon. Many 
countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia were dependent upon selling their exports— 
usually 1-2 cash crops and people were buying much less. Malaya, Indochina, and Dutch 
East Indies were the big rubber producers, and when production of automobiles went way 
down, they suffered. South Africa was about the only place not to be so hard hit b/c the 
value of its gold went up. 
Rise of Fascism in Italy: R efer to fascism handout for general methods. Benito 
Mussolini, a one time socialist, became head of Italy’s fascist party, which by 1921 had 
300,000 members. (Refer to handout for the role of fascism in industry). In 1922 
Mussolini threatened that he would march on Rome if not appointed Prime Minister, and 
once in place he put party members in all gov’t jobs. Mussolini was esp. good at 
propaganda and utilizing billboards, movies, radio bulletins, etc. to spread his message. 
During the course of the 1930s fascist parties spring up not only in Europe, but also Latin 
America, China, and Japan. 
Germany & Hitler: Son of a minor Austrian official, Hitler fought in WWI and 
afterwards began a splinter political movement called the National Socialist German 
Worker’s Party, better known by its acronym, Nazi. He published his ideas in a book 
called Mein Kampf in 1925. In it he asserted that Germany needed to absorb all German-
speaking people. Furthermore, he felt that Aryans, i.e. Germans, Scandinavians, and 
Britons, were a master race, followed by the Alpines (French and Italians), and the E 
Slavs, who were good only for slavery. The goal was for the master race to rule the 
world. To carry out his plan he would need to remove some of the restrictions placed on 
the German military by Versailles and expand his greater Germany into Poland and the 
USSR. At the time when his book came out, Hitler was a nonentity and it did not make 
much of a splash, but after the depression he found a more interested audience. In March 
1933, as leader of the largest party in Germany, he became chancellor, which he changed 
to Fuhrer the following year, initiating a Third Reich (empire)—the first being the Holy 
Roman Empire and the second being Germany from 1871-1918. Women were urged to 
take care of their children, the church, and their kitchen—releasing jobs for men. 
Road to War: In 1933 Hitler withdrew from the League of Nations and set out to rebuild 
his military. Britain and France barely put up a whimper—both are having problems at 
home and in their empires and neither wants to wage war. The US sees this as a European 
concern. Meanwhile, Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935. In March 1938 Hitler invaded 

Austria and later part of Czechoslovakia. Europeans were reluctant to do anything— 
feared war and thought that if they could give Germany something that Hitler would be 
appeased. Further complicating the matter was the issue of Communism. European 
politicians feared Stalin more than Hitler, who seemed a good counterbalance. Once 
Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1939, it was clear that the war 
was on—by this time Germany and Italy formed an alliance called the Axis (Sept. 1940, 
Japan joins). The British and French eagerly sought Soviet help, but Stalin did not trust 
them and instead signed the Nazi-Soviet pact in which the two powers partitioned Poland. 
This bought Hitler 2 years time in which he did not have to fight a two-front war. 
Early War: The period between the winter of 1939 40 is sometimes called the “phony 
war” b/c Britain and France did not do much. In fact, the USSR was the most active, 
moving into the Baltic states. Things pick up in the spring of 1940 when Hitler moves 
into NW Europe and beginning a massive air campaign against Britain. The US provides 
lend-lease aid to not only Britain, but also countries e.g. Saudi Arabia. 
Soviet Entrance: In June of 1941 Hitler turned his attention eastward moving into the 
Baltic states, the Ukraine, and Russia proper (literally at the gates of Moscow and 
Leningrad)—but then the cold weather set in. Meanwhile, Italy moving across N Africa. 
By the year’s end, the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor (see Japan handout). In Jan. of 1942, 
US, Britain, and USSR make a declaration that they will not seek separate peace. 
1943-45: Tide begins to turn on many fronts—Soviets regain advantage in the E theatre 
and the W powers get a grip on N Africa and Italy, the latter of which exited the war in 
the summer of 1943. The Allied forces launched the Normandy invasion (D-Day) in June 
1944—but Germany holds on for nearly a year more. In Feb. of 1945 FDR, Stalin, and 
Churchill meet to discuss postwar world—Stalin and Churchill like the old-style sphere 
of influence—Stalin was preoccupied with security that would enable his country to 
rebuild. Stalin considers his moves in E Europe analogous to those of Britain and the US 
in Italy. Hitler commits suicide in May of 1945. Japan cont’d to fight. 
The Bomb & the Origins of the Cold War: There are many schools of thought on why 
the bomb was used and whether or not it was meant as much to “show the Russians” as it 
was to win the war quickly. Early on in the war, FDR decided to build the bomb and to 
establish a partnership on atomic energy with Britain and to bar the Soviets from any 
knowledge. Truman was only dimly aware of project Manhatten when FDR died in April 
of 1945, just before victory in Europe. Truman inherited FDR’s advisors who viewed the 
bomb as a legitimate weapon to use against Japan, and thus discussion about its use 
centered on its effectiveness as a negotiating weapon (vis a vis the Soviets). The 
Alamagordo test and the Potsdam conference to discuss post-war issues both happened in 
July 1945. On Aug. 6, 1945 the US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing 
80,000 instantly and another 120,000 more slowly; three days later another bomb was 
dropped on Nagasaki. What alternatives to the bomb did the US have: (1) allow Russian 
entry into war in Pacific (2) utilize a non-combat demonstration of the weapon to initiate 
fear and surrender (3) redefine the necessity of unconditional surrender—this could 
potentially lengthen war too (4) pursue Japan’s peace feelers—certain factions of 
leadership were ready for surrender. (5) use conventional warfare (a ground invasion was 
planned for November). On Aug. 14, 1945 Japan surrendered. 
Holocaust: Refer to lecture on WWI-WWII. Note—it is cleat that the Allies knew about 
Hitler’s final solution, but Allied leadership decided that the first priority ought to be 

bringing Hitler down. Prior to the war when the anti-Jewish legislation began in the mid-

30s, FDR did not want extra immigrants in the midst of the depression. Once he learned 

of the final solution he allowed 15,000 Jews with visitor permit to stay. Some argue that 

the US could have bombed the RRs carrying the Jews to the camps, while others state 

that the US just could not understand the extent of the problem—just too horrible to 

believe. 

Rise of Nationalism & American Economic Dominance: The US encouraged 

nationalist movements worldwide—some argue for altruism while others claim that it 

was in an effort to reorganize the world for US economic expansion—i.e. that the US 

fostered nationalism in order to create a new form of economic dependency. 

United Nations: Before the war’s end (1944), representatives from the US, Britain, 

USSR, and China met to draft the UN charter. Like its predecessor, it would have a 

general assembly and a security council with 5 permanent members (the 4 above +  

France) and 7 rotating ones; however it differed from it in that decisions would be made 

by majority vote, rather than unanimous agreement. The exception to the rule was that the 

5 permanent members would have veto power in the security council. Theoretically, all 

signatories renounced war and territorial conquest. Obviously, the ability of the  

permanent 5 to veto legislation could play into a variety of Cold War issues. The 

decolonization of Africa and Asia meant a tremendous growth in the size of the General 

Assembly. Early on the General Assembly had more power and prestige, e.g. at the time

of the UN partition plan for the Palestine mandate. Later, as membership swelled with 

non-Western members, the powerful Western powers disregarded its initiatives. The UN 

also created separate agencies to deal with specific issues: UNICEF (UN Children’s 

Emergency Fund), UNRWA (UN Relief Works Agency), UNESCO (UN Educational,  

Scientific and Cultural Organization).
