Japan 
Japan & Missionaries: Where China was more open to Jesuit missionaries, so long as 
the missionaries were syncretic enough to accommodate Confucian values and learn 
something about Chinese values, Japan saw relatively few converts in the 1500s. We 
talked in class about the “closing” of Japan and the banning of Christianity. Despite the 
so-called closing, lords located on the extreme southern or northern ends tended to be less 
controlled by shoguns. 
End of Shogunate: By the 1800s some of the provinces in the S had emerged as more 
wealthy and prosperous than others, probably owing to their insulation from central 
power. There was a movement in the central government to attempt to restore more direct 
control. They were also on careful lookout for intruders from their W, e.g. Dutch, British, 
French, and Russians. It is in this context that US Commodore Perry arrives with his fleet 
in 1853, demanding that Japan open to US ships for refueling and trade when he return in 
1854. The Tokugawa shogun, begrudgingly accepted, angering provincial leaders. In the 
early 1860s these tensions grew, esp. in the SW provinces, where open rebellion to 
central authorities took place. Other provincial leaders joined the rebellion in 1867, and 
by 1868 the old state was destroyed and the young emperor “restored”. 
Meiji Restoration: The new state was known by the young emperor’s reign name 
meaning “enlightened rule”. Japan’s new leadership (Meiji oligarchs) set out to create a 
strong centralized state. This growth and centralization took place b/c neither the US, nor 
Britain and France took any great interest in making a move on it. The new leadership 
dissolved the old system of provincial governors and the samurai class. Already way 
ahead of the game in regional literacy (as much as 35%), the new leaders also developed 
Japan’s educational system, as well as a conscript army and new systems of 
communication. They also began sending educational missions abroad. The ruling 
oligarchy sought technical, commercial, and consumer knowledge from the W—there 
was the idea that they would adopt only that which was useful. 
Rise of Industry: Industrialization took place without too much foreign debt. 
Nevertheless, peasants were often over-taxed in the process, and many families sent their 
daughters into indentured servitude to textile mills—the govt then sold these bonds to 
investors, which allowed the state to pay off its debts. Japan’s many rivers allowed it to 
develop hydroelectric capacity. Four giant industries—Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Yasuda, 
and Mitsui controlled most of industry and commerce—remember the address by Iwasaki 
Yataro from Week 9. About half the population remained poor farmers. 
Authoritarian Gov’t & Imperialism: In 1889 Japan promulgated a new constitution, 
with a bicameral legislature and a cabinet led by Prime Minister. The military (army and 
navy) remained out of civilian control. Only the rich could vote. As Japan built the 
military and industrial apparatus to combat encroachment by W powers, it also built an 
apparatus that would allow it to extend its own will as well. As China was growing 
weaker, Japan was growing stronger. Japan had little arable land to grow food for its 
rapidly growing population. It saw Korea, Manchuria, and parts of China as integral to its 
further development. By 1900 Japan, alongside European powers and the US, helped to 
put down China’s Boxer Rebellion. It is also at this time that Japan was strong enough to 
repudiate some of the unequal trading treaties that had been established since its 
reopening. Japan’s military might was further proved in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. 
Western powers thought they could control what they viewed as their junior partner. 

WWI: The Japanese joined the Allied side in WWI with an eye toward advancing upon 
Germany’s N Pacific colonies and moving further into China. During the war Japan 
presented China with 21 Demands, making it into a virtual protectorate. 
Post WWI-1937: Nationalists in China are growing stronger—want to challenge 
Japanese. Japanese, in the meanwhile use an incident at the Manchurian railway to 
“liberate” the province from the Chinese. At grassroots level, Chinese boycott Japanese 
goods. After 1921—Communist Party in China—small, intellectual—Mao leads in early 
20s. US and League of Nations condemn Japanese actions in Manchuria, but Japanese 
ignore and build RRs and heavy industry to speed up their own military development. In 
Japan proper—massive building of war ships and gov’t grows more authoritarian. By the 
mid-1930s debates among Japanese leadership deal with how to solve economic 
problems: conquest of China or war with USSR. 
Sino-Japanese War: In 1937 Japan attacked China, seizing Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, 
and other coastal cities—continued to move—see map. Warfare was absolutely brutal 
1937/38 raping of women, mass killing of civilians, etc. Nationalist leader Chiang did 
things like flood out villages to slow the Japanese onslaught, but they also had the effect 
of causing massive destruction, death, and homelessness. Chiang then fled to central 
China to build up forces—not to fight the Japanese, but to fight the Communists, who 
were growing more powerful. 
WWII—Asian/Pacific Theatre: When war broke out in Europe in 1939, this opened 
opportunities for Japan in Southeast Asia, a region rich in oil, rubber, and other strategic 
resources. After the fall of France, Japan moved into French Indochina (Vietnam). Britain 
and US stop shipments of steel, iron, oil, etc. crippling the Japanese war machine. Japan’s 
alternatives were: give up conquests and be humiliated; continue, but face economic 
disaster; chose war. The attack on Pearl Harbor (12/41) was not meant as a first step to 
conquest of the US, but in forcing the US to accept its role in the Pacific and Southeast 
Asia—Admiral Yamamoto was trying to pull a move like Hitler in Europe and assumed 
that the “isolationist” US would not respond. As the Japanese pushed their way through 
Southeast Asia and the Dutch East Indies, their rhetoric spoke of liberation and their 
tactics of conquest. By the spring of 1942 the US was bombing Tokyo and blocking 
Japanese passage to Australia. The major turning point, however, was the Battle of 
Midway in which Japan lost a number of aircraft carriers and the US made steady gains 
thereafter. 
Cold War: After their defeat the Japanese had to accept foreign military occupation 
(until 1952) and the creation of a new gov’t. Japan received independence in 1951 and 
signed peace treaties with its former enemies. The new constitution, written during the 
US occupation, called for limited self-defense, no deployment of troops abroad, and gave 
women the vote. The Japanese turn toward rebuilding for commerce rather than conquest. 
Electricity, steel, and shipbuilding all contributed to Japan’s reemergence as a formidable 
player in the world economy. Despite Japan’s paucity in mineral resources, it weathered 
the oil crisis of 1973 much better than Europe or the US. Throughout the 70s and 80s, 
Japan was a major exporter of goods to the W, prompting the US and the European 
Community to try to force open the Japanese market—limited success. There were 
predictions in the 80s that Japan would eclipse the US in economic growth, but issues 
related to the stock market and housing, as well as issues of corruption in gov’t, slowed 
things down.
