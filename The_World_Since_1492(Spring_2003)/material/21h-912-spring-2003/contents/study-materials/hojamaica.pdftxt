Jamaica 

Inhabited by Arawak Indians—Columbus comes in 1494. Spanish control until 1655— 
then the British. 
Sugarworks—Jamaica—use waterpowered mills fed by elaborate aquaducts. 
Average plantation size in 17th century was 100 acres—twice that by 18th.  In 1774 
Jamaica’s 680 sugar plantations averaged 441 acres, with some as large as 2000. 
Jamaica was so specialized in sugar production that it relied on food imports. 
Large amount of deforestation and the end of many indigenous species—by 18th c almost 
all animals and crops were European in origin and later African, e.g. okra, black-
eyed peas, yams, sorghum, millet, and mangoes. 
Slaves—great gang made of the strongest did the heaviest work and the grass gang of 
kids supervised by an elderly did light tasks. Women form majority of field 
laborers. Old women take care of toddlers. 
Slaveships brought twice as many male slaves as female slaves from Africa. 
Poor nutrition and overwork meant that many women did not carry children to term— 
therefore there was not a high rate of natural increase. 
About 1/3 of slaves died during process of seasoning—becoming accustomed to the new 
environment. 
Maroon communities existed in the interior of Jamaica and Hispanola.
