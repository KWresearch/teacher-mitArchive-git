Ch’ien Lung’s Reply to George III of 1793: 
“We, by the Grace of Heaven, Emperor, instruct the King
of England to take note of our charge.
Although your country, O King, lies in the far oceans,
yet inclining your heart toward civilization you have
specifically sent an envoy respectfully to present a state
message, and sailing the seas he has come to our Court to
kowtow and to present congratulations for the imperial
birthday, and also to present local products, thereby
showing your sincerity...
The Celestial Emperor, ruling all the four seas [i.e.,
the world], simply concentrates on carrying out the affairs
of Government properly, and does not value rare and precious
things... In fact, the virtue and power of the Celestial
Dynasty has penetrated afar to the myriad kingdoms, which
have come to render homage, and so all kinds of precious
things from ‘over mountain and sea’ have been collected
here, things which your chief envoy and others have seen for
themselves. Nonetheless we have never valued ingenious
articles, nor do we have the slightest need for your
country’s manufactures.” 

Poetic lines composed by the Emperor Ch’ien L’ung on the
occasion of Lord Macartney’s visit in 1793: 
“Now England is paying homage... 

My Ancestors’ merit and virtue must have reached their

distant shores. 
Though their tribute is commonplace, my heart approves
sincerely.
Curios, and the boasted ingenuity of their devices, I prize
not. 
Though what they bring is meager, yet,
In my kindness to men from afar I make generous return,
Wanting to preserve my good health and power.”
