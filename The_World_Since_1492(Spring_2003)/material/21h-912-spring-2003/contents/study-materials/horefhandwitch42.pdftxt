Week 4 

Protestant Reformation & European Rivalries 
Introduction 
Previously, the Catholic Church tolerated and embraced a wide range of practices that all fell 
under the rubric of Christianity. As discussed in week 2, there existed syncretism: cults, 
mysticism, saint worship, pagan rituals cloaked in Christian garb, etc. Mysticism was the only 
way for lay people to experience religion directly. It also opened up opportunities for women: i.e. 
you can be a mystic, but not a priest. There were large numbers of female mystics in the 14th and 
15th centuries--e.g. Joan of Arc (d.1456). 
Precursors to Reformation: 
Rise in urban literacy--allows people to read the Bible on their own--before focus of religion was 
on the ritual of the sacraments and easy lessons, e.g. 7 deadly sins. 
One of the reasons for the rise in literacy was improvement in paper technology--13th and 14th 
centuries--and the development of movable type in the 15th century. 
A related development was reading glasses, which enabled those with poor vision to read. 
A movement called Brothers of the Common Life, later known as Modern Devotion encouraged 
religious life outside formal religious structures. It began in the late 14th century in the 
Netherlands and spread throughout N Europe. The Imitation of Christ, written in 1425, 
summarized the philosophy of the movement. 
The rise of humanism in Renaissance Italy (15th century--spread N&W thereafter)--movement 
which involved the self-conscious idea of entering a new age: the ancient world was 
distinct from the medieval one, and people were embarking on another phase. This 
movement involved the copy, preservation, and study of ancient texts. 
Abuses of the Church 
There were large numbers of priests who did not satisfy the obligations of priesthood: illiterate, 
ignorant, and not necessarily celibate. 
There are Bishops who don't even live in the territory for which they are in charge. 
Accumulation of revenue utilizing less than legitimate means: sale of high church offices and sale 
of indulgences. In the 14th century Pope Clement VII proclaimed the existence of a 
"treasury of merit" which could be dispensed at the Pope's discretion. It was on this basis 
that the Church could sell letters of indulgence covering works of satisfaction owed by 
penitents. About a hundred years later, the Pope extended indulgences to purgatory such 
that a person could pay not only for their present and future sins, but also the sins of 
relatives suffering in purgatory. 
Martin Luther (d. 1534) 
He was born to a simple miner's family in what today is central Germany. He was fixated by the 
idea of guilt/evil. Consequently he spent a lot of time thinking about the use and abuse of 
indulgences. Originally schooled as a lawyer--a stepping stone to public office--he joined 
an Augustinian monastery after being thrown to the ground during a thunderstorm. He 
begins the reformation in 1517 by nailing his 95 theses against indulgences to the door of 
a Church in Wittenberg. 
His message can be condensed into three main ideas. Authority of Scripture--the Bible is the sole 
foundation of Christian thought--not what other people say about it. Justification by 
Faith--More faith, less ritual--keeps only Baptism and Eucharist. Priesthood of Believers-
-no separation between the lay people and the priests--no need for celibacy--no miracle in 
mass--language of the believers should be the vernacular--translates Bible into German. 
Spin-offs, Responses, & Consequences 

Zwingli (d. 1531)--likes Luther's simplicity. Belief that man is good, but needs constant 
correction and reminders to stay that way. 
Anabaptists--while Zwingli and Luther see some role for church authority, these radical 
Protestants take things one step further. They want to return to the simplicity of the 
Church in the time of Christ--adult baptism, communal property, etc. 
Calvin--discuss in class--predestination--much larger and longer lasting impact than Luther. 
Counter-Reformation--Reform against the worst examples of corruption and extreme repression 
of heterodoxy via the Inquisition. Catholic orders, e.g. Jesuits, arise to emphasize good 
works and community service. 
Catholicism and Protestantism become almost like two major international parties which can 
intervene in and complicate local disputes. Watch as people become more concerned with 
their allegiance to their state rather than their religion. A strong monarchy and a strong 
church will support each other, and the most effective monarchs place political objectives 
before religious ones. 
Impact on Women & Family 
Protestantism places a high degree of emphasis on the family. One did not have to pledge his or 
her virginity to God to achieve a higher state of religiousity. 
While there existed the notion of an equality of believers and a high degree of individualism, this 
did not mean equality in marriage. The husband and wife and complementary roles. 
Sexual fidelity was demanded by both sexes. The main function of sex is procreation, but 
recreational sex is OK within the bounds of marriage. 
There is no place for women as pastors, eliminating a space that had existed in Catholocism for 
nuns and Saints. 

Charles V & Protestants 
Charles was just a teenager in 1516 when he ascended to the Spanish (Castile & Aragon) throne 
as Charles I--he was schooled in the Netherlands and did not even speak Castilian 
Spanish. He had trouble getting his subjects to accept him, and when his Grandfather 
died, it created the opportunity for becoming Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V. He 
borrowed money from Fugger banking family (Augsburg) to bribe the electors (see 
below). See chart for geneology and land. 
As the old adage goes, the Holy Roman Empire was neither holy nor Roman. It had been 
dominated by the Austrian branch of the Habsburg family since the 13th century. The 
empire consisted of 2000 imperial knights, some of whom owned no more than a few 
acres of land; 50 ecclesiastical and 30 secular princes; more than 100 counts; 77 prelates; 
and 66 cities all of thich were politically independent but subordinate to the emperor. The 
unifying institution was the Diet, which had 3 assemblies: reps. of the cities, the princes, 
and the electors (the seven princes who decided who would be the emperor). 
Early in his reign (1521), Charles takes a firm stand against Protestantism. About a year after 
Luther had been excommunicated, he issues the Edict of Worms, the secular equivalent 
of excommunication. 
After dealing with difficulties on the Iberian peninsula, Charles had to deal with peasant uprisings 
in Germany--part of HRE--where peasants correlated getting rid of church hierarchy with 
getting rid of feudal hierarchy. Charles with the help of German princes, who are 
Catholic and Protestant (many convert to get Church land), brutally crush this rebellion. 
Because Charles is facing a two-front war with the French and the Turks and needs the support 
from the HRE, he allows individual princes to enforce or not enforce sanctions against 
Protestantism that he created in 1521. With respect to the French there is the dynastic 
issue relating to Burgundy (see geneological chart), and the fact that Francis competed 
with Charles for the title of HRE. The Turks have completed conquest of the Balkans and 

the Middle East--push deep into Hungarian territory--taking advantage of hostility 
between Charles and Francis. 
Wars on all of these fronts sap the coffers of the royal treasury--Aragon with its stronger Cortes 
avoided the brunt--too much pressure put on Castile and later the Netherlands. 
Charles abdicates in 1556 in debt and weary from all of these battles. He leaves his E European 
holdings to his brother Ferdinand, who takes the title HRE. 
Philip II 
Son of Charles V & Isabella of Portugal. Before his father abdicated in 1556, he had already 
received his family's holdings in Italy and the Netherlands. With his father's retirement, 
he gets Castile, Aragon, and New Spain. From his mother's side he inherits Portuguese 
throne and its Asian outposts in 1580. A master of strategic marriage, he first marries his 
Portuguese cousin as a teenager. Just two years prior to his father's abdication, he marries 
Mary Tudor (see chart), aka "Bloody Mary". After her death, he tried desperately to 
marry her half sister Elizabeth I, but she would not have him. He then tries to use 
Elizabeth's cousin Mary Queen of Scots to bring her down, but Elizabeth executes Mary 
in 1587. The big showdown comes in 1588 when Elizabeth's navy defeats his armada. He 
inherited not only debts from his father, but also war with the Ottoman Turks. With some 
help from the Pope, he is able to defeat them in the Mediterranean in 1571. 
He must also crush the rebellion in the Netherlands. 
He marries Princess Elizabeth of France (originally betrothed to his son), and felt the need to 
interfere in a French succession crisis (on the Catholic side, of course). He sends troops 
to France (1589) after a Calvinist king takes the throne (Henry IV), but the people rally 
behind their king, who eventually issues the Edict of Nantes, a guarantee of religious 
freedom (1598). 

More Context on Issues Related to Women & Witchcraft 
The Woman Question & Demographic Change 
Sometime around the 15th century, the “woman question” arose in the prosperous cities of Italy 
and Flanders. The Woman Question was what to do with lay, unmarried urban women. 
After the plague (1348), they had been denied access to guilds and a slow decline in their wages. 
Pre-plague—80% of men’s and post-plague over 200 years went to 40%. 
There were new definitions of public and private. Before this time there was no separation 
between the household unit and the unit of production, i.e. no separation between family 
and work. Medieval clothing was not particularly gender specific until some time after 
1300. The plague induced conspicuous consumption and elite creates sumptuary laws to 
regulate clothing. 
The structure of the population was also changing. Husbands were becoming more expensive— 
dowries rise between the 12th and 20th centuries. Women found it more difficult to marry 
a man of their social status. Women often married in their teens to husbands in their 30s. 
The difficulty of the times meant that there were young, unmarried women outside the 
convent and there were more widows. 
How do you control women who are out of the control of men? This was the “Woman Question”. 
Witchcraft and spiritualism/mysticism were two possible outlets, which were sometimes related. 
Protestantism with its emphasis on gender complementarity heightened tensions. 
Accusation of Witchcraft: Writers and judges came up with consistent guidelines, claiming that 
they were observing something “new”, which allowed them to get around older Catholic 
rejections of the reality of witches. Witches were depraved human beings, usually 
women, who made a covenant with the devil and participated in nocturnal Sabbath 
ceremonies in which they renounced and derided Christ, the Church, and the sacraments. 
Witches could fly and they committed sexual excesses with one another and the Devil. 

They could also change their appearance—turn into animals, e.g. wolves, cats, or mice. 
Witchcraft could be defined as a combination of sorcery—some sort of supernatural 
power, and heresy—repudiation of Christian beliefs. 
Local elites were the ones who investigated claims and decided whether they merited state 
attention—i.e. it was largely out of the hands of religious authorities. The secularization 
of the process led to an increase in the number of executions. 
Religion, Community, Church, & State 
Reformers realized that reforming the church would mean breaking from the Catholic Church to 
found a truer faith—Catholics, of course, viewed this action as deviating from the true 
faith. These reformers gained the support of European princes who saw religious change 
as an opportunity to increase their own power, esp. in the HRE, where the Hapsburgs had 
a monopoly on power and vigorously defended the Catholic Church. 
Protestant princes insisted that their subjects had to follow their faith. Furthermore, they could 
seize lands belonging to the Catholic Church. 
While in a united Christendom, Catholic states and rulers vied for the favor of the pope, but 
Protestants had no higher appeal than that of their ruler. 
As states grew and enforced their vision of Christian doctrine, witchcraft became a major state 
and religious crime. 
Protestantism & Changing Views on Poverty 
Medieval Christians did not view poverty with the same disdain that Protestant reformers did. In 
the past, giving alms to the poor was seen as a route to salvation. According to Calvinist 
and Puritan doctrine, however, poverty was seen as a moral flaw.
