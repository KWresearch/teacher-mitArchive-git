Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilleus 
and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians, -- 
hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls 
of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting 
of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished 
since that time when first there stood in division of conflict 
Atreus' son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus. 
What god was it then set them together in bitter collision? 
Zeus' son and Leto's, Apollo, who in anger at the king drove 
the foul pestilence along the host, and the people perished, 
since Atreus' son had dishonoured Chryses, priest of Apollo, 
when he came beside the fast ships of the Achaians to ransom 
back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding  
in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo 
who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians, 
but above all Atreus' two sons, the marshals of the people.
