Final Exam 
Part II:  Passage Identifications   Value: 40 points 
Allotted Time: 60 minutes 
 
Choose EIGHT passages  from below,  identify  the  title of  the work and  the author  for each 
as well as the speaker and represented audience (where applicable), explain the significance 
and the implications of the quotation in context, and then discuss how the passage functions 
in  relation  to  the  narrative  structure  as  a  whole.    Where  the  works  themselves  are 
theoretical instead of narrative, explain the consequences and implications of the excerpted 
statement as it relates to narratives. 
 
A. 
"My  lord,"  he  said,  "you  are  preparing  to  fight  against men  who  dress  in  leather  --  both 
breeches and everything else.  So rough is their country that they eat as much as they have, never 
as much as  they want.   They drink no wine but only water.   They have no good  things at all, not 
even  figs  for dessert.   Now  if you conquer  this people, what will you get  from  them, seeing  they 
have  nothing  for  you  to  take?    And  if  they  conquer  you,  think  how  many  good  things  you  will 
lose;  for  once  they  taste  the  luxuries  of  Lydia  they  will  hold  on  to  them  so  tightly  that  nothing 
will  make  them  let  go.    I  am  thankful  myself  that  the  gods  have  never  put  it  into  the  Persians' 
heads to attack the Lydians."

All  these  consequences  are  contained  in  the  definition  that  the  worker  is  related  to  the 
product  of  his  labour  as  to  an  alien  object.    For  on  this  premise  it  is  clear  that  the  more  the 
worker  spends  himself,  the  more  powerful  the  alien  objective  world  becomes  which  he  creates 
over-against himself,  the poorer he himself—his  inner world—becomes,  the  less belongs  to him 
as his own.

But in forming him nature had so badly erred  
that he never gave any thought to love. 
There wasn't a lady or a maid on earth, 
no matter how noble, or how beautiful, 
who wouldn't have willingly granted him her love, 
had he asked for it. 
Many maids asked him, 
but he wasn't interested in such things; 
no one could discover in him  
the slightest desire to love. 
Therefore both friends and strangers 
gave him up for lost. 

I pity you, children.  You have come full of longing, 
but I have known the story before you told it 
only too well.  I know you are all sick, 
yet there is not one of you, sick though you are, 
that is as sick as I myself. 
Your several sorrows each have single scope 
and touch but one of you.  My spirit groans 
for city and myself and you at once.

The  access  of  pleasure  I  experienced  in  the moment  of  triumph,  and which  I  still  feel,  is 
nothing  but  the  delicious  sensation  of  glory.    I  encourage myself  in  this  belief  because  it  spares 
me  the  humiliation  of  thinking  that  I might  in  any way  have been  dependent  on  the  very  slave  I 
had  subjected  to  my  will;  that  I  might  not  find  in  myself  alone  everything  I  require  for  my 
happiness;  and  that  the  capacity  to  give  me  enjoyment  of  it  in  all  its  intensity  might  be  the 
prerogative of any one woman to the exclusion of all others.

Accordingly  she  threw  herself  into  the  water,  and  said,  In  thy  name,  O  my  Lord  Jesus 
Christ,  I  am  this  last  day  baptized.    The women  and  the  people,  seeing  this,  cried  out,  and  said, 
Do  not  throw  yourself  in  the  water.    And  the  governor  himself  cried  out,  to  think  that  the  fish 
(sea-calves) were like to devour so much beauty. 
 
G. 
This  distinctive  feature  manifests  itself  preeminently  in  what  might  be  called  historical 
inversion.    The  essence  of  this  inversion  is  found  in  the  fact  that  mythological  and  artistic 
thinking  locates  such  categories  as  purpose,  ideal,  justice,  perfection,  the  harmonious  condition 
of man  and  society  and  the  like  in  the  past.   Myths  about  paradise,  a Golden Age,  a  heroic  age, 
an  ancient  truth,  as well  as  the  later  concepts  of  a  "state  of  nature,"  of  natural,  innate  rights  and 
so on, are all expressions of this historical inversion.  To put it in somewhat simplified terms, we 
might  say  that  a  thing  that  could  and  in  fact  must  only  be  realized  exclusively  in  the  future  is 
here  portrayed  as  something  out  of  the  past,  a  thing  that  is  in  no  sense  part  of  the  past's  reality, 
but a thing that is in its essence a purpose, an obligation. 
 
H. 
If  you  reply  that  the men who  compose  such  books write  them  as  fiction,  and  so  are  not 
obliged  to  look  into  fine  points  or  truths,  I  should  reply  that  the more  it  resembles  the  truth  the 
better the fiction, and the more probable and possible it is, the better it pleases.   Fictions have to 
match  the  minds  of  their  readers,  and  to  be  written  in  such  a  way  that,  by  tempering  the 
impossibilities,  moderating  excesses,  and  keeping  judgement  in  the  balance,  they  may  so 
astonish, hold, excite, and entertain, that wonder and pleasure go hand in hand.  None of this can 
be  achieved  by  anyone  departing  from  verisimilitude  or  from  that  imitation  of  nature  in  which 
lies the perfection of all that is written.

For he made love to her himself, and dishonoured his own wife, 
my mother; who was forever taking my knees and entreating me 
to lie with this mistress instead so that she would hate the old man. 
I was persuaded and did it; and my father when he heard of it straightway 
called down his curses, and invoked against me the dreaded furies 
that I might never have any son born of my seed to dandle 
on my knees; and the divinities, Zeus of the underworld 
and Persephone the honoured goddess, accomplished his curses. 
Then I took it into my mind to cut him down with the sharp bronze, 
but some of the immortals checked my anger, reminding me 
of rumour among the people and men's maledictions repeated, 
that I might not be called a parricide among the Achaians. 
But now no more could the heart in my breast be ruled entirely 
to range still among these halls when my father was angered.

From  every  element  in  a  dream's  content  associative  threads  branch  out  in  two  or  more 
directions; every situation in a dream seems to be put together out of two or more impressions or 
experiences.   For  instance,  I once had  a dream of  a  sort of  swimming-pool,  in which  the bathers 
were  scattering  in  all directions;  at one point on  the  edge of  the pool  someone was  standing  and 
bending  towards one of  the people bathing, as  though  to help her out of  the water.   The situation 
was  put  together  from  a memory  of  an  experience  I  had  had  at  puberty  and  from  two  paintings, 
one of which I had seen shortly before the dream. 
 
K. 
Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound -- the tumultuous motion of 
the  heart,  and,  in  my  ears,  the  sound  of  its  beating.    Then  a  pause  in  which  all  is  blank.    Then 
again  sound,  and motion,  and  touch  --  a  tingling  sensation  pervading my  frame.   Then  the mere 
consciousness  of  existence,  without  thought  --  a  condition  which  lasted  long.    Then  very 
suddenly,  thought,  and  shuddering  terror,  and  earnest  endeavor  to  comprehend  my  true  state.  
Then  a  strong  desire  to  lapse  into  insensibility.   Then  a  rushing  revival  of  soul  and  a  successful 
effort  to move.   And  now  a  full memory  of  the  trial, of  the  judges, of  the  sable draperies, of  the 
sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon.  Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that 
a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall. 
 
 
Part III: Short-Answer Questions   
 
Choose TWO of the following questions to answer. 
 
1. 
Testing  becomes  an  important  element  in  many  stories.    Explain  how  tests  operate  in 
different types of stories and what they are designed to demonstrate. 
 
2. 
 
 
Part IV: Essay Question 
 
 
Choose  ONE  of  the  following  topics  and  write  a  comprehensive  response  that  addresses 
three of  the narratives you have studied  this semester, that carefully   defines  the key  terms 
you are using, and that provides clear and consistent criteria for reaching decisions. 
 
 
1. 
In  the  process  of  story-telling,  the  structures  of  "Time"  and  "Space"  play  a  critical, 
determinative  role  in  coordinating  information,  shaping  narrative,  and  controlling  meaning.  
Consider  the  different  effects  that  these  parameters  can  have  by  examining  how  time  and  space 
are  organized  differently  in  three  different  narratives.    Think  about  the  various  advantages  and 
disadvantages involved in each choice of spatial and temporal structure. 
 
Events  are  random,  haphazard,  and  unforeseen  occurrences.    It  is  their  very  novelty  and 
2. 
unexpectedness  that  make  events  noteworthy.    Discourse,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  foreordained 
and pre-determined  logical structure  that gets super-imposed on narrative  in order  to make sense

of experience.   It is the regularity, familiarity, and predictability of discourse that make narrative 
comprehensible.    Consider  how  these  two  opposing  functions  of  story-telling  are  balanced  and 
combined  in  three  different  types  of  narrative  (epic,  tragedy,  history,  romance,  novel, 
Bildungsroman,  horror  story,  detective  fiction,  fairy  tales,  science  fiction)  and  how  different 
meanings are generated by the different discursive structures employed.
