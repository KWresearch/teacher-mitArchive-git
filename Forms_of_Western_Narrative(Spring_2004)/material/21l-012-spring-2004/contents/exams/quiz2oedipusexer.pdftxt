21L.012 Forms of Western Narrative  
 
 
1. 
The  conventions  of  tragic  drama  in  Ancient  Athens  assigned  all  the  speaking  parts  in  a 
play,  aside  from  the Chorus  and  the Leader  of  the Chorus  (Choragos),  to  just  three male  actors.   
If Sophocles' Oedipus  the King  is broken down  into  six different episodes  (separated by  stasima 
or  choral  odes  performed  by  the  chorus),  consider  how  the  speaking  parts  would  have  been 
distributed  among  the  different  actors,  given  that  the  same  role  would  always  be  played  by  the 
same actor and  that enough  time has  to be allocated for changes in costumes and masks between 
appearances.    Note  that,  in  episode  #1,  the  role  of  the  Priest  would  have  been  played  by  the 
Leader of the Chorus rather than one of the principal actors.   [40 points]

Notice  the  roles  that  have  been  assigned  to Actors  1  and  3  in  each  column,  and  consider 
what  those  roles  have  in  common  with  the  other  roles  in  the  same  column.    Pay  particular 
attention  to  the  plot  function  that  each  role  performs  in  each  episode,  and  then  explain what  the 
common function is for each actor.

What  narrative  effects  are  achieved  by  distributing  the  story-telling  among  several 
different performers instead of one single performer as in the case of epic singers?  [30 points]
