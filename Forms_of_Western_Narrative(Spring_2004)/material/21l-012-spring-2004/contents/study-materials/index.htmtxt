Some Pointers for Writing Papers in Literature Courses
**** Exposition ****
   1. Limit your argument to a single, manageable topic that you can easily and
      reliably control. You are not expected to know everything about
      everything. Universal assumptions are usually impossible to prove
      conclusively, and they can simply be invalidated by just one single
      counter-example. Start with a specific observation and work from there.
      It is easiest to move from the concrete to the abstract, from the
      particular instance to the general principle.

   2. Precisely define the key terms you are using. Words have different
      connotations in different contexts. The more abstract the word, the more
      it can be interpreted in different ways. Explain how you are limiting the
      use of your terms, so that your reader does not supply the wrong
      associations. You want your reader to draw the same conclusions that you
      do based on a common understanding of what is at stake. Do not quote
      dictionaries as the sources of your definitions unless they are supplying
      the exact definitions you wish to use in your own specific context.

      Â 
   3. Establish working criteria for making judgments. If you are trying to
      demonstrate that a text fulfills certain functions or expectations,
      explain what those functions or expectations are and how you would decide
      whether or not your standards are being fulfilled.

      Â 
   4. Avoid making broad and vague generalizations. Do not assume that your
      reader will believe anything you say simply because you say it.
      Â 
**** Evidence ****
   1. Provide specific examples to support your claims. Select the most
      appropriate passages from your text to illustrate the precise point you
      are trying to make.

      Â 
   2. You may quote passages directly or paraphrase what is happening in the
      text at that particular moment, but in either case you should supply
      references to the edition you are using and the specific page number
      where your example occurs.

      Â 
   3. If you are quoting passages from the text, short citations of three lines
      or fewer should be included in the main body of your paragraph within
      quotation marks and the page reference bracketed at the end or footnoted.
      Longer citations should be indented and single-spaced to set them apart
      from the rest of your paragraph.

      Â 
   4. Interpret the passage you are citing to demonstrate how it illustrates
      your point. Quotations do not speak for themselves. They need to be
      explicated and integrated into the rest of your argument.

      Â 
   5. Any ideas you receive from outside sources (i.e. any ideas that are not
      originally your own) need to be fully referenced and documented with
      citations and bibliography.

      Â 
   6. References may be either footnoted or endnoted.
**** Development ****
   1. Once you have established a clear perspective on your subject, be
      consistent and try to maintain it until you have exhausted everything you
      have to say about the subject. Do not switch: (a) between subjects, or
      (b) between points of view, or (c) between levels of discourse, or (d)
      between levels of diction unless you clearly indicate to your reader what
      you are going to do next. Otherwise, it can be very disorienting for your
      reader to follow along.

      Â 
   2. Create smooth transitions and logical connections between different ideas
      and different parts of your argument. Consider whether what you have just
      said is sufficient information to lead you to your next observation.
      Linking words like "because," "since," "while," "when," "as," "by," "by
      means of," "consequently," "as a result," "for this reason," "through,"
      "thus," and "therefore" can be useful for drawing out relationships
      between ideas. Transitional sentences are necessary for connecting
      paragraphs. Do not continue your line of argument using demonstrative or
      personal pronouns ("this," "that," "these," "those," "it," "he," "she,"
      "they") unless the antecedent has been well established.

      Â 
   3. Develop your thoughts as if you were answering a series of questions,
      moving from "what?" to "where and when?" to "who or by whom?" to "how?"
      and "why?." First of all, you need to explain what the phenomenon is that
      you are observing. Then, try to determine under what conditions the
      phenomeon is taking place and how exactly it manifests itself under these
      conditions. Decide what agency is involved: who might be controlling or
      promoting the phenomenon and who might be affected by it. Finally, you
      need to think about causality: why is the phenomenon taking place at this
      particular juncture and what purpose or function is it serving? You
      probably will not be able to answer all of these questions with every
      assignment you undertake, but you should at least be thinking about them.

      Â 
   4. Consider how you are saying relates to your overall argument. Some
      information you may find curious, interesting, or nice to know, but
      unless it is clearly relevant to the topic you have chosen, do not
      include it in your paper. You can always save it for another time.

      Â 
   5. Show your reader the different stages of thinking that led you to reach
      the conclusions you have made. Do not make your reader do the work of
      drawing connections and conclusions for himself or herself. That is your
      job.
**** Conclusion ****
   1. Explain why your findings are significant, meaningful, and relevant. Your
      reader needs to know why it is that what you have discovered is useful
      and how it might be applicable to other situations. Consider the
      consequences and implications of your conclusions.
**** General Instructions ****
   1. Double-space your paper except for indented citations, which should be
      single-spaced. Use 12-point type with 1-inch margins on every side.

      Â 
   2. Provide a meaningful title for your paper, and include your name in the
      header or footer of every page.

      Â 
   3. Titles of full texts should be underlined or italicized. Articles or
      short stories require quotation marks.

      Â 
   4. Number all of your pages.
