Character and the requirements of narrative function 
 
•  Characters, in both Open and Closed Forms of Narrative, may be 
conceived initially as Open Slots, Empty Shells, Functional 
Place-Holders, not Fully Formed Persons with their own 
Individual Characteristics and Psychological Dimensions 
•  Characters serve as Vehicles for the Action of the Story 
•  In Pre-Modern Narrative Forms especially, Characters Remain 
Flat and Fully Exteriorized 
•  Roles already Pre-Determined by Considerations External to the 
Characters themselves 

 
Characters serve as Vehicles for the Action of the Story 
– Active, in Pursuing Goals & Objectives 
– Passive, in Being Acted Upon by Others 
– Centers for the Narrative Conflict 

 
In Pre-Modern Narrative Forms especially, Characters Remain Flat 
and Fully Exteriorized 
•All Surface  
•No Depth  
•No Interiority 
•No Subjectivity 
 
•A Fully Integrated View of Society allows Characters to be   seen 
only in terms of their Public Participation in Collective  Pursuits 
that Everyone may Identify with Equally 
 
•Qualities and Experiences that Distinguish Individuals from the 
 
Rest of the Group are of little Narrative Interest 
•The Segregation of Society into Different Classes and   Categories 
Allows Characters to Differentiate Themselves and to Move into 
Different Social Spaces where They Change  ‘Persona’ 
Accordingly 
 

Character and the requirements of narrative function 
•  Roles already Pre-Determined by Considerations External to the 
Characters themselves 

–  Characters’ Situation, Status, and Positional Relation to Other 
Characters 

 
–  Specific Functions Required of Characters by the Formal 
Conventions of the Narrative 

 
–  Different Narrative Genres Have Different Narrative 
Functions to Perform and thus Generate Different Types of 
Characters 

 

 

 
 
The Formation of Character Types Based on Narrative Functions: 
Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale. 

 
•   The Formal Structure of Folktales, though primitive, is 
 
Instructive because of the Common Elements shared with 
  Related Genres 
•   Tales can be Broken Down into Discrete Episodes by Function 
•   The Trajectory of the Narrative Axis is Always Constant 
 
The Formal Structure of Folktales, though primitive, is  Instructive 
because of the Common Elements shared with Related Genres 

–  Greek Novels, Chivalric Romances, Picaresques 
–  Quest Narratives, Fantasy Novels, Science Fiction, Detective 
Fiction 
–  Action/Adventure Stories and Games 

 
Character and the requirements of narrative function 
The Formation of Character Types Based on Narrative Functions:  
Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale. 
 
Tales can be Broken Down into Discrete Episodes by Function 
 

–  The Same Constituent Functions Recur Regularly in All Tales  
–  The Number of Different Functions is Limited 
–  The Sequence in which Functions can occur is Invariable 
–  The Same Functions, however, can be Repeated with 
Variations within the Same Tale and Recombined in a 
Potentially Infinite Series 
–  Different Functions have Specific Character Types Associated 
with them 

 
The Trajectory of the Narrative Axis is Always Constant. 
–  The Closed Formal Structure of the Narrative Always Aims 
toward a Specific Destination that Limits the Range of 
Functions to be Performed and the Available Repertory of 
Characters to Perform them 
–  Hero must depart from Home Base and Return at the End 
–  Departure motivated (1) by Loss or (2) due to some Lack or 
Insufficiency 
–  Return is only possible after (1) Restitution is Made or     (2) 
the Lack has been Liquidated 
–  Any Number of Intervening Contests with the Same Structural 
Function may Occur

Character and the requirements of narrative function 
 
  The Formal Properties of Characters are dictated by the 
Conventional Functions they perform 

–  Heroes are Generated to Endure Trials (to determine their 
Strength, Worth, Intelligence) and are Already Equipped with 
the Requisite Skills 
–  Villains are Generated to “Disturb the Peace of a Happy 
Family, to Cause some Form of Misfortune, Damage, or 
Harm” 
–  Destination Characters are Introduced in Order to be Rescued 
by Heroes 
–  Donor Characters and Magical Helpers are Generated to test 
Heroes and Provide Assistance in Quests 
–  Secondary Characters may be Generated to Mirror Existing 
Functions 

 

 

 

Character and the requirements of narrative function 
 
  Characters Remain Constant with Respect to Function 
 

–  Heroes may be Active (Seekers) or Passive (Victims) without 
Altering the Necessary Trajectory of Narrative Functions, Just 
the Sphere of Action 

 
–  The Particular Attributes of Individual Characters are Purely 
Incidental and Remain Inconsequential to the Story 

 
–  Characters Remain Undeveloped in that They Never Undergo 
Personal Transformations as a Result of the Action and They 
Never Experience Internal Change

•  Characters can finally be Differentiated according to the 
  Quality of  their own Individual Experiences  
•  Quality of Experience is Measured by the Perceived Impact upon 
  Character of the Temporal and Spatial Distribution of 
  Narrative Events 
•  Narrative Events become Consequential and Cumulative in the 
  Ongoing Development of Characters 
•  Characters can undergo Substantive Changes within 
  Themselves 
•  the Determinants of Character move from External to Internal 
Conditions as Characters Begin to Retain Impressions of 
Previous Events 

 
•  The Temporal and Spatial Mechanisms through which Events 
Get Processed Differ from Genre to Genre and Affect both the 
Types of Characters that are Produced and the Eventual Shapes 
that Characters Take

of Character Formation 

 

 

–  Variations in the Temporal Dimensions of Narrative 
–  Variations in the Spatial Dimensions of Narrative 

Variations in the Temporal Dimensions of Narrative 
 
Characters’ Experience of Time can be Altered: 
•  Narrative Flow 
–  Advancement or Retardation of Plot Functions 
•  Destination as Series of Functions to be Executed by 
Character 
•  Destination as Gradual Transformations in Personal 
Character 
•  Coherence  
–  Fragmentary Incidents or Continuous Unfolding 
•  Accidental Occurrences or Coordinated Actions 
•  Adventure Time or Real Time 
•  Duration 
–  Dilation or Contraction of Narration 
•  Varying Degrees of Narrative Emphasis for Subjective 
Development 
•  Contingency 
–  Events as Digressive or Developmental in relation to 
Character 
•  Temporal Orientation 
–  Vertical or Horizontal Axis 
•  Eternalized or Transitory Contextualizations 

 
•  Space Takes on the Attributes of Human Social Relationships 
–  Abstracted Space: Undifferentiated except for the Relative 
Proximity or Distance between Characters 
–  Symbolic Space: Where Archetypal Figures are Encountered 
•  Woodlands, Cities, Homes, Dungeons, the Open Road, 
Otherworlds 
–  Open Spaces: Where Characters Assume their Public Roles 
–  Closed Spaces: Where Characters meet Privately & Intimately 
–  Transitional Spaces: Where Unexpected Encounters take place 
on the way to Characters’ ultimate Destinations 
–  Socialized Spaces: Differentiated by the Types of Characters 
that might Occupy or Inhabit them 
–  Alien Territories or Familiar Landscapes 
–  Domestic Situations or Communal Locations 
–  Spaces Associated with Professional or Social Classes 
•  Characters Change their Identities as they Move between

Epic 
Homer, Iliad, Book IX, tr. Richard Lattimore.    [8th Century BCE] 
 
 
  For my mother Thetis the goddess of the silver feet tells me 
  I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death.  Either, 
 
if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans, 
  my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting; 
  but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers, 
the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life 
 
 
left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly. 
 
Epic 
•  Socially Homogeneous Environment 
•  Holistic and Unified Worldview Based on Common Enterprise 
•  Located in Public Space of Public Actions 
•  Characters have Simple Motivations Determined by Roles 
–  Honor 
–  Glory 
–  Retribution 
–  Justice 
•  Heroes Remain Idealized and Generalized Types 
•  Character Conflicts are Positional not Personal 
–  Individual Characters make Critical Choices Between Action 
and Inaction that will Ultimately Affect the Outcome of 
Events 
–  But these Decisions are Equally Common to all other 
Characters in the Same Situation, not just Select Individuals 
•  The Concept of Fate Pre-Determines both the Outcome of 
Events and the Functions that Characters Perform 

 
Tragedy 
Sophocles, Oedipus Rex, tr. David Grene.            [442 BCE] 
 
 
OEDIPUS: I pity you, children.  You have come full of longing, 
but I have known the story before you told it 
 
 
all too well.  I know you are all sick, 
 
 
 
 
yet there is not one of you, sick though you are, 
 
 
that is as sick as I myself. 
 
  Your several sorrows each have single scope 
and touch but one of you.  My spirit groans 
 
 
 
 
for city and myself and you at once. 
 
Tragedy 
Similarities to Epic Conventions 
•  Still Located in Public Space of Public Actions 
•  Characters have Simple Motivations Determined by Roles 
•  Character Conflicts are Positional, not Personal 
•  The Concept of Fate Predetermines the Outcome of Events 
Despite the Actions that Characters Take 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Distinctive Departures from Epic Conventions 
•  Fates are Fully Individualized, not Commonly Shared 
•  The Violent and Painful Downfall of an Exalted Figurehead is 
Designed to Evoke Pity in Spectators 
•  Recognition of a Character’s True Identity, rather than his or her 
Assumed Identity, is Fundamental to the Tragic Plot 
•  Character is still Relational, but a Theatricalized Sense of 
Identity -- as a Distinct Socialized Role to be Performed -- now 
Emerges 

 
Comedy 
Terence, The Eunuch, Act II.             [161 BCE] 
 
PARMENIO:  We’re doing something we could get flogged for! 
CHAEREA:  What is there to get flogged for, if I am just 
getting myself dragged off to a whorehouse and all its 
punishments, all those dreadful girls who have always been 
despising us and our youth and are constantly tormenting us in 
every possible way?  Why, now I am only paying them back and 
deceiving them for how we have always been deceived by   them.  
Wouldn’t you be all for it if the same thing were being done to 
my father and he was being fooled by my tricks?  Whatever they 
find out, they will be sure to blame us for, but everyone else is 
going to think it a job well done. 

 
Comedy 
•  Socially Heterogeneous Environments, Dependent on Disparities 
between Different Classes 
•  Located in Private and Domestic Spaces  
•  Plots are Driven by Personal Self-Interest  
•  Protagonists usually Drawn from the Underprivileged Classes, 
especially Slaves and Disadvantaged Younger Sons 
•  Rogue Protagonists Seek to Gain Advantage over More 
Powerful Characters (particularly Heads of Households) by 
Resorting to their Wits and Employing Deceit, Trickery, and 
Disguise 
•  Disguise Allows Characters to Assume a Theatricalized Identity, 
to Create a Different Surface Appearance that they can 
Manipulate at will 
•  An Initial Division Emerges between the Exterior and the 
Interior of Characters 
•  In the End, Characters are always Restored to their Original 
Status 
•  Personal Fortunes Depend on Chance, Not Fate 

Hagiography 
The Acts of Paul and Thecla, IX.6-9.   [2nd Century CE] 
 
Afterwards  they  brought  out many  other wild  beasts;  but  Thecla  stood with 
her  hands  stretched  towards  heaven,  and  prayed;  and  when  she  had  done 
praying,  she  turned  about,  and  saw  a  pit  of  water,  and  said,  Now  it  is  a 
proper  time for me  to be baptized.   Accordingly she  threw herself  into  the 
water,  and  said,  In  thy  name,  O  my  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  I  am  this  last  day 
baptized.    The women  and  the  people  seeing  this,  cried  out,  and  said, Do 
not  throw yourself  into  the water.   And  the  governor  himself  cried  out,  to 
think  that  the  sea-calves  were  like  to  devour  so  much  beauty.  
Notwithstanding  all  this, Thecla  threw  herself  into  the water,  in  the  name 
of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.    But  the  sea-calves  when  they  saw  the  lighting 
and  fire, were killed,  and  swam dead upon  the  surface of  the water,  and  a 
cloud of  fire surrounded Thecla, so  that as  the beasts could not come near 
her, so the people could not see her nakedness. 

 
Hagiography 
•  Hagiographical Works (Saints’ Lives) typically Follow the 
Patterns of the Greek Novel as Discussed by Bakhtin, but with a 
Few Notable Exceptions  
•  Narratives of Travel, Where Protagonists go out Alone on a 
Journey, Leaving behind their Families and their Former 
Identities, but they do Not Return to where they started from 
•  Narratives of Conversion and Personal Transformation, 
frequently Figured in Ritual Images of Death and Rebirth, to 
Indicate the Abandonment of an Old Self and the Adoption of a 
New Self, the Abrupt Transition from One Steady State to 
Another Steady State that is Totally Different 
•  This New Self Usually comes into Opposition with the Rest of 
Society, particularly Powerful Figureheads, as the Familiar 
becomes Alien, as the Private becomes Public 
•  The Interior is Exteriorized through Confessions of Faith 
•  Adventures are Episodic and Fragmentary, focusing on the 
Exceptional, the Wondrous, the Miraculous, and Usually Ending 
in an Extraordinarily Memorable Death Scene 

Chivalric Romance 
Chrétien de Troyes, Cligès, tr. Burton Raffel.    [1177] 
 
The king’s boat, as he made the crossing, carried a single young 
man, Alexander, and only a single girl, the queen’s  companion, 
Soredamour, who had always laughed at love.  No one had ever 
heard her speak of a man worth loving, whether for beauty, 
bravery, courage, rank, or any ability.  The girl was so gracious 
and lovely that, if only she’d wanted them, she certainly should 
have been taking lessons from Love.  But it wasn’t a subject she 
wanted to study.  This state of affairs saddened Love, who began 
to seriously consider revenge for the overweening pride she 
stubbornly displayed.  Love’s aim was perfect: his arrow struck 
her right in the heart. Her face changed color, her breath caught, 
and, despite herself, she loved.  She could not keep her eyes 
from Alexander, though she knew she had to be careful of my 
lord Gawain, her brother.  How dearly she paid and did penance 
for her pride and disdain!  Love drew her a bath so burning hot 
that her heart sweated and boiled.  Alexander was fine; 
Alexander was bad; she loved him, she didn’t; she accused her 
eyes of treason, saying ‘Sight, you’ve betrayed me, escorting 
enemy invaders to my heart.  You used to be loyal, but now what 
I see hurts me.  Hurts me?  No, it helps me – but if something 
hurts me, and I go on looking, who controls my eyes?  Not me, 
I’ve lost my strength – and how little I’m worth, unable to tell 
my eyes where to look, and when – for they look all the time ...” 

 
Chivalric Romance 
 
•  Personal Transformations Effected from Outside 
–  Symbolic, Mythological Role of the God of Love 
•  External Conflicts Internalized 
–  through Images of Assault and Invasion 
–  through Figures of the Body Divided against Itself 
•  Divisions within Character no longer just between Interior and 
Exterior Identities but within Inner Self 
•  Inner Conflict Increases Character Complexity 
•  Different Sides of Conflict Indicate Tensions 
–  Between Public and Private Interests 
–  Between Family and Personal Obligations 
–  Between Past and Future Identity 
•  Inner Life of Characters brought to the Surface through the 
Theatrical Device of Soliloquy, Interior Dialogue 
•  Rest of the Narrative Shares Qualities with Epic and Greek 
Novel 

 
The Novel of Development: Bildungsroman 
Jane Austen, Pride & Prejudice, vol. II, chap. 13.  [1813] 
 
  ‘How  despicably  have  I  acted!’  she  cried.  –  ‘I, who  have  prided 
myself on my discernment! –    I, who have valued myself on my 
abilities!  who  have  often  disdained  the  generous  candour  of  my 
sister, and gratified my vanity,  in useless and blameable distrust. 
–  How  humiliating  is  this  discovery!  –  Yet,  how  just  a 
humiliation!  –  Had  I  been  in  love,  I  could  not  have  been  more 
wretchedly  blind.    But  vanity,  not  love,  has  been  my  folly.  – 
Pleased  with  the  preference  of  one,  and  offended  by  the  neglect 
of  the  other,  on  the  very  beginning  of  our  acquaintance,  I  have 
courted  prepossession  and  ignorance,  and  driven  reason  away, 
where  either  were  concerned.    Till  this  moment,  I  never  knew 
myself.’ 

 
The Novel of Development: Bildungsroman 
 
•  The Goal of Personal Advancement Cannot be Attained without 
Characters Experiencing Personal Transformations through 
ongoing Learning Processes 
•  Social Mobility of Characters between Heterogeneous Locations 
Requires Personal Distancing from Family, Familiar Situations, 
and Previous Identifications 
•  Characters Become Self-Made and Internally Motivated, as they 
become Isolated from their Traditional Communities 
•  Narrative Events have a Cumulative Effect on Characters 
•  Perspective, Which Limits Characters’ Immediate Awareness 
and Understanding at any Given Point in the Narrative, Restricts 
the Delivery of Information and Creates Suspense 
•  Changes in Perspective Result in Substantive Changes in 
Character 
•  Interior Spaces and Everyday Events Create a More Private and 
Intimate Sense of Self
