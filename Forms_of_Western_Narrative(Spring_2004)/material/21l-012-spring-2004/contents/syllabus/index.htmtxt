***** Course Description *****
This class will investigate the ways in which the formal aspects of Western
storytelling in various media have shaped both fantasies and perceptions,
making certain understandings of experience possible through the selection,
arrangement, and processing of narrative material. Surveying the field
chronologically across the major narrative genres and sub-genres from Homeric
epic through the novel and across media to include live performance, film, and
video games, we will be examining the ways in which new ideologies and
psychological insights become available through the development of various
narrative techniques and new technologies. Emphasis will be placed on the
generic conventions of story-telling as well as on literary and cultural
issues, the role of media and modes of transmission, the artistic significance
of the chosen texts and their identity as anthropological artifacts whose
conventions and assumptions are rooted in particular times, places, and
technologies. Authors will include: Homer, Sophocles, Herodotus, Christian
evangelists, Marie de France, Cervantes, La Clos, Poe, Lang, Cocteau, Disney-
Pixar, and Maxis-Electronic Arts, with theoretical readings in Propp, Bakhtin,
Girard, Freud, and Marx.
***** Criteria for HASS-CI Subjects *****
Communication Intensive Subjects in the humanities, arts, and social sciences
should require at least 20 pages of writing divided among 3-5 assignments. Of
these 3-5 assignments, at least one should be revised and resubmitted. HASS-CI
subjects should further offer students substantial opportunity for oral
expression through presentations, student-led discussion, or class
participation. In order to guarantee sufficient attention to student writing
and substantial opportunity for oral expression, the maximum number of students
per section in a HASS-CI subject is 18, except in the case of a subject taught
without sections (where the faculty member in charge is the only instructor).
In that case, enrollments can rise to 25, if a writing fellow is attached to
the subject.
***** Requirements and Grading *****
The final grade for this class will be computed according to the following
weighted scale:
ACTIVITIES                                              PERCENTAGES
Active Class Participation                              20%
In-Class Exercises                                      10%
5 Short Reader Response Papers (each 2 pages in length) 20%
Final Paper (10 pages in length)                        25%
Final Exam                                              25%
***** Guidelines for Reader Responses *****
Approximately every other week, Reader Responses covering the current reading
assignment will be due. Reader Responses should be 2 pages in length,
typewritten in 12-point type, double-spaced with 1-inch margins on all sides,
stapled together, and each page must be numbered. Each Reader Response will
consist of three principal parts as described below:
   1. Identify some feature within the text (e.g., imagery, theme, incident,
      passage, narrative structure, framing device, style, sentence
      construction, message or moral, etc.) which happens to strike you as
      strange, unfamiliar, remarkable, or problematic, and explain what it is
      that you find so unusual about that particular element or how it differs
      from what you might have expected.

   2. Consider how that feature is operating within the text, what function or
      purpose it might be serving within its immediate context or within the
      broader narrative as a whole, and why it might have been represented in
      this particular manner rather than some other way.

   3. Then explain how this feature helps you to interpret the general meaning
      of the text as you explore the particular implications and consequences
      of your new understanding.
***** In-Class Exercises *****
Opportunities for applying new methods of approaching texts will be provided
through in-class exercises.
***** Final Paper *****
A final paper (8-10 pages in length), selected from a list of assigned topics
and integrating the work you have been doing throughout the term, will be due
towards the end of the semester. This work will be evaluated on the basis of
consistent logical argumentation, judicious use of evidence, coherent
development of ideas, and rhetorical effectiveness. A first draft will be
submitted two weeks earlier to allow for revisions.
***** Final Exam *****
A final exam, comprehending all the material throughout the semester, will be
given during exam period.
***** Late Paper Policy *****
Final papers and reader responses may receive an automatic extension for one
class period upon consultation with the instructor. Further lateness will
result in a reduction of 1/3 of a grade for each class the paper is overdue
beyond that time.
***** Rewrite Policy *****
Any paper or reader response may be rewritten upon satisfying the following
requirements:
   1. The original paper was submitted on time.
   2. The student meets with the instructor to go over the paper.
   3. The paper is completely rewritten from scratch and not just edited.
   4. The rewritten paper is resubmitted no later than one week after the
      original was returned in class.
The highest grade that a rewritten paper may receive is a B+.
***** Plagiarism Policy *****
Plagiarism - use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgment - is a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgment for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available in the Writing and Communication Center and theÂ MIT
Website_on_Plagiarism.
