You  can  remember  the  quotient  rule  by  rewriting 
u  � 
v 
and  applying  the  product  rule  and  chain  rule.

Implicit  diﬀerentiation 
Let’s  say  you  want  to  ﬁnd  y �  from  an  equation  like 

y 3  + 3xy 2  = 8 

Instead  of  solving  for  y  and  then  taking  its  derivative,  just  take 
example, 

d
dx 

of  the  whole  thing.  In  this 

3y 2 y �  + 6xyy �  + 3y 2  = 0 
(3y 2  + 6xy)y �  =  −3y 2 
−3y2 
y �  = 
3y2  + 6xy 
Note  that  this  formula  for  y �  involves  both  x  and  y .  Implicit  diﬀerentiation  can  be  very  useful  for 
taking  the  derivatives  of  inverse  functions. 
For  instance,


y = sin−1 x 

⇒ 

sin y = x


Implicit  diﬀerentiation  yields 

and 

(cos y)y �  = 1 

y �  =

Speciﬁc  diﬀerentiation  formulas 

You  will  be  responsible  for  knowing  formulas  for  the  derivatives  and  how  to  deduce  these  formulas 
from  previous  information:  x ,  sin−1 x,  tan−1 x,  sin x,  cos x,  tan x,  sec x, e  ,  ln x .

For  example,  let’s  calculate 

sec x: 

d

sec x =

d 
dx cos x 

= 

−(− sin x)
cos2 x 

= tan x sec x 

You  may  be  asked  to  ﬁnd 

d

sin x  or 

d

cos x,  using  the  following  information: 

sin(h)
lim

→
h 0  h
cos(h) − 1  = 0 
h

lim

h 0 

Remember  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative:

f (x) =  lim

Δx 0 

f (x + Δx) − f (x)

How  to  ﬁnd 
x r ,  where  r  is  a  real  (but  not  necessarily  rational)  number?  All  we  have  done  so  far 
dx 
is  the  case  of  rational  numbers,  using  implicit  diﬀerentiation.  We  can  do  this  two  ways: 

1st  method:  base  e 

� 
e ln x �r  =  e r ln x 
x  =  e ln x 
x r  = 
x r  =  x r  � r 
� 
e r ln x  =  e r ln x  d 
(r ln x)  =  e r ln x r

Finally,  in  the  ﬁrst  lecture  I  promised  you  that  you’d  learn  to  diﬀerentiate  anything—  even 
something  as  complicated  as 
d x tan−1 x 
e 
dx 

So  let’s  do  it! 

d
e uv  =  e uv 
dx 
Substituting, 
e x tan−1  x  =  e x tan−1  x 
d

d 
(uv) =  e uv (u� v + uv � )
