4. 
derivative  from  that  for  the  derivative  of  sin x. 

by  relating  it  to  a  derivative.  (Indicate  reasoning.) 

5. 

For  the  function 

 

ax + b, 
x > 0 
�
1 − x + x2 , x � 0, 
a)  ﬁnd  all  values  of  a  and  b  for  which  the  function  will  be  continuous; 

a  and  b  constants, 

f (x) =	

,

b)  ﬁnd  all  values  of  a  and  b  for  which  the  function  will  be  diﬀerentiable. 

6.  For  the  curve  given  by  the  equation 

x 2 y + y 3  + x 2  = 8, 

ﬁnd  all  points  on  the  curve  where  its  tangent  line  is  horizontal. 

7.  Where  does  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  y = f (x)  at  the  point  (x0 , y0 )  intersect 
the  x-axis? 
8.  The volume of a spherical balloon is decreasing at the instantaneous rate of −10 cm3/sec, 
at  the  moment  when  its  radius  is  20  cm.  At  that  moment,  how  rapidly  is  its  radius 
decreasing? 

9.	 Where  are  the  following  functions  discontinuous? 

b)	

a) 

sec x

1 + x2

10.  A  radioactive  substance  decays  according  to  a  law  A  =  A0 e−rt ,  where  A(t)  is  the 
amount  in  present  at  time  t,  and  r  is  a  positive  constant. 
a)  Derive  an  expression  in  terms  of  r  for  the  time  it  takes  for  the  amount  to  fall  to 
one-quarter  of  the  initial  amount  A0 . 
b)  At  the moment when  the  amount has  fallen  to  1/4  the  initial  amount, how  rapidly 
is  the  amount  falling?  (Units:  grams,  seconds.)
