Final  Examination:  Thursday,  Dec.  21 

The  ﬁnal  examination  will  cover  the  entire  semester’s  work,  including  all  the  material  since 
Exam  4,  namely,  L’Hˆopital’s  rule,  improper  integrals,  inﬁnite  series,  power  series. 
To  prepare  for  it,  make  sure  you  understand  the  solutions  to  the  problems  on  the  four  hour 
exams  and  to  the practice problems  given  out  for  each  of  the hour  exams.  If you ﬁnd you  still have 
trouble  with  some  topics,  go  back  to  the  problem  sets  which  covered  those,  and  practice  on  the 
relevant  Part  I  problems  that  were  assigned  for  them.  A  practice  ﬁnal  exam  will  be  posted. 
The  table  of  formulas  from  Exam  4 will  be  printed with  the  ﬁnal  exam.  Some  problems  on  the 
exam  related  to  techniques  of  integration  may  be  in  a  new  format,  namely,  you  will  be  given  an 
integral  formula  that  follows  a  method  of  integration,  (integration  by  parts,  partial  fractions,  or 
substitution) and asked  to ﬁnd  the mistake(s)  in  it.  The ﬁnal exam will  test  the notion of weighted 
average  (see  Problem  4,  Exam  3). 

Makeup  18.01  during  IAP 

Students  who  receive  a  D  in  18.01  this  semester  will  be  eligible  to  take  a  review  course  during 
IAP.  It  counts  as  6  units  on  the  IAP  load,  so  students  also  in  8.01L  can  continue with  that  course. 
Students who  pass  this  review  course will  receive  the  usual  12  units  credit  for  having  passed  18.01. 
The  IAP  review  course  consists  of  daily  one  or  two  hour  review  sessions,  going  through  the 
entire  course,  with  the  hour  exams  occurring  at  the  relevant  times  (and  a make-up  hour  exam  the 
next day,  for  those who  failed  the earlier one).  In general,  there will be  two or  three  review  sessions 
preceding  each  exam.  At  the  end  is  a  ﬁnal  exam. 
Students  who  receive  an  F  in  18.01  this  semester  will  in  general  not  be  eligible  for  the  review 
course;  they  should  retake  18.01  in  the  spring.  If  there  are  extenuating  circumstances  which  make 
it  likely  that  the  student  will  be  able  to  pass  the  review  course,  they  can  be  considered. 
Students who  fail 18.01 will be notiﬁed by e-mail the day after the ﬁnal,  so they can make plans 
for  the  IAP  course  if  they  wish  to  do  so  and  are  eligible  for  it.
