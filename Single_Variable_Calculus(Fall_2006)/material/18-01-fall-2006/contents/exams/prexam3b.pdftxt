Problem  2.  (15)  K-mart  is  selling  at  half-price  its  left-over  Great  Pumpkins—  thin  orange  plastic 
shells  ﬁlled  with  half-price Halloween  candy. 
A  Great  Pumpkin  has  the  shape  of  the  curve  x 2  + y 4  =  1,  rotated  about  the  vertical  axis,  i.e.,  the 
y -axis.  This  curve  is  symmetric  about  the  x-axis  and  the  y -axis  —  it  looks  something  like  a  circle,  but 
somewhat  ﬂatter  at  the  top  and  bottom. 

sin2 xdx. 

Using  units  in  feet, how many  cubic  feet of  candy will  it  take  to ﬁll  a Great Pumpkin?  Give  the  exact 
answer,  then  tell  if  5  cubic  feet will  be  enough.

Problem  4.  (15:  12,  3)  The  end  portion of  a boneless AllSoy  SmartHam  of  length a  has  approxi­
mately  the  shape  of  the  region  under  the  curve  y = �x,  0 � x � a,  rotated  about  the  x-axis. 
a) When  it  is  sliced  vertically  into  thin  slices,  what  is  the  average  area  of  a  slice? 

,  if  x > 0. 

b) Where  on  the  SmartHam  is  there  a  slice  having  this  average  area  (i.e.,  how  far  from  the  tip)? 
Problem  5.  (15:  7,8)  You  only  have  time  to  look  at  the  newspaper  on  Sunday,  but  the  ﬁrst  thing 
you turn to is  the baseball statistics from Saturday’s game, to see how many hits your favorite ball-player 
Pepe LeMoko  got.  In  September  (which  started  on  a  Saturday)  he  had  a  slump  in  the middle,  but  came 
out  of  it.  His  record  on  the  ﬁve  successive  Saturdays was 

Day: 
No. hits:

Suppose  there was  a  game  every  day;  estimate  the  total  number  of  hits  he  got  during  those  29  games 
by  using 

a) 

the  trapezoidal  rule 

b)  Simpson’s  rule

Problem  6.  (15)  Rain  falls  for  10  hours  on  a  little  garden  pool,  increasing  from  a  drizzle  to  a 
downpour,  then  tapering  oﬀ  to  a  drizzle  again.  The  rate  of  raining  is  given  by 

r(t) = t2 (10 − t)2  cm/hr. 

. 

This  being  the  city,  the  rain  is  polluted  with  acid;  at  the  start  of  the  rain  (t  =  0),  it  contains  2 
nanograms/cu.cm.  of acid, but this decreases linearly to only  1 nanogram/cu.cm.  by the end of the rain. 

Assume  the  pool  has  an  area  of  one  square meter. 

Set up, but do  not  evaluate a deﬁnite integral which tells how many nanograms of acid are in the pool 
at the end of the rain.  Give brief reasoning, either by dividing up the time interval into small subintervals, 
or  by  using  inﬁnitesimal  time  intervals.
