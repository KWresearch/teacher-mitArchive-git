Problem 1. (15 pts.) Estimate the following to two decimal places (show work) 

a. (8 pts.)  sin(
π+

1 / 100)

b. (7 pts.)  101

x
x
y

− ∞ < < ∞
= + + on
Problem 2. (20 pts.) Sketch the graph of 
x
and label all critical points and infection points with their coordinates on the 
graph along with the letter “C” or “I”

Problem 3. (20 pts.) An architect plans to build a triangular enclosure with a fence
on two sides and a wall on the third side. Each of the fence segments has fixed 
Length L. What is the length x of the third side if the region enclosed has the largest 
possible area? Show work and include an argument to show that your answer really
gives the maximum area.       

Problem4. (15 pts) A rocket has launched straight up, and its altitude is h = 10t2
feet after t seconds. You are on the ground 1000 feet from the launch site. The line
of sight from you to the rocket makes an angle θ with the horizontal. By how many
Radians per second is θ changing ten seconds after the launch?      

Write down on which intervals the function is:
 
 Increasing:
 
  
Decreasing: 

 

Concave down:
