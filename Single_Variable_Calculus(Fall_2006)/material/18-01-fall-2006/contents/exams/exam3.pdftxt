(Do not give a numerical approximation to square roots; leave them alone.)

a) Using the upper Riemann sum with two intervals

b) Using the trapezoidal rule with two intervals

c) Using Simpson’s rule with two intervals 

Problem 3. (20 points) Find the volume of the solid of revolution formed by 
revolving the y-axis the region enclosed by

and the x-axis (central hump, only). 

y=cos(x2) 

Problem 4. (20 points) Students studying for an exam get x hours of sleep in the
two days leading up to the exam, where x is the range 0 ≤ x ≤ a. The numbers of
students who got between x1 and x2 hours of sleep in given by

b) Their scores are proportional to the amount of sleep they got: 
S(x) = 100 (x/a). Find the (correctly weighted) average score in the class.
