18.01  Practice  Questions  for  Exam  2 
Solutions  will  be  posted  on  the  18.01 website.  No  books,  notes,  calculators.  Show  work. 

1.  For  the  function  3x5  − 5x3  + 1,  sketch  the  graph  over  a  suitable  interval  showing 
all  the  local  maximum  and  minimum  points  on  the  graph,  the  points  of  inﬂection,  and  the 
approximate  location  of  its  zeros  (show  on  which  intervals  of  the  form  [n, n + 1],  (n  is  an 
integer)  they  occur.  Show  work,  or  indicate  reasoning.

2.  Sketch  the  graph  of  4x 2 
over  an  interval  showing  its  interesting  features  –  local 
− 
x 
maxima  and minima,  points  of  inﬂection,  zeros,  asymptotes. 

3.  A  line of negative slope  through (1, 2) cuts oﬀ a  triangle in  the ﬁrst quadrant.  For which 
such  line  will  the  triangle  have  least  area?  (Use  its  slope  m  as  the  independent  variable. 
Show  that  you  get  a minimum.) 

4.  The  bottom  of  the  legs  of  a  three-legged  table  are  the  vertices  of  an  isosceles  triangle 
with  sides  5,  5,  and  6.  The  legs  are  to  be  braced  at  the  bottom  by  three  wires  in  the  shape 
of  a  Y. What  is  the  minimum  length  of  wire  needed?  Show  it  is  a minimum. 

5.  A  200  foot  tree  is  falling  in  the  forest;  the  sun  is  directly  overhead.  At  the  moment 
when  the  tree  makes  an  angle  of  30o  with  the  horizontal,  its  shadow  is  lengthening  at  the 
rate  of  50  feet/sec.  How  fast  is  the  angle  changing  at  that  moment? 

6.  A  container  in  the  shape  of  a  right  circular  cone  with  vertex  angle  a  right  angle  is 
partially  ﬁlled  with  water. 
a)  Suppose  water  is  added  at  the  rate  of  3  cu.cm./sec.  How  fast  is  the  water  level 
rising  when  the  height  h = 2cm.? 
b)  Suppose  instead  no  water  is  added,  but  water  is  being  lost  by  evaporation.  Show 
the  level  falls  at  a  constant  rate.  (You  will  have  to  make  a  reasonable  physical  assumption 
about  the  rate  of  water  loss—state  it  clearly.)

7.  How  should  the  parameter  �  be  chosen  so  that  f (x) = 
remain  as  close  to  1 
1 + 2 sin x 
as  possible,  when  x � 0?  Using  this  value  of  �,  estimate  f (.1)  to  two  decimal  places. 

−�x

8.	 State  the Mean-value  Theorem,  and  use  it  to  prove  that 
a)  if  f (x)  is diﬀerentiable  and  f �(x) > 0  for  all x,  then  f (x)  is  an  increasing  function; 
b)  e x  > 1 + x  for  all  x > 0.

11.  The  rate  at  which  a  body  heats  up  by  conduction  is  proportional  to  the  diﬀerence 
between  its  temperature  T  and  the  temperature  Te  of  its  surroundings.  A  ﬁsh  at  room 
temperature  (20o )  is  cooked  by  putting  it  into  boiling  water  at  100o  .  After  5  minutes  its 
temperature  has  risen  to  30o .  How  long  will  it  take  to  be  done  (60o) ? 
a)  Set  up  a  diﬀerential  equation  for  the  ﬁsh  temperature  T (t).  (Call  the  constant  of 
proportionality  k .) 
b)  Find the solution T (t) satisfying the given data,  then use it to answer the question.
