18.01  UNIT  2  REVIEW;  Fall  2007 


The central theme of Unit 2 is that knowledge of f �  (and sometimes f ��) tells us something about 
x 
f  itself.  This  is  even  true  of  our  ﬁrst  topic,  approximation.  For  instance,  knowing  that  f (x) =  e
satisﬁes  f (0) = 1  and  f � (0) = 1,  we  can  say 

e x  � 1 + x  provided  x � 0 

The  linear  function  1 + x  is  much  simpler  than  e ,  so  f (0)  and  f �(0)  give  us  a  (very)  simpliﬁed 
x
picture  of  our  function,  useful  only  near  near  0.  For more  detail,  use  the  quadratic  approximation, 

x e  � 1 + x + x 2/2  provided  x � 0 

(still  only  works  well  near  0) 

The  second  and  third  practice  exams  are  actual  tests  from  previous  years.  The  exam  this  year 
is  similar  to  the  one  from  2006  posted  at  our  site.  It  has  6  questions  covering  the  following  topics. 
(No  Newton’s  method,  but  there  is  a  seventh,  extra  credit  problem.) 

1.  Linear  and/or  quadratic  approximations 

2.  Sketch  a  graph  y = f (x) 

3.  Max/min 

4.  Related  rates 

5.  Find  antiderivatives  and  solve  a  diﬀerential  equation  by  separating  variables 

6.  Mean  value  theorem. 

Remarks. 

1.  Recall  that  linear  [and  quadratic]  approximation  is 

f (x) � f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  [+(f �� (a)/2)(x − a)2 ] 

2.  You  should  expect  to  graph  a  function  y  = f (x),  where  f (x)  is  a  rational  function  (ratio  of 
polynomials). 

Warnings: 

a) When asked to  label the critical point on the graph, ﬁnd and mark the point (a, b).  In lecture 
we  called  x  =  a  the  critical  point  and  y  =  b  the  critical  value,  and  this  is  what  is  used  in  18.02, 
and  elsewhere.  But  for  this  exam  (and  this  is  just  an  inconsistency  in  language  that  you  will  have 
to  tolerate)  the words  “critical  point”  refer  to  the  point  on  the  graph  (a, b),  not  the  number  a  and 
the  point  on  the  x-axis.  The  same  applies  to  inﬂection  points. 

b)  y  = 1/(x − 1)  is  decreasing  on  the  intervals  −≈  < x <  1  and  1  < x <  ≈,  but  it  is  not 
decreasing  on  the  interval  −≈ < x < ≈.  Draw  the  graph  to  see. 
You  cannot  just  use  the  fact  that  y �  = −1/(x − 1)2  <  0  because  there  is  a  point  in  the  middle 
at  which  y  is  not  diﬀerentiable  —  and  not  even  continuous.  So  the  mean  value  theorem  does  not 
apply. 
c)  Similarly,  y  = 1/(x − 1)2  is  concave  up  on  −≈  < x <  1  and  1  < x <  ≈,  but  it  is  not 
concave  up  on  the  interval  −≈ < x < ≈.  Here  y ��  = 6/(x − 1)4  > 0,  but  there  is  a  singularity  in 
the  middle.  Plot  the  graph  yourself  to  see.

3.  The mean  value  theorem  says  that  if  f  is  diﬀerentiable,  then  for  some  c,  a < c < x, 

f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) 

It  is  used  as  follows.  Suppose  that  m < f � (c) < M  on  the  interval  a < c < x,  then 

f (x) = f (a) + f �(c)(x − a) < f (a) + M (x − a) 

Similarly, 

f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) > f (a) + m(x − a) 

Put  another  way,  if �f  = f (x) − f (a)  and �x = x − a,  and m < f �(c) < M  for  a < c < x,  then 

m�x < �f < M �x 

More  consequences  of  the  mean  value  theorem. 

A  function  f  is  called  increasing  (also  called  strictly  increasing)  if  x > a  implies  f (x)  > f (a). 
The reasoning above with m = 0  shows that  if f �  > 0,  then f  is  increasing.  Similarly  if f �  < 0,  then 
f  is  decreasing.  We  use  these  facts  every  time  we  sketch  a  graph  of  a  function  or  ﬁnd  a  maximum 
or minimum. 

A  similar  discussion  works  when  the  inequality  is  not  strict.  If  m �  f � (c)  � M  for  a < c < x, 
then 

f (a) + m(x − a) � f (x) � f (a) + M (x − a) 

A  function  is  called  nondecreasing  if  x > a  implies  f (x) �  f (a).  If  f �  � 0,  then  the  inequality 
above shows that f  is nondecreasing.  Conversely,  if the function is nondecreasing and diﬀerentiable, 
then  f �  � 0.  Similarly,  diﬀerentiable  functions  are  nonincreasing  if  and  only  if  they  satisfy  f �  � 0. 
Key  corollary  to  the  mean  value  theorem:  f �  = g �  implies  f − g  is  constant. 
In  Unit  2,  we  have  found  that  information  about  f �  gives  information  about  f .  In  particular, 
knowing a  starting value  for a  function and  its rate of change determines the  function.  A seemingly 
obvious  example  is  that  if  f �  =  0  for  all  x,  then  f  is  constant.  If  this  were  not  true,  then  the 
mathematical  notion  of  derivative  would  fail  to  coincide  with  our  intuitive  notion  of  what  rate  of 
change  and  cause  and  eﬀect  mean. 

But  this  fundamental  fact  needs  a  proof.  Derivatives  are  instantaneous  quantities,  obtained 
as  limits.  It  is  the  mean  value  theorem  that  allows  us  to  pass  in  rigorous  mathematical  fashion 
from  the  inﬁnitesimal  to  the  practical,  human  scale.  Here  is  the  proof.  If  f �  =  0,  then  one  can 
take  m  =  M  =  0  in  the  inequalities  above,  and  conclude  that  f (x) =  f (a).  In  other  words,  f  is 
constant.  As  an  immediate  consequence,  if  f �  = g � ,  then  f  and  g  diﬀer  by  a  constant.  (Apply  the 
previous argument  to  the  function f − g , whose  derivative  is 0.)  This basic  fact will  lead  us  shortly 
to  what  is  known  as  the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus.
