Use upper  sums  (circumscribed  rectangles).  You  can use  the  formula  � i =  n(n + 1).

3.  A  bank  gives  interest  at  the  rate  r,  compounded  continuously,  so  that  an  amount  A0 
deposited  grows  after  t  years  to  an  amount  A(t) = A0 ert . 
You  make  a  daily  deposit  at  the  constant  annual  rate  k ;  in  other  words,  over  the  time 
period  �t  you  deposit  k�t  dollars.  Set  up  a  deﬁnite  integral  (give  reasoning)  which  tells 
how much  is  in  your  account  at  the  end  of  one  year.  (Do  not  evaluate  the  integral.)

an  explicit  formula  for  F (x), 
a)  (5)  show  that  F (1) � 2; 
b)  (5)  determine  whether  F (x)  is  convex  (“concave  up”)  or  concave  (“concave  down”) 
on  the  interval  0 < x < 1;  show  work  or  give  reasoning;

6.  A  glass vase has  the  shape  of  the  solid  obtained by  rotating about  the  y -axis  the  area  in 
the  ﬁrst  quadrant  lying  over  the  x-interval  [0, a]  and  under  the  graph  of  y = �x.  By  slicing 
it  horizontally,  determine  how much  glass  it  contains. 

f (t) dt = e 2x cos x + c,  ﬁnd  the  value  of  the  constant  c  and  the  function  f (t).

7.  A  right  circular  cone  has  height  5  and  base  radius  1;  it  is  over-ﬁlled  with  ice  cream,  in 
the usual way.  Place the cone so its vertex is at the origin, and its axis lies along the positive 
y -axis,  and  take  the  cross-section  containing  the  x-axis.  The  top  of  this  cross-section  is  a 
piece  of  the  parabola  y  = 6 − x2 .  (The  whole  ﬁlled  ice-cream  cone  is  gotten  by  rotating 
this  cross-section  about  the  y -axis.) 
What  is  the  volume  of  the  ice  cream?  (Suggestion:  use  cylindrical  shells.) 

8.  Rectangles  are  inscribed  as  shown  in  the  quarter-circle  of  radius  a,  with  the  point  x 
being  chosen  randomly  on  the  interval  [0, a].  Find  the  average value  of  their  area. 

9. 
Find  the  approximate  value  given  for  the  integral  below  by  the  trapezoidal  rule  and 
also by Simpson’s  rule,  taking n = 2  (i.e.,  dividing  the  interval  of  integration  into  two  equal 
subintervals):
