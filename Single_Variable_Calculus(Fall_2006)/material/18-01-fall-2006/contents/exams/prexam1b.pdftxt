18.01  Practice  Questions  for  Exam  1 

Solutions  will  be  posted  on  the  18.01 website 

a) 

Problem  1.  Evaluate  each  of  the  following: 
 
d  �x 
 
�
 
�
 
�
dx  1 + 2x  x=1 
�
d 
(u  ln 2u) 
du

(simplify  your  answer) 

b) 

Problem  2. 

 
d 
�
1 − k cos2  t,  where  k  is  constant. 
dt 
b)  Check  your  answer  to  part  (a)  by  showing  that  if  k = 1,  your  answer  agrees with  the 
derivative  calculated  by  a  simpler  method. 

a)  Evaluate 

 

 

Derive  the  formula  for

derivative. 
(You  will  need  to  transform  the  diﬀerence  quotient  algebraically  before  taking  the 
limit.) 

directly  from  the  deﬁnition  of 

Problem  4. 
Derive  the  formula  for 
using  implicit  diﬀerentiation. 

d 
dx 

sin−1 x  by  solving  y = sin−1 x  for x  and 

(You may use  the known values of  D sin x  and  D cos x  in your derivation.  Your answer 
must  be  expressed  in  terms  of  x.) 
Problem  5. 
by 

Find all values of the constants a and b for which the  function deﬁned 
 

f (x) = 

�

ax + b, 
x > 1 
2x − 3x + 2, x � 1 

will  be  diﬀerentiable. 
Problem  6. 
just  guessing: 

Evaluate  the  following,  with  enough  indications  to  show  you  are  not 

a) 

b)

Problem  7. 
A  hawk  is  pursuing  a  mouse.  We  choose  a  coordinate  system  so  the 
mouse runs along the x-axis in the negative direction, and the hawk is ﬂying over the x-axis, 
swooping  down  along  the  exponential  curve  y  =  ekx ,  for  some  positive  constant  k .  The 
hawk  in  ﬂight  is  always aimed directly  at  the mouse.  It  is  noon  at  the  equator, and  the  sun 
is  directly  overhead. 

(relate  it  to  the  value  of  a  derivative) 

When  the  hawk’s  shadow  on  the  ground  is  at  the  point  x0 ,  where  is  the  mouse?
