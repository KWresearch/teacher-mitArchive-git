Problem  1.  (20)  Find  the  local maxima  and minima  and  points  of  inﬂection  of 

2x 3  + 3x 2 

 12x + 1  .

Then use  this  data  to  sketch  its  graph on  the given  axes,  showing also where  it  is  convex  (concave up) or 
concave  (down).  (Note  that  diﬀerent  scales  are  used  on  the  two  axes.) 
Problem  2.  (20)  A  new  junk  food — NoKarb PopKorn —  is  to be  sold  in  large  cylindrical metal 
cans  with  a  removable  plastic  lid  instead  of  a  metal  top.  The  metal  side  and  bottom  will  be  of  uniform 
thickness,  and  the  volume  is  ﬁxed  to  be  64�  cubic  inches. 
What  base  radius  r  and  height  h  for  the  can will  require  the  least  amount  of metal? 
Show  work,  and  include  an  argument  to  show  your  values  for  r  and  h  really  give  a minimum.

b) 

 

A  searchlight  L  is  100  meters  from  a  prison  wall.  It  is  rotating  at  a  constant  rate  of  one  revolution 
every  8 minutes.  (How many  radians/minute  is  that?) 
Martha, an  escaping prisoner,  is  running along the wall  trying  to keep  just ahead of  the beam of  light. 
At  the moment when  the  searchlight  angle  �  is  60  degrees,  how  fast  does  she  have  to  run? 
Problem  5.  (15:  5,  10) 

a)  What  value  for  the  constant  c  will  make  the  function  e
values  of  x  near  0? 
(Show  work.)

b)  Find  the  solution  x(t)  to  the  diﬀerential  equation 
which  also  satisﬁes  the  condition  x(0) = 1.

a)  Use  the Mean-value Theorem  to  show  that 

ln(1 + x) < x, 

if  x > 0. 

(You  do  not  have  to  state  the  theorem.) 
b)  Let  c  be  any  constant.  Show  that  the  function  f (x) = x 3  + x + c  cannot  have  two  zeros. 

(Use  the Mean-value  theorem,  or  some  other  argument.)
