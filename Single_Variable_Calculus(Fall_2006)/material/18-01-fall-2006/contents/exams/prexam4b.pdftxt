Problem  3.  (20)  Evaluate

Problem  1.  (15)  Evaluate 
0  �1 − x2 
to  change  the  limits  also. 
Problem  2.  (15)  Find  the  volume  of  the  solid  obtained  by  rotating  about  the  y -axis  (that’s  the 
y -axis)  the  area  under  the  graph  of  y = ex  and  over  the  interval  0 � x � 1 . 
(Suggestion:  use  cylindrical  shells.)

�
(x2  − 1)(x − 1) 
(Begin  by  factoring  the  denominator  completely;  don’t  forget  the  ﬁnal  integration.) 
Problem  4.  (15:  8,  7) 
a)  Write  down  the  deﬁnite  integral  of  the  form  �
curve  y = sin2 x  for  0 � x � �/4. 
b)  Show  that  the  arclength  is  less  than  1.2  by  estimating  the  integral. 
(Indicate  how  you  are  estimating  it.  It  helps  to  write  the  integral  in  the  simplest-looking  form.) 
Problem  5.  (15) 

f (x) dx  which  represents  the  arclength  of  the 

  b 

a 

A  circle  in  the  xy -plane  has  radius  a  and  center  at  the  point  (b, 0)  on  the  x-axis;  assume  a < b. 

a) Write  its  equation  in  rectangular  coordinates,  and  change  the  equation  to  polar  coordinates. 

Problem  5b  can  be  skipped;  no  question  similar  to  5b  will  appear  on  the  2006  exam. 

b)  Check  your  answer  by  deriving  it  directly  in  polar  coordinates,  using  a  geometric  formula. 
Problem  6.  (20) 

Once  every  century  the  Klingon  moon  Bosok  completely  eclipses  the  moon  Yan-ki.  As  seen  from  the 
city Mitek,  the  two moons  appear  as  circular  discs,  with  radii  respectively  �2  and  1  (units:  dorks). 
When  the  center  of  Bosok  is  exactly  on  the  circumference  of  Yan-ki,  the  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  the  area 
(in  square  dorks)  of  the  region  of  the Yan-ki  disc  that  is  not  yet  covered. 

a)  Draw a diagram in polar coordinates, placing the center of Bosok at the origin, and the other center 
on the positive x-axis.  Set up a deﬁnite integral representing the area of  the desired region.  Indicate how 
the  signiﬁcant  limit  on  the  integral was  determined. 

b)  Evaluate  the  integral. 

(If  you have  time,  check  your answer by  elementary geometry, but no  credit  for  this,  just a warm  glow 
of  satisfaction  and  a  smug  feeling  of  superiority.)
