b. (10 points) Find an integral formula for the surface area of 
the curve in part (a) rotated around the x-axis. Simplify the 
integrand and evaluate the integral.

Problem 5. a. (7 points) Sketch the spiral r = θ2

times the curve meets the x-axis counting θ = 0 as the first 
times, and mark those points with X-s. (Your sketch need not be
accurate to scale.) 

b. (8 points) On your picture, shade in the region 0 ≤ r ≤ θ2,
0 ≤ θ ≤ 2∏, and find its area.
