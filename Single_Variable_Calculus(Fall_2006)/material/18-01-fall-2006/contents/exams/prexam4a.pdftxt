Problem  5.  Make  a  reasonable  sketch  of  one  loop  of  the  polar  curve  r  =  sin 3�,  and 
ﬁnd  the  area  inside  it. 
Problem  6.  Let  x(t) = cos3  t,  y(t) = sin3  t, 0 � t � �/2  be  a  parametric  representation  of 
a  curve. 
a)  Compute  the  arclength  of  the  curve. 
b)  Compute  the  surface  area  of  the  surface  formed  by  rotating  the  curve  around  the 
x-axis. 

Problem  7.  Set  up  an  integral  for  the  length  of  one  arch  of  the  curve  y = sin x,  and  by 
estimating  the  integral,  tell  how  this  length  compares with  ��2. 

Problem  8. 
A  circular  metal  disc  of  radius  a  has  a  non-constant  density  �  (units: 
gms/cm2);  the  density  at  a  point  P  on  the  disc  is  given  by  �  =  r 2 ,  where  r  is  the  distance 
of  the  point  from  the  center  of  the  disc.  Set  up  and  evaluate  a  deﬁnite  integral  giving  the 
total mass  of  the  disc. 

Problem  9. 
a)  Sketch  the  curve  given  in  polar  coordinates  by  r = 1 + cos � 
b)  Find  the  polar  coordinates  of  the  following  two  points  (show  work): 
(i) where the curve in part  (a)  intersects the circle of radius 3/2 centered at  the origin; 
(ii)  where  the  above  curve  intersects  the  circle  of  radius  3/2  centered  at  the  point 
x = 3/2  on  the  x-axis. 

Other  kinds  of  problems: 
Other  kinds  of  partial  fractions  decompositions; 
sketching  curves  given  parametrically,  ﬁnding  their  arclength; 
ﬁnding  surface  area  for  rotated  curves  in  xy -coordinates; 
deriving polar equations of curves given geometrically, changing from rectangular equa­
tions  to  polar  and  vice-versa.
