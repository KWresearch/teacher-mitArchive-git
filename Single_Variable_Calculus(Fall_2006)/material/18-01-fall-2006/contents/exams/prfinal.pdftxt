18.01  Practice  Final  Exam

There are 19 problems, totaling 250 points.  No books, notes, or calculators.  This practice exam should 
take  3  hours.

Problem  2.  (10)  Find  the equation of  the  line  tangent to the graph of  x2 y2 + y3  = 2  at the point 
(1, 1)  on  the  graph.  (Give  the  equation  in  the  form  y = mx + b.)

Problem  5.  (15)  On  a  night when  the  full moon  is  directly  overhead,  an  outdoor Christmas  tree 50 
feet  high  is  falling  over.  Its  top  is  falling  at  the  rate  of  2  feet/sec,  at  the moment when  it  is  30  feet  from 
the  ground.  At  that moment,  how  rapidly  is  the  shadow  of  the  tree  cast  by  the moon  lengthening? 

Problem  6.  (15)  Find  the  area  of  the  largest  rectangle whose  base  lies  along  the  x-axis  and  whose 
top  corners  lie  on  the  parabola  y = 1 − x2 . 
Problem  7.  (15:  4,7,4)  The graph of  y = y(x)  has this property:  at each point (x, y) on the graph, 
the normal  line  at  that point passes  through the ﬁxed point  (1, 0).  (The normal  is  the  line perpendicular 
to  the  tangent  line.)

b)  Using  separation  of  variables,  ﬁnd  all  solutions  to  the  diﬀerential  equation.  You  can  leave  the 
solutions  in  implicit  form,  i.e.,  as  equations  connecting x  and  y . 

c)  Describe  the  curves  which  are  their  graphs.  (You  may  have  to  use  algebraic  processes  ﬁrst  (like 
completing  the  square)  in  order  to  change  the  equations  into  a  form  where  you  know  what  their  graphs 
look  like.) 
Problem  8.  (15)  The  cup  of  a  wine-glass  has  the  shape  formed  by  rotating  the  parabola  y  =  x 2 
about  the  y -axis;  its  upper  rim  is  a  circle  of  radius  1.  How  much  wine  does  it  hold?

Problem  11.  (15:  7,8)  Between  the  two  towers  of  a  suspension  bridge,  each  of  the  two main  cables 
has  the  shape  of  the  parabola  y  =  1  x2  (units  are  kilometers).  The  two  towers  are  2  km.  apart;  the
