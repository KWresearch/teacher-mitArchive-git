Tips_for_Success_in_Undergraduate_Math_Courses by Jessica Purcell. Some very
good advice for college calculus students. Read this carefully and do as it
suggests.
Common_Errors_in_Undergraduate_Mathematics by Eric Schechter
The_calculus_page_problems_list problems by D. A. Kouba at UC Davis
***** Assorted Applets *****
The Web page contains a plethora of interesting resources to help you visualize
important mathematical concepts. Most of these are Java applets, which run
interactively as plug-ins in your web browser. To use them you must have Java
enabled in your browser preferences - by default, it probably is already.
    * Some Java applets from MIT's OpenCourseWare page for 18.013A:
          o Operations_on_functions
          o Trigonometric_functions
          o Slope_of_a_line
          o Derivative_and_tangent_line
          o Constant,_linear,_quadratic_and_cubic_approximations
          o Numerical_integration
          o Polar_plotter
          o Curves_in_two_dimensions
    * Function and Derivative Animations, by Przemyslaw Bogacki and Gordon
      Melrose (.avi files, can play e.g. with Windows_MediaÂ®_Player)
    * Java applets of secant lines and tangent lines (from IES, Manipula_Math):
          o A_smooth_function
          o One-sided_derivatives_at_a_point_of_non-differentiability
    * Secant_lines_for_a_function_with_two_non-differentiable_points (applet by
      Daniel J. Heath)
    * Animations of secant lines approaching (or not approaching) tangent lines
      (by Douglas N. Arnold):
          o At_a_point_of_differentiability
          o At_a_point_of_non-differentiability (the one-sided derivatives
            don't match)
          o At_another_point_of_non-differentiability (vertical tangent; the
            derivative is infinite)
    * Constructing_functions_that_are_continuous_but_nowhere_differentiable
      (!), applet from Maths Online
    * Chain_rule applet (from a multimedia_calculus_course by Scott Sarra)
    * First_and_second_derivatives applet (by Scott Sarra)
    * More first_and_second_derivatives, with parameters you can tweak (applet
      from Maths_Online)
    * Derivatives of ax, sin_x, cos_x (applets by Daniel J. Heath)
    * Converging_to_the_number_e (applet from IES, Manipula_Math); note that
      the simulation doesn't let you go far enough to approach that close to e
    * Zooming_in_on_a_tangent_line (animation by Douglas N. Arnold)
    * Linear_approximation_of_sin_x_at_0 (applet from UBC_Calculus_Online)
    * Finding_a_function's_extremum, applet from Maths_Online
    * Rolle's_theorem_and_the_mean_value_theorem (applet from IES, Manipula
      Math)
    * Some nice integral applets (by Daniel J. Heath):
          o Riemann_sums
          o Definite_integrals_and_the_integral_function_1
          o Definite_integrals_and_the_integral_function_2
    * Numerical_Integration_Simulation (by Joseph L. Zachary)
    * Some applets on volumes of solids (from IES, Manipula_Math):
          o Solid_1
          o Solid_2
          o Solid_of_revolution_1
    * Direction_field_applet (by Scott Sarra)
    * More_direction_field_applets (from UBC_Calculus_Online)
    * Yet_another_direction_field_applet (from IES, Manipula_Math)
    * Parametric_equation_applet (by Scott Sarra)
    * Another_parametric_equation_applet (from IES, Manipula_Math)
    * Cycloid animation (AVI) (by Przemyslaw Bogacki and Gordon Melrose)
    * Cycloid_applet (from Maths_Online)
    * Computing arc length (AVI) (animation by Przemyslaw Bogacki and Gordon
      Melrose)
    * Approximating_arc_length (applet by Daniel J. Heath)
    * Polar_curve_applet (from IES, Manipula_Math)
    * Several polar curve animations (by Przemyslaw Bogacki and Gordon
      Melrose):
          o limacons:
                # r = 1 + sin t (AVI)
                # r = 3 - 2 cos t (AVI)
                # r = 1 + 2 cos t (AVI)
                # r = 3 - sin t (AVI)
          o rose curves:
                # r = 3 cos(3t) (AVI)
                # r = 5 sin(2t) (AVI)
          o spiral: r = t (AVI)
          o circle: r = cos t (AVI)
    * Converging and diverging series animations (by Przemyslaw Bogacki and
      Gordon Melrose):
          o 1 / N(1/2) (AVI)
          o 1 / N (AVI)
          o 1 / N2 (AVI)
          o 1 / N15 (AVI)
    * Numerical_tools_for_computing_sequences_/_series (from Maths_Online)
    * Taylor_approximations (applet by Daniel J. Heath)
    * Power_series_grapher
And just for the fun of it, there's the Quadratic Formula Song (WMA_-_1.1_MB).
