Lecture  32:  Polar  Co-ordinates,  Area  in  Polar

Co-ordinates


Polar  Coordinates 

Figure 1: Polar Co-ordinates. 

In polar coordinates, we specify an ob ject’s position in terms of its distance r  from the origin 
and the angle θ  that the ray from the origin to the point makes with respect to the x-axis. 
Example  1.  What are the polar coordinates for the point speciﬁed by (1, −1)  in rectangular 
coordinates?

In most cases, we use the convention that r ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π . But another common convention 
is to say r ≥ 0  and −π ≤ θ ≤ π . All values of θ  and even negative values of r  can be used.

Regardless of whether we allow positive or negative values of r  or θ, what is always  true is:


x = r cos θ  and  y = r sin θ 
For instance, x = 1, y = −1  can be represented by r = −√

Example  2.  Consider a circle of radius a  with its center at x  =  a, y  = 0.  We want to ﬁnd an 
equation that relates r  to θ.

We know the equation for the circle in rectangular coordinates is 
(x − a)2  + y 2  = a 2 

Start by plugging in: 

This gives us

x = r cos θ  and  y = r sin θ 

(r cos θ − a)2  + (r sin θ)2  = a 2

r 2 cos2 θ − 2arcosθ + a 2  + r 2 sin2 θ = a 2

Since radius is a function of angle (r = f (θ)), we will integrate with respect to θ. The question 
is: what, exactly, should we integrate? 
?? dθ

Let’s look at a very small slice of this region:

This inﬁnitesimal slice is approximately a right triangle. To ﬁnd its area, we take:
