Lecture  23:  Work,  Average  Value,  Probability 

Application  of  Integration  to  Average  Value 

You  already  know  how  to  take  the  average  of  a  set  of  discrete  numbers: 
a1  + a2 
a1  + a2  + a3

Now,  we  want  to  ﬁnd  the  average  of  a  continuum.

The  answer  85o  is  consistent  with  the  ordinary  average.  The  weighted  average  (integration  with 
respect  to  πy dy)  is  lower  (80o )  because  there  is  more  water  at  cooler  temperatures  in  the  upper 
parts  of  the  cauldron. 

Dart  board,  revisited 

Last  time,  we  said  that  the  accuracy  of  your  aim  at  a  dart  board  follows  a  “normal  distribution”: 
ce−r 
2 

Now,  let’s  pretend  someone  –  say,  your  little  brother  –  foolishly  decides  to  stand  close  to  the  dart 
board.  What  is  the  chance  that  he’ll  get  hit  by  a  stray  dart? 

Figure  5:  Shaded  section  is  2ri  < r < 3r1  between  3  and  5  o’clock. 

To  make  our  calculations  easier,  let’s  approximate  your  brother  as  a  sector  (the  shaded  region 
in  Fig.  5).  Your  brother  doesn’t  quite  stand  in  front  of  the  dart  board.  Let  us  say  he  stands  at  a 
distance  r  from  the  center  where  2r1  < r <  3r1  and  r1  is  the  radius  of  the  dart  board.  Note  that 
your  brother  doesn’t  surround  the  dart  board.  Let  us  say  he  covers  the  region  between  3  o’clock

of  a  ring. 
and  5  o’clock,  or

Compute  Q = 

Figure  8:  Q =  Area  under  curve  e(−x 2 ) . 

This is one of the most important integrals in all of calculus.  It is especially important in probability 
and  statistics.  It’s  an  improper  integral,  but  don’t  let  those ∞’s  scare  you.  In  this  integral,  they’re 
actually  easier  to  work  with  than  ﬁnite  numbers  would  be. 
� 
To  ﬁnd  Q,  we  will  ﬁrst  ﬁnd  a  volume  of  revolution,  namely, 
V  = volume  under  e−r 
2 
(r =  x2  + y2 ) 
We ﬁnd this volume by the method of shells, which  leads to the same  integral as  in the  last problem. 
The  shell  or  cylinder  under  e−r  at  radius  r  has  circumference  2πr ,  thickness  dr;  (see  Figure  9).
