Lecture  34:  Indeterminate  Forms  - L’Hôpital’s  Rule 

L’Hôpital’s  Rule 

(Two correct spellings: “L’Hôpital” and “L’Hospital”) 
Sometimes, we run into indeterminate forms. These are things like 

and 

0 
0 
∞ 
∞
For instance, how do you deal with the following? 
x3  − 1  = 
lim 
x 1  x2  − 1
→

0
0

?? 

Example  0.  One way of dealing with this is to use algebra to simplify things: 
(x − 1)(x2  + x + 1)  =  lim 
x3  − 1  =  lim 
x2  + x + 1  = 
lim 
x→1  x2  − 1 
(x − 1)(x + 1) 
x→1 
x→1 
x + 1 
In general, when f (a) = g(a) = 0,

f (x) 
=  lim  x − a  = 
x→a  g(x)	
x − a 
This is the easy version of L’Hôpital’s rule: 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

f (x) − f (a) 
lim 
x − a 
→
a 
x
g(x) − g(a) 
x − a 

lim 
→
x a

f � (a)
g � (a) 

= 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

= 

f � (a)
g � (a) 

Note: this only works when g � (a) = 0
! 
In example 0, 

f (x) = x 3  = 1;  g(x) = x 2  − 1

⇒ 
f � (x) = 3x 2 ;  g � (x) = 2x  = 
f � (1) = 3;  g � (1) = 2

The limit is f � (1)/g � (1) = 3/2. Now, let’s go on to the full L’Hôpital rule.

Example  1.  Apply L’Hôpital’s rule (a.k.a. “L’Hop”) to 
15  − 1 
x
lim 
− 1

x 1  x3

15  = 5 
15x14 
lim 
x→1  x3  − 1 
x→1  3x2 
3 
Let’s compare this with the answer we’d get if we used linear approximation techniques, instead of 
L’Hôpital’s rule: 
x 15  − 1 ≈ 15(x − 1) 
(Here, f (x) = x15  − 1, a = 1, f (a) = b = 0, m = f � (1) = 15, and f (x) ≈ m(x − a) + b.) 
Similarly, 
x 3  − 1 ≈ 3(x − 1) 
15(x − 1)  = 5 
3(x − 1) 

x15  − 1 
x3  − 1 

Therefore,

Just to check, let’s compare that answer to the one we would get if we used quadratic approximation 
techniques. Remember that:

The limit is not of the form  , which means L’Hôpital’s rule cannot be used.  The  point  is:  look

More “interesting” cases that work.

It is also okay to use L’Hôpital’s rule on limits of the form

apply this to rates of growth. Which function goes to ∞  faster: x, e ax , or ln x?
