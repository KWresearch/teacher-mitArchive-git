Hyperbolic  Sine  and  Cosine 

Hyperbolic  sine  (pronounced  “sinsh”): 

sinh(x) = 

ex  − e−x

Hyperbolic  cosine  (pronounced  “cosh”):

Likewise,

(Note  that  this  is  diﬀerent  from

cos(x).)

Important  identity:


Proof: 

cosh2 (x) − sinh2 (x) = 

cosh2 (x) − sinh2 (x) = 

cosh2 (x) − sinh2 (x) = 1

(2 + 2) = 1 

Why  are  these  functions  called  “hyperbolic”? 
Let  u = cosh(x)  and  v = sinh(x),  then 
u 2  − v 2  = 1 

which  is  the  equation  of  a  hyperbola. 
Regular  trig  functions  are  “circular”  functions.  If  u = cos(x)  and  v = sin(x),  then 

which  is  the  equation  of  a  circle. 

u 2  + v 2  = 1

Implicit  diﬀerentiation 
Let’s  say  you  want  to  ﬁnd  y �  from  an  equation  like 

y 3  + 3xy 2  = 8 

Instead  of  solving  for  y  and  then  taking  its  derivative,  just  take 
example, 

d
dx 

of  the  whole  thing.  In  this 

3y 2 y �  + 6xyy �  + 3y 2  = 0 
(3y 2  + 6xy)y �  =  −3y 2 
−3y2 
y �  = 
3y2  + 6xy 
Note  that  this  formula  for  y �  involves  both  x  and  y .  Implicit  diﬀerentiation  can  be  very  useful  for 
taking  the  derivatives  of  inverse  functions. 
For  instance,


y = sin−1 x 

⇒ 

sin y = x


Implicit  diﬀerentiation  yields 

and 

(cos y)y �  = 1 

y �  =

Speciﬁc  diﬀerentiation  formulas 

You  will  be  responsible  for  knowing  formulas  for  the  derivatives  and  how  to  deduce  these  formulas 
from  previous  information:  x ,  sin−1 x,  tan−1 x,  sin x,  cos x,  tan x,  sec x, e  ,  ln x .

For  example,  let’s  calculate 

sec x:

sec x =

d

= 

−(− sin x)
cos2 x 

= tan x sec x 

You  may  be  asked  to  ﬁnd

sin x  or

sin(h)

h 0  h
cos(h) − 1  = 0

Remember  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative:

dx 
is  the  case  of  rational  numbers,  using  implicit  diﬀerentiation.  We  can  do  this  two  ways: 

1st  method:  base  e 

� 
e ln x �r  =  e r ln x 
x  =  e ln x 
x r  = 
x r  =  x r  � r 
� 
e r ln x  =  e r ln x  d 
(r ln x)  =  e r ln x r

Finally,  in  the  ﬁrst  lecture  I  promised  you  that  you’d  learn  to  diﬀerentiate  anything—  even 
something  as  complicated  as 
d x tan−1 x 
e 
dx 

So  let’s  do  it! 

d
e uv  =  e uv

Substituting, 
e x tan−1  x  =  e x tan−1  x
