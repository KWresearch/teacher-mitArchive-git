Geometric  Viewpoint  on  Derivatives 

Figure  1:  A  function  with  secant  and  tangent  lines 

The  derivative  is  the  slope  of  the  line  tangent  to  the  graph  of  f (x).  But  what  is  a  tangent  line, 
exactly?

•	 It  is  NOT  just  a  line  that meets  the  graph  at  one  point. 
•	 It  is the  limit of  the secant  line  (a  line drawn between  two points on  the graph) as  the distance 
between  the  two  points  goes  to  zero.

Finding  the  tangent  line. 

Write  the  equation  for  the  tangent  line  at  the  point  (x0 , y0 )  using  the  equation  for  a  line, which  you 
all  learned  in  high  school  algebra:

Just  for  fun,  let’s  compute  the  area  of  the  triangle  that  the  tangent  line  forms  with  the  x- and 
y-axes  (see  the  shaded  region  in  Fig.  4). 
First  calculate  the  x-intercept  of  this  tangent  line.  The  x-intercept  is  where  y  =  0.  Plug  y  = 0 
into  the  equation  for  this  tangent  line  to  get:

and x = 
Next we claim  that  the y-intercept  is at y = 2y0 .  Since y = 
y 
x
the  graph  is  symmetric  when  x  and  y  are  exchanged.  By  symmetry,  then,  the  y-intercept  is  at 
y  = 2y0 .  If  you  don’t  trust  reasoning  with  symmetry,  you  may  follow  the  same  chain  of  algebraic 
reasoning  that  we  used  in  ﬁnding  the  x-intercept.  (Remember,  the  y-intercept  is  where  x = 0.)

line.

Notations 

Calculus,  rather  like  English  or  any  other  language,  was  developed  by  several  people.  As  a  result, 
just  as  there  are many  ways  to  express  the  same  thing,  there  are many  notations  for  the  derivative. 
Since  y = f (x),  it’s  natural  to  write 
Δy = Δf  = f (x) − f (x0 ) = f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 ) 
We  say  “Delta  y”  or  “Delta  f ”  or  the  “change  in  y”. 
If  we  divide  both  sides  by Δx = x − x0 ,  we  get  two  expressions  for  the  diﬀerence  quotient: 

Δf 
Δy  =
Δx  Δx 

Taking  the  limit  as Δx → 0,  we  get 
Δy 
Δx 
Δf 
Δx 

dy 
→ 
(Leibniz’  notation) 
dx 
→  f � (x0 )  (Newton’s  notation) 

When  you  use  Leibniz’  notation,  you  have  to  remember  where  you’re  evaluating  the  derivative 
—  in  the  example  above,  at  x = x0 . 
Other,  equally  valid  notations  for  the  derivative  of  a  function  f  include 

df 
, f � ,  and  Df 
dx

(From  here  on,  we  replace  x0  with  x,  so  as  to  have  less  writing  to  do.)  Since 
(x + Δx)n  = (x + Δx)(x + Δx)...(x + Δx)  n  times 
�
� 
x n  + n(Δx)x n−1  + O  (Δx)2
O(Δx)2  is  shorthand  for “all of  the  terms with  (Δx)2 ,  (Δx)3 ,  and  so on up  to  (Δx)n .”  (This  is part 
of  what  is  known  as  the  binomial  theorem;  see  your  textbook  for  details.)

Physical  Interpretation  of  Derivatives 

You  can  think  of  the  derivative  as  representing  a  rate  of  change  (speed  is  one  example  of  this). 
On Halloween, MIT students have a tradition of dropping pumpkins from the roof of this building, 
which  is  about  400  feet  high. 
The  equation  of  motion  for  ob jects  near  the  earth’s  surface  (which  we  will  just  accept  for  now) 
implies  that  the  height  above  the  ground  y  of  the  pumpkin  is: 
y = 400 − 16t2 

The  average  speed  of  the  pumpkin  (diﬀerence  quotient)  = 

When  the  pumpkin  hits  the  ground,  y = 0, 
400 − 16t2  = 0

Solve  to  ﬁnd  t = 5.  Thus  it  takes  5  seconds  for  the  pumpkin  to  reach  the  ground. 

Average  speed = 

400  ft 
5 sec 

= 80  ft/s

A  spectator  is  probably more  interested  in  how  fast  the  pumpkin  is  going when  it  slams  into  the 
ground.  To  ﬁnd  the  instantaneous  velocity  at  t = 5,  let’s  evaluate  y � : 
y �  = −32t = (−32)(5) = −160  ft/s  (about  110 mph) 
y �  is  negative  because  the  pumpkin’s  y-coordinate  is  decreasing:  it  is moving  downward.
