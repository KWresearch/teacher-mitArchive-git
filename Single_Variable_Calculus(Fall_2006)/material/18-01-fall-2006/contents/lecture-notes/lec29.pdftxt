Lecture  29:  Partial  Fractions 

We continue the discussion we started last lecture about integrating rational functions.  We 
deﬁned a rational function as the ratio of two polynomials: 

P (x)

Q(x)


+ 

�  � 
We looked at the example 
1
x − 1
That same problem can be disguised: 
3  =
x + 2 
� 

1
x − 1 
which leaves us to integrate this: 

+

4x − 1 
x2  + x − 2 

dx = ??? 

� 
3 
dx =  ln |x − 1| + 3 ln |x + 2| + c 
x + 2 

(x + 2) + 3(x − 1)
(x − 1)(x + 2) 

4x − 1

x2  + x − 2


= 

P (x)
Goal: we want to ﬁgure out a systematic way to split 
Q(x)


into simpler pieces. 

First, we factor the denominator Q(x).

4x − 1
x2  + x − 2

= 

4x − 1
(x − 1)(x + 2) 

= 

A  + 
x − 1 

B

x + 2


There’s a slow way to ﬁnd A  and B . You can clear the denominator by multiplying through by 
(x − 1)(x + 2): 
(4x − 1) = A(x + 2) + B (x − 1) 

From this, you ﬁnd 

4 = A + B  and  − 1 = 2A − B 
You can then solve these simultaneous linear equations for A  and B . This approach can take a very 
long time if you’re working with 3, 4, or more variables. 

There’s a faster way, which we call the “cover-up method”. Multiply both sides by (x − 1): 
4x − 1 
x + 2 
Set x = 1  to make the B  term drop out: 

B 
(x − 1) 
x + 2 

= A + 

4 − 1
1 + 2 

= A

A = 1

The fastest way is to do this in your head or physically cover  up  the struck-through terms.  For 
instance, to evaluate B : 
4x − 1 
A� 
B 
� + 
= 
����
(x − 1)����
x − 1
(x + 2)
(x + 2) 
�
Implicitly, we are multiplying by (x + 2)  and setting x = −2. This gives us 
4(−2) − 1
−2 − 1 

⇒ 
= B  = 

B = 3 

What we’ve described so far works when Q(x)  factors completely into distinct  factors and the 
degree of P  is less than the degree of Q. 

If the factors of Q  repeat, we use a slightly diﬀerent approach. For example:


+

=

+ 

C

x + 2 

x2  + 2 
A
B
(x − 1)2 (x + 2) 
x − 1
(x − 1)2 
Use the cover-up method on the highest degree term in (x − 1). 
x2  + 1 
12  + 2 
= B + [stuﬀ](x − 1)2  =
⇒ 
⇒ 
= B  = 
x + 2 
1 + 2 
Implicitly, we multiplied by (x − 1)2 , then took the limit as x → 1. 
C  can also be evaluated by the cover-up method. Set x = −2  to get 
(−2)2  + 2  = C  = 
x2  + 2 2 
⇒ 
(x − 1) 
(−2 − 1)2 

⇒ 
= C + [stuﬀ](x + 2)  = 

B = 1 

C  =

This yields 

2/3 
1
x2  + 2 
A 
(x − 1)2 
x − 1
(x − 1)2 (x + 2) 
x + 2 
Cover-up can’t be used to evaluate A. Instead, plug in an easy value of x: x = 0. 
− A  = ⇒  A =
= ⇒  1 = 1 +

Now we have a complete answer:

3(x + 2) 

Not all polynomials factor completely (without resorting to using complex numbers). For exam­
ple: 

1 
(x2  + 1)(x − 1) 
We ﬁnd A1 , as usual, by the cover-up method.

Now, plug in any value other than x = 0, 1. For example, let’s use x = −1. 
B1  − 1/2
B1 (−1) − 1/2

Alternatively, you can multiply out to clear the denominators (not done here).

What if we’re faced with something that looks like this? 

dx 
(x − 1)10

This is actually quite simple to integrate:

dx 
(x − 1)10  = − 
(x − 1)−9  + c

What about this? 

dx 
(x2  + 1)10 

Here, we would use trig substitution: 

x = tan u  and  dx = sec2 udu 

and the trig identity 

to get 

�

tan2 u + 1 = sec2 u 
� 

sec2 u du  = 
(sec2 u)10 
From here, we can evaluate this integral using the methods we introduced two lectures ago.
