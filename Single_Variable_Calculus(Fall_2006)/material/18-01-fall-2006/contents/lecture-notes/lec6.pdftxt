Figure  1:  Geometric  deﬁnition  of  M (a) 

2.  Geometrically, M (a)  is  the  slope  of  the  graph  y = a at  x = 0. 
x

The  trick  to  ﬁguring  out  what  M (a)  is  is  to  beg  the  question  and  deﬁne  e  as  the  number  such 
that  M (e)  =  1.  Now  can  we  be  sure  there  is  such  a  number  e?  First  notice  that  as  the  base  a 
increases,  the  graph  a gets  steeper.  Next,  we  will  estimate  the  slope  M (a)  for  a  =  2  and  a  = 4 
x
geometrically.  Look  at  the  graph  of  2x  in  Fig.  2.  The  secant  line  from  (0, 1)  to  (1, 2)  of  the  graph 
y = 2x  has  slope  1.  Therefore,  the  slope  of  y = 2x  at  x = 0  is  less:  M (2) < 1  (see  Fig.  2).

Next,  look  at  the  graph  of  4x  in  Fig.  3.  The  secant  line  from  (−

y = 4x  has  slope  1.  Therefore,  the  slope  of  y = 4x  at  x = 0  is  greater  than M (4) > 1  (see  Fig.  3). 
Somewhere  in  between  2  and  4  there  is  a  base  whose  slope  at  x = 0  is  1.

Thus  we  can  deﬁne  e  to  be  the  unique  number  such  that

What  is

(e x ) = M (e)e x .  So

Natural  log  (inverse  function  of  ex) 

To  understand  M (a)  better,  we  study  the  natural  log  function  ln(x).  This  function  is  deﬁned  as 
follows: 

If  y = e x ,  then  ln(y) = x 

(or) 

If  w =  ln(x),  then  e x  = w 

Note  that  e is  always  positive,  even  if  x  is  negative. 
x
Recall  that  ln(1) = 0; 
ln(x) < 0  for  0 < x < 1; 
ln(x) > 0  for  x > 1.  Recall  also  that 

Let  us  use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  to  ﬁnd 

ln(x1x2 ) = ln x1  + ln x2 
d  ln(x).  w =  ln(x).  We  want  to  ﬁnd

Finally,  what  about 

d 
dx

(a x )? 

There  are  two  methods  we  can  use: 

Method  1:  Write  base  e  and  use  chain  rule. 
�
�x 
a x  =  eln(a)  = e x ln(a) 

Rewrite  a  as  eln(a) .  Then, 

That  looks  like  it might  be  tricky  to  diﬀerentiate.  Let’s  work  up  to  it: 

d 
e x 
dx 

d 
e 3x 
dx 

= 
and  by  the  chain  rule, 

e x 

= 

3e 3x 

Remember,  ln(a)  is  just  a  constant  number–  not  a  variable!  Therefore, 

(ln a)e(ln a)x 

d
e(ln a)x  = 
dx 
or 
d  (a x ) =  ln(a)  a x 
· 
dx 

d  (a x ) = M (a)  a x 
·

dx 

Recall  that 

So  now  we  know  the  value  of M (a):  M (a) =  ln(a).

Even  if  we  insist  on  starting  with  another  base,  like  10,  the  natural  logarithm  appears:

d  10x  = (ln 10)10x 
dx 

The  base  e  may  seem  strange  at  ﬁrst.  But,  it  comes  up  everywhere.  After  a  while,  you’ll  learn  to 
appreciate  just  how  natural  it  is. 

Method  2:  Logarithmic  Diﬀerentiation. 

The  idea  is  to  ﬁnd 
u = f (x).

ln(f (x))  instead.  Sometimes  this  approach  is  easier.  Let

Apply  this  to  f (x) = a .

Example  1.

With  variable  (“moving”)  exponents,  you  should  use  either  base  e  or  logarithmic  diﬀerentiation. 
In  this  example,  we  will  use  the  latter. 

f  =  x x

ln f  =  x ln x

(ln f )�  =

f �  = f (ln f )�  = x x  (ln(x) + 1) 

Therefore, 

If  you wanted  to  solve  this  using  the  base  e  approach,  you would  say  f  = ex ln x  and  diﬀerentiate 
it  using  the  chain  rule.  It  gets  you  the  same  answer,  but  requires  a  little  more  writing.

Remark  1.  We  never  ﬁgured  out  what  the  exact  numerical  value  of  e  was.  Now  we  can  use  this 
limit  formula;  k = 10  gives  a  pretty  good  approximation  to  the  actual  value  of  e. 
Remark  2.  Logs  are  used  in  all  sciences  and  even  in  ﬁnance.  Think  about  the  stock  market.  If  I 
say  the market  fell 50 points  today,  you’d need  to know whether  the market average before  the drop 
was  300  points  or  10, 000.  In  other  words,  you  care  about  the  percent  change,  or  the  ratio  of  the 
change  to  the  starting  value:
