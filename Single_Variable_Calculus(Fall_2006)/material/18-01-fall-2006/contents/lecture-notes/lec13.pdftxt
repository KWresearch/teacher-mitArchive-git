Newton’s  Method 

Newton’s method  is  a  powerful  tool  for  solving  equations  of  the  form  f (x) = 0. 
Example  1.  f (x) =  x2  − 3.  In  other  words,  solve  x2  − 3 =  0.  We  already  know  that  the  solution

3.  Newton’s  method,  gives  a  good  numerical  approximation  to  the  answer.  The 
to  this  is  x  = 
method  uses  tangent  lines  (see  Fig.  1). 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  Newton’s  Method,  Example  1. 

The goal  is  to ﬁnd where  the graph crosses  the x-axis.  We  start with a guess of x0  = 1.  Plugging 
that  back  into  the  equation  for  y ,  we  get  y0  = 12  − 3 = −2,  which  isn’t  very  close  to  0. 
Our next guess is x1 , where the tangent line to the function at x0  crosses the x-axis.  The equation 
for  the  tangent  line  is: 
y − y0  = m(x − x0 ) 
When  the  tangent  line  intercepts  the  x-axis,  y = 0,  so 
−y0  =  m(x1  − x0 ) 
y0 − 
=  x1  − x0

x1  =  x0  −

Remember:  m  is  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  y = f (x)  at  the  point  (x0 , y0 ).

Summary 

Newton’s Method  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  3  and  can  be  summarized  as  follows: 

xk+1  = xk  − 

f (xk ) 
f � (xk )

Ring  on  a  String 

Consider  a  ring  on  a  string  1  held  ﬁxed  at  two  ends  at  (0, 0)  and  (a, b)  (see  Fig.  6).  The  ring  is 
free  to  slide  to  any  point.  Find  the  position  (x, y)  of  the  string. 

Figure  6:  Illustration  of  the  Ring  on  a  String  problem. 

Physical  Principle The  ring  settles at  the  lowest height  (lowest potential  energy),  so  the prob­
lem  is  to minimize  y  sub ject  to  the  constraint  that  (x, y)  is  on  the  string. 
� 
� 
Constraint  The  length  L  of  the  string  is  ﬁxed: 
x2  + y2  + (x − a)2  + (y − b)2  = L 
The  function  y = y(x)  is  determined  implicitly  by  the  constraint  equation  above.  We  traced  the 
constraint  curve  (possible positions  of  the  ring)  on  the blackboard.  This  curve  is  an  ellipse with  foci 
at  (0, 0)  and  (a, b),  but  knowing  that  the  curve  is  an  ellipse  does  not  help  us  ﬁnd  the  lowest  point. 
Experiments with the hanging ring show that the  lowest point  is somewhere  in the middle.  Since 
the  ends  of  the  constraint  curve  are  higher  than  the  middle,  the  lowest  point  is  a  critical  point 
(a  point  where  y � (x)  =  0).  In  class  we  also  gave  a  physical  demonstration  of  this  by  drawing  the 
horizontal  tangent  at  the  lowest  point. 
To  ﬁnd  the  critical  point,  diﬀerentiate  the  constraint  equation  implicitly  with  respect  to  x,

From  Fig.  6,  we  see  that  the  last  equation  can  be  interpreted  geometrically  as  saying  that 
sin α = sin β 
where  α  and  β  are  the  angles  the  left  and  right  portions  of  the  string make  with  the  vertical. 

Physical  and  geometric  conclusions 

The  angles  α  and  β  are  equal.  Using  vectors  to  compute  the  force  exerted  by  gravity  on  the  two 
halves  of  the  string,  one  ﬁnds  that  there  is  equal  tension  in  the  two  halves  of  the  string  - a  physical 
equilibrium.  (From  another  point  of  view,  the  equal  angle  property  expresses  a  geometric  property 
of  ellipses:  Suppose  that  the  ellipse  is  a  mirror.  A  ray  of  light  from  the  focus  (0, 0)  reﬂects  oﬀ  the 
mirror  according  to  the  rule  angle  of  incidence  equals  angle  of  reﬂection,  and  therefore  the  ray  goes 
directly  to  the  other  focus  at  (a, b).)

Adding  these  two  equations,

The  equations  for  the  vertical  legs  of  the  right  triangles  are  (note  that  y < 0):

to  write  L cos α = L 
Use  the  relation  sin α =

Finally,  to  ﬁnd  the  formula  for  x,  use  the  similar  right  triangles

Thus  we  have  formulae  for  x  and  y  in  terms  of  a,  b  and  L. 
I  omitted  the  derivation  of  the  formulae  for  x  and  y  in  lecture  because  it  is  long  and  because we 
got  all  of  our  physical  intuition  and  understanding  out  of  the  problem  from  the  balance  condition 
that  was  the  immediate  consequence  of  the  critical  point  computation. 
Final  Remark.  In  18.02,  you will  learn  to  treat  constrained max/min  problems  in  any  number 
of  variables  using  a  method  called  Lagrange multipliers.
