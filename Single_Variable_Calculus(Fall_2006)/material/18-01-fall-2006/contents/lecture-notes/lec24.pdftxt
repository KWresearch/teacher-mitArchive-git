Lecture  24:  Numerical  Integration 

Numerical  Integration 
�  b 
We  use  numerical  integration  to  ﬁnd  the  deﬁnite  integrals  of  expressions  that  look  like:

We  also  resort  to  numerical  integration  when  an  integral  has  no  elementary  antiderivative.  For 
instance,  there  is  no  formula  for  �  x

Numerical  integration  yields  numbers  rather  than  analytical  expressions. 
We’ll talk about three techniques  for numerical  integration:  Riemann sums,  the trapezoidal rule, 
and  Simpson’s  rule.

Here, 

xi  − xi−1  = Δx 


(or,  xi  = xi−1  + Δx)

y0  = f (x0 ), y1  = f (x1 ), . . . yn  = f (xn )

2.  Trapezoidal  Rule 

The  trapezoidal  rule  divides  up  the  area  under  the  function  into  trapezoids,  rather  than  rectangles.

The  area  of  a  trapezoid  is  the  height  times  the  average  of  the  parallel  bases:

Note:  The  trapezoidal  rule  gives  a  more  symmetric  treatment  of  the  two  ends  (a  and  b)  than  a 
Riemann  sum  does —  the  average  of  left  and  right  Riemann  sums. 

3.  Simpson’s  Rule 

This  approach  often  yields  much  more  accurate  results  than  the  trapezoidal  rule  does.  Here,  we 
match  quadratics  (i.e.  parabolas),  instead  of  straight  or  slanted  lines,  to  the  graph.  This  approach 
requires  an  even  number  of  intervals.
