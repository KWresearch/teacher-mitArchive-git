Lecture  12:  Related  Rates


Example  1.  Police  are  30  feet  from  the  side  of  the  road.  Their  radar  sees  your  car  approaching  at 
80  feet  per  second  when  your  car  is  50  feet  away  from  the  radar  gun.  The  speed  limit  is  65  miles 
per  hour  (which  translates  to  95  feet  per  second).  Are  you  speeding? 
First,  draw  a  diagram  of  the  setup  (as  in  Fig.  1): 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  example  1:  triangle  with  the  police,  the  car,  the  road,  D  and  x  labelled. 

Next, give the variables names.  The important thing to ﬁgure out is which variables are changing. 
= D �  = 
dD
At  D = 50,  x = 40.  (We  know  this  because  it’s  a  3-4-5  right  triangle.)  In  addition, 
dt 
−80.  D �  is  negative  because  the  car  is  moving  in  the  −x  direction.  Don’t  plug  in  the  value  for  D 
yet!  D  is  changing,  and  it  depends  on  x. 
The  Pythagorean  theorem  says

302  + x 2  = D2

This  exceeds  the  speed  limit  of  95  feet  per  second;  you  are,  in  fact,  speeding.

There  is  another,  longer,  way  of  solving  this  problem.  Start  with

The  general  strategy  for  these  types  of  problems  is: 

1.  Draw  a  picture.  Set  up  variables  and  equations. 

2.  Take  derivatives. 

3.  Plug  in  the  given  values.  Don’t  plug  the  values  in  until  after  taking  the  derivatives. 

Example  2.  Consider  a  conical  tank.  Its  radius at  the  top  is  4  feet,  and  it’s  10  feet high.  It’s being 
ﬁlled  with  water  at  the  rate  of  2  cubic  feet  per minute.  How  fast  is  the  water  level  rising  when  it  is 
5  feet  high?

From  Fig.  2),  the  volume  of  the  tank  is  given  by

The key here is to draw the two-dimensional cross-section.  We use the letters r and h to represent 
the  variable  radius  and height  of  the water  at  any  level.  We  can ﬁnd  the  relationship between  r  and 
h  from  Fig.  3)  using  similar  triangles. 

From  Fig.  3),  we  see  that

Related  rates  also  arise  on  Problem  Set  3  (Fig.  4).  There’s  a  part  II  margin  of  error  problem

There  is  also  a  parabolic mirror  problem  based  on  similar  ideas  (Fig.  5).
