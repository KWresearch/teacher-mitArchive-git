Example  1.

We  proved  this  by  an  explicit  computation  for  a = 0, 1, 2, ....  From  this,  we  also  got  the  formula  for 
a = −1, −2, ....  Let  us  try  to  extend  this  formula  to  cover  rational  numbers,  as  well:

so  nyn−1 dy  = mx m−1 .  Solve  for

Example 2.  Equation of a circle with a radius of 1:  x2 + y2  = 1 which we can write as y2  = 1− x2 . 
So  y = ±√

y3 + xy2 + 1 = 0.  In  this case,  it’s not  easy  to  solve  for y  as a  function of x.  Instead,

we  use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  to  ﬁnd

Inverse  Functions 
If  y = f (x)  and  g(y) = x,  we  call  g  the  inverse  function  of  f ,  f −1 : 
x = g(y) = f −1 (y) 

Now,  let  us  use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  to  ﬁnd  the  derivative  of  the  inverse  function. 

y  =  f (x) 
f −1 (y) =  x 
(f −1 (y)) = 
d

So,  implicit  diﬀerentiation makes  it  possible  to  ﬁnd  the  derivative  of  the  inverse  function.

This  form  is messy.  Let  us  use  some  geometry  to  simplify  it. 

Figure  1:  Triangle  with  angles  and  lengths  corresponding  to  those  in  the  example  illustrating  diﬀerentiation  using 
the  inverse  function  arctan 

In  this  triangle,  tan(y) = x  so


arctan(x) = y

The  Pythagorian  theorem  tells  us  the  length  of  the  hypotenuse: 
1 + x2 

h = 

From  this,  we  can  ﬁnd 

From  this,  we  get

Graphing  an  Inverse  Function. 
Suppose  y  =  f (x)  and  g(y) =  f −1 (y) =  x.  To  graph  g  and  f  together  we  need  to  write  g  as  a 
function  of  the  variable  x.  If  g(x) =  y ,  then  x  =  f (y),  and  what  we  have  done  is  to  trade  the 
variables  x  and  y .  This  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  2 
◦ 
f −1 (f (x)) = x  f −1  f (x) = x

f (f −1 (x)) = x  f

◦ 
f −1 (x) = x

Figure  2:  You  can  think  about  f −1  as  the  graph  of  f  reﬂected  about  the  line  y = x
