Lecture  9:  Linear  and  Quadratic  Approximations


Unit  2:  Applications  of  Diﬀerentiation


Today,  we’ll  be  using  diﬀerentiation  to make  approximations. 

Linear  Approximation 

Figure  1:  Tangent  as  a  linear  approximation  to  a  curve 

The  tangent  line  approximates  f (x).  It  gives  a  good  approximation  near  the  tangent  point  x0 . 
As  you  move  away  from  x0 ,  however,  the  approximation  grows  less  accurate. 
f (x) ≈ f (x0 ) + f � (x0 )(x − x0 ) 

Example  1.  f (x) =  ln x,  x0  = 1  (basepoint)

Basic  list  of  linear  approximations 
In  this  list,  we  always  use  base  point  x0  = 0  and  assume  that  |x| << 1. 
1.  sin x ≈ x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
2.  cos x ≈ 1  (if  x ≈ 0) 
3.  e ≈ 1 + x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
x
4.  ln(1 + x) ≈ x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
5.  (1 + x)r  ≈ 1 + rx  (if  x ≈ 0) 

(see  part  a  of  Fig.  2) 
(see  part  b  of  Fig.  2) 

Proofs 
Proof  of  1:  Take  f (x) = sin x,  then  f � (x) = cos x  and  f (0) = 0 
f � (0) = 1, f (x) ≈ f (0) + f � (0)(x − 0) = 0 + 1.x 
So  using  basepoint  x0  = 0, f (x) = x.  (The  proofs  of  2,  3  are  similar.  We  already  proved  4  above.) 
Proof  of  5:


f (0) = 1

f (x)  =  (1 + x)r ; 
d  (1 + x)r
|
x=0  = r(1 + x)r−1
f � (0)  = 
dx
f (x) =  f (0) + f � (0)x  = 1 + rx

x=0  = r

Example  2.  Find  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x) =

We  could  calculate  f � (x)  and  ﬁnd  f � (0).  But  instead,  we  will  do  this  by  combining  basic  approxi­
mations  algebraically.

Now,  we  discard  that  last  x2  term,  because  we’ve  already  thrown  out  a  number  of  other  x2  (and

|
higher  order)  terms  in  making  these  approximations.  Remember,  we’re  assuming  that  x  <<  1. 
This  means  that  x is  very  small,  x is  even  smaller,  etc.  We  can  ignore  these  higher-order  terms,

because  they  are  very,  very  small.  This  yields

(1 + 2x)10  ≈ 1 + 10(2x) (Use  (1 + u)r  ≈ 1 + ru  where  u = 2x  and  r = 10.)

If  v = 4  km/s,  and  the  speed  of  light  (c)  is  3 × 105  km/s,

c2 
between the times measured on the ground and in the satellite.  Nevertheless, engineers used this very 
approximation  (along  with  several  other  such  approximations)  to  calibrate  the  radio  transmitters 
on  GPS  satellites.  (The  satellites  transmit  at  a  slightly  oﬀset  frequency.)

example,  let’s  consider  f (x) = cos(x)  (see  Figure  4).  If  x0  = 0,  then  f (0) = cos(0) = 1,  and

Lecture  10:  Curve  Sketching 

Goal:  To  draw  the  graph  of  f  using  the  behavior  of  f �  and  f �� .  We  want  the  graph  to  be 
qualitatively  correct,  but  not  necessarily  to  scale. 
Typical  Picture: Here, y0  is the minimum value, and x0  is the point where that minimum occurs. 

Figure  1:  The  critical  point  of  a  function 
Notice  that  for  x < x0 ,  f � (x)  <  0.  In  other  words,  f  is  decreasing  to  the  left  of  the  critical  point. 
For  x > x0 ,  f � (x) > 0:  f  is  increasing  to  the  right  of  the  critical  point. 

Another  typical  picture: Here,  y0  is  the  critical  (maximum)  value,  and  x0  is  the  critical  point.  f 
is  decreasing  on  the  right  side  of  the  critical  point,  and  increasing  to  the  left  of  x0 .

Rubric  for  curve-sketching 

1.  (Precalc  skill)  Plot  the  discontinuities  of  f  —  especially  the  inﬁnite  ones! 
2.  Find  the  critical  points.	 These  are  the  points  at  which  f � (x)  =  0  (usually  where  the  slope 
changes  from  positive  to  negative,  or  vice  versa.) 

3.  (a)  Plot  the  critical  points  (and  critical  values),  but  only  if  it’s  relatively  easy  to  do  so. 
(b)  Decide  the  sign  of  f � (x)  in  between  the  critical  points  (if  it’s  not  already  obvious). 
4.  (Precalc  skill)  Find  and  plot  the  zeros  of  f .  These  are  the  values  of  x  for  which  f (x)  =  0. 
Only  do  this  if  it’s  relatively  easy. 
5.  (Precalc  skill)  Determine  the  behavior  at  the  endpoints  (or  at  ±∞). 

Example  1.  y = 3x − x3 

1.  No  discontinuities. 
2.	 y �  = 3 − 3x2  = 3(1 − x2 )  so,  y �  = 0  at  x = ±1. 
3.  (a)  At  x = 1,  y = 3 − 1 = 2. 
(b)  At  x = −1,  y = −3 + 1 = −2.  Mark  these  two  points  on  the  graph. 
4.  Find  the  zeros:  y = 3x − x = x(3 − x2 ) = 0  so  the  zeros  lie  at  x = 0, ±√
3
5.  Behavior  of  the  function  as  x → ±∞.

As  x → ∞,  the  x3  term  of  y  dominates,  so  y → −∞.  Likewise,  as  x → −∞,  y → ∞.

Putting  all  of  this  information  together  gives  us  the  graph  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  3) 

Figure  3:  Sketch  of  the  function  y = 3x − x .  Note  the  labeled  zeros  and  critical  points

Let  us  do  step  3b  (the  sign  of  f � )  to  double-check  for  consistency. 
y �  = 3 − 3x 2  = 3(1 − x 2 ) 
y �  > 0  when  |x| < 1;  y �  < 0  when  |x| > 1.  Sure  enough,  y  is  increasing  between  x = −1  and  x = 1, 
and  is  decreasing  everywhere  else.

There  is a critical point at x = 1.  y �  > 0 on both  sides of x = 1,  so y  is  increasing everywhere.  In 
this  case,  the  sign  of  y �  doesn’t  change  at  the  critical  point,  but  the  graph  does  level  out  (see Fig.  6.

2nd  Derivative  Information 

When  f ��  > 0,  f �  is  increasing.  When  f ��  < 0,  f �  is  decreasing.  (See  Fig.  8  and  Fig.  9) 

Figure  8:  f  is  convex  (concave-up).  The  slope  increases  from  negative  to  positive  as  x  increases. 

Figure  9:  f  is  concave-down.  The  slope  decreases  from  positive  to  negative  as  x  increases. 

Therefore, the sign of the second derivative tells us about concavity/convexity of the graph.  Thus 
the  second  derivative  is  good  for  two  purposes. 

1.  Deciding whether a critical point is a maximum or a minimum.  This is known as the second  derivative 
test.

The  points  where  f ��  = 0  are  called  inﬂection  points.  Usually,  at  these  points  the  graph  changes 
from  concave  up  to  down,  or  vice  versa.  Refer  to  Fig.  10  to  see  how  this  looks  on  Example  1.

Example  2.  Find  the  max  and  the  min  of  the  function  in  Fig.  2 

Answer:  If  you’ve  already  graphed  the  function,  it’s  obvious  where  the  maximum  and  minimum 
values  are.  The  point  is  to  ﬁnd  the maximum  and minimum  without  sketching  the  whole  graph. 
Idea:  Look  for  the  max  and  min  among  the  critical  points  and  endpoints.You  can  see  from  Fig.  2 
that we only need to compare the heights or y -values corresponding to endpoints and critical points.

V  = πr2h =  constant 
We’re  also  looking  for  the  surface  area.  So  we  need  the  formula  for  that,  too: 

Now,  in  symbols,  the  problem  is  to minimize  S  with  V  constant.

By  checking  the  endpoints  in  Fig.  6,  we  see  that  the  minimum  area  was  achieved  at  x  =  1

The  maximum  area  is  not  achieved  in  0  < x <  1,  but  it  is  achieved  at  x  =  0  or  1.  The  maximum 
corresponds  to  using  the  whole  length  of  wire  for  one  square.

Lecture  12:  Related  Rates


Example  1.  Police  are  30  feet  from  the  side  of  the  road.  Their  radar  sees  your  car  approaching  at 
80  feet  per  second  when  your  car  is  50  feet  away  from  the  radar  gun.  The  speed  limit  is  65  miles 
per  hour  (which  translates  to  95  feet  per  second).  Are  you  speeding? 
First,  draw  a  diagram  of  the  setup  (as  in  Fig.  1): 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  example  1:  triangle  with  the  police,  the  car,  the  road,  D  and  x  labelled. 

Next, give the variables names.  The important thing to ﬁgure out is which variables are changing.

The  general  strategy  for  these  types  of  problems  is: 

1.  Draw  a  picture.  Set  up  variables  and  equations. 

2.  Take  derivatives. 

3.  Plug  in  the  given  values.  Don’t  plug  the  values  in  until  after  taking  the  derivatives. 

Example  2.  Consider  a  conical  tank.  Its  radius at  the  top  is  4  feet,  and  it’s  10  feet high.  It’s being 
ﬁlled  with  water  at  the  rate  of  2  cubic  feet  per minute.  How  fast  is  the  water  level  rising  when  it  is 
5  feet  high?

the  variable  radius  and height  of  the water  at  any  level.  We  can ﬁnd  the  relationship between  r  and 
h  from  Fig.  3)  using  similar  triangles.

Lecture  13:  Newton’s  Method  and  Other 
Applications 

Newton’s  Method 

Newton’s method  is  a  powerful  tool  for  solving  equations  of  the  form  f (x) = 0. 
Example  1.  f (x) =  x2  − 3.  In  other  words,  solve  x2  − 3 =  0.  We  already  know  that  the  solution 
√
3.  Newton’s  method,  gives  a  good  numerical  approximation  to  the  answer.  The 
to  this  is  x  = 
method  uses  tangent  lines  (see  Fig.  1). 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  Newton’s  Method,  Example  1. 

The goal  is  to ﬁnd where  the graph crosses  the x-axis.  We  start with a guess of x0  = 1.  Plugging 
that  back  into  the  equation  for  y ,  we  get  y0  = 12  − 3 = −2,  which  isn’t  very  close  to  0. 
Our next guess is x1 , where the tangent line to the function at x0  crosses the x-axis.  The equation 
for  the  tangent  line  is: 
y − y0  = m(x − x0 ) 
When  the  tangent  line  intercepts  the  x-axis,  y = 0,  so 
−y0  =  m(x1  − x0 ) 
y0 − 
=  x1  − x0 
m 
x1  =  x0  − 
y0 
m 
Remember:  m  is  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  y = f (x)  at  the  point  (x0 , y0 ).

xk+1  = xk  −

Ring  on  a  String 

Consider  a  ring  on  a  string  1  held  ﬁxed  at  two  ends  at  (0, 0)  and  (a, b)  (see  Fig.  6).  The  ring  is 
free  to  slide  to  any  point.  Find  the  position  (x, y)  of  the  string. 

Figure  6:  Illustration  of  the  Ring  on  a  String  problem. 

Physical  Principle The  ring  settles at  the  lowest height  (lowest potential  energy),  so  the prob­
lem  is  to minimize  y  sub ject  to  the  constraint  that  (x, y)  is  on  the  string. 
� 
� 
Constraint  The  length  L  of  the  string  is  ﬁxed: 
x2  + y2  + (x − a)2  + (y − b)2  = L 
The  function  y = y(x)  is  determined  implicitly  by  the  constraint  equation  above.  We  traced  the 
constraint  curve  (possible positions  of  the  ring)  on  the blackboard.  This  curve  is  an  ellipse with  foci 
at  (0, 0)  and  (a, b),  but  knowing  that  the  curve  is  an  ellipse  does  not  help  us  ﬁnd  the  lowest  point. 
Experiments with the hanging ring show that the  lowest point  is somewhere  in the middle.  Since 
the  ends  of  the  constraint  curve  are  higher  than  the  middle,  the  lowest  point  is  a  critical  point 
(a  point  where  y � (x)  =  0).  In  class  we  also  gave  a  physical  demonstration  of  this  by  drawing  the 
horizontal  tangent  at  the  lowest  point. 
To  ﬁnd  the  critical  point,  diﬀerentiate  the  constraint  equation  implicitly  with  respect  to  x,

From  Fig.  6,  we  see  that  the  last  equation  can  be  interpreted  geometrically  as  saying  that 
sin α = sin β 
where  α  and  β  are  the  angles  the  left  and  right  portions  of  the  string make  with  the  vertical. 

Physical  and  geometric  conclusions 

The  angles  α  and  β  are  equal.  Using  vectors  to  compute  the  force  exerted  by  gravity  on  the  two 
halves  of  the  string,  one  ﬁnds  that  there  is  equal  tension  in  the  two  halves  of  the  string  - a  physical 
equilibrium.  (From  another  point  of  view,  the  equal  angle  property  expresses  a  geometric  property 
of  ellipses:  Suppose  that  the  ellipse  is  a  mirror.  A  ray  of  light  from  the  focus  (0, 0)  reﬂects  oﬀ  the 
mirror  according  to  the  rule  angle  of  incidence  equals  angle  of  reﬂection,  and  therefore  the  ray  goes 
directly  to  the  other  focus  at  (a, b).)

got  all  of  our  physical  intuition  and  understanding  out  of  the  problem  from  the  balance  condition 
that  was  the  immediate  consequence  of  the  critical  point  computation.

Lecture  14:  Mean  Value  Theorem  and  Inequalities


Mean-Value  Theorem


The Mean-Value  Theorem  (MVT)  is  the  underpinning  of  calculus.  It  says: 
If  f  is  diﬀerentiable  on  a < x < b,  and  continuous  on  a ≤ x ≤ b,  then 
f (b) − f (a)  = f � (c) 
(for  some  c,  a < c < b)
b − a 

Here, 

f (b) − f (a)
b − a 

is  the  slope  of  a  secant  line,  while  f � (c)  is  the  slope  of  a  tangent  line. 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem. 

Geometric  Proof:  Take  (dotted)  lines  parallel  to  the  secant  line,  as  in  Fig.  1  and  shift  them  up 
from below the graph until one of them ﬁrst touches the graph.  Alternatively, one may have to start 
with  a  dotted  line  above  the  graph  and  move  it  down  until  it  touches. 
If  the  function  isn’t  diﬀerentiable,  this  approach  goes  wrong.  For  instance,  it  breaks  down  for 
the  function  f (x) =  |x|.  The  dotted  line  always  touches  the  graph  ﬁrst  at x = 0,  no matter what  its 
slope  is,  and  f � (0)  is  undeﬁned  (see  Fig.  2).

Interpretation  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem 

You  travel  from  Boston  to  Chicago  (which  we’ll  assume  is  a  1,000  mile  trip)  in  exactly  3  hours.  At 
1000
some  time  in  between  the  two  cities,  you  must  have  been  going  at  exactly 
mph.

f (t) =  position, measured  as  the  distance  from  Boston. 


f (3) = 1000,
f (0) = 0,
a = 0,  and  b = 3. 
f (b) − f (a)
1000  =

where  f � (c)  is  your  speed  at  some  time,  c. 

= f � (c)

Versions  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem 

There  is  a  second  way  of  writing  the MVT: 
f (b) − f (a) =  f � (c)(b − a) 
f (b) =  f (a) + f � (c)(b − a)  (for  some  c, a < c < b) 

There  is  also  a  third  way  of  writing  the MVT:  change  the  name  of  b  to  x. 
f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) 

for  some  c, a < c < x 

The  theorem  does  not  say  what  c  is.  It  depends  on  f ,  a,  and  x. 
This  version  of  the MVT  should  be  compared  with  linear  approximation  (see  Fig.  3). 
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  x  near  a

The  tangent  line  in  the  linear  approximation  has  a  deﬁnite  slope  f � (a).  by  contrast  formula  is  an 
exact  formula.  It  conceals  its  lack  of  speciﬁcity  in  the  slope  f � (c),  which  could  be  the  slope  of  f  at 
any  point  between  a  and  x. 

Figure  3:  MVT  vs.  Linear  Approximation. 

Uses  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem. 

Key  conclusions:  (The  conclusions  from  the MVT  are  theoretical) 

1.  If  f � (x) > 0,  then  f  is  increasing. 
2.  If  f � (x) < 0,  then  f  is  decreasing. 
3.  If  f � (x) = 0  all  x,  then  f  is  constant. 

Deﬁnition  of  increasing/decreasing: 
⇒
⇒ 
Increasing means  a < b 
f (a) < f (b).  Decreasing means  a < b  = 
Proofs: 
Proof  of  1: 

f (a) < f (b).

a < b 
f (b) =  f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) 
Because  f � (c)  and  (b − a)  are  both  positive, 
f (b) = f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) > f (a) 
(The  proof  of  2  is  omitted  because  it  is  similar  to  the  proof  of  1) 
Proof  of  3: 

f (b) = f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) = f (a) + 0(b − a) = f (a) 

Conclusions 1,2, and 3 seem obvious, but let me persuade you that they are not.  Think back to the 
deﬁnition  of  the  derivative.  It  involves  inﬁnitesimals.  It’s  not  a  sure  thing  that  these  inﬁnitesimals 
have  anything  to  do  with  the  non-inﬁnitesimal  behavior  of  the  function.

Proof  of  2:  Deﬁne f1 (x) = ex − 1.  Then, f1 (0) = e0 − 1 = 0, and f � (x) = ex  > 0.  (This last assertion

is  from  step  1).  Hence,  f1 (x)  is  increasing,  so  f (x) > f (0)  for  x > 0.  That  is: 

e x  > 1  for  x > 0

f � (x) = e x  − 1 = f1 (x) > 0  (if  x > 0).

Uniqueness  of  the  antiderivative  up  to  an  additive  constant. 
If  F � (x) = f (x),  and  G� (x) = f (x),  then  G(x) = F (x) + c  for  some  constant  factor  c. 
Proof:


(G − F )�  = f  − f  = 0


Recall that we proved as a corollary of the Mean Value Theorem that if a function has a derivative 
zero  then  it  is  constant.  Hence  G(x) − F (x) = c  (for  some  constant  c).  That  is,  G(x) = F (x) + c.

Exam  Review 

Exam  2  will  be  harder  than  exam  1 —  be  warned!  Here’s  a  list  of  topics  that  exam  2  will  cover: 

1.  Linear  and/or  quadratic  approximations 
2.  Sketches  of  y = f (x) 
3.  Maximum/minimum  problems. 
4.  Related  rates. 
5.  Antiderivatives.  Separation  of  variables. 
6.  Mean  value  theorem. 

More  detailed  notes  on  all  of  these  topics  are  provided  in  the  Exam  2  review  sheet.

18.01  UNIT  2  REVIEW;  Fall  2007 


The central theme of Unit 2 is that knowledge of f �  (and sometimes f ��) tells us something about 
x 
f  itself.  This  is  even  true  of  our  ﬁrst  topic,  approximation.  For  instance,  knowing  that  f (x) =  e
satisﬁes  f (0) = 1  and  f � (0) = 1,  we  can  say 

e x  � 1 + x  provided  x � 0 

The  linear  function  1 + x  is  much  simpler  than  e ,  so  f (0)  and  f �(0)  give  us  a  (very)  simpliﬁed 
x
picture  of  our  function,  useful  only  near  near  0.  For more  detail,  use  the  quadratic  approximation, 

x e  � 1 + x + x 2/2  provided  x � 0 

(still  only  works  well  near  0) 

The  second  and  third  practice  exams  are  actual  tests  from  previous  years.  The  exam  this  year 
is  similar  to  the  one  from  2006  posted  at  our  site.  It  has  6  questions  covering  the  following  topics. 
(No  Newton’s  method,  but  there  is  a  seventh,  extra  credit  problem.) 

1.  Linear  and/or  quadratic  approximations 

2.  Sketch  a  graph  y = f (x) 

3.  Max/min 

4.  Related  rates 

5.  Find  antiderivatives  and  solve  a  diﬀerential  equation  by  separating  variables 

6.  Mean  value  theorem. 

Remarks. 

1.  Recall  that  linear  [and  quadratic]  approximation  is 

f (x) � f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  [+(f �� (a)/2)(x − a)2 ] 

2.  You  should  expect  to  graph  a  function  y  = f (x),  where  f (x)  is  a  rational  function  (ratio  of 
polynomials). 

Warnings: 

a) When asked to  label the critical point on the graph, ﬁnd and mark the point (a, b).  In lecture 
we  called  x  =  a  the  critical  point  and  y  =  b  the  critical  value,  and  this  is  what  is  used  in  18.02, 
and  elsewhere.  But  for  this  exam  (and  this  is  just  an  inconsistency  in  language  that  you  will  have 
to  tolerate)  the words  “critical  point”  refer  to  the  point  on  the  graph  (a, b),  not  the  number  a  and 
the  point  on  the  x-axis.  The  same  applies  to  inﬂection  points. 

b)  y  = 1/(x − 1)  is  decreasing  on  the  intervals  −≈  < x <  1  and  1  < x <  ≈,  but  it  is  not 
decreasing  on  the  interval  −≈ < x < ≈.  Draw  the  graph  to  see. 
You  cannot  just  use  the  fact  that  y �  = −1/(x − 1)2  <  0  because  there  is  a  point  in  the  middle 
at  which  y  is  not  diﬀerentiable  —  and  not  even  continuous.  So  the  mean  value  theorem  does  not 
apply. 
c)  Similarly,  y  = 1/(x − 1)2  is  concave  up  on  −≈  < x <  1  and  1  < x <  ≈,  but  it  is  not 
concave  up  on  the  interval  −≈ < x < ≈.  Here  y ��  = 6/(x − 1)4  > 0,  but  there  is  a  singularity  in 
the  middle.  Plot  the  graph  yourself  to  see.

3.  The mean  value  theorem  says  that  if  f  is  diﬀerentiable,  then  for  some  c,  a < c < x, 

f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) 

It  is  used  as  follows.  Suppose  that  m < f � (c) < M  on  the  interval  a < c < x,  then 

f (x) = f (a) + f �(c)(x − a) < f (a) + M (x − a) 

Similarly, 

f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) > f (a) + m(x − a) 

Put  another  way,  if �f  = f (x) − f (a)  and �x = x − a,  and m < f �(c) < M  for  a < c < x,  then 

m�x < �f < M �x 

More  consequences  of  the  mean  value  theorem. 

A  function  f  is  called  increasing  (also  called  strictly  increasing)  if  x > a  implies  f (x)  > f (a). 
The reasoning above with m = 0  shows that  if f �  > 0,  then f  is  increasing.  Similarly  if f �  < 0,  then 
f  is  decreasing.  We  use  these  facts  every  time  we  sketch  a  graph  of  a  function  or  ﬁnd  a  maximum 
or minimum. 

A  similar  discussion  works  when  the  inequality  is  not  strict.  If  m �  f � (c)  � M  for  a < c < x, 
then 

f (a) + m(x − a) � f (x) � f (a) + M (x − a) 

A  function  is  called  nondecreasing  if  x > a  implies  f (x) �  f (a).  If  f �  � 0,  then  the  inequality 
above shows that f  is nondecreasing.  Conversely,  if the function is nondecreasing and diﬀerentiable, 
then  f �  � 0.  Similarly,  diﬀerentiable  functions  are  nonincreasing  if  and  only  if  they  satisfy  f �  � 0. 
Key  corollary  to  the  mean  value  theorem:  f �  = g �  implies  f − g  is  constant. 
In  Unit  2,  we  have  found  that  information  about  f �  gives  information  about  f .  In  particular, 
knowing a  starting value  for a  function and  its rate of change determines the  function.  A seemingly 
obvious  example  is  that  if  f �  =  0  for  all  x,  then  f  is  constant.  If  this  were  not  true,  then  the 
mathematical  notion  of  derivative  would  fail  to  coincide  with  our  intuitive  notion  of  what  rate  of 
change  and  cause  and  eﬀect  mean. 

But  this  fundamental  fact  needs  a  proof.  Derivatives  are  instantaneous  quantities,  obtained 
as  limits.  It  is  the  mean  value  theorem  that  allows  us  to  pass  in  rigorous  mathematical  fashion 
from  the  inﬁnitesimal  to  the  practical,  human  scale.  Here  is  the  proof.  If  f �  =  0,  then  one  can 
take  m  =  M  =  0  in  the  inequalities  above,  and  conclude  that  f (x) =  f (a).  In  other  words,  f  is 
constant.  As  an  immediate  consequence,  if  f �  = g � ,  then  f  and  g  diﬀer  by  a  constant.  (Apply  the 
previous argument  to  the  function f − g , whose  derivative  is 0.)  This basic  fact will  lead  us  shortly 
to  what  is  known  as  the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus.
