Lecture  18:  Deﬁnite  Integrals 

Integrals  are  used  to  calculate  cumulative  totals,  averages,  areas. 
Area  under  a  curve:  (See  Figure  1.) 

1.  Divide  region  into  rectangles 

2.  Add  up  area  of  rectangles 

3.  Take  limit  as  rectangles  become  thin

We  will  now  estimate  the  sum  using  some  3-dimensional  geometry. 
Consider  the  staircase  pyramid  as  pictured  in  Figure  3. 

Figure  3:  Staircase  pyramid:  left(top  view)  and  right  (side  view) 
1st  level:  n × n  bottom,  represents  volume  n2 .

2nd  level:  (n − 1) × (n − 1),  represents  volumne  (n − 1)2 ),  etc. 

Hence,  the  total  volume  of  the  staircase  pyramid  is  n2  + (n − 1)2  +  + 1.

Next,  the  volume  of  the  pyramid  is  greater  than  the  volume  of  the  inner  prism:

Example  2.  f (x) = x;  area  under  x  above  [0, b].  Reasoning  similar  to  Example  1,  but  easier,  gives 
a  sum  of  areas:

This  deﬁnite  integral  represents  the  area  under  the  curve  y = f (x)  above  [a, b]. 

called  a  Riemann  sum.

Deﬁnition:

f (x)dx 

← 

called  a  deﬁnite  integral 

Example  3.  (Integrals  applied  to  quantity  besides  area.)  Student  borrows  from  parents. 
P  =  principal  in  dollars,  t =  time  in  years,  r =  interest  rate  (e.g.,  6 %  is  r = 0.06/year). 
After  time  t,  you  owe  P (1 + rt) = P  + P rt 

The  integral  can be used  to  represent  the  total  amount borrowed  as  follows.  Consider  a  function 
f (t),  the  “borrowing  function”  in  dollars  per  year.  For  instance,  if  you  borrow  $  1000  /month,  then 
f (t) = 12, 000/year.  Allow  f  to  vary  over  time. 
Say Δt = 1/12  year = 1  month. 

ti  = i/12 

i = 1, · · ·  , 12.

In  the  limit  as Δt 

0,  we  have

f (ti )  is  the  borrowing  rate  during  the  ith  month  so  the  amount  borrowed  is  f (ti )Δt.  The  total  is

which  represents  the  total  borrowed  in  one  year  in  dollars  per  year. 
The  integral  can  also  be  used  to  represent  the  total  amount  owed.  The  amount  owed  depends 
on  the  interest  rate.  You  owe 
f (ti )(1 + r(1 − ti ))Δt 
�  1 
for  the  amount  borrowed  at  time  ti .  The  total  owed  for  borrowing  at  the  end  of  the  year  is
