Lecture  20:  Second  Fundamental  Theorem 

Recall:  First  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  (FTC  1)

f (x)dx = F (b) − F (a)

Do  all  continuous  functions  have  antiderivatives?  Yes.  However... 
What  about  a  function  like  this?

We  can  also  write  that  as 

e−x  dx =?? 
2 
Yes,  this  antiderivative  exists.  No,  it’s  not  a  function  we’ve met  before:  it’s  a  new  function.

The  new  function  is  deﬁned  as  an  integral:

F (x) =

It  will  have  the  property  that  F � (x) = e−x  .

Geometric  Proof  of  FTC  2:  Use  the  area  interpretation:  F (x)  equals  the  area  under  the  curve 
between  a  and  x. 

ΔF  =  F (x + Δx) − F (x)

ΔF  ≈

As  the  length Δx  of  the  interval  tends  to  0,  this  average  tends  to  f (x).

Proof  of  FTC  1  (using  FTC  2) 

� 
Start  with  F �  =  f  (we  assume  that  f  is  continuous).  Next,  deﬁne  G(x) = 
f (t)dt.  By  FTC2, 
G� (x) =  f (x).  Therefore,  (F  − G)�  =  F �  − G�  =  f  − f  =  0.  Thus,  F  − G  =  constant.  (Recall  we 
a 
used  the Mean  Value  Theorem  to  show  this). 
�  b 
Hence,  F (x) = G(x) + c.  Finally  since  G(a) = 0,

which  is  FTC  1. 
Remark.  In  the  preceding  proof  G  was  a  deﬁnite  integral  and  F  could  be  any  antiderivative.  Let

cos t dt = sin t��  = sin x  and G(0) = 0.

f (t)dt = G(b) = G(b) − G(a) = [F (b) − c] − [F (a) − c] = F (b) − F (a)

�  b 
If,  for  example,  F (x) = sin x + 21.  Then  F � (x) = cos x  and 
a 
Every  function  of  the  form  F (x) = G(x) + c  works  in  FTC  1. 

sin x dx = F (b) − F (a) = (sin b + 21) − (sin a + 21) = sin b − sin a

Another  “new”  function  of  this  type,  called  the  logarithmic  integral,  is  deﬁned  as 
2 
This  function  gives  the  approximate  number  of  prime  numbers  less  than  x.  A  common  encryption 
technique  involves  encoding  sensitive  information  like  your  bank  account  number  so  that  it  can  be 
sent  over  an  insecure  communication  channel.  The  message  can  only  be  decoded  using  a  secret 
prime  number.  To  know  how  safe  the  secret  is,  a  cryptographer  needs  to  know  roughly  how  many 
�  10201 
200-digit  primes  there  are.  You  can  ﬁnd  out  by  estimating  the  following  integral: 
10200

ln t

ln t 

We  know  that 
ln 10200  = 200 ln(10) ≈ 200(2.3) = 460  and 

ln 10201  = 201 ln(10) ≈ 462

There  are  LOTS  of  200-digit  primes.  The  odds  of  some  hacker  ﬁnding  the  200-digit  prime  required 
to  break  into  your  bank  account  number  are  very  very  slim.
