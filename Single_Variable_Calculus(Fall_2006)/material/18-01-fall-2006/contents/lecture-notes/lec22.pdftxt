Lecture  22:  Volumes  by  Disks  and  Shells 

Disks  and  Shells 

We  will  illustrate  the  2 methods  of  ﬁnding  volume  through  an  example. 
Example  1.  A  witch’s  cauldron 

Figure  1:  y = x rotated  around  the  y -axis.

Method  1:  Disks

The  area  of  the  disk  in  Figure  2  is  πx2 .  The  disk  has  thickness  dy  and  volume  dV  =  πx2dy .

But  100cm  =  1m.  Why  is  this  answer  diﬀerent?  The  resolution  of  this  paradox  is  hiding  in  the 
equation. 

V  = 

y = x 2 
⇒ 
At the top, 100 = x 2  =  x = 10 cm.  So the second cauldron looks like Figure  3.  By contrast, when 

Figure  3:  The  skinny  cauldron. 

a = 1 m,  the  top  is  ten  times wider:  1 = x2  or x = 1 m.  Our  equation,  y = x2 ,  is not  scale-invariant. 
The  shape  described  depends  on  the  units  used. 

Method  2:  Shells 

This  really  should  be  called  the  cylinder method.

Example  2.  The  boiling  cauldron 
Now,  let’s  ﬁll  this  cauldron with water,  and  light  a  ﬁre  under  it  to  get  the water  to  boil  (at  100oC). 
Let’s  say  it’s  a  cold  day:  the  temperature  of  the  air  outside  the  cauldron  is  0oC.  How  much  energy 
does  it  take  to boil  this water,  i.e.  to  raise  the water’s  temperature  from  0oC  to  100oC? Assume  the

So,  it  takes  about  500  candy  bars’  worth  of  energy  to  boil  the  water.

Figure 6:  Flow  is  faster  in  the  center  of  the  pipe.  It  slows–  “sticks”–  at  the  edges  (i.e.  the  inner  surface  of  the  pipe.) 

Example  3.  Pipe  ﬂow 
Poiseuille  was  the  ﬁrst  person  to  study  ﬂuid  ﬂow  in  pipes  (arteries,  capillaries).  He  ﬁgured  out  the 
velocity  proﬁle  for  ﬂuid  ﬂowing  in  pipes  is: 
v  =  c(R2  − r 2 ) 
distance 
speed  = 
v  = 
time 

Figure  7:  The  velocity  of  ﬂuid  ﬂow  vs.  distance  from  the  center  of  a  pipe  of  radius  R. 

The  ﬂow  through  the  “annulus”  (a.k.a  ring)  is  (area  of  ring)(ﬂow  rate) 

area  of  ring = 2πrdr  (See  Fig.  8:  circumference  2πr ,  thickness  dr) 

v  is  analogous  to  the  height  of  the  shell.

Notice that the ﬂow is proportional to R4 .  This means there’s a big advantage to having thick pipes. 
Example  4.  Dart  board 
You  aim  for  the  center  of  the  board,  but  your  aim’s  not  always  perfect.  Your  number  of  hits, N ,  at 
radius  r  is  proportional  to  e−r  .

N  = ce−r

This  looks  like:
