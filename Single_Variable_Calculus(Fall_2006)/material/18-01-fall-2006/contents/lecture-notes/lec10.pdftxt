Lecture  10:  Curve  Sketching 

Goal:  To  draw  the  graph  of  f  using  the  behavior  of  f �  and  f �� .  We  want  the  graph  to  be 
qualitatively  correct,  but  not  necessarily  to  scale. 
Typical  Picture: Here, y0  is the minimum value, and x0  is the point where that minimum occurs. 

Figure  1:  The  critical  point  of  a  function 
Notice  that  for  x < x0 ,  f � (x)  <  0.  In  other  words,  f  is  decreasing  to  the  left  of  the  critical  point. 
For  x > x0 ,  f � (x) > 0:  f  is  increasing  to  the  right  of  the  critical  point. 

Another  typical  picture: Here,  y0  is  the  critical  (maximum)  value,  and  x0  is  the  critical  point.  f 
is  decreasing  on  the  right  side  of  the  critical  point,  and  increasing  to  the  left  of  x0 .

Rubric  for  curve-sketching 

1.  (Precalc  skill)  Plot  the  discontinuities  of  f  —  especially  the  inﬁnite  ones! 
2.  Find  the  critical  points.	 These  are  the  points  at  which  f � (x)  =  0  (usually  where  the  slope 
changes  from  positive  to  negative,  or  vice  versa.) 

3.  (a)  Plot  the  critical  points  (and  critical  values),  but  only  if  it’s  relatively  easy  to  do  so. 
(b)  Decide  the  sign  of  f � (x)  in  between  the  critical  points  (if  it’s  not  already  obvious). 
4.  (Precalc  skill)  Find  and  plot  the  zeros  of  f .  These  are  the  values  of  x  for  which  f (x)  =  0. 
Only  do  this  if  it’s  relatively  easy. 
5.  (Precalc  skill)  Determine  the  behavior  at  the  endpoints  (or  at  ±∞). 

Example  1.  y = 3x − x3 

1.  No  discontinuities. 
2.	 y �  = 3 − 3x2  = 3(1 − x2 )  so,  y �  = 0  at  x = ±1. 
3.  (a)  At  x = 1,  y = 3 − 1 = 2. 
(b)  At  x = −1,  y = −3 + 1 = −2.  Mark  these  two  points  on  the  graph. 
4.  Find  the  zeros:  y = 3x − x = x(3 − x2 ) = 0  so  the  zeros  lie  at  x = 0, ±√
3
5.  Behavior  of  the  function  as  x → ±∞.

As  x → ∞,  the  x3  term  of  y  dominates,  so  y → −∞.  Likewise,  as  x → −∞,  y → ∞.

Putting  all  of  this  information  together  gives  us  the  graph  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  3) 

Figure  3:  Sketch  of  the  function  y = 3x − x .  Note  the  labeled  zeros  and  critical  points

Let  us  do  step  3b  (the  sign  of  f � )  to  double-check  for  consistency. 
y �  = 3 − 3x 2  = 3(1 − x 2 ) 
y �  > 0  when  |x| < 1;  y �  < 0  when  |x| > 1.  Sure  enough,  y  is  increasing  between  x = −1  and  x = 1, 
and  is  decreasing  everywhere  else.

This  example  illustrates why  it’s  important  to  ﬁnd  a  function’s  discontinuities  before  looking  at  the 
properties  of  its  derivative.  We  calculate

Warning:  The  derivative  is  never  positive,  so  you  might  think  that  y  is  always  decreasing,  and  its 
graph  looks  something  like  that  in  Fig.  4.

Example  3.  y = x3  − 3x2  + 3x. 

18.01  Fall  2006 

y �  = 3x 2  − 6x + 3 = 3(x 2  − 2x + 1) = 3(x − 1)2 
There  is a critical point at x = 1.  y �  > 0 on both  sides of x = 1,  so y  is  increasing everywhere.  In 
this  case,  the  sign  of  y �  doesn’t  change  at  the  critical  point,  but  the  graph  does  level  out  (see Fig.  6.

Next,  ﬁnd  the  zeros  of  this  function: 

y = 0 

⇔ 

ln x = 0 

So  y = 0  when  x = 1. 
What  happens  as  x → ∞?  This  time,  consider  x = 2+n .

Sure  enough,  the  function  is  increasing  between  0  and  the  critical  point.

2nd  Derivative  Information 

When  f ��  > 0,  f �  is  increasing.  When  f ��  < 0,  f �  is  decreasing.  (See  Fig.  8  and  Fig.  9) 

Figure  8:  f  is  convex  (concave-up).  The  slope  increases  from  negative  to  positive  as  x  increases. 

Figure  9:  f  is  concave-down.  The  slope  decreases  from  positive  to  negative  as  x  increases. 

Therefore, the sign of the second derivative tells us about concavity/convexity of the graph.  Thus 
the  second  derivative  is  good  for  two  purposes. 

1.  Deciding whether a critical point is a maximum or a minimum.  This is known as the second  derivative 
test. 
f � (x0 )  f �� (x0 )

Critical  point  is  a:

minimum 

2.  Concave/convex  “decoration.”

The  points  where  f ��  = 0  are  called  inﬂection  points.  Usually,  at  these  points  the  graph  changes 
from  concave  up  to  down,  or  vice  versa.  Refer  to  Fig.  10  to  see  how  this  looks  on  Example  1.
