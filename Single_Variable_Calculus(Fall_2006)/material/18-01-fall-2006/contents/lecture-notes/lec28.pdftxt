We want to express this in terms of x, not u. When t = 0, a sin u = 0, and therefore u = 0. 
When t = x, a sin u = x, and therefore u = sin−1 (x/a).

How can we ﬁnd cos u  = cos  sin−1 (x/a)  ? Answer: use a right triangle (Figure  2).

When the answer  is this complicated, the route to getting there has to be rather complicated. 
There’s no way to avoid the complexity.

Let’s extend this further. How can we evaluate an integral like this? 

x = sec u 

dx 
√
x2  + 4x 
When you have a linear and a quadratic term under the square root, complete the square. 
x 2  + 4x = (something)2  ± constant 

In this case, 

Plugging these in gives us 

(x + 2)2  = x 2  + 4x + 4  = ⇒  x 2  + 4x = (x + 2)2  − 4 
Now, we make a substitution.

Remember that

sec u du =  ln(sec u + tan u) + c 

Finally, rewrite everything in terms of x.

Set up a right triangle as in Figure  4. Express tan u  in terms of v . 

v = 2 sec u 

cos u =

cos u = 2/v .

Here’s a teaser for next time.  In the next lecture, we’ll integrate all rational functions.  By 
“rational functions,” we mean functions that are the ratios of polynomials:

How can we reorganize what to do starting from (4x − 1)/(x2  + x − 2)? Next time, we’ll see how. 
It involves some algebra.
