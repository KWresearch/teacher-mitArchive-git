Surface  Area 

Arclength,  continued 

Example  1.  Consider this parametric equation: 

for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 
x = t2  y = t3 
x 3  = (t2 )3  = t6 ;  y 2  = (t3 )2  = t6  = ⇒  x 3  = y 2  = ⇒  y = x 2/3 

0 ≤ x ≤ 1

Surface  Area  (surfaces  of  revolution)


Figure 2: Calculating surface area 

ds  (the inﬁnitesimal curve length in Figure  2) is revolved a distance 2πy . The surface area of the 
thin strip of width ds  is 2πy ds. 

Example  2.  Revolve Example 1 (x = t2 , y = t3 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1) around the x-axis. Refer to Figure  3.

We’re going to ignore the factor of 2π . You can reinsert it once you’re done evaluating the integral.

This is a tan − sec  integral. It’s doable, but it will take a long time for you to work the whole thing 
out. We’re going to stop evaluating it here.

Example  3 Let’s use what we’ve learned to ﬁnd the surface area of the unit sphere (see Figure  4).

For the top half of the sphere,

We want to ﬁnd the area of the spherical slice between x = a  and x = b. A spherical slice has area

For a half sphere, a = 0  and b = 1. 

2π(1 − (−1)) = 4π
