Lecture  3  (presented by  Kobi  Kremnizer): 

Derivatives of  Products, Quotients, Sine, and 

Cosine 


Derivative Formulas 

There  are  two  kinds of  derivative formulas: 
d
1.  Specific Examples:  -x" 
or -
dx 
2 .   General Examples:  (u  + v)' = u1+ v1 and  (cu) = cul  (where c is a  constant) 

A  notational convention we  will  use  today  is: 

Proof  of  (u+ v) = u' + v'. (General) 
$@rt  by  using the  definition af &hederivative. 
(U+ U ) (X+ a x )  - (U+ v ) ( x )  
( U  + v)'(x)  =

U (X+ a x )  + V (X+ AX )- U (X )- V (X )

So, we  know  the value  of  - sin x  and of  - cos x  a t  x = 0.  Let  us  find  these  for  arbitrary x.

A  similar calculation gives

(uv)' = ulv + uvl 

Proof: 

(uv)(X  + AX)- (UV )(x )  
(uv)' =  lim 
Ax 
h x t ~  

u (x  + Ax )v (x  + Ax )  - u (x )v (x )
=  lim 
AX  
A x t o  

Now  obviously, 

so adding tha t   to   the numerator won't change anything. 
u (x  + Ax )v (x )  - u (x )v (x )  + U (X   + AX )V (X+ Ax )  - u (x  + Ax )v (x )
AX  

(uv)' =  lirn

We  can  re-arrange th a t   expression t o  get 

(uv)' =  lim 
Ax-0 

) V (X )+ U (X   + A X )
Remember, the  limit  of  a  sum is the  sum of  the   limits. 
u (x  + Ax )  - u (x )

(uv)' = u l (x )v (x ) + u (x )v l (x )  

I > 

Note:  we  also used  the fact  th a t  
lirn  u (x  + Ax )  = u (x )  
Ax-0 
This proof  of  the  product  rule  assumes th a t   u  and v  have  derivatives, which  implies both  functions 
are continuous. 

(true because u  is  continuous)

Figure  1: A  graphical  "proof" of  the product  rule 

An  intuitive justification: 

We  want  t o  find the  difference in area between  th e  large  rectangle  and  th e  smaller,  inner  rectangle. 
Th e  inner  (orange)  rectangle  has area uv .  Define A u ,  the  change in u , by 
Au  = u ( x + A x )  - U ( X )  
We  also  abbreviate  u  = u ( x ) ,so  t h a t   u ( x + A x )  + = u + A u ,  and,  similarly, v ( x + A x )  = v + Av .  
Therefore  th e  area of  th e  largest  rectangle is  ( u A u )  ( v  + A v ) .  
If  you  let  v  increase and  keep  u  constant, you  add  th e  area  shaded  in red.  If  you  let  u  increase 
and  keep  v  constant,  you  add  th e   area  shaded  in  yellow.  The   sum  of  areas  of  the   red  and  yellow 
rectangles  is: 
[ u ( v+ A v )  - uv]+ [ v ( u+ A u )  - uv]= uAv  + v A u  
If  Au  and   Av  are  small,  then   ( A u ) ( A v )FZ  0,  t h a t   is,  th e   area  of  th e   white  rectangle  is  very 
small.  Therefore  th e   difference  in  area  between  the   laxgest  rectangle  and  th e   orange  rectangle  is 
approximately  t h e  same  as th e  sum of  areas of  t h e  red  and yellow  rectangles.  Thus we  have: 

[ ( u+ A u )  ( v  + A v )  - uv] w uA v  + v A u  
(Divide by  A x  and  let  A x  + 0  t o  finish the   argument.)
