Lecture  21:  Applications  to  Logarithms  and

Geometry


Application  of  FTC  2  to  Logarithms 

The  integral  deﬁnition  of  functions  like  C (x),  S (x)  of  Fresnel  makes  them  nearly  as  easy  to  use  as 
elementary  functions.  It  is  possible  to  draw  their  graphs  and  tabulate  values.  You  are  asked  to 
carry  out  an  example  or  two  of  this  on  your  problem  set.  To  get  used  to  using  deﬁnite  integrals 
and FTC2, we will discuss  in detail  the  simplest  integral  that  gives  rise  to  a  relatively new  function, 
� 
namely  the  logarithm. 
Recall  that 
n+1x
+ c 
x ndx =
n + 1 
except  when  n  =  −1.  It  follows  that  the  antiderivative  of  1/x  is  not  a  power,  but  something  else. 
�  x  dt 
So  let  us  deﬁne  a  function  L(x)  by 
t
1 
(This function turns out to be the logarithm.  But recall that our approach to the logarithm was fairly 
involved.  We  ﬁrst  analyzed  ax ,  and  then  deﬁned  the  number  e,  and  ﬁnally  deﬁned  the  logarithm  as 
the  inverse  function  to  e .  The  direct  approach  using  this  integral  formula  will  be  easier.) 
x
All  the  basic  properties  of  L(x)  follow  directly  from  its  deﬁnition.  Note  that  L(x)  is  deﬁned  for 
0  < x < ∞.  (We  will  not  extend  the  deﬁnition  past  x  =  0  because  1/t  is  inﬁnite  at  t  =  0.)  Next, 
the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus  (FTC2)  implies 

L(x) = 

1 
L� (x) = 
x 
�  1  dt 
Also,  because  we  have  started  the  integration  with  lower  limit  1,  we  see  that 
t
1 

L(1) = 

= 0 

Thus  L  is  increasing  and  crosses  the  x-axis  at  x  =  1:  L(x)  <  0  for  0  < x <  1  and  L(x)  >  0  for 
x > 1.  Diﬀerentiating  a  second  time, 
L�� (x) = −1/x2 

It  follows  that  L  is  concave  down. 
The key property of L(x) (showing that it is, indeed, a logarithm) is that it converts multiplication 
into  addition: 
Claim  1.  L(ab) = L(a) + L(b) 
�  ab  dt 
Proof:  By  deﬁnition  of  L(ab)  and  L(a),

This  conﬁrms  L(ab) = L(a) + L(b). 
Two  more  properties,  the  end  values,  complete  the  general  picture  of  the  graph. 
Claim  2.  L(x) → ∞  as  x → ∞. 
Proof:  It  suﬃces  to  show  that  L(2n ) → ∞  as  n → ∞,  because  the  fact  that  L  is  increasing  ﬁlls  in 
all  the  values  in  between  the  powers  of  2. 
· 
L(2n ) =  L(2  2n−1 ) = L(2) + L(2n−1 )
· · · 
=  L(2) + L(2) + L(2n−2 ) = L(2) + L(2) +  + L(2)  (n  times)
Consequently,  L(2n ) = nL(2) → ∞  as  n → ∞.  (In  more  familiar  notation,  ln 2n  = n ln 2.) 
�

Claim  3.  L(x) → −∞  as  x 
→ 
0+ . 
1
Proof:  0 = L(1) = L x · 
= L(x) + L(1/x) = ⇒  L(x) = −L(1/x).  As  x →  0+ , 1/x → +∞,  so 
x 
Claim  2  implies  L(1/x) → ∞.  Hence 
L(x) = −L(1/x) → −∞,  as  x → 0+ 

Thus  L(x),  deﬁned  on  0 < x < ∞  increases  from  −∞  to  ∞,  crossing  the  x-axis  at  x =  1.  It  is 
concave  down  and  its  graph  can  be  drawn  as  in  Fig.  1. 
This  provides  an  alternative  to  our  previous  approach  to  the  exponential  and  log  functions. 
Starting  from L(x), we  can  deﬁne  the  log  function  by  ln x = L(x),  deﬁne  e  as  the  number  such  that 
L(e) = 1,  deﬁne  e as  the  inverse  function  of  L(x),  and  deﬁne  a x  = e xL(a) .

First,  graph  these  functions  and  ﬁnd  the  crossing  points  (see  Figure  3). 

y + 2  =  x = y 2 
y 2  − y − 2 = 0 
(y − 2)(y + 1)  =  0 
Crossing  points  at  y  = −1, 2.  Plug  these  back  in  to  ﬁnd  the  associated  x  values,  x =  1  and  x =  4. 
Thus  the  curves meet  at  (1, −1)  and  (4, 2)  (see  Figure  3). 
There  are  two  ways  of  ﬁnding  the  area  between  these  two  curves,  a  hard  way  and  an  easy  way. 

Hard  Way:  Vertical  Slices 
If  we  slice  the  region  between  the  two  curves  vertically,  we  need  to  consider  two  diﬀerent  regions.

A = 

Where  x >  1,  the  region’s  lower  bound  is  the  straight  line.  For  x <  1,  however,  the  region’s  lower 
bound  is  the  lower  half  of  the  sideways  parabola.  We  ﬁnd  the  area,  A,  between  the  two  curves  by

2.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolution 

Rotate  f (x)  about  the  x-axis,  coming  out  of  the  page,  to  get: 

Figure  6:  A  solid  of  revolution:  the  purple  slice  is  rotated  by  π/4  and  π/2. 

We  want  to  ﬁgure  out  the  volume  of  a  “slice”  of  that  solid.  We  can  approximate  each  slice  as  a 
disk  with  width  dx,  radius  y ,  and  a  cross-sectional  area  of  πy2 .  The  volume  of  one  slice  is  then: 

dV  = πy2dx  (for  a  solid  of  revolution  around  the  x-axis) 

Integrate  with  respect  to  x  to  ﬁnd  the  total  volume  of  the  solid  of  revolution.
