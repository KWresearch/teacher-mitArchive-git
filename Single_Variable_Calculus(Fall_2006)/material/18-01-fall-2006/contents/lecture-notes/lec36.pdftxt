Lecture 36: Inﬁnite Series and Convergence Tests 

Inﬁnite Series 

Geometric Series 

A geometric series looks like 

1 + a + a 2  + a 3  + ... = S 
There’s a trick to evaluate this: multiply both sides by a: 

a + a 2  + a 3  + ... = aS 

Subtracting, 

(1 + a + a 2  + a 3  + ) − (a + a 2  + a 3  + 
) = S − aS
· · · 
· · · 

In other words, 

1 = S − aS  = ⇒  1 = (1 − a)S  = ⇒  S  =
This only works when |a| < 1, i.e. −1 < a < 1. 
a = 1  can’t work:

1 − a 

1 + 1 + 1 + ... = ∞ 

a = −1  can’t work, either:

Notation 

� 
Here is some notation that’s useful for dealing with series or sums. An inﬁnite sum is written: 
∞
ak  = a0  + a1  + a2  + ... 
k=0 
� 
n
ak  = a0  + ... + an 
k=0 
is called the “ nth  partial sum” of the inﬁnite series. 

The ﬁnite sum 

Sn  =

means the same thing as 

� 
n
ak 
k=0 
We say the series converges  to s, if the limit exists and is ﬁnite. The importance of convergence is 
illustrated here by the example of the geometric series. If a = 1, S  = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = ∞. But 
S − aS  = 1  or  ∞ − ∞ = 1 

lim  Sn  = s,  where Sn  = 
n→∞ 

does not make sense and is not usable! 

Another type of series: 

�

np 
n=1 
�  ∞  dx

We can use integrals to decide if this type of series converges. First, turn the sum into an integral: 
∞

np  ∼ 
If that improper integral evaluates to a ﬁnite number, the series converges. 
Note :  This approach only tells us whether or not a series converges.  It does not  tell us what

number the series converges to. That is a much harder problem. For example, it takes a lot of work 
to determine

We can evaluate the improper integral via Riemann sums. 
We’ll use the upper Riemann sum (see Figure  1) to get an upper bound on the value of the 
integral.

Playing with blocks 

18.01 Fall 2006 

At  this  point  in  the  lecture,  the  professor  brings  out  several  long,  identical  building  blocks. 
Do you think it’s possible to stack the blocks like this? 

Figure 3: Collective  center  of  mass  of  upper  blocks  is  always  over  the  base  block. 

In order for this to work, you want the collective center of mass of the upper blocks always to be 
over the base block. 
The  professor  successful ly  builds  the  stack. 
Is it possible to extend this stack clear across the room? 
The best strategy is to build from the top  block down. 
Let C0  be the left end of the ﬁrst (top) block. 
Let C1  =  the center of mass of the ﬁrst block (top block). 
Put the second block as far to the right as possible, namely, so that it’s left end is at C1  (Figure  4). 
Let C2  =  the center of mass of the top two blocks. 
Strategy : put the left  end  of the next block underneath the center of mass of all the previous ones 
combined. (See Figure  5).

Top block is farther outthan the bottom block.Lecture 36

Figure 6: Stack  of  n + 1  Blocks. 

So yes, you can extend this stack as far (horizontally) as you want — provided that you have enough 
N�  1  = SN 
blocks. Another way of looking at this problem is to say 
n 
n=1 
Recall the Riemann Sum estimation from the beginning of this lecture: 
ln N  < SN  < (ln N ) + 1 

as N  → ∞, SN  → ∞. 
How high would this stack of blocks be if we extended it across the two lab tables here at the 
front of the lecture hall? The blocks are 30 cm by 3 cm (see Figure  7). One lab table is 6.5  blocks, 
or 13 units, long. Two tables are 26 units long. There will be 26 − 2 =  24  units of overhang in the 
stack. 

Figure 7: Side  view  of  one  block. 

If ln N  = 24, then N  = e 24 . 

Height = 3 cm e 24  ≈ 8 × 108 m
· 
That height is roughly twice the distance to the moon. 
If you want the stack to span this room (∼  30 ft.), it would have to be 1026  meters high. That’s 
about the diameter of the observable universe.
