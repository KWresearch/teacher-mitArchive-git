Chain  Rule 

We’ve  got  general  procedures  for  diﬀerentiating  expressions  with  addition,  subtraction,  and  multi­ 

plication.  What  about  composition?


Example  1.  y = f (x) = sin x, x = g(t) = t2 .

dy ,  write

So,  y  =  f (g(t))  =  sin(t2 ).  To  ﬁnd 
dt 

t0  = t0 
x0  = g(t0 ) 
y0  = f (x0 ) 

t = t0  + Δt
x = x0  + Δx
y = y0  + Δy

As Δt 

→

0, Δx 

→ 

Δy  Δx 
Δy  =

Δt  Δx

0  too,  because  of  continuity.  So  we  get:

In  the  example,

= 2t  and

or

Higher  Derivatives


Higher  derivatives  are  derivatives  of  derivatives.  For  instance,  if  g  =  f � ,  then  h  =  g �  is  the  second 
derivative  of  f .  We  write  h = (f � )�  = f �� . 
Notations 

f � (x) 

Df 

f �� (x) 

D2 f 

f ��� (x) 

D3 f 

f (n) (x) 

Dn f 

df 
dx 

d2 f 
dx2 

d3 f 
dx3 

dn f 
dxn 

Higher  derivatives  are  pretty  straightforward —- just  keep  taking  the  derivative! 

Example.  Dnx = ?

n
Start  small  and  look  for  a  pattern.


Dx  = 1

· 
D2 x 2  =  D(2x) = 2  ( = 1  2)

·
· 
D3 x 3  =  D2 (3x 2 ) =  D(6x) = 6  ( = 1  2 3)
·
·
· 
D4 x 4  =  D3 (4x 3 ) =  D2 (12x 2 ) =  D(24x) = 24  ( = 1  2 3 4)
← 
Dn x n  =  n! 
we  guess,  based  on  the  pattern  we’re  seeing  here. 

The  notation  n!  is  called  “n  factorial”  and  deﬁned  by  n! = n(n − 1) 
· · ·

Proof  by  Induction:  We’ve  already  checked  the  base  case  (n = 1). 
� 
� 
Induction  step:  Suppose  we  know  Dnx = n! (nth  case).  Show  it  holds  for  the  (n + 1)st  case. 
n
Dn+1 x n+1  =  Dn  Dxn+1 =  Dn  ((n + 1)x n ) = (n + 1)Dn x n  = (n + 1)(n!) 
Dn+1 x n+1  = (n + 1)! 

Proved!
