Lecture  14:  Mean  Value  Theorem  and  Inequalities


Mean-Value  Theorem


The Mean-Value  Theorem  (MVT)  is  the  underpinning  of  calculus.  It  says: 
If  f  is  diﬀerentiable  on  a < x < b,  and  continuous  on  a ≤ x ≤ b,  then 
f (b) − f (a)  = f � (c) 
(for  some  c,  a < c < b)
b − a 

Here, 

f (b) − f (a)
b − a 

is  the  slope  of  a  secant  line,  while  f � (c)  is  the  slope  of  a  tangent  line. 

Figure  1:  Illustration  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem. 

Geometric  Proof:  Take  (dotted)  lines  parallel  to  the  secant  line,  as  in  Fig.  1  and  shift  them  up 
from below the graph until one of them ﬁrst touches the graph.  Alternatively, one may have to start 
with  a  dotted  line  above  the  graph  and  move  it  down  until  it  touches. 
If  the  function  isn’t  diﬀerentiable,  this  approach  goes  wrong.  For  instance,  it  breaks  down  for 
the  function  f (x) =  |x|.  The  dotted  line  always  touches  the  graph  ﬁrst  at x = 0,  no matter what  its 
slope  is,  and  f � (0)  is  undeﬁned  (see  Fig.  2).

Interpretation  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem 

You  travel  from  Boston  to  Chicago  (which  we’ll  assume  is  a  1,000  mile  trip)  in  exactly  3  hours.  At 
1000
some  time  in  between  the  two  cities,  you  must  have  been  going  at  exactly 
mph.

f (t) =  position, measured  as  the  distance  from  Boston.


f (3) = 1000,
f (0) = 0,
a = 0,  and  b = 3.

Versions  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem 

There  is  a  second  way  of  writing  the MVT: 
f (b) − f (a) =  f � (c)(b − a) 
f (b) =  f (a) + f � (c)(b − a)  (for  some  c, a < c < b) 

There  is  also  a  third  way  of  writing  the MVT:  change  the  name  of  b  to  x. 
f (x) = f (a) + f � (c)(x − a) 

for  some  c, a < c < x 

The  theorem  does  not  say  what  c  is.  It  depends  on  f ,  a,  and  x. 
This  version  of  the MVT  should  be  compared  with  linear  approximation  (see  Fig.  3). 
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  x  near  a

The  tangent  line  in  the  linear  approximation  has  a  deﬁnite  slope  f � (a).  by  contrast  formula  is  an 
exact  formula.  It  conceals  its  lack  of  speciﬁcity  in  the  slope  f � (c),  which  could  be  the  slope  of  f  at 
any  point  between  a  and  x.

Uses  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem. 

Key  conclusions:  (The  conclusions  from  the MVT  are  theoretical) 

1.  If  f � (x) > 0,  then  f  is  increasing. 
2.  If  f � (x) < 0,  then  f  is  decreasing. 
3.  If  f � (x) = 0  all  x,  then  f  is  constant. 

Deﬁnition  of  increasing/decreasing: 
⇒
⇒ 
Increasing means  a < b 
f (a) < f (b).  Decreasing means  a < b  = 
Proofs: 
Proof  of  1: 

f (a) < f (b).

a < b 
f (b) =  f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) 
Because  f � (c)  and  (b − a)  are  both  positive, 
f (b) = f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) > f (a) 
(The  proof  of  2  is  omitted  because  it  is  similar  to  the  proof  of  1) 
Proof  of  3: 

f (b) = f (a) + f � (c)(b − a) = f (a) + 0(b − a) = f (a) 

Conclusions 1,2, and 3 seem obvious, but let me persuade you that they are not.  Think back to the 
deﬁnition  of  the  derivative.  It  involves  inﬁnitesimals.  It’s  not  a  sure  thing  that  these  inﬁnitesimals 
have  anything  to  do  with  the  non-inﬁnitesimal  behavior  of  the  function.

Proofs.  We  will  take  property  1  (e > 0)  for  granted.  Proofs  of  the  other  two  properties  follow:

Proof  of  2:  Deﬁne f1 (x) = ex − 1.  Then, f1 (0) = e0 − 1 = 0, and f � (x) = ex  > 0.  (This last assertion 
1
is  from  step  1).  Hence,  f1 (x)  is  increasing,  so  f (x) > f (0)  for  x > 0.  That  is: 

e x  > 1  for  x > 0 

. 
Proof  of  3:  Let  f2 (x) = e − (1 + x). 
x
f � (x) = e x  − 1 = f1 (x) > 0  (if  x > 0).

Hence,  f2 (x) > 0  for  x > 0.  In  other  words, 

e x  > 1 + x
