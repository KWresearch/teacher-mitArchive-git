It’s not obvious from the series expansion that sin x  deals with angles.  Series are sometimes com­
plicated and unintuitive.

Here’s a hard  (optional) extra credit problem:  why does  this  series converge?  Hint:  use 
L’Hôpital’s rule to ﬁnd out how quickly the terms decrease. 

The  Final  Exam 

Here’s another attempt to clarify the concept of weighted averages. 
Weighted Average 

� b w(x)f (x) dx 
A weighted average of some function, f , is deﬁned as: 
� b w(x) dx 
a
�  b 
a 
Here,  w(x) dx  is the total, and w(x)  is the weighting function. 
a 

Average(f ) = 

Example:  taken  from  a  past  problem  set. 
You get $t if a certain particle decays in t  seconds. How much should you pay to play? You were 
given that the likelihood that the particle has not decayed (the weighting function) is: 
w(x) = e−kt

On the problem set, we calculated the half-life (H ) for Polonium120  was (131)(24)(60)2  seconds. We 
also found that 

k = 

ln 2 
H 

Therefore, the expected payoﬀ is 

1  H = 
ln 2 
k 
where H  is the half-life of the particle in seconds. 
Now, you’re all probably wondering: who on earth bets on particle decays? 
In truth, no one does. There is, however, a very similar problem that is useful in the real world. 
There is something called an annuity, which is basically a retirement pension.  You can buy an 
annuity, and then get paid a certain amount every month once you retire. Once you die, the annuity 
payments stop. 
You (and the people paying you) naturally care about how much money you can expect to get 
over the course of your retirement.  In this case, f (t) =  t  represents how much money you end up 
with, and w(t) = e−kt  represents how likely your are to be alive after t  years. 
What if you want a 2-life annuity? Then, you need multiple integrals, which you will learn about 
in multivariable calculus (18.02). 
Our ﬁrst goal in this class was to be able to diﬀerentiate anything. In multivariable calculus, you 
will learn about another chain rule. That chain rule will unify the (single-variable) chain rule, the 
product rule, the quotient rule, and implicit diﬀerentiation. 
You might say the multivariable chain rule is 

One thing to rule them al l 
One thing to ﬁnd them 
One thing to bring them al l 
And in a matrix bind them. 

(with apologies to JRR Tolkien).
