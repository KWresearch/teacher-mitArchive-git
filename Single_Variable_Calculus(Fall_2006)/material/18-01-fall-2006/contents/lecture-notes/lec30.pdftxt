Formulae 

Integration  by  Parts 

Remember the product rule: 

(uv)�  = u� v + uv � 

We can rewrite that as 

uv �  = (uv)�  − u� v 
� 
� 
Integrate this to get the formula for integration by parts: 
uv � dx = uv −  u� v dx 

� 
tan−1 x dx. 
Example  1. 
� 
� 
At ﬁrst, it’s not clear how integration by parts helps. Write 

tan−1 x dx = 

· 
tan−1 x(1  dx) = 

� 

uv � dx

with 

u = tan−1 x  and  v �  = 1. 

Therefore, 

1 
v = x  and  u�  = 
1 + x2 
� 
� 
� 
Plug all of these into the formula for integration by parts to get: 
uv � dx = (tan−1 x)x − 

tan−1 x dx =

1 + x2 (x)dx 
ln |1 + x 2 | + c

Alternative  Approach  to  Integration  by  Parts 

= x tan−1 x − 

As above, the product rule: 

(uv)�  = u� v + uv � 

can be rewritten as 

uv �  = (uv)�  − u� v

This time, let’s take the deﬁnite integral:

By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we can say

Another notation in the indeﬁnite case is 
u dv = uv − 

v du 

u� v dx 

This is the same because

⇒ 
dv = v � dx  =  uv � dx = u dv  and  du = u� dx  =  u� v dx = vu� dx = v du

(ln x)dx = x ln x −  x 
dx = x ln x − 
x 

dx = x ln x − x + c 

We can also use “advanced guessing” to solve this problem.  We know that the derivative of 
something equals ln x: 

d  (??) =  ln x 
dx 

Let’s try 

1
d 
· 
(x ln x) = ln x + x 
dx 
x 
That’s almost it, but not quite. Let’s repair this guess to get: 
d  (x ln x − x) =  ln x + 1 − 1 =  ln x 
dx 

=  ln x + 1 

Example  3. 
Let’s try: 

(ln x)n dx

u = (ln x)n  =  u�  = n(ln x)n−1

Plugging these into the formula for integration by parts gives us:

Keep repeating integration by parts to get the full formula: n 

(ln x)ndx = x(ln x)n 

Example  4. 

x n e x dx  Let’s try:

(n − 2)

(n − 3)

etc

u = x n  =  u�  = nx n−1 ;  v �  = e x  = 

v = e x

Putting these into the integration by parts formula gives us:

n x 
x e x dx = x e 

nx n−1 e x dx

Bad  news: 

Repeat, going from n → (n − 1) → (n − 2) →  etc.

If you change the integrals just a little bit, they become impossible to evaluate: 
tan−1 x  dx =  impossible 
� 

dx = also impossible 
�  2  xe
Good  news:  When you can’t evaluate an integral, then 
1  x 
is an answer, not a question. This is the solution– you don’t have to integrate it! 
The most important thing is setting up the integral!  (Once you’ve done that, you can always 
evaluate it numerically on a computer.) So, why bother to evaluate integrals by hand, then? Because 
� 
you often get families of related integrals, such as 
x∞  e
dx 
xa 
1 
where you want to ﬁnd how the answer depends on, say, a.

Parametric  Equations 

Example  6. 

x = a cos t 
y = a sin t 
Ask yourself: what’s constant? What’s varying? Here, t  is variable and a  is constant. 
Is there a relationship between x  and y? Yes: 

x 2  + y 2  = a 2 cos2  t + a 2  sin2  t = a 2 

Extra information (besides the circle): 
At t = 0, 

x = a cos 0 = a  and  y = a sin 0 = 0
