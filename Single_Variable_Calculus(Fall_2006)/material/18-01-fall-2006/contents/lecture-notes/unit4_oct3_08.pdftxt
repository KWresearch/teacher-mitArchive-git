Lecture  26:  Trigonometric  Integrals  and  Substitution 

Trigonometric  Integrals 
� 
How do you integrate an expression like  sinn x cosmx dx? (n = 0, 1, 2...  and m = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 
� 
� 
We already know that: 

sin x dx = − cos x + c  and 

cos x dx = sin x + c 

Method  A 
� 
Suppose either n  or m  is odd. 
sin3 x cos2x dx. 
Example  1. 
� 
� 
Our strategy is to use sin2 x + cos2x = 1  to rewrite our integral in the form: 

Indeed, 

�

sin3 x cos2x dx = 

sin3 x cos2x dx = 
� 

f (cosx)  sinx dx 
� 

sin2 x cos2 x  sin x dx = 

(1 − cos2 x) cos2 x  sin x dx 

u = cos x  and  du = − sin x dx 
� 

(1 − cos2 x)  cos2 x  sin x dx = 

(1 − u 2 )u 2 (−du) 

Then, 

Next, use the substitution

This method requires both  m  and n  to be even. It requires double-angle formulae such as

(Recall that cos 2x = cos2 x − sin2 x = cos2 x − (1 − sin2 x) = 2 cos2 x − 1)

The full strategy for these types of problems is to keep applying Method B until you can apply

Method A (when one of m  or n  is odd).

The next family of trig integrals, which we’ll start today, but will not ﬁnish is:

Now, let’s see what happens when you have an even power of secant. (The case n  even.)

We get the answer by “advanced guessing,” i.e., “knowing the answer ahead of time.” 
sec x + tan x 
sec x dx = sec x 
dx = 
sec x + tan x 

sec2 x + sec x tan x 
dx 
tan x + sec x 

Make the following substitutions: 

u = tan x + sec x

What if we want to ﬁnd this area? 

Figure 2: Area  to  be  evaluated  is  shaded. 
�  t=x � 
To do so, you need to evaluate this integral: 
a2  − t2 dt 
t=0 
Let t  =  a sin u  and dt  =  a cos u du.  (Remember to change the limits of integration when you do a 
� 
change of variables.) 
Then, 
a2  − t2  = a cos u 
a 2  − t2  = a 2  − a 2  sin2 u = a 2 cos2 u;

When you have a linear and a quadratic term under the square root, complete the square. 
x 2  + 4x = (something)2  ± constant

Plugging these in gives us 

(x + 2)2  = x 2  + 4x + 4  = ⇒  x 2  + 4x = (x + 2)2  − 4

Lecture  29:  Partial  Fractions 

We continue the discussion we started last lecture about integrating rational functions.  We 
deﬁned a rational function as the ratio of two polynomials: 

P (x)

We looked at the example

4x − 1

x2  + x − 2


= 

P (x)
Goal: we want to ﬁgure out a systematic way to split 
Q(x)


into simpler pieces. 

First, we factor the denominator Q(x).

4x − 1
x2  + x − 2

= 

4x − 1
(x − 1)(x + 2) 

= 

A  + 
x − 1 

B

x + 2


There’s a slow way to ﬁnd A  and B . You can clear the denominator by multiplying through by 
(x − 1)(x + 2): 
(4x − 1) = A(x + 2) + B (x − 1) 

From this, you ﬁnd 

4 = A + B  and  − 1 = 2A − B 
You can then solve these simultaneous linear equations for A  and B . This approach can take a very 
long time if you’re working with 3, 4, or more variables. 

There’s a faster way, which we call the “cover-up method”. Multiply both sides by (x − 1): 
4x − 1 
x + 2 
Set x = 1  to make the B  term drop out: 

B 
(x − 1) 
x + 2 

= A + 

4 − 1
1 + 2 

= A

A = 1

Lecture 29 

18.01 Fall 2006 

The fastest way is to do this in your head or physically cover  up  the struck-through terms.  For 
instance, to evaluate B : 
4x − 1 
A� 
B 
� + 
= 
����
(x − 1)����
x − 1
(x + 2)
(x + 2)

Implicitly, we are multiplying by (x + 2)  and setting x = −2. This gives us 
4(−2) − 1
−2 − 1 

⇒ 
= B  = 

B = 3 

What we’ve described so far works when Q(x)  factors completely into distinct  factors and the 
degree of P  is less than the degree of Q. 

If the factors of Q  repeat, we use a slightly diﬀerent approach. For example:


+

+ 

C

x2  + 2 
A
B
(x − 1)2 (x + 2) 
x − 1
(x − 1)2 
Use the cover-up method on the highest degree term in (x − 1). 
x2  + 1 
12  + 2 
= B + [stuﬀ](x − 1)2  =
⇒ 
⇒ 
= B  = 
x + 2 
1 + 2 
Implicitly, we multiplied by (x − 1)2 , then took the limit as x → 1. 
C  can also be evaluated by the cover-up method. Set x = −2  to get 
(−2)2  + 2  = C  = 
x2  + 2 2 
⇒ 
(x − 1) 
(−2 − 1)2 

⇒ 
= C + [stuﬀ](x + 2)  = 

B = 1 

C  =

This yields 

2/3 
1
x2  + 2 
A 
(x − 1)2 
x − 1
(x − 1)2 (x + 2) 
x + 2 
Cover-up can’t be used to evaluate A. Instead, plug in an easy value of x: x = 0. 
− A  = ⇒  A =
= ⇒  1 = 1 +

Not all polynomials factor completely (without resorting to using complex numbers). For exam­

Parametric  Equations 

Example  6.

Ask yourself: what’s constant? What’s varying? Here, t  is variable and a  is constant. 
Is there a relationship between x  and y? Yes: 

x 2  + y 2  = a 2 cos2  t + a 2  sin2  t = a 2

Polar  Coordinates 

Figure 1: Polar Co-ordinates. 

In polar coordinates, we specify an ob ject’s position in terms of its distance r  from the origin 
and the angle θ  that the ray from the origin to the point makes with respect to the x-axis. 
Example  1.  What are the polar coordinates for the point speciﬁed by (1, −1)  in rectangular

In most cases, we use the convention that r ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π . But another common convention 
is to say r ≥ 0  and −π ≤ θ ≤ π . All values of θ  and even negative values of r  can be used.

•	 Q: Can you quickly review how to do partial fractions? 
•	 A: When ﬁnding partial fractions, ﬁrst check whether the degree of the numerator is greater 
than or equal to the degree of the denominator.  If so, you ﬁrst need to do algebraic long-
division. If not, then you can split into partial fractions.

1. Integrate by trigonometric substitution; evaluate the trigonometric integral and work 
backwards to the original variable by evaluating trig(trig−1 ) using a right triangle: 
a) a2  − x2  use x = a sin u, dx = a cos u du. 
b) a2  + x2  use x = a tan u, dx = a sec2 u du

c) x2  − a2  use x = a sec u, dx = a sec u tan u du

2. Integrate rational functions P /Q  (ratio of polynomials) by the method of partial fractions: 
If the degree of P  is less than the degree of Q, then factor Q  completely into linear and quadratic 
factors, and write P /Q  as a sum of simpler terms. For example,

Terms such as D/(x2  + 9)  can be integrated using the trigonometric substitution x = 3 tan u. 
This method can be used to evaluate the integral of any rational function.  In practice, the 
hard part turns out to be factoring the denominator! In recitation you encountered two other steps

Postscript:  Systematic  integration  of  rational  functions 

+ 

For a general rational function P /Q, the ﬁrst step is to express P /Q  as the sum of a polynomial 
and a ratio in which the numerator has smaller degree than the denominator. 
For example, 

3x − 2 
x3 
= x + 2 + 
x2  − 2x + 1 
x2  − 2x + 1 
(To carry out this long division, do not factor the denominator Q(x) =  x2  − 2x + 1, just leave it 
alone.) The quotient x + 2  is a polynomial and is easy to integrate. The remainder term 
3x − 2 
(x − 1)2 
has a numerator 3x − 2  of degree 1  which is less than the degree 2 of the denominator (x − 1)2 . 
Therefore there is a partial fraction decomposition. In fact, 
(3x − 3) + 1  =
3x − 2  =
1 
3
(x − 1)2 
(x − 1)2 
(x − 1)2 
x − 1
In general, if P  has degree n  and Q  has degree m, then long division gives 
R(x)
P (x) 
= P1 (x) + 
Q(x) 
Q(x) 
in which P1 , the quotient in the long division, has degree n − m  and R, the remainder in the long 
division, has degree at most m − 1.

Lecture  34:  Indeterminate  Forms  - L’Hôpital’s  Rule 

L’Hôpital’s  Rule 

(Two correct spellings: “L’Hôpital” and “L’Hospital”) 
Sometimes, we run into indeterminate forms. These are things like 

and

∞

For instance, how do you deal with the following? 
x3  − 1  = 
lim 
x 1  x2  − 1
→

0
0

?? 

Example  0.  One way of dealing with this is to use algebra to simplify things: 
(x − 1)(x2  + x + 1)  =  lim 
x3  − 1  =  lim 
x2  + x + 1  = 
lim 
x→1  x2  − 1 
(x − 1)(x + 1) 
x→1 
x→1 
x + 1 
In general, when f (a) = g(a) = 0, 

3 
2 

f (x) 
=  lim  x − a  = 
x→a  g(x)	
x − a 
This is the easy version of L’Hôpital’s rule: 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

f (x) − f (a) 
lim 
x − a 
→
a

g(x) − g(a)

x a

f � (a)
g � (a) 

= 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

= 

f � (a)
g � (a) 

Note: this only works when g � (a) = 0
! 
In example 0, 

f (x) = x 3  = 1;  g(x) = x 2  − 1

⇒ 
f � (x) = 3x 2 ;  g � (x) = 2x  = 
f � (1) = 3;  g � (1) = 2

The limit is f � (1)/g � (1) = 3/2. Now, let’s go on to the full L’Hôpital rule.

Let’s compare this with the answer we’d get if we used linear approximation techniques, instead of 
L’Hôpital’s rule: 
x 15  − 1 ≈ 15(x − 1) 
(Here, f (x) = x15  − 1, a = 1, f (a) = b = 0, m = f � (1) = 15, and f (x) ≈ m(x − a) + b.) 
Similarly, 
x 3  − 1 ≈ 3(x − 1) 
15(x − 1)  = 5 
3(x − 1)

Application:  Replace x  by t  = time in seconds in Example 1.

R =  rate of decay = number of atoms that decay per second at time 0.

At later times t > 0  the decay rate is Re−kt  (smaller by an exponential factor e−kt )

Let us illustrate with Polonium 210, which has been in the news lately. The half life is 138 days 

or 

H  = (138days)(24hr/day)(602 sec/hr) = (138)(24)(60)2 seconds 
Using  this value of H ,  we ﬁnd  that one gram of Polonium 210 emits (1  gram)(6  ×  1023/210 
atoms/gram)(ln2)/H  = 1.661014  decays/sec ≈ 4500  curies 
At 5.3 MeV per decay, Polonium gives oﬀ 140  watts of radioactive energy per gram (white hot). 
Polonium emits alpha rays, which are blocked by skin but when ingested are 20 times more dangerous

Determining Divergence and Convergence 
To decide whether an integral converges or diverges, don’t need to evaluate. Instead one can compare

it to a simpler integral that can be evaluated.

xp
From Examples 4, 5 and 6 we know that this diverges (is inﬁnite) for 0  < p  ≤  1  and converges (is 
1 
ﬁnite) for p > 1. 
The comparison of integrals says that a larger function has a larger integral.  If we restrict 
ourselves to nonnegative functions, then even when the region is unbounded, as in the case of an 
improper integral, the area under the graph of the larger function is more than the area under the 
graph of the smaller one. Consider 0 ≤ f (x) ≤ g(x)  (as in Figure  3)

The way comparison is used is by replacing functions by simpler ones whose integrals we can 
calculate. You will have to decide whether you want to trap the function from above or below. This 
will depend on whether you are demonstrating that the integral is ﬁnite or inﬁnite.

Inﬁnite Series 

Geometric Series 

A geometric series looks like 

1 + a + a 2  + a 3  + ... = S 
There’s a trick to evaluate this: multiply both sides by a: 

a + a 2  + a 3  + ... = aS 

Subtracting, 

(1 + a + a 2  + a 3  + ) − (a + a 2  + a 3  + 
) = S − aS
· · · 
· · · 

In other words, 

1 = S − aS  = ⇒  1 = (1 − a)S  = ⇒  S  =
This only works when |a| < 1, i.e. −1 < a < 1. 
a = 1  can’t work:

Notation

Here is some notation that’s useful for dealing with series or sums. An inﬁnite sum is written: 
∞
ak  = a0  + a1  + a2  + ... 
k=0 
� 
n
ak  = a0  + ... + an 
k=0 
is called the “ nth  partial sum” of the inﬁnite series. 

The ﬁnite sum

means the same thing as

We say the series converges  to s, if the limit exists and is ﬁnite. The importance of convergence is 
illustrated here by the example of the geometric series. If a = 1, S  = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... = ∞. But 
S − aS  = 1  or  ∞ − ∞ = 1 

lim  Sn  = s,  where Sn  = 
n→∞ 

does not make sense and is not usable! 

Another type of series:

We can use integrals to decide if this type of series converges. First, turn the sum into an integral:

If that improper integral evaluates to a ﬁnite number, the series converges. 
Note :  This approach only tells us whether or not a series converges.  It does not  tell us what

Playing with blocks 

18.01 Fall 2006 

At  this  point  in  the  lecture,  the  professor  brings  out  several  long,  identical  building  blocks. 
Do you think it’s possible to stack the blocks like this? 

Figure 3: Collective  center  of  mass  of  upper  blocks  is  always  over  the  base  block. 

In order for this to work, you want the collective center of mass of the upper blocks always to be 
over the base block. 
The  professor  successful ly  builds  the  stack. 
Is it possible to extend this stack clear across the room? 
The best strategy is to build from the top  block down. 
Let C0  be the left end of the ﬁrst (top) block. 
Let C1  =  the center of mass of the ﬁrst block (top block). 
Put the second block as far to the right as possible, namely, so that it’s left end is at C1  (Figure  4). 
Let C2  =  the center of mass of the top two blocks. 
Strategy : put the left  end  of the next block underneath the center of mass of all the previous ones 
combined. (See Figure  5).

So yes, you can extend this stack as far (horizontally) as you want — provided that you have enough

n 
n=1 
Recall the Riemann Sum estimation from the beginning of this lecture: 
ln N  < SN  < (ln N ) + 1 

as N  → ∞, SN  → ∞. 
How high would this stack of blocks be if we extended it across the two lab tables here at the 
front of the lecture hall? The blocks are 30 cm by 3 cm (see Figure  7). One lab table is 6.5  blocks, 
or 13 units, long. Two tables are 26 units long. There will be 26 − 2 =  24  units of overhang in the 
stack. 

Figure 7: Side  view  of  one  block. 

If ln N  = 24, then N  = e 24 . 

Height = 3 cm e 24  ≈ 8 × 108 m
· 
That height is roughly twice the distance to the moon. 
If you want the stack to span this room (∼  30 ft.), it would have to be 1026  meters high. That’s 
about the diameter of the observable universe.

example, in the case of the geometric series, if |a| =
, then |a n | =
2n . Since the higher-order terms

get increasingly small if |a| < 1, the “tail” of the series is negligible. 

Example 1. If a = −1, |a | = 1  does not tend to 0. 
n

The sum bounces back and forth between 0  and 1. Therefore it does not approach 0. Outside the 
interval −1 < a < 1, the series diverges.

Here’s a hard  (optional) extra credit problem:  why does  this  series converge?  Hint:  use 
L’Hôpital’s rule to ﬁnd out how quickly the terms decrease. 

The  Final  Exam 

Here’s another attempt to clarify the concept of weighted averages. 
Weighted Average 

� b w(x)f (x) dx 
A weighted average of some function, f , is deﬁned as: 
� b w(x) dx 
a
�  b

Here,  w(x) dx  is the total, and w(x)  is the weighting function. 
a 

Average(f ) = 

Example:  taken  from  a  past  problem  set. 
You get $t if a certain particle decays in t  seconds. How much should you pay to play? You were 
given that the likelihood that the particle has not decayed (the weighting function) is: 
w(x) = e−kt

On the problem set, we calculated the half-life (H ) for Polonium120  was (131)(24)(60)2  seconds. We 
also found that 

k = 

ln 2 
H 

Therefore, the expected payoﬀ is 

1  H = 
ln 2 
k 
where H  is the half-life of the particle in seconds. 
Now, you’re all probably wondering: who on earth bets on particle decays? 
In truth, no one does. There is, however, a very similar problem that is useful in the real world. 
There is something called an annuity, which is basically a retirement pension.  You can buy an 
annuity, and then get paid a certain amount every month once you retire. Once you die, the annuity 
payments stop. 
You (and the people paying you) naturally care about how much money you can expect to get 
over the course of your retirement.  In this case, f (t) =  t  represents how much money you end up 
with, and w(t) = e−kt  represents how likely your are to be alive after t  years. 
What if you want a 2-life annuity? Then, you need multiple integrals, which you will learn about 
in multivariable calculus (18.02). 
Our ﬁrst goal in this class was to be able to diﬀerentiate anything. In multivariable calculus, you 
will learn about another chain rule. That chain rule will unify the (single-variable) chain rule, the 
product rule, the quotient rule, and implicit diﬀerentiation. 
You might say the multivariable chain rule is 

One thing to rule them al l 
One thing to ﬁnd them 
One thing to bring them al l 
And in a matrix bind them. 

(with apologies to JRR Tolkien).
