Lecture  26:  Trigonometric  Integrals  and  Substitution 

Trigonometric  Integrals 
� 
How do you integrate an expression like  sinn x cosmx dx? (n = 0, 1, 2...  and m = 0, 1, 2, . . .) 
� 
� 
We already know that: 

sin x dx = − cos x + c  and 

cos x dx = sin x + c 

Method  A 
� 
Suppose either n  or m  is odd. 
sin3 x cos2x dx. 
Example  1. 
� 
� 
Our strategy is to use sin2 x + cos2x = 1  to rewrite our integral in the form: 

Indeed, 

�

sin3 x cos2x dx = 

sin3 x cos2x dx = 
� 

f (cosx)  sinx dx 
� 

sin2 x cos2 x  sin x dx = 

(1 − cos2 x) cos2 x  sin x dx 

u = cos x  and  du = − sin x dx 
� 

(1 − cos2 x)  cos2 x  sin x dx = 

(1 − u 2 )u 2 (−du) 

Then, 

Next, use the substitution

u = sin x  and  du = cos x dx 

cos3x dx =

Method  B

This method requires both  m  and n  to be even. It requires double-angle formulae such as 

1 + cos 2x
cos x =

(Recall that cos 2x = cos2 x − sin2 x = cos2 x − (1 − sin2 x) = 2 cos2 x − 1) 
Integrating gets us 

sin2x dx =

cos2 x dx =

We follow a similar process for integrating sin2 x.

sin2 x =

The full strategy for these types of problems is to keep applying Method B until you can apply 
� 
Method A (when one of m  or n  is odd). 
sin2 x cos2x dx. 
Example  3.

Applying Method B twice yields

The next family of trig integrals, which we’ll start today, but will not ﬁnish is: 

secn x  tanmx dx  where n = 0, 1, 2, . . .  and m = 0, 1, 2, . . . 

Remember that 

sec2 x = 1 + tan2 x 

which we double check by writing

To calculate the integral of tan x, write 
tan x dx =

tan x dx = − ln(cos x) + c 

= − ln(u) + c

(We’ll ﬁgure out what 

sec x dx  is later.)

Now, let’s see what happens when you have an even power of secant. (The case n  even.) 

sec4x dx = 

f (tanx)  sec2x dx = 

(1 + tan2 x)  sec2x dx 

Make the following substitution:

and 

sec4x dx =

du = sec2x dx

(1 + u 2 )du = u +

What happens when you have a odd power of tan? (The case m  odd.) 
� 
tan3 x  sec x dx = 
(sec2 x − 1)  sec x  tan x dx 
= 
(Remember that sec2 x − 1 = tan2 x.) 
Use substitution: 

f (sec x) d(sec x) 

u = sec x 

and 

Then, 

�

du = sec x  tan x dx 

� 
tan3 x  secx dx = (u 2  − 1)du =

We carry out one ﬁnal case: n = 1, m = 0 

sec x dx =  ln (tan x + sec x) + c

We get the answer by “advanced guessing,” i.e., “knowing the answer ahead of time.” 
sec x + tan x 
sec x dx = sec x 
dx = 
sec x + tan x 

sec2 x + sec x tan x 
dx 
tan x + sec x 

Make the following substitutions: 

u = tan x + sec x 

and 

This gives

du = (sec2 x + sec x tan x) dx

Cases like n  = 3, m  = 0  or more generally n  odd and m  even are more complicated and will be 

=  ln(u) + c =  ln(tan x + sec x) + c 

sec x dx = 

discussed later. 

Trigonometric  Substitution 

Knowing how to evaluate all of these trigonometric integrals turns out to be useful for evaluating 
� 
integrals involving square roots.

What if we want to ﬁnd this area? 

Figure 2: Area  to  be  evaluated  is  shaded. 
�  t=x � 
To do so, you need to evaluate this integral: 
a2  − t2 dt 
t=0 
Let t  =  a sin u  and dt  =  a cos u du.  (Remember to change the limits of integration when you do a 
� 
change of variables.) 
Then, 
a2  − t2  = a cos u 
a 2  − t2  = a 2  − a 2  sin2 u = a 2 cos2 u; 
�  x �
�  u=sin−1 (x/a) 
� 
Plugging this into the integral gives us 
a2  − t2 dt = (a cos u) a cos u du = a 2 
u=0

Here’s how we calculated the new limits of integration:
