Unit  2:  Applications  of  Diﬀerentiation


Today,  we’ll  be  using  diﬀerentiation  to make  approximations. 

Linear  Approximation 

Figure  1:  Tangent  as  a  linear  approximation  to  a  curve 

The  tangent  line  approximates  f (x).  It  gives  a  good  approximation  near  the  tangent  point  x0 . 
As  you  move  away  from  x0 ,  however,  the  approximation  grows  less  accurate. 
f (x) ≈ f (x0 ) + f � (x0 )(x − x0 ) 

Example  1.  f (x) =  ln x,  x0  = 1  (basepoint)

Change  the  basepoint:

x = 1 + u  = ⇒ 
u = x − 1

Basic  list  of  linear  approximations 
In  this  list,  we  always  use  base  point  x0  = 0  and  assume  that  |x| << 1. 
1.  sin x ≈ x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
2.  cos x ≈ 1  (if  x ≈ 0) 
3.  e ≈ 1 + x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
x
4.  ln(1 + x) ≈ x  (if  x ≈ 0) 
5.  (1 + x)r  ≈ 1 + rx  (if  x ≈ 0) 

(see  part  a  of  Fig.  2) 
(see  part  b  of  Fig.  2) 

Proofs 
Proof  of  1:  Take  f (x) = sin x,  then  f � (x) = cos x  and  f (0) = 0 
f � (0) = 1, f (x) ≈ f (0) + f � (0)(x − 0) = 0 + 1.x 
So  using  basepoint  x0  = 0, f (x) = x.  (The  proofs  of  2,  3  are  similar.  We  already  proved  4  above.) 
Proof  of  5:


f (0) = 1

f (x)  =  (1 + x)r ; 
d  (1 + x)r
|
x=0  = r(1 + x)r−1
f � (0)  = 
dx
f (x) =  f (0) + f � (0)x  = 1 + rx

x=0  = r

Example  2.  Find  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x) = 
1 + x 
We  could  calculate  f � (x)  and  ﬁnd  f � (0).  But  instead,  we  will  do  this  by  combining  basic  approxi­
mations  algebraically.

Now,  we  discard  that  last  x2  term,  because  we’ve  already  thrown  out  a  number  of  other  x2  (and 
|
|
higher  order)  terms  in  making  these  approximations.  Remember,  we’re  assuming  that  x  <<  1. 
This  means  that  x is  very  small,  x is  even  smaller,  etc.  We  can  ignore  these  higher-order  terms,

because  they  are  very,  very  small.  This  yields

(since  f � (x) = 10(1 + 2x)9  2 = 20  at  x = 0) 
Now  we  can  do  the  same  problem  a  diﬀerent  way,  namely,  using  linear  approximation. 
(1 + 2x)10  ≈ 1 + 10(2x) (Use  (1 + u)r  ≈ 1 + ru  where  u = 2x  and  r = 10.)

overhead  with  a  velocity  v .  We  want  to  ﬁnd  the  time  dilation  (a  concept  from  special  relativity)

If  v = 4  km/s,  and  the  speed  of  light  (c)  is  3 × 105  km/s, 
v ≈ 10−10 .  There’s  hardly  any  diﬀerence 
c2 
between the times measured on the ground and in the satellite.  Nevertheless, engineers used this very 
approximation  (along  with  several  other  such  approximations)  to  calibrate  the  radio  transmitters 
on  GPS  satellites.  (The  satellites  transmit  at  a  slightly  oﬀset  frequency.) 

Quadratic  Approximations 

These  are  more  complicated.  They  are  only  used  when  higher  accuracy  is  needed.

Geometric  picture:  A  quadratic  approximation  gives  a  best-ﬁt  parabola  to  a  function.  For 
example,  let’s  consider  f (x) = cos(x)  (see  Figure  4).  If  x0  = 0,  then  f (0) = cos(0) = 1,  and 
f � (0) = − sin(0) = 0

You  are  probably  wondering  where  that

there  is  so  that  this  approximation  is  exact  for  quadratic  functions.  For  instance,  consider 
f �� (x) = 2c.
