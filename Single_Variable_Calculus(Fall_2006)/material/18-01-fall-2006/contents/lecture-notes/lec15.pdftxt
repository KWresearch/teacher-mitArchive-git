Lecture  15:  Diﬀerentials  and  Antiderivatives 

Diﬀerentials 

New  notation: 

dy = f � (x)dx 
(y = f (x)) 
Both  dy  and  f � (x)dx  are  called  diﬀerentials.  You  can  think  of 
dy  = f � (x)
dx 
as  a  quotient  of  diﬀerentials.  One  way  this  is  used  is  for  linear  approximations.

Example  1.  Approximate  651/3 

Method  1  (review  of  linear  approximation  method) 

f (x) =	 x 1/3

f � (x) =

f (x)  ≈  f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)

x 1/3  ≈  a 1/3  +
a−2/3 (x − a)

A  good  base  point  is  a = 64,  because  641/3  = 4. 
Let  x = 65.

651/3  = 641/3  +  64−2/3 (65 − 64) = 4 +

Anti-derivatives 

f (x)dx means  that  F  is  the  antiderivative  of  f . 

Other  ways  of  saying  this  are: 
F � (x) = f (x)  or,  dF  = f (x)dx

Uniqueness  of  the  antiderivative  up  to  an  additive  constant. 
If  F � (x) = f (x),  and  G� (x) = f (x),  then  G(x) = F (x) + c  for  some  constant  factor  c. 
Proof:


(G − F )�  = f  − f  = 0


Recall that we proved as a corollary of the Mean Value Theorem that if a function has a derivative 
zero  then  it  is  constant.  Hence  G(x) − F (x) = c  (for  some  constant  c).  That  is,  G(x) = F (x) + c.

Method  of  substitution. 

Example  1. 

x 3 (x 4  + 2)5dx 

Substitution: 

u = x 4  + 2,  du = 4x 3dx,

x 3 (x 4  + 2)5dx =

Another  way  to  ﬁnd  an  anti-derivative  is  “advanced  guessing.”  First  write 
x √
dx = 
1 + x2 

x(1 + x 2 )−1/2dx 

Guess:  (1 + x 2 )1/2 .  Check  this.

d 
(1 + x 2 )1/2  =  (1 + x 2 )−1/2 (2x) = x(1 + x 2 )−1/2

x(1 + x 2 )−1/2dx = (1 + x 2 )1/2  + c

 cos2 x + c

sin x cos xdx = −

This  seems  like  a  contradiction,  so  let’s  check  our  answers: 
d  sin2 x = (2 sin x)(cos x)
dx 

and 

d 
cos x = (2 cos x)(− sin x)
2

dx 
So  both  of  these  are  correct.  Here’s  how  we  resolve  this  apparent  paradox:  the  diﬀerence  between 
the  two  answers  is  a  constant. 
1 sin2 x − (− 
1 cos2 x) =

(sin2 x + cos2 x) =

The  two  answers  are,  in  fact,  equivalent.  The  constant  c  is  shifted  by  1

other.
