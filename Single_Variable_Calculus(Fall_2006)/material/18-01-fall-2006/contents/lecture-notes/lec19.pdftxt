x(t)  is  a  position; 

is  the  speed  or  rate  of  change  of  x.

Intuitive  Interpretation  of  FTC:

R.H.S. is how far x(t) went from time t = a to time t = b (diﬀerence between two odometer readings).

The  integral  represents  the  sum  of  areas  under  the  curve,  above  the  x-axis  minus  the  areas  below 
the  x-axis.  (See  Figure  2.)

This  deﬁnition  is  used  so  that  the  fundamental  theorem  is  valid  no matter  if  a < b  or  b < a.  It  also 
makes  it  so  that  the  additive  property  works  for  a, b, c  in  any  order,  not  just  the  one  pictured  in 
Figure  3.
