Integration 

1.  Evaluate  deﬁnite  integrals.  Substitution,  ﬁrst  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus  (FTC  1),  (and 
hints?) 
� 
d 
dx  a 

f (t) dt = f (t)

2.  FTC  2: 

x 

�

3.  Riemann  sums;  trapezoidal  and  Simpson’s  rules. 

If  F (x) = 

x 

f (t) dt,  ﬁnd  the  graph  of  F ,  estimate  F ,  and  change  variables. 

4.  Areas,  volumes. 

5.  Other  cumulative  sums:  average  value,  probability,  work,  etc. 

There  are  two  types  of  volume  problems: 

1.  solids  of  revolution 

2.  other  (do  by  slices) 

In  these  problems,  there will  be  something  you  can  draw  in  2D,  to  be  able  to  see what’s  going  on  in 
that  one  plane. 
In  solid  of  revolution problems,  the  solid  is  formed by  revolution  around  the x-axis or  the  y -axis. 
You  will  have  to  decide  how  to  chop  up  the  solid:  into  shells  or  disks.  Put  another  way,  you  must 
decide  whether  to  integrate  with  dx  or  dy .  After  making  that  choice,  the  rest  of  the  procedure  is 
systematically  determined.  For  example,  consider  a  shape  rotated  around  the  y-axis. 
•  Shel ls :  height  y2  − y1 ,  circumference  2πx,  thickness  dx

We  need  to  use  an  integral  if  the  force  is  variable.

Example  1:  Pendulum.  See  Figure  1

Consider  a  pendulum  of  length  L,  with mass m  at  angle  θ.  The  vertical  force  of  gravity  is mg  (g =

gravitational  coeﬃcient  on  Earth’s  surface)


Figure  1:  Pendulum. 

In  Figure  2,  we  ﬁnd  the  component  of  gravitational  force  acting  along  the  pendulum’s  path 
F  = mg sin θ. 

Figure  2:  F  = mg sin θ  (force  tangent  to  path  of  motion).

Is  it  possible  to  build  a  perpetual  motion  machine?  Let’s  think  about  a  simple  pendulum,  and 
how much work  gravity  performs  in  pulling  the  pendulum  from  θ0  to  the  bottom  of  the  pendulum’s 
arc. 
�  θ0 
�  θ0 
Notice  that  F  varies.  That’s  why  we  have  to  use  an  integral  for  this  problem. 
· 
W  = 
(Force)  (Distance) = 
(mg sin θ)(L dθ)
� 
W  = −Lmg cos θ ��θ0  = −Lmg(cos θ0  − 1) = mg [L(1 − cos θ0 )]

In  Figure  3,  we  see  that  the  work  performed  by  gravity  moving  the  pendulum  down  a  distance 
L(1 − cos θ)  is  the  same  as  if  it  went  straight  down. 

Figure  3:  Eﬀect  of  gravity  on  a  pendulum. 

In  other words,  the  amount  of work  required  depends  only  on  how  far  down  the  pendulum  goes. 
It  doesn’t  matter  what  path  it  takes  to  get  there.  So,  there’s  no  free  (energy)  lunch,  no  perpetual 
motion  machine.
