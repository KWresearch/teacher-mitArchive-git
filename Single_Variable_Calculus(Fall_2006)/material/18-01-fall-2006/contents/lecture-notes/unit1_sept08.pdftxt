Geometric  Viewpoint  on  Derivatives 

Figure  1:  A  function  with  secant  and  tangent  lines 

The  derivative  is  the  slope  of  the  line  tangent  to  the  graph  of  f (x).  But  what  is  a  tangent  line, 
exactly?

•	 It  is  NOT  just  a  line  that meets  the  graph  at  one  point. 
•	 It  is the  limit of  the secant  line  (a  line drawn between  two points on  the graph) as  the distance 
between  the  two  points  goes  to  zero.

Just  for  fun,  let’s  compute  the  area  of  the  triangle  that  the  tangent  line  forms  with  the  x- and 
y-axes  (see  the  shaded  region  in  Fig.  4). 
First  calculate  the  x-intercept  of  this  tangent  line.  The  x-intercept  is  where  y  =  0.  Plug  y  = 0 
into  the  equation  for  this  tangent  line  to  get:

Next we claim  that  the y-intercept  is at y = 2y0 .  Since y =

x
the  graph  is  symmetric  when  x  and  y  are  exchanged.  By  symmetry,  then,  the  y-intercept  is  at 
y  = 2y0 .  If  you  don’t  trust  reasoning  with  symmetry,  you  may  follow  the  same  chain  of  algebraic 
reasoning  that  we  used  in  ﬁnding  the  x-intercept.  (Remember,  the  y-intercept  is  where  x = 0.)

Notations 

Calculus,  rather  like  English  or  any  other  language,  was  developed  by  several  people.  As  a  result, 
just  as  there  are many  ways  to  express  the  same  thing,  there  are many  notations  for  the  derivative. 
Since  y = f (x),  it’s  natural  to  write 
Δy = Δf  = f (x) − f (x0 ) = f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 ) 
We  say  “Delta  y”  or  “Delta  f ”  or  the  “change  in  y”. 
If  we  divide  both  sides  by Δx = x − x0 ,  we  get  two  expressions  for  the  diﬀerence  quotient: 

Δf 
Δy  =
Δx  Δx 

Taking  the  limit  as Δx → 0,  we  get 
Δy 
Δx 
Δf 
Δx 

dy 
→ 
(Leibniz’  notation) 
dx 
→  f � (x0 )  (Newton’s  notation) 

When  you  use  Leibniz’  notation,  you  have  to  remember  where  you’re  evaluating  the  derivative 
—  in  the  example  above,  at  x = x0 . 
Other,  equally  valid  notations  for  the  derivative  of  a  function  f  include 

df 
, f � ,  and  Df

(From  here  on,  we  replace  x0  with  x,  so  as  to  have  less  writing  to  do.)  Since 
(x + Δx)n  = (x + Δx)(x + Δx)...(x + Δx)  n  times 
�
� 
x n  + n(Δx)x n−1  + O  (Δx)2
O(Δx)2  is  shorthand  for “all of  the  terms with  (Δx)2 ,  (Δx)3 ,  and  so on up  to  (Δx)n .”  (This  is part 
of  what  is  known  as  the  binomial  theorem;  see  your  textbook  for  details.)

Physical  Interpretation  of  Derivatives 

You  can  think  of  the  derivative  as  representing  a  rate  of  change  (speed  is  one  example  of  this). 
On Halloween, MIT students have a tradition of dropping pumpkins from the roof of this building, 
which  is  about  400  feet  high. 
The  equation  of  motion  for  ob jects  near  the  earth’s  surface  (which  we  will  just  accept  for  now) 
implies  that  the  height  above  the  ground  y  of  the  pumpkin  is: 
y = 400 − 16t2 

The  average  speed  of  the  pumpkin  (diﬀerence  quotient)  = 

When  the  pumpkin  hits  the  ground,  y = 0, 
400 − 16t2  = 0

Lecture  1 

18.01  Fall  2006 

Solve  to  ﬁnd  t = 5.  Thus  it  takes  5  seconds  for  the  pumpkin  to  reach  the  ground. 

Average  speed = 

400  ft 
5 sec 

= 80  ft/s

A  spectator  is  probably more  interested  in  how  fast  the  pumpkin  is  going when  it  slams  into  the 
ground.  To  ﬁnd  the  instantaneous  velocity  at  t = 5,  let’s  evaluate  y � : 
y �  = −32t = (−32)(5) = −160  ft/s  (about  110 mph) 
y �  is  negative  because  the  pumpkin’s  y-coordinate  is  decreasing:  it  is moving  downward.

4.  Sensitivity  of  measurements:  An  example  is  carried  out  on  Problem  Set  1.  In  GPS,  radio 
signals  give  us  h  up  to  a  certain  measurement  error  (See  Fig.  2  and  Fig.  3).  The  question  is 
ΔL
how  accurately  can we measure L.  To decide, we ﬁnd 
.  In  other words,  these variables  are 
Δh 
related  to  each  other.  We want  to  ﬁnd  how  a  change  in  one  variable  aﬀects  the  other  variable.

x → x0  we  always  assume  x  �= x0 .  In  other  words  x − x0  �= 0.  So  the  proof  is  valid.

Figure  1:  A  graphical  “proof ”  of  the  product  rule 

An  intuitive  justiﬁcation: 

We  want  to  ﬁnd  the  diﬀerence  in  area  between  the  large  rectangle  and  the  smaller,  inner  rectangle. 
The  inner  (orange)  rectangle  has  area  uv .  Deﬁne  Δu,  the  change  in  u,  by 
Δu = u(x + Δx) − u(x) 

We  also  abbreviate  u  =  u(x),  so  that  u(x + Δx) =  u + Δu,  and,  similarly,  v(x + Δx) =  v + Δv . 
Therefore  the  area  of  the  largest  rectangle  is  (u + Δu)(v + Δv). 
If  you  let  v  increase  and  keep  u  constant,  you  add  the  area  shaded  in  red.  If  you  let  u  increase 
and  keep  v  constant,  you  add  the  area  shaded  in  yellow.  The  sum  of  areas  of  the  red  and  yellow 
rectangles  is: 
[u(v + Δv) − uv ] + [v(u + Δu) − uv ] = uΔv + vΔu 
If  Δu  and  Δv  are  small,  then  (Δu)(Δv)  ≈  0,  that  is,  the  area  of  the  white  rectangle  is  very 
small.  Therefore  the  diﬀerence  in  area  between  the  largest  rectangle  and  the  orange  rectangle  is 
approximately  the  same  as  the  sum  of  areas  of  the  red  and  yellow  rectangles.  Thus  we  have: 

(Divide  by  Δx  and  let  Δx 

[(u + Δu)(v + Δv) − uv ] ≈ uΔv + vΔu 
0  to  ﬁnish  the  argument.)

Chain  Rule 

We’ve  got  general  procedures  for  diﬀerentiating  expressions  with  addition,  subtraction,  and  multi­ 

plication.  What  about  composition?


Example  1.  y = f (x) = sin x, x = g(t) = t2 .

dy ,  write

So,  y  =  f (g(t))  =  sin(t2 ).  To  ﬁnd 
dt 

t0  = t0 
x0  = g(t0 ) 
y0  = f (x0 ) 

t = t0  + Δt
x = x0  + Δx
y = y0  + Δy

Higher  Derivatives


Higher  derivatives  are  derivatives  of  derivatives.  For  instance,  if  g  =  f � ,  then  h  =  g �  is  the  second 
derivative  of  f .  We  write  h = (f � )�  = f �� .

If  y = f (x)  and  g(y) = x,  we  call  g  the  inverse  function  of  f ,  f −1 : 
x = g(y) = f −1 (y) 

Now,  let  us  use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  to  ﬁnd  the  derivative  of  the  inverse  function.

Graphing  an  Inverse  Function. 
Suppose  y  =  f (x)  and  g(y) =  f −1 (y) =  x.  To  graph  g  and  f  together  we  need  to  write  g  as  a 
function  of  the  variable  x.  If  g(x) =  y ,  then  x  =  f (y),  and  what  we  have  done  is  to  trade  the

The  trick  to  ﬁguring  out  what  M (a)  is  is  to  beg  the  question  and  deﬁne  e  as  the  number  such 
that  M (e)  =  1.  Now  can  we  be  sure  there  is  such  a  number  e?  First  notice  that  as  the  base  a 
increases,  the  graph  a gets  steeper.  Next,  we  will  estimate  the  slope  M (a)  for  a  =  2  and  a  = 4

y = 2x  has  slope  1.  Therefore,  the  slope  of  y = 2x  at  x = 0  is  less:  M (2) < 1  (see  Fig.  2).

y = 4x  has  slope  1.  Therefore,  the  slope  of  y = 4x  at  x = 0  is  greater  than M (4) > 1  (see  Fig.  3). 
Somewhere  in  between  2  and  4  there  is  a  base  whose  slope  at  x = 0  is  1.

Natural  log  (inverse  function  of  ex) 

To  understand  M (a)  better,  we  study  the  natural  log  function  ln(x).  This  function  is  deﬁned  as 
follows: 

If  y = e x ,  then  ln(y) = x

If  w =  ln(x),  then  e x  = w 

Note  that  e is  always  positive,  even  if  x  is  negative.

Recall  that  ln(1) = 0; 
ln(x) < 0  for  0 < x < 1;

Finally,  what  about

(a x )? 

There  are  two  methods  we  can  use: 

Method  1:  Write  base  e  and  use  chain  rule. 
�
�x 
a x  =  eln(a)  = e x ln(a) 

Rewrite  a  as  eln(a) .  Then, 

That  looks  like  it might  be  tricky  to  diﬀerentiate.  Let’s  work  up  to  it: 

d 
e x 
dx 

d 
e 3x 
dx 

= 
and  by  the  chain  rule, 

e x 

= 

3e 3x 

Remember,  ln(a)  is  just  a  constant  number–  not  a  variable!  Therefore, 

(ln a)e(ln a)x 

d
e(ln a)x  = 
dx 
or 
d  (a x ) =  ln(a)  a x 
· 
dx 

d  (a x ) = M (a)  a x 
·

dx 

Recall  that 

So  now  we  know  the  value  of M (a):  M (a) =  ln(a).

Even  if  we  insist  on  starting  with  another  base,  like  10,  the  natural  logarithm  appears:

d  10x  = (ln 10)10x 
dx 

The  base  e  may  seem  strange  at  ﬁrst.  But,  it  comes  up  everywhere.  After  a  while,  you’ll  learn  to 
appreciate  just  how  natural  it  is.

With  variable  (“moving”)  exponents,  you  should  use  either  base  e  or  logarithmic  diﬀerentiation. 
In  this  example,  we  will  use  the  latter.

Therefore, 

If  you wanted  to  solve  this  using  the  base  e  approach,  you would  say  f  = ex ln x  and  diﬀerentiate 
it  using  the  chain  rule.  It  gets  you  the  same  answer,  but  requires  a  little  more  writing.

Remark  1.  We  never  ﬁgured  out  what  the  exact  numerical  value  of  e  was.  Now  we  can  use  this

Remark  2.  Logs  are  used  in  all  sciences  and  even  in  ﬁnance.  Think  about  the  stock  market.  If  I 
say  the market  fell 50 points  today,  you’d need  to know whether  the market average before  the drop 
was  300  points  or  10, 000.  In  other  words,  you  care  about  the  percent  change,  or  the  ratio  of  the 
change  to  the  starting  value:

Why  are  these  functions  called  “hyperbolic”? 
Let  u = cosh(x)  and  v = sinh(x),  then 
u 2  − v 2  = 1 

which  is  the  equation  of  a  hyperbola. 
Regular  trig  functions  are  “circular”  functions.  If  u = cos(x)  and  v = sin(x),  then

Implicit  diﬀerentiation 
Let’s  say  you  want  to  ﬁnd  y �  from  an  equation  like 

y 3  + 3xy 2  = 8 

Instead  of  solving  for  y  and  then  taking  its  derivative,  just  take 
example, 

d
dx 

of  the  whole  thing.  In  this 

3y 2 y �  + 6xyy �  + 3y 2  = 0 
(3y 2  + 6xy)y �  =  −3y 2 
−3y2 
y �  = 
3y2  + 6xy 
Note  that  this  formula  for  y �  involves  both  x  and  y .  Implicit  diﬀerentiation  can  be  very  useful  for 
taking  the  derivatives  of  inverse  functions. 
For  instance,


y = sin−1 x 

⇒ 

sin y = x


Implicit  diﬀerentiation  yields 

and 

(cos y)y �  = 1
