corresponding ﬁnite integral

term e−kM  is negligible, so even the simpler formula 1/k  serves as a good approximation to the ﬁnite

integral. Inﬁnite integrals are often easier than ﬁnite ones, just as inﬁnitesimals and derivatives are

easier than diﬀerence quotients.

Application:  Replace x  by t  = time in seconds in Example 1.

R =  rate of decay = number of atoms that decay per second at time 0.

At later times t > 0  the decay rate is Re−kt  (smaller by an exponential factor e−kt )


e−kxdx = 1/k 

(since k > 0)

Eventually (over time 0  ≤  t <  ∞) every atom decays.  So the total number of atoms N  is

The half life H  of a radioactive element is the time H  at which the decay rate is half what it was at 
the start. Thus 

Re−ktdt = R/k

Hence 

R = N k = N (ln 2)/H

Let us illustrate with Polonium 210, which has been in the news lately. The half life is 138 days 

or 

H  = (138days)(24hr/day)(602 sec/hr) = (138)(24)(60)2 seconds 
Using  this value of H ,  we ﬁnd  that one gram of Polonium 210 emits (1  gram)(6  ×  1023/210 
atoms/gram)(ln2)/H  = 1.661014  decays/sec ≈ 4500  curies 
At 5.3 MeV per decay, Polonium gives oﬀ 140  watts of radioactive energy per gram (white hot). 
Polonium emits alpha rays, which are blocked by skin but when ingested are 20 times more dangerous 
than gamma and X-rays. The lethal dose, when ingested, is about 10−7  grams.

Determining Divergence and Convergence 
To decide whether an integral converges or diverges, don’t need to evaluate. Instead one can compare 
� 
it to a simpler integral that can be evaluated. 
∞  dx
The  General  Story  for  powers: 
xp
From Examples 4, 5 and 6 we know that this diverges (is inﬁnite) for 0  < p  ≤  1  and converges (is 
1 
ﬁnite) for p > 1. 
The comparison of integrals says that a larger function has a larger integral.  If we restrict 
ourselves to nonnegative functions, then even when the region is unbounded, as in the case of an 
improper integral, the area under the graph of the larger function is more than the area under the 
graph of the smaller one. Consider 0 ≤ f (x) ≤ g(x)  (as in Figure  3)

If

then the area under g , being larger, must also be inﬁnite.) 
The way comparison is used is by replacing functions by simpler ones whose integrals we can 
calculate. You will have to decide whether you want to trap the function from above or below. This 
will depend on whether you are demonstrating that the integral is ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
