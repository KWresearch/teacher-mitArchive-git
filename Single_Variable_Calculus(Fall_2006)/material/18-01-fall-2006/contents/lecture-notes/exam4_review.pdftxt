•	 Q: Can you quickly review how to do partial fractions? 
•	 A: When ﬁnding partial fractions, ﬁrst check whether the degree of the numerator is greater 
than or equal to the degree of the denominator.  If so, you ﬁrst need to do algebraic long-
division. If not, then you can split into partial fractions. 
Example. 

x2  + x + 1

(x − 1)2 (x + 2)

We already know the form  of the solution: 

x2  + x + 1

(x − 1)2

There are two coeﬃcients that are easy to ﬁnd: B  and C . We can ﬁnd these by the cover-up 
method.

Exam  4  Review  Handout 

1. Integrate by trigonometric substitution; evaluate the trigonometric integral and work 
backwards to the original variable by evaluating trig(trig−1 ) using a right triangle: 
a) a2  − x2  use x = a sin u, dx = a cos u du. 
b) a2  + x2  use x = a tan u, dx = a sec2 u du

c) x2  − a2  use x = a sec u, dx = a sec u tan u du

2. Integrate rational functions P /Q  (ratio of polynomials) by the method of partial fractions: 
If the degree of P  is less than the degree of Q, then factor Q  completely into linear and quadratic 
factors, and write P /Q  as a sum of simpler terms. For example,

A
x − 1
(x − 1)(x + 2)2 (x2  + 9) 
Terms such as D/(x2  + 9)  can be integrated using the trigonometric substitution x = 3 tan u. 
This method can be used to evaluate the integral of any rational function.  In practice, the 
hard part turns out to be factoring the denominator! In recitation you encountered two other steps 
required to cover every case systematically, namely, completing the square1  and long division.2

This is used when u� v  is simpler than uv � . (This is often the case if u�  is simpler than u.)

5. Surface area for a surface of revolution: 
a) around the x-axis: 2πyds = 2πy  1 + (dy/dx)2 dx  (requires a formula for y = y(x))

b) around the y -axis: 2πxds = 2πx  (dx/dy)2  + 1 dy  (requires a formula for x = x(y)) 
6. Polar coordinates: x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ  (or, more rarely, r =  x2  + y2 , θ = tan−1 (y/x)) 
a) Find the polar equation for a curve from its equation in (x, y)  variables by substitution. 
b) Sketch curves given in polar coordinates and understand the range of the variable θ  (often 
in preparation for integration).

1For  example,  we  rewrite  the  denominator  x2  + 4x + 13 =  (x + 2)2  + 9 = u2  + a2  with  u = x + 2  and  a = 3. 
2Long  division  is  used  when  the  degree  of  P  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  degree  of Q.  It  expresses  P (x)/Q(x) = 
P1 (x) + R(x)/Q(x)  with  P1  a  quotient  polynomial  (easy  to  integrate)  and  R  a  remainder.  The  key  point  is  that  the 
remainder  R  has  degree  less  than  Q,  so  R/Q  can  be  split  into  partial  fractions.

Postscript:  Systematic  integration  of  rational  functions 

+ 

For a general rational function P /Q, the ﬁrst step is to express P /Q  as the sum of a polynomial 
and a ratio in which the numerator has smaller degree than the denominator. 
For example, 

3x − 2 
x3 
= x + 2 + 
x2  − 2x + 1 
x2  − 2x + 1 
(To carry out this long division, do not factor the denominator Q(x) =  x2  − 2x + 1, just leave it 
alone.) The quotient x + 2  is a polynomial and is easy to integrate. The remainder term 
3x − 2 
(x − 1)2 
has a numerator 3x − 2  of degree 1  which is less than the degree 2 of the denominator (x − 1)2 . 
Therefore there is a partial fraction decomposition. In fact, 
(3x − 3) + 1  =
3x − 2  =
1 
3
(x − 1)2 
(x − 1)2 
(x − 1)2 
x − 1
In general, if P  has degree n  and Q  has degree m, then long division gives 
R(x)
P (x) 
= P1 (x) + 
Q(x) 
Q(x) 
in which P1 , the quotient in the long division, has degree n − m  and R, the remainder in the long 
division, has degree at most m − 1.

A(x − B /2A)  yields combinations of integrals of the form

The ﬁrst integral is handled by the substitution w = u2  + k2 , dw = 2udu. The second integral can 
be worked out using the trigonometric substitution u =  k tan θ  du =  k sec2 θdθ . This then leads to 
sec-tan integrals, and the actual computation for large values of n  are long.
