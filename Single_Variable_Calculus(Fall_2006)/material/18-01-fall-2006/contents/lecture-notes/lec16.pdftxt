Lecture  16:  Diﬀerential  Equations  and  Separation

of  Variables 

Example  1. 

Ordinary  Diﬀerential  Equations  (ODEs) 
dy  = f (x)

f (x)dx.  We  consider  these  types  of  equations  as  solved. 
Solution:  y =

is  known  in  quantum  mechanics  as  the  annihilation  operator.)

Example  2.

dx 
Besides integration, we have only one method of solving this so far, namely, substitution.  Solving 
dy  gives: 
dx

for 

dy  = −xy
dx 

The  key  step  is  to  separate  variables. 

dy  = −xdx 
y 
Note  that  all  y -dependence  is  on  the  left  and  all  x-dependence  is  on  the  right.

Next,  take  the  antiderivative  of  both  sides:

|y |  =  e c e−x 2 /2 
(exponentiate) 
(a = ±e c ) 
y  =  ae−x /2

Despite  the  fact  that  e =�
0, a  =  0  is  possible  along  with  all  a  =�
0,  depending  on  the  initial 
c
conditions.  For  instance,  if  y(0) = 1,  then  y = e−x 2 /2 .  If  y(0) = a,  then  y = ae−x 2 /2  (See  Fig.  1).

In  general: 

dy  =  f (x)g(y)

dy  =  f (x)dx  which  we  can  write  as 
g(y)

. 
g(y)

h(y)dy  =  f (x)dx  where  h(y) =

Now,  we  get  an  implicit  formula  for  y : 

H (y) = F (x) + c  (H (y) = 

h(y)dy ;  F (x) = 

f (x)dx) 

where  H �  = h,  F �  = f ,  and 

(H −1  is  the  inverse  function.) 
In  the  previous  example: 

y = H −1 (F (x) + c) 

f (x) =  x;  F (x) =

Find  a  graph  such  that  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  is  twice  the  slope  of  the  ray  from  (0, 0)  to  (x, y)

Thus, 

y = ax 2 
Again,  a < 0,  a > 0  and  a = 0  are  all  acceptable.  Possible  solutions  include,  for  example, 

y  =  x 2 
(a = 1) 
y  = 2x 2 
(a = 2) 
y  =  −x 2 
(a = −1) 
y  = 0x 2  = 0  (a = 0) 
y  =  −2y 2 
(a = −2) 
y  =  100x 2

Exam  Review 

Exam  2  will  be  harder  than  exam  1 —  be  warned!  Here’s  a  list  of  topics  that  exam  2  will  cover: 

1.  Linear  and/or  quadratic  approximations 
2.  Sketches  of  y = f (x) 
3.  Maximum/minimum  problems. 
4.  Related  rates. 
5.  Antiderivatives.  Separation  of  variables. 
6.  Mean  value  theorem. 

More  detailed  notes  on  all  of  these  topics  are  provided  in  the  Exam  2  review  sheet.
