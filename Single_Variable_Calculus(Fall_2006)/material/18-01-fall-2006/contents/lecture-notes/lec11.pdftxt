Lecture  11:  Max/Min  Problems 

Example  1.  y = 

ln x  (same  function  as  in  last  lecture) 
x

What  is  the maximum  value?  Answer:  y = .
e 
•  Where  (or  at  what  point)  is  the maximum  achieved?  Answer:  x = e.  (See  Fig.  1).) 

Beware:  Some  people will  ask  “What  is  the maximum?”.  The  answer  is  not  e.  You will  get  so  used 
to  ﬁnding  the  critical  point  x = e,  the main  calculus  step,  that  you will  forget  to  ﬁnd  the maximum

.  Both  the  critical  point  x =  e  and  critical  value  y  = 
value  y  = 
are  important.  Together,  they

form  the  point  of  the  graph  (e,  )  where  it  turns  around.

Example  2.  Find  the  max  and  the  min  of  the  function  in  Fig.  2 

Answer:  If  you’ve  already  graphed  the  function,  it’s  obvious  where  the  maximum  and  minimum 
values  are.  The  point  is  to  ﬁnd  the maximum  and minimum  without  sketching  the  whole  graph. 
Idea:  Look  for  the  max  and  min  among  the  critical  points  and  endpoints.You  can  see  from  Fig.  2 
that we only need to compare the heights or y -values corresponding to endpoints and critical points. 
(Watch  out  for  discontinuities!)

Example  3.  Find  the  open-topped  can  with  the  least  surface  area  enclosing  a  ﬁxed  volume,  V.


Figure  3:  Open-topped  can. 

1.  Draw  the  picture. 

2.  Figure  out  what  variables  to  use.  (In  this  case,  r ,  h,  V  and  surface  area,  S .) 

3.  Figure  out what  the  constraints  are  in  the problem,  and  express  them using  a  formula.  In  this 
example,  the  constraint  is 

V  = πr2h =  constant 
We’re  also  looking  for  the  surface  area.  So  we  need  the  formula  for  that,  too: 

Now,  in  symbols,  the  problem  is  to minimize  S  with  V  constant.


S  = πr2  + (2πr)h

As  r  →  0,  the  second  term, 
,  goes  to  inﬁnity,  so  S  → ∞.  As  r  → ∞,  the  ﬁrst  term  πr2  goes 
r 
to  inﬁnity,  so  S  → ∞.  Since  S  = +∞  at  each  end,  the  minimum  is  achieved  at  the  critical  point 
r = (V /π)1/3 ,  not  at  either  endpoint.

Example  4.  Consider  a  wire  of  length  1,  cut  into  two  pieces.  Bend  each  piece  into  a  square.  We 
want  to  ﬁgure  out  where  to  cut  the  wire  in  order  to  enclose  as  much  area  in  the  two  squares  as 
possible.

By  checking  the  endpoints  in  Fig.  6,  we  see  that  the  minimum  area  was  achieved  at  x  =  1
2 . 
The  maximum  area  is  not  achieved  in  0  < x <  1,  but  it  is  achieved  at  x  =  0  or  1.  The  maximum 
corresponds  to  using  the  whole  length  of  wire  for  one  square.

Moral:  Don’t forget endpoints.  If you only look at critical points you may ﬁnd the worst answer, 
rather  than  the  best  one.
