We  will  now  estimate  the  sum  using  some  3-dimensional  geometry. 
Consider  the  staircase  pyramid  as  pictured  in  Figure  3.

2nd  level:  (n − 1) × (n − 1),  represents  volumne  (n − 1)2 ),  etc. 

Hence,  the  total  volume  of  the  staircase  pyramid  is  n2  + (n − 1)2  +  + 1.

Example  3.  (Integrals  applied  to  quantity  besides  area.)  Student  borrows  from  parents. 
P  =  principal  in  dollars,  t =  time  in  years,  r =  interest  rate  (e.g.,  6 %  is  r = 0.06/year). 
After  time  t,  you  owe  P (1 + rt) = P  + P rt 

The  integral  can be used  to  represent  the  total  amount borrowed  as  follows.  Consider  a  function 
f (t),  the  “borrowing  function”  in  dollars  per  year.  For  instance,  if  you  borrow  $  1000  /month,  then 
f (t) = 12, 000/year.  Allow  f  to  vary  over  time. 
Say Δt = 1/12  year = 1  month. 

ti  = i/12

Proof  of  FTC  1  (using  FTC  2)

Start  with  F �  =  f  (we  assume  that  f  is  continuous).  Next,  deﬁne  G(x) = 
f (t)dt.  By  FTC2, 
G� (x) =  f (x).  Therefore,  (F  − G)�  =  F �  − G�  =  f  − f  =  0.  Thus,  F  − G  =  constant.  (Recall  we

Lecture  21:  Applications  to  Logarithms  and

Geometry


Application  of  FTC  2  to  Logarithms 

The  integral  deﬁnition  of  functions  like  C (x),  S (x)  of  Fresnel  makes  them  nearly  as  easy  to  use  as 
elementary  functions.  It  is  possible  to  draw  their  graphs  and  tabulate  values.  You  are  asked  to 
carry  out  an  example  or  two  of  this  on  your  problem  set.  To  get  used  to  using  deﬁnite  integrals 
and FTC2, we will discuss  in detail  the  simplest  integral  that  gives  rise  to  a  relatively new  function, 
� 
namely  the  logarithm. 
Recall  that 
n+1x
+ c 
x ndx =
n + 1 
except  when  n  =  −1.  It  follows  that  the  antiderivative  of  1/x  is  not  a  power,  but  something  else. 
�  x  dt 
So  let  us  deﬁne  a  function  L(x)  by 
t
1 
(This function turns out to be the logarithm.  But recall that our approach to the logarithm was fairly 
involved.  We  ﬁrst  analyzed  ax ,  and  then  deﬁned  the  number  e,  and  ﬁnally  deﬁned  the  logarithm  as 
the  inverse  function  to  e .  The  direct  approach  using  this  integral  formula  will  be  easier.) 
x
All  the  basic  properties  of  L(x)  follow  directly  from  its  deﬁnition.  Note  that  L(x)  is  deﬁned  for 
0  < x < ∞.  (We  will  not  extend  the  deﬁnition  past  x  =  0  because  1/t  is  inﬁnite  at  t  =  0.)  Next, 
the  fundamental  theorem  of  calculus  (FTC2)  implies 

L(x) = 

1 
L� (x) = 
x 
�  1  dt 
Also,  because  we  have  started  the  integration  with  lower  limit  1,  we  see  that 
t
1 

L(1) = 

= 0 

Thus  L  is  increasing  and  crosses  the  x-axis  at  x  =  1:  L(x)  <  0  for  0  < x <  1  and  L(x)  >  0  for 
x > 1.  Diﬀerentiating  a  second  time, 
L�� (x) = −1/x2 

It  follows  that  L  is  concave  down. 
The key property of L(x) (showing that it is, indeed, a logarithm) is that it converts multiplication 
into  addition:

This  conﬁrms  L(ab) = L(a) + L(b). 
Two  more  properties,  the  end  values,  complete  the  general  picture  of  the  graph. 
Claim  2.  L(x) → ∞  as  x → ∞. 
Proof:  It  suﬃces  to  show  that  L(2n ) → ∞  as  n → ∞,  because  the  fact  that  L  is  increasing  ﬁlls  in 
all  the  values  in  between  the  powers  of  2. 
· 
L(2n ) =  L(2  2n−1 ) = L(2) + L(2n−1 )
· · · 
=  L(2) + L(2) + L(2n−2 ) = L(2) + L(2) +  + L(2)  (n  times)
Consequently,  L(2n ) = nL(2) → ∞  as  n → ∞.  (In  more  familiar  notation,  ln 2n  = n ln 2.) 
�

Claim  3.  L(x) → −∞  as  x 
→ 
0+ . 
1
Proof:  0 = L(1) = L x · 
= L(x) + L(1/x) = ⇒  L(x) = −L(1/x).  As  x →  0+ , 1/x → +∞,  so 
x 
Claim  2  implies  L(1/x) → ∞.  Hence 
L(x) = −L(1/x) → −∞,  as  x → 0+ 

Thus  L(x),  deﬁned  on  0 < x < ∞  increases  from  −∞  to  ∞,  crossing  the  x-axis  at  x =  1.  It  is 
concave  down  and  its  graph  can  be  drawn  as  in  Fig.  1. 
This  provides  an  alternative  to  our  previous  approach  to  the  exponential  and  log  functions. 
Starting  from L(x), we  can  deﬁne  the  log  function  by  ln x = L(x),  deﬁne  e  as  the  number  such  that 
L(e) = 1,  deﬁne  e as  the  inverse  function  of  L(x),  and  deﬁne  a x  = e xL(a) .

First,  graph  these  functions  and  ﬁnd  the  crossing  points  (see  Figure  3). 

y + 2  =  x = y 2 
y 2  − y − 2 = 0 
(y − 2)(y + 1)  =  0 
Crossing  points  at  y  = −1, 2.  Plug  these  back  in  to  ﬁnd  the  associated  x  values,  x =  1  and  x =  4. 
Thus  the  curves meet  at  (1, −1)  and  (4, 2)  (see  Figure  3). 
There  are  two  ways  of  ﬁnding  the  area  between  these  two  curves,  a  hard  way  and  an  easy  way. 

Hard  Way:  Vertical  Slices 
If  we  slice  the  region  between  the  two  curves  vertically,  we  need  to  consider  two  diﬀerent  regions.

A = 

Where  x >  1,  the  region’s  lower  bound  is  the  straight  line.  For  x <  1,  however,  the  region’s  lower 
bound  is  the  lower  half  of  the  sideways  parabola.  We  ﬁnd  the  area,  A,  between  the  two  curves  by

Figure  6:  A  solid  of  revolution:  the  purple  slice  is  rotated  by  π/4  and  π/2. 

We  want  to  ﬁgure  out  the  volume  of  a  “slice”  of  that  solid.  We  can  approximate  each  slice  as  a 
disk  with  width  dx,  radius  y ,  and  a  cross-sectional  area  of  πy2 .  The  volume  of  one  slice  is  then: 

dV  = πy2dx  (for  a  solid  of  revolution  around  the  x-axis) 

Integrate  with  respect  to  x  to  ﬁnd  the  total  volume  of  the  solid  of  revolution.

But  100cm  =  1m.  Why  is  this  answer  diﬀerent?  The  resolution  of  this  paradox  is  hiding  in  the 
equation. 

V  = 

y = x 2

At the top, 100 = x 2  =  x = 10 cm.  So the second cauldron looks like Figure  3.  By contrast, when

a = 1 m,  the  top  is  ten  times wider:  1 = x2  or x = 1 m.  Our  equation,  y = x2 ,  is not  scale-invariant. 
The  shape  described  depends  on  the  units  used.

Now,  let’s  ﬁll  this  cauldron with water,  and  light  a  ﬁre  under  it  to  get  the water  to  boil  (at  100oC). 
Let’s  say  it’s  a  cold  day:  the  temperature  of  the  air  outside  the  cauldron  is  0oC.  How  much  energy 
does  it  take  to boil  this water,  i.e.  to  raise  the water’s  temperature  from  0oC  to  100oC? Assume  the

The  answer  85o  is  consistent  with  the  ordinary  average.  The  weighted  average  (integration  with

Dart  board,  revisited 

Last  time,  we  said  that  the  accuracy  of  your  aim  at  a  dart  board  follows  a  “normal  distribution”: 
ce−r

Now,  let’s  pretend  someone  –  say,  your  little  brother  –  foolishly  decides  to  stand  close  to  the  dart 
board.  What  is  the  chance  that  he’ll  get  hit  by  a  stray  dart? 

Figure  5:  Shaded  section  is  2ri  < r < 3r1  between  3  and  5  o’clock. 

To  make  our  calculations  easier,  let’s  approximate  your  brother  as  a  sector  (the  shaded  region 
in  Fig.  5).  Your  brother  doesn’t  quite  stand  in  front  of  the  dart  board.  Let  us  say  he  stands  at  a 
distance  r  from  the  center  where  2r1  < r <  3r1  and  r1  is  the  radius  of  the  dart  board.  Note  that 
your  brother  doesn’t  surround  the  dart  board.  Let  us  say  he  covers  the  region  between  3  o’clock

This is one of the most important integrals in all of calculus.  It is especially important in probability

To  ﬁnd  Q,  we  will  ﬁrst  ﬁnd  a  volume  of  revolution,  namely, 
V  = volume  under  e−r

We ﬁnd this volume by the method of shells, which  leads to the same  integral as  in the  last problem.

The  trapezoidal  rule  divides  up  the  area  under  the  function  into  trapezoids,  rather  than  rectangles.

The  area  of  a  trapezoid  is  the  height  times  the  average  of  the  parallel  bases:

Note:  The  trapezoidal  rule  gives  a  more  symmetric  treatment  of  the  two  ends  (a  and  b)  than  a 
Riemann  sum  does —  the  average  of  left  and  right  Riemann  sums. 

3.  Simpson’s  Rule 

This  approach  often  yields  much  more  accurate  results  than  the  trapezoidal  rule  does.  Here,  we 
match  quadratics  (i.e.  parabolas),  instead  of  straight  or  slanted  lines,  to  the  graph.  This  approach 
requires  an  even  number  of  intervals.

There  are  two  types  of  volume  problems:

In  solid  of  revolution problems,  the  solid  is  formed by  revolution  around  the x-axis or  the  y -axis. 
You  will  have  to  decide  how  to  chop  up  the  solid:  into  shells  or  disks.  Put  another  way,  you  must 
decide  whether  to  integrate  with  dx  or  dy .  After  making  that  choice,  the  rest  of  the  procedure  is 
systematically  determined.  For  example,  consider  a  shape  rotated  around  the  y-axis.

Consider  a  pendulum  of  length  L,  with mass m  at  angle  θ.  The  vertical  force  of  gravity  is mg  (g =

In  Figure  2,  we  ﬁnd  the  component  of  gravitational  force  acting  along  the  pendulum’s  path 
F  = mg sin θ.

18.01  Fall  2006 

Is  it  possible  to  build  a  perpetual  motion  machine?  Let’s  think  about  a  simple  pendulum,  and 
how much work  gravity  performs  in  pulling  the  pendulum  from  θ0  to  the  bottom  of  the  pendulum’s 
arc. 
�  θ0 
�  θ0 
Notice  that  F  varies.  That’s  why  we  have  to  use  an  integral  for  this  problem.

W  =

In  Figure  3,  we  see  that  the  work  performed  by  gravity  moving  the  pendulum  down  a  distance 
L(1 − cos θ)  is  the  same  as  if  it  went  straight  down. 

Figure  3:  Eﬀect  of  gravity  on  a  pendulum. 

In  other words,  the  amount  of work  required  depends  only  on  how  far  down  the  pendulum  goes. 
It  doesn’t  matter  what  path  it  takes  to  get  there.  So,  there’s  no  free  (energy)  lunch,  no  perpetual 
motion  machine.
