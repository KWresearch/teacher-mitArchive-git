4.  Sensitivity  of  measurements:  An  example  is  carried  out  on  Problem  Set  1.  In  GPS,  radio 
signals  give  us  h  up  to  a  certain  measurement  error  (See  Fig.  2  and  Fig.  3).  The  question  is 
ΔL
how  accurately  can we measure L.  To decide, we ﬁnd 
.  In  other words,  these variables  are 
Δh 
related  to  each  other.  We want  to  ﬁnd  how  a  change  in  one  variable  aﬀects  the  other  variable.

Figure  8:  An  example  of  an  ugly  discontinuity:  a  function  that  oscillates  a  lot  as  it  approaches  the  origin 
This  function  doesn’t  even  go  to ±∞ —  it  doesn’t make  sense  to  say  it  goes  to  anything.  For 
something  like  this,  we  say  the  limit  does  not  exist.

Notice  that  the  graph  of  f (x)  does  NOT  look  like  the  graph  of  f � (x)!  (You  might  also  notice 
that  f (x)  is  an  odd  function,  while  f � (x)  is  an  even  function.  The  derivative  of  an  odd  function  is 
always  even,  and  vice  versa.)

Theorem:  Diﬀerentiable  Implies  Continuous. 
� 
� 
If  f  is  diﬀerentiable  at  x0 ,  then  f  is  continuous  at  x0 . 
f (x) − f (x0 )
(x − x0 ) = f � (x0 ) · 0 = 0. 
x − x0 
x − x0 .  It  looks  as 
Remember:  you  can  never  divide  by  zero!  The  ﬁrst  step  was  to  multiply  by 
x − x0 
0 
if  this  is  illegal  because  when  x  =  x0 ,  we  are  multiplying  by 
.  But  when  computing  the  limit  as 
0 
x → x0  we  always  assume  x  �= x0 .  In  other  words  x − x0  �= 0.  So  the  proof  is  valid.
