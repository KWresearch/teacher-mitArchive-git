FT. SECOND  FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM 

1.  The  Two  Fundamental  Theorems  of  Calculus 

The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  really  consists  of  two  closely  related  theorems, 
usually  called  nowadays  (not very  imaginatively)  the  First  and  Second  Fundamental  Theo­
rems.  Of the  two,  it is  the  First Fundamental  Theorem  that  is the  familiar  one  used  all  the 
time.  It  is  the  theorem  that  tells  you  how  to  evaluate  a  definite  integral  without  having  to 
go  back  to  its  definition  as  the  limit  of a  sum  of rectangles. 

First  Fundamental  Theorem  Let  f(x)  be  continuous on  [a, b].  Suppose there  is a 
function F(x) such  that f(x)  = F'(x) .  Then 
b 
b 
f  f()dx 
)  = 

-
F(b)  F(a). =

(1) 

F(x) 

(The  last  equality just  gives  another  way of writing  F(b) - F(a) that  is  in  widespread  use.) 
Still another  way of writing  the theorem  is to observe  that F(x) is  an antiderivative  for  f(x), 
or  as  it- is  sometimes  called,  an  indefinite  integral  for  f(x);  using  the  standard  notation  for 
indefinite  integral  and  the bracket  notation  given  above,  the  theorem  would  be  written 

(1') 

f (x) dx  = 

f  (x)d 

. 

Writing  the  theorem  this  way makes  it  look sort  of  catchy, and  more  importantly,  it  avoids 
having  to  introduce  the  new  symbol  F(x) for  the  antiderivative. 

In  contrast  with  the  above  theorem,  which  every  calculus  student  knows,  the  Second 
Fundamental  Theorem  is  more  obscure and  seems  less  useful.  The  purpose  of this  chapter  is 
to  explain  it, show  its  use  and  importance,  and  to  show  how  the  two  theorems  are  related. 
To  start  things  off,  here  it  is. 

Second  Fundamental Theorem.  Let  f(x)  be  continuous, and fix  a. 

(2) 

Set  F()  = 

f (t)dt; 

then  F'(x) =  f(x). 

We  begin  by interpreting  (2)  geometrically.  Start with  the  graph of  f(t) 
in  the  ty-plane.  Then  F(x)  represents  the  area  under  f(t) between  a and 
x;  it  is  a  function'  of  x.  Its  derivative  -
the  rate  of  change  of  area  with 
respect  to  x  -
is  the  length  of the  dark vertical line.  This  is what  (2)  says 
e met.ricrnll 

ISimmons calls  this function A(x)  on p.  207  (2nd edition);  this  section of Simmons is another presentation 
of much  of  the material  given  here. 

Example  1.  Verify  (2)  if f(x) = 2xsin  2  and  a= 0. 
Solution.  Here  we  can  integrate  explicitly  by  finding  an  antiderivative  (using  the  first 
fundamental  theorem): 

F(W)  = 

2tsintdt 

- cos t2 

-cosx  +  1; 

differentiating  by  the  chain  rule,  we  verify  that  indeed  F'(x) =  2zsinx 2,  as  predicted  by 
(2).

*Example2.  Let  F(z)  = 

Ssint 

dt. 

Find  F'(7r/2). 

Solution.  Neither  integration  techniques  nor  integral  tables  will  produce  an  explicit 
antiderivative  for the  function  in  the  integrand.  So we  cannot  use  (1).  But  we  can  use  (2), 
which  says  that 

sin 7r/2 
F'(R/2)  =  i/2 
/2 
Many  students  feel  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem  is  "obvious";  these  students  are 
confusing  it with  the  similar-looking 

1

(2') 

Let  F(x)  = 

f f(x) dx; 

then  F'(x) = f(x). 

Indeed,  (2') is obvious.  The  "integral"  in  it  is  an  indefinite  integral,  i.e.,  an  antiderivative. 
So what  (2') says  is:  "Let F(x) be  an  antiderivative  for f  (x);  then  F(x) is an  antiderivative 
for f(x)  - a  true  statement,  but  not  a  very  exciting  one  (logicians  call  it  a  tautology.) 
The  Second  Fundamental  Theorem  (2)  looks  almost  the  same  as  (2'), but  it  is  actually 
entirely  different,  because  F(x)  is  defined  as  a  definite  integral.  The  next  section,  which 
continues  the  discussion,  should  help  show  the  difference. 

2.  Do  functions  have  antiderivatives? 

f(x) dx  by  finding  an anti­
The  First Fundamental  Theorem  tells us  how  to calculate 
derivative  for  f(x).  But  the theorem  isn't so useful  if you  can't find an  antiderivative.  Most 
calculus  students  think  for  example  that  e'-
has  no  antiderivative  -
"the  integral  isn't 
in  the  tables",  "it  can't be  integrated"  are  some  of  the  ways  they  express  this.  Even  for  a 
, it is not obvious what  the antiderivative  is.  Perhaps  it doesn't 
simple function  like  11-
have  any? 
The  Second  Fundamental  Theorem provides  the answer;  it says: 

Every contiziuous function  f(x)  has an  antoiderivative: 

f (t)dt. 
The  antiderivative  may  not  be  expressible  in  terms  of  elementary  functions  -
difficulty  with  e- "2  - but  it  always  exists. 

this  is  the 

FT.  THE  SECOND  FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM 

Example  3.  Find  an  antiderivative  for

Solution.  This doesn't look  so easy to do explicitly.  But the Second  Fundamental Theorem 
says  the  following  function  is  an  antiderivative: 

(3)  .. 

F(z).-

dt 

Discussion.  You  may  feel  that  this  doesn't represent  progress:  the  formula  for  the 
antiderivative  is useless.  But that's not  so:  the function F(z) can be  calculated by numerical 
integration.  It can  be  programmed  into a  calculator  so  that when  you  press  an  z-value,  the 
screen  will  display  the  corresponding  value  of  F(z)  to  12 decimal  digits.  Pressing  another 
button will draw  the graph  of F(z)  over  any interval  on  the  z-axis that  you  specify. 
Repeating  what  we  said  earlier,  the  integral  in  (3)  should  be carefully  distinguished  from 
dz  -
this  "integral"  is  just  another  notation  for  the  antiderivative,  and  is 

therefore  not  a  solution  to  the  problem.  The  integral  in  (3)  by  contrast  is  a  perfectly 
definite  function,  and it  does  solve  the  problem  of finding  an  antiderivative.. 
In  this  case,  it  turns  out  that  F(z)  does  have  an  expression  in  terms  of  elementary 
functions.  It is 

(4) 

F(z)  =  (f+  1)3/8-4(v  +1)1'   ­
3 
3 

(You  can  prove  this is correct  by differentiating  it; the  8/3  is put in  to  ensure that F(O) = 0, 
as definition  (3) requires.) 
The  above  way  of  writing  F(z)  is  different  from  (3).  Whether  or  not  it  is  a  better  way 
depends  on what  you  want  to know  about  F(.)  and what  use  you want  to make  of it.  For 
instance, 

Is  F(z)  > 0 when  z  >  07 
The  answer  is  clearly  "yes"  if we  look  at  the integral  (3),  since  the  integrand  is  positive;  it 
is  not  at  all  clear  what  the  answer  is  if  instead  we  look  at  (4),  because  of  the  - sign.  As 
.another example,  what is  F'(z) ?  From  (3)  the  answer  is  immediate,  whereas  from  (4)  you 
would  have  to calculate  for  a while  -
as  you  will  know  if you  took  the  trouble  to  check  its 
correctnessl 

3.  Defining  new  functions:  In(x)  and  erf(x). 
One  important  use  of the Second  Fundamental  Theorem  is to  define  new  functions.  Cal­
culus  can  then  be  used  to  study  their  properties. 
To  illustrate,  we  consider  first  an  old  function:  Inz. Let's pretend  we  know  nothing  of 
logarithms.  We  do  know that 

SXd  = n+l' 
However,  we  know  no  explicit  formula  for  an  antiderivative  of  1/x,  i.e.,  when  n =  -1. 
We  therefore  use  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem  to define  an  antiderivative  of  1/z,
namely 

no-1 . 

(5) 

L(x)  =  d 

(We  use  1 as  the  lower  limit  of  integration  since  the  integrand  is  not  defined  at  0.)  What 
are  the  properties  of this function? 
Properties  of  L(x) = 

dt 

L-1.  L(x)  is  defined  for  x  >  0  (since  1/t is  continuous  for t  >  0);

L-2.  L(1)  = 0;

L-3.  L'(x) = 1/x,  by the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem;

L-4.  L"(z) = -I/za,  by  differentiating  1/x;

L-5.  L(x)  is  increasing  for  all  z  >  0,  since  L'(x) >  0;  its  graph  is  concave  (i.e.,  concave

down)  since  L"(s) >  0; 
L-6.  L(ab) =L(a) +L(b). 
Of  course,  it  is  this  last which  is the  interesting  property;  the  proof  of it  is  elegant. 
Proof of L-6.  We  break up  the integral  defining  L(ab) into  two parts, the first  of which 
is L(a):  to do  this,  we  use  the  ihiterval  addition  rule  (3)  in Notes  PI.1  . 
a -d  = =t IT + 
ab  dt 

L(ab) 

(6) 

Comparing with Property  L-6, we  see we  have  to  show the  last  integral on  the right above 
has  the  value  L(b).  To  see  this,  make  the  change  of variable  t =  au and  apply  the  change 
of'variable rule  (see  (7),  p.  PI.2  in  these  notes).  You  get  successively 

t = au, 

do

adu 
dt 
du 
au 
t 
*u 
t 
atu 
We  have  to  change  the  limits on  the  integral  also:  t = a and t =  ab correspond  respectively 
to u  =  1,u = b.  Thus the  rule  for changing  variable  in  a definite  integral  gives 
jabdt 
= 

dt = a du,

FT.  THE  SECOND  FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM 

which  proves  L-6. 
Once  we  have  this,  the other  properties  of the logarithm  follow  in  a standard  way. 
L-7.  L(1/a) = -L(a),  since  L(1/a) + L(a) = L(! - a) = L(1)  = 0  . 
lim  L(z)  = oo;  namely,  L(z)  is  incrieasing  and  L(2")  increases  without  bound  as 
L-8. 
n--+oo,  since  L(2") = nL(2),  by  Property  6;  note  that  L(2)  > 0 since  f(z)  is  increasing.  0 
In our  definition  of  L(x),  the number  e  appears  as the  unique  number  such  that 

O 

L(e)  =  =

Such  a  number  exists by  the Intermediate  Value  Theorem, 2  since  L(z)  is increasing,  contin­
uous  (since  it  has  a derivative),  and gets  bigger  than  1. 

We  now  turn  to a  second  example  of using  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem  to  define 
a  function  F(x) -
this  time,  the  function  will  be  genuinely  new.  It  is  closely  related  to 
an  important  function  in  probability  and  statistics,  the  error  function  erf  x.  (Statistics­
oriented  calculators  have  a  button  for it.)  The two  functions  differ  only by  a  change of scale 
on  the  x- and  y-axes.  There  is  no simpler  or more  elementary  expression  for  F(x). 

Example  5.  Define  a  function  F(z)  by F(z)  = 

e-' dt.

F'(x) =  e  by  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem;  since  the  exponential 
positive,  this  shows  F(z) is  increasing  for  all  x,  and  therefore  it  has  no  relative , 
minima. 
F"(z)  =  -2xe- 2 ; since  F"(z)  <  0 for  z  >  0,  the  graph  of  F(x)  is 
concave  (down) when  x >  0.  Similarly, it  is  convex  (concave  up)  for  z  < 0,

F(z)  is  an  odd  function.  To  see  this,  we  note  that  e 2 is  an  even  function.  As  the 
picture  shows,  the.two  shaded  areas  are  equal;  the one  on  the left  however must  be  counted 
negatively,  since  the  integration  is  backwards:  if z  >  0,  then

4.  Proof of  the two  Fundamental  Theorems. 
We  will  give  an  intuitive  argument.for  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem,  and  then 
deduce  the  First  Fundamental  Theorem  from  the  Second.  Though  the  argument  for  the 
Second  Theorem  is  only  suggestive,  it  has  the  right  ideas  in  it,  and  can  be  easily  made 
rigorous  if you  have  available  a precise  definition  of limit.3 
.-	Second  Fundamental  Theorem:  Intuitive  Argument

We  wish  to prove  that if  f (s)  is  continuous,  then


We  calculate  F'(s)using  the definition  of  derivative.  Let  a change  by Az, 
andt  let. AF  be. the  corresponding  change  in  F(-s).  From the  picture. 
AF  =  F(x + Ax)  - F(c)  =  j 
a  f(s)Az, 

(9) 

f(t) dt 

since  the  area of the  vertical  strip  under  the  curve  is  approximately  the  same  as the  area of 
the  rectangle.  Dividing,  we  have 

AF 

where  the error in the  approximation  is  bounded by  the  height  of  the small  curved  triangle. 
Since  .f(t)is  continuous,  the  error is  small  compared  with  f(x),  and  disappears  when  we 
pass  to the  limit  as  Ax  -- 0;  we  get  therefore 

F'(x)  =  lim 

=  f(x). 

Note  that  if f(t) were  discontinuous  at  the  point  x,  the  result  would not  be  true;  as  the 
picture  shows,  the  approximation  in  (9)  would  not  be  true. 

First  Fundamental  Theorem:  Proof4 
We  want  to show  that if f(z) is  continuous  and  f(x)'=  F'(x), then 

(10) 	

We begin  by  defining 

f(x)  dz  =  F(b) - F(a). 

(11) 

(z)= 
f (t) dt; 
G'(x)  =  f (x), 

then 

by  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem. 

3 A  somewhat  fuller  argument  is given  in  Simmons,  Step  1, p.  206-7.

4 this  same  classical  reasoning  is given  in Simmons:  Steps' 2  and  3,  p.  207.


FT.  THE  SECOND  FUNDAMENTAL  THEOREM


Since  G'(x) = f(x) = F'(x), we  have  (G(x)  - F(s))' = 0, which  implies  G(x)  - F(x) = C, 
i.e., 

(12) 

G(x)  =  F(x) + C, 

for some  constant  C. 

To evaluate  C, we  put  x = a in  (12);  since  G(a) = 0,  we  get 

C  = -- F(a). 

Finally,  put x  =  b in  equation  (12),  and  use  the  above  value  for  C: 
G(b)  = F(b)- F(a), 
which  is exactly  (10),  in  view  of the  definition  of G(x). 

O 

Remark.  Both  fundamental  theorems  say  that  differentiation  and  definite integration 
are  inverse  operations:  each undoes  what the other  does.  In  the First Fundamental Theorem 
we  differentiate,  then  integrate: 

F(x)  -- F'(x) 

F'(t)dt= F(x) - F(a); 

In  the  Second  Fundamental  Theorem,  we  integrate,  then  differentiate: 

f)  -W 

f(t)  --- 

dA 

d 

f(t) dt  =  f(x) . 

In  both  cases,  the  theorem  says  that  we  end  up  essentially  where  we  started  - only  "essen­
tially"  because  of the  additive  constant  in F(x). 

(Of  course,  differentiation  and  indefinite integration  are  also  inverse  operations,  but  this 
is trivial  - it's just  a  restating  of the  definition  of indefinite  integration.)
