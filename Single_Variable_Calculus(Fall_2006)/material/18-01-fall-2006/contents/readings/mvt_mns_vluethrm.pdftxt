MVT.  MEAN-VALUE  THEOREM


There  are  two  forms  in  which  the  Mean-value  Theorem  can  appear;1  you  should  get 
familiar  with both  of them.  Assuming for simplicity  that  f(z) is  differentiable  on an  interval 
whose  endpoints  are  a  and  b, or  a and  z,  the  theorem  says 

f(b)  - f(a)  = 
b-a 
f(x)  =  f(a) +  f'(c)(z  - a), 

for  some  c  between  a  and  b;

for  some  c between  a and  x 

The  first  form  (1) has  an  intuitive  geometric  interpretation  in  terms  of  the  slope  of  a 
secant  being  equal  to  the  slope  of  the  graph  at  some  point  c.  and  in  this  form,  it's easy  to 
give  an  intuitive  argument  for the  theorem. 
The  second  form  (2)  looks  less  intuitive,  but  all  that  has  been  done  is  to multiply  both 
sides  of  (1). by  b-a, transpose a term,  and change the name  of b td z.  Now  it's not  a theorem 
about  slopes;  instead,  it  says  that the value  of  f  at some  point  z  can be estimated,  provided 
you  know  the  value  of  f  at  some fixed  point  a, and  have  information  about  the  size  of f'  on 
the interval  [a, z].  In  other  words,  from information  about  f',we  can get  information  about 
f.  (Such  information  can  also  be  gotten  by  integration;  one  can  think  of  the  Mean-value 
Theorem  as  a  poor-person's  substitute  for  integration.) 
The special  case  of (1) in  which  f(a) = f(b) =  0 is. usually  called  Rolle's theorem;  it says 
that  if f  is  differentiable  on  [a, b], 

f(a) = f(b) = 0 

Sf'(c)= 0 

for  some  c, where  a <  c <  b.
