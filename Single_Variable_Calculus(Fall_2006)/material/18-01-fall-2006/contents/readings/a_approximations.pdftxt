A.  APPROXIMATIONS 

In science  and engineering,  you often  approaimate  complicated  functions by  simpler  ones 
which  are easier  to calculate  with,  and which  show  the relations between  the variables  more 
clearly.  Of course,  the approximation  must be close enough  to give  you reasonable  accuracy. 
For  this  reason,  approximation  is  a skill,  one  your  other  teachers  will  expect  you  to have. 
This  is a  good place  to start  acquiring  it. 
Throughout,  we  will  use  the  symbol  a  to mean  "approximately  equal  to";  this  is  a  bit 
vague,  but  making  approximations  in  engineering  is more  art than  science. 

1.  The  linear  approximation;  linearizations. 
The  simplest  way to  approximate  a function  f(z)  for  values  of z  near  a 
is  to use a  linear  funcion.  The  linear function  we shall use is the one whose 
graph  is  the  tangent  line  to f(z)  at x =  a.  This makes  sense  because  the 
tangent  line  at  (a, f(a)) gives  a good  approximation  to the  graph  of f(z),

To  turn  (1) into  calculus,  we  need  the  equation  for  the  tangent  line.  Since  the  line  goes 
through  (a, f(a))  and  has  slope  f'(a), its  equation is 

S 

f(a)  + f'(a)(x -

), 

and therefore  (1) can be  expressed  as 

(2) 

f(z) 

f()  + f'(a)(  - a), 

for  Tua. 

This  says  that  for x  near a, the  function  f(z)  can  be  approximated  by  the  linear  function 
the one whose graph is  the tangent  line -
on the  right of (2).  This  function  -
is  called  the 
linerization  of f(z)  at  z = a. 
The  appraoimation  (2) is  often written  in  an equivalent  form  that  you  should  become 
familiar  with;  it makes  use  of a  dependent  variable.  Writing 

(3) 

v =  f(z),  A  = z- a,  Ay  = f()  - f(a), 

the  approximation  (2)  takes  the  form 

(2')

. 

f(a)Ax 

In  this form, the  quantity on the right represents  the change  in height  of the 
taent line, while  the  left measures  the change  in height  of the eraph. 
Here  are  some  examples  of  linear  approximations.  In all  of  them,  we  are  taking  a = 0,
this  being  the most  important  case  All  can  be  found  by  using  (2) above  and  calculating
the  derivative.  You should  verify each  of them,  and memorize  the approximation.

Note  that  (4)  becomes  a  special  case  of  (5)  if  we  take  r  =  -1 and  replace  x  by  -z; 
nonetheless,  learn  (4)  separately  since  it  is very  common.  As  an  example  of verification,  let 
us  check  (5): 

f(x) =  (1+  x)' 

f'()  =  r(1 +  x) -

which is(5). 

2.  The  algebraic  viewpoint;  examples 
Though  the  three  basic  approximations  given  above  can  be  derived  by  using  differen­
tiation,  many  people  remember  them  better  by  relating  them  to  high  school  algebra  and 
geometry.  We  show  how. 
The  approximation  (4)  can  be  thought  of  as  coming  from  the  formula  for  the  sumn  of  a 
geometric  series  (memorize  this  too,  if you  have  forgotten  it): 
-= +xz+x2  +...  +zX + ... , 

IJ  < 1.

1-x 

Ifx is  small,  then  the  terms  z2 ,  X3,...  on  the  right  are  all  negligible  compared  with  the 
term  x,  so  they  can  be  ignored,  and  we  get  (4). 
Similarly,  the approximation  (5)  can be thought  of as  coming  from  the binomial  theorem, 
if r  is  a positive  integer: 

(1+x)r  =  1+rzx+ 

r(r - 1) 2 +.. +  r 
2


As before,  if x is small,  we  can neglect  the  terms in  z 2 ,  s ,...,  and we  get  the approximation 
(5).  Even if r is not an  integer, you will learn when  you study  infinite  series that the binomial 
theorem  is  still  formally  true.  Though  it  gives  an  infinite  sum  on  the  right,  instead  of  a

Finally,, the  linear  approximation  (6)  for sin  should  make  sense  if  you

think  of  the  trigonometric  definition  of sinz.  Referring  to  the  picture,  it

says  that  a small  arc  2z  of the  unit  circle  is  approximately  equal  in  length

Continuing  this  algebraic  viewpoint,  many  other  linear  approximation  formulas  can  be 
derived  from  the  basic  ones  above  by  using  algebra,  rather  than  by  going  back  to  (2)  and 
calculating  derivatives.  Here  are  some  examples  of this. 

Example  1. 
In  each  of the  following,  we  want  a linear  approximation  valid  for  z  - 0. 
Observe  in the  first  two  how  the  variable  is divided  by a number  (or  "scaled",  as  one  says,
since it  amounts  to  a change of scale  or  change  of units  for  the variable).  The  purpose  is  to 
put  the  expression  in  a  form  where  one  of  the  basic  approximations  can  be  used.

Notice  that in  this  example,  the  linearization  2 + 0 

turns  out  to be  a constant  function. 

Approximations  for  za 
a,  where  a  A0  . 
Though  it  is most  common  to work  near  a = 0,  sometimes  one wants  another  value  of a. 
Either  one  can  use the  formula  (2),  or  else  one  can make  a change  of variable:  h, Az,e are 
all  common  choices,  related  to  z  by 

(7) 	

z = a + h, 

z = a + Az,  z= a+e. 

The  new variable  is  then  close  to  0  when  z is  close  to  a.  Here  is  an example. 

Example  2.  Approximate  3 +  x4  for  z m 1. 
Solution.  Either  use  (2),  or  change  variable;  doing  the  latter, we  put  = 1 +  h.  Then

Applications.  Here  are  a  few  typical  uses  of the  linearization. 
Example  3.  In  the theory of special  relativity, the mass m of a body  moving with  speed 
v  is given  by

m 0  = mass  at rest,  c = velocity  of light 

What  speed  produces  a 1%increase  in  mass? 

A.  APPROXIMATIONS


Solution.  We  could  crank  out  the  answer,  using  the  formula  for  m,  but  in  practise  a 
simplifying  approximation  would be  used.  To  begin  with,  scale  m  and  v,  i.e.,  divide  them 
by  suitable  constants  to make  them  dimensionless:  m/tmo  and  v/c;  this  turns  the  above 
formula  into  (dividing  top  and  bottom by  c): 

m 
mo

- (1- u 2)1/2 

where  we  have  set  v/c = u;.when  v  is  small compared  with  c,  then u  s~  0.  We  get,  using  (5) 
with  r  =  1/2,

where  the  second  approximation  used  (4),  with  x  = u 2 /2. 
This  approximation  shows  that  to  make  m/mo =  1.01  (this  represents  a  1%increase  in 
the  mass),  we  want

Example  4.  Give  a  useful  approximate  formula,  valid  for  relatively  small  heights, 
showing  how  the  weight  of  a  body  decreases  as  it  rises  above  the  earth,  and  use  your 
formula  to determine  how  high it must  rise  to  experience  a  1%loss in  weight. 
Solution.  Let  R  be  the radius  of the  earth.  The  force  between  two  masses mi  and  M2 
with  centers  of 'mass separated  by  a distance  d  is 

so if  the  earth  weight  is M  and  our  body  has  weight  m,

where  in  this  last  step  we  made  the  variable  dimensionless  by  dividing  numerator  and 
denominator  by  R2;  this  scaling  also  makes  the  expression  simpler.  We  continue  with 
approximations:

There  is  a general  formula  for  the  coefficients  A, B, C  using  calcihlus,  but  let's work  alge­
braically  first,  and  consider  the  basic  approximations.

Discussion 
Formula  (9)  comes  as  before  from  the  sum of the  geometric  series. 
Formula  (10)  is the  beginning  of the  binomial  theorem,  if r  is  an  integer. 
Formula  (11)  looks  like  our  earlier  linear  approximation,  but  the  assertion here  is that  it 
that  is,  the term  in x 2  has 0  for  its  coefficient. 
is  also  the  best  quadratic  approximation  -
This  is  so  because  sin x  is  an  odd function,  so  the approximating  polynomial  should  be  odd 
also,  which  means  it cannot  have  any  x2 term. 
Formula  (12)  is  derived  from  (11)  and  the  identity  sin  x+z

cos 2 x =  1;  this  is  one  of  the 

Using  these  basic quadratic  approximations,  we  can by  algebra  get  quadratic  approxima­
tions  to  more  involved  expressions.  Examples  are  given  below.  In  studying  the  examples,
Snotice  that  during  the  course  of  the  calculation,  all  approximations must  be  quadratic.  If 
one  of  the  approximations  you  use  is  only  linear,  then  that  contaminates  the  final  result, 
which  probably  will  not  have  the  correct  x2  term.  This  is  the  same  principle  you  meet  in 
adding  numbers:  if one  of the  numbers  is  only  good  to  one  decimal  place,  then  no matter 
how  accurate  all the  other  numbers  are,  the  sum will  only  be  good  to  one  decimal  place.

To  illustrate  what  happens  if you  don't keep  enough  terms  during  the  calculation,  observe 
that  if  in  (d). above we  only  used  1+  x  in  the right-hand  factor,  the  answer  would  have  been 
1+ x  - x 2/2,  whose  x2  term  is  incorrect.

for x  a. 

Example  6.  Check  formulas  (10)  and  (11)  by  using  (13). 

Solution.  Since the  first two terms  of (13)  are  the linearization,  we  can build  on our  earlier 
work,  and  have  only  to  calculate  the  quadratic  coefficient  f"(0)/2.  We  get

The  usefulness  of  (13)  is  tempered  by  the  fact  that  it  requires  calculation  of  second

derivatives.  This  can  get rather  tedious  -
so  that using  the  algebraic  techniques  is  often  better.

A.  APPROXIMATIONS


The  quadratic  approximation  formula  (13)  may  be  "derived"  as  follow.  We  are  looking 
for the  right  choice  of coefficients  in 

(14) 

f(s) 

A + B(z - a) + C(z - a)2 , 

z  a. 

Let us  denote  by  Q(x) the polynomial on the right of (14).  Then itmakes sense to choose 
the  coefficients  A,  B, C so  that  f(s) and  Q(z)  have  the  same  'alue  and  the. same  first  and 
second  derivatives  at  a, i.e.,  so  that 

(15) 

f(a) = Q(a), 

f'(a) = Q'(a), 

f"(a) = Q"(a). 

Since  Q'(s) =  B  +  2C(r  - a)and Q"(z) =  2C,  equations  (15)  say  that 

(16) 

f(a) =A, 

f'(a) = B, 

f"(a) = 2C; 

these  values  for  A, B, C turn  (14)  into  (13),  as promised.  Note  that  the  first two  terms  on 
the  right  of  (13)  give  the  linearization  at  z  =  a; thus  the  quadratic  approximation  refines 
the  linear  approximation  by  adding  a quadratic  term  to  it.  ­
