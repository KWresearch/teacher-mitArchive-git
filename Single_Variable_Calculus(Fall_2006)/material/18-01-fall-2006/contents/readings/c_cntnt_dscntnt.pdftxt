C.  CONTINUITY  AND 

DISCONTINUITY


1.  One-sided  limits 
We  begin  by  expanding  the  notion  of limit  to  include  what  are  called  one-sided limits, 
where  z  approaches  a  only  from  one  side  -
the  right  or  the  left.  The  terminology  and 
notation  is:. 

right-hand  limit 

lim 

f(x) 

(z  comes  from  the  right,  x  >  a) 

left-hand  limit 

lim  f(z) 
(x  comes  from  the  left,  z <  a)
X  ML_ 
Since  we  use  limits  informally,  a  few  examples  will  be  enough  to  indicate  the  usefulness  of 
this  idea.

(As  the picture  shows,  at  the two  endpoints  of the domain,  we  only  have  a one-sided  limit.)

The  relationship  between  the one-sided  limits  and  the  usual  (two-sided)  limit. is  given by 
lim  f(x)  = L  and 
lim  f()  = L
lim  f(x)  = L

In words,  the (two-sided)  limit  exists if and  only if both one-sided  limits  exist  and  are equal. 
This  shows  for  example  that  in  Examples  2 and  3  above,  lim f(z)  does  not  exist. 

Students  often  say  carelessly  that  lim  1/x  =  oo, but  this  is  not  sloppy,  it  is  simply
2--+0

wrong,  as  the  picture  for  Example  3  shows.  By  contrast,  lirn  1/z  =  oo is  correct  and 
acceptable  terminology. 

2.  Continuity 
Tob  understand  continuity,  it  helps  to  see  how  a function  can  fail  to be  continuous.  All 
of the  important  functions  used  in  calculus  and  analysis  are  continuous  except  at  isolated 
points.  Such points  are  called  points of discontinuity.  There  are  several  types.  Let's begin 
by  first recalling  the  definition  of continuity  (cf.  book,  p.  75). 

(2) 

ff() 

is  continuous  at  a 

i 

lim  f(x)  =  f(a). 

Thus,  if a  is  a  point  of  discontinuity, 'something about the  limit  statement  in  (2) must  fail 
to be  true. 

Types  of  Discontinuity

In  a  removable  discontinuity,  lim f(x)  exists,  but  lim f(z)  ff(a).  This may be because 
--ia 
s--+a 
f(a) is undefined,  or  because  f(a) has  the  "wrong"  value.  The discontinuity  can  be removed 
by changing the  definition of f(x) at a so that its new value there is  lir  f(z). In the left-most 

is  undefined  when  x  =  1, but  if the  definition  of the  function  is  completed
picture, 
-
z-1 
by  setting  f(1)  = 2,  it becomes  continuous  -
the  hole  in  its  graph is  "filled  in". 

In  a  jump  discontinuity  (Example  2),  the  right-  and  left-hand  limits  both  exist,  but 
are  not  equal.  Thus,  lim f(z)  does  not exist,  according  to  (1).  The  size  of  the  jump  is 
the  difference  between  the  right- and  left-hand  limits  (it is  2 in  Example  2, for  instance). 
Though  jump  discontinuities  are  not  common  in  functions  given  by  simple  formulas,  they 
occur  frequently  in  engineering  -
for  example,  the  square  waves  in  electrical  engineering, 
or  the  sudden  discharge  of a  capacitor. 

In  an  infinite  discontinuity  (Examples 3  and  4),  the  one-sided  limits  exist  (perhaps  as  oo 
or  -oo),  and  at  least one  of them  is  foo. 

An  essential  discontinuity  is one  which  isn't of the three  previous  types - at least  one  of 
the one-sided  limits doesn't  exist  (not  even  as  ±oo).  Though  sin(1/z)  is  a  standard  simple 
example  of  a  function  with  an essential  discontinuity  at  0,in  applications  they  arise  rarely, 
presumably  because Mother  Nature  has  no  use for  them. 

We  say  a  function  is  continuous  on  an  interval  [a,  b]if it  is  defined  on  that interval  and 
continuous  at  every  point  of that interval.  (At the  endpoints,  we  only  use  the  approrpiate 
one-sided  limit  in  applying  the  definition  (2).) 

C.  CONTINUITY  AND  DISCONTINUITY 

We  say  a function  is  continuous if its  domain is an  interval, and it  is  continuous at  every 
point  of that  interval. 
A point of discontinuity is  always  understood  to be  isolated,  i.e.,  it is  the only  bad point 
for  the  function  on  some  interval. 
We  illustrate  the  point  of these  definitions.  (They  are  slightly  different  from  the ones  in 
your  book,  but  are more  consistent  with  standard  terminology  in  calculus.)

Example  5.  The  function  1/z  is  continuous  on  (0, oo)  and  on  (-oo, 0),  i.e.,  for  z > 0 
and for  z <  0,  in  other words,  at  every  point in  its domain.  However,  it  is not  a continuous 
function  since  its  domain  is  not  an  interval.  It has  a single  point  of  discontinuity,  namely 
z  = 0,  and it  has  an  infinite  discontinuity  there. 

Example  6.  The  function  tanz  is  not continuous,  but  is  continuous  on  for  example  the 
interval  -ir/2  <  x  < ir/2.  It has  infinitely  many  points  of-discontinuity,  at  +ir/2,  13r/2, 
etc.;  all  are  infinite  discontinuities. 

Example  7;  f ()  =  Jz- is continuous,  but  f'(z) has  a jump  discontinuity  at  0. 

-1,1,  X><0,0  does  not  have  a 
Example  8.  The  function  in  Example  2,  f(z)  = 
continuous  derivative  f'(z) -
students  often  think  it  does  since  it  seems  that  f'(z) =  0 
everywhere.  However  this  is not  so:  f'(0) does  not  exist,  since  by  definition, 

+ Az)  - f(0)

AX--+O 
but  f(0)  does  not  even  exist.  Even  if f(0) is  defined  to  be  say  1, or  0,  the  derivative  f'(0) 
does  not  exist. 

Remember  the  important  little  theorem  (Simmons  p.  75) 
f (z)  continuous  at  a 

f(z)  differentiable  at  a 

(3) 

or to  put  it  contrapositively, 

"f(x) discontinuous  at a 
f(z)  not differentiable  at  a 
The function  in Example 8 is discontinuous  at 0,  so it has no derivative  at 0; the discontinuity 
of f'(x) at  0 is  a  removable  discontinuity.
