F.  HEAVISIDE'S  COVER-UP  METHOD 

The  eponymous  method was  introduced  by  Oliver  Heaviside  as  a fast  way  to  do a  decom­
position  into partial  fractions.  In  18.01  we  need  the  partial fractions  decomposition  in  order 
to  integrate'rational functions  (i.e.,  quotients  of polynomials).  In  18.03,  it  will be needed  as 
an  essential  step  in  using  the  Laplace  transform  to  solve  differential  equations,  and  in  fact 
this  ývas  more or  less  Heaviside's  original  motivation. 
The  cover-up  method  can be  used  to make  a partial  fractions  decomposition  of a  rational 
function  p-)  whenever the  denominator can  be factored into  distinct linearfactors. 

We illustrate  with  an  example;  though  simple,  it  should  convince  you  that  the  method  is 
worth  learning. 

Example  1.  Decompose  ( 

x-7 
1)(  +2)  into  partial  fractions. 

Solution.  We  know  the  answer  will  have  the  form 
A 
B 
x-7 
x-1  +x+2 
(x-1)(x+2)-
To  determine  A  by  the cover-up  method,  on  the left-hand  side we  mentally  remove  (or  cover 
up  with  a  finger)  the factor  x  - 1 associated  with  A,  and substitute  x  = 1 into what's left; 
this  gives  A: 

x-7 

(2) 

1-7 
((+2) x,=1  =  -
1+2 
Similarly,  B  is  found  by  covering  up  the  factor  x +  2 on  the left,  and  substituting  x  =  -2 
into  what's left.  This  gives 

=  -2=  A.

x-7 
(x  - 1)

-2-1 

I=-2 

=  3  =  B. 

Thus,  our  answer  is

Why  does  the method  work?  The reason  is simple.  The  "right"  way  to  determine  A  from 
equation  (1) would  be  to  multiply  both  sides  by  (z  - 1);  this  would  give

(4) 
x-
B 
(x + 2)  =  A  +  + 2(-1). 
Now  if we  substitute  x =  1, what  we  get  is  exactly  equation  (2),  since the  term  on  the  right 
disappears.  The  cover-up  method  therefore  is  just  any  easy  way  of  doing  the  calculation 
without  going  to  the  fuss  of  writing  (4)  -
it's unnecessary  to  write  the  term  containing  B 
since  it  will  become  0  .

F.  COVER-UP  METHOD


In  general,  if the  denominator  of the  rational  function  factots  into  the  product  of  distinct 
linear  factors: 

A 1 
A, 
p(z) 
( -al)(z -a2)..- (-a)  =  A 
- +  ...+  -ar,  4ra 
x-a 
then  Ai  is  found  by  covering  up  the  factor  x - ai pn  the left,  and  setting  x  =  a4 in. the rest 
of the  expression.

Example  2.  Decompose

into  partial  fractions. 

Solution.  Factoring,  x33  _  =. x(  2  - 1) = z(x - 1)(z  +  1).  By  the  cover-up  method,

z(=-1)(z+11) 

-1 
1/2 
X  X-1 

1/2 
z+  ' 

To  be  honest,  the  real  difficulty  in  all  of  the  partial  fractions  methods  (the  cover-up 
method  being  no  exception)  is  in factoring  the  denominator.  Even  the  programs  which  do 
*symbolic  integration,  like  Macsyma,  or  Maple,  can  only  factor  polynomials  whose  factors 
have  integer  coefficients,  or  "easy coefficients"  like  V2. and therefore  they  can only  integrate 
rational  functions  with  "easily-factored"  denominators.  .(Of course,  these  are  the  only  kind 
you'll see  in  18.01  or  18.03.), 

Heaviside's cover-up  method  also  can be  used  even  when  the  denominator  doesn't factor 
into  distinct  linear  factors.  To  be  sure,  it  gives  only partial  results,  but  these  can  often  be 
a  big  help.  We  illustrate. 
Example  3.  Decompose 

5= +6+6
5z
(x2+4)(x  - 2) 

Solution.  We  write 

.5z+6 
( 2 + 4)-x(z-
(5 

2) 

C 
Az+B 
X2  +4  +  x-2

We  first  determine  C by  the  cover-up method,  getting C = 2. Then  A  and  B  can be.found 
by  the  method  of undetermined  coefficients;  the  work  is  greatly  reduced  since  we  need  to 
solve  only  two  simultaneous  equations  to  find  A  and  B,  not  three. 
Following  this plan,  using C = 2,  we  combine  terms.on  the  right  of (5)  so  that  both  sides 
have  the  same  denominator.  The  numerators must  then  also  be equal,  which  gives  us 

5x +  6 = (Ax +  B)(z - 2)  +  2(X2 +  4). 
(6) 
Comparing  the  coefficients  say  of z 2  and  of  the  constant  terms  on  both  sides  of  (6)  then 
gives  respectively  the  two  equations 

0=A+2 

and 

6= -2B  + 8, 

from  which  A =-2  and  .B= 1 
In  using (6),  one  could have  instead  compared the coefficients  of x,  getting  5  = -2A+  B; 
this  provides  a valuable  check  on the  correctness  of our  values  for  A  and  B. 

F.  COVER-UP  METHOD 

In  Example  3,  an  alternative  to  undetermined  coefficients  would  be  to  substitute  two 
numerical  values  for  x  into  the  original  equation  (5),  say  z =  0  and  z  =  1  (any  values 
other  than  x  =  2  are  usable).  Again  one  gets  two  simultaneous  equations  for  A  and  B. 
This  method  requires  addition  of  fractions,  and  is  usually  better  when  only  one  coefficient 
remains  to be  determined  (as in Example  4 below). 
Still  another  method  would  be  to  factor  the  denominator  completely  into  linear  factors, 
using complex coefficients,  and then use  the cover-up method,  but with complex  numbers.  At 
the  end, conjugate  complex  terms  have  to be  combined  in  pairs to produce  real  summands. 
The  calculations  are  sometimes  longer,  and  require  skill  with  complex  numbers. 

The  cover-up  method  can  also  be  used  if a linear  factor is  repeated,  but  there  too  it gives 
just  partial  results.  It  applies  only  to  the  highest power of the  linearfactor. Once again,  we 
illustrate.

Example  4.  Decompose  (
(X- 1)2(X + 2) 

Solution.  We write 

(7) 

1 
A 
+ 
(  )  +2 
-
(Z- 1)2(X + 2)  (z- 1)2 

C 
B 
+ 
z- 1  x+2 

To find A  cover  up (  - 1)2  and set  x = 1;  you  get A = 1/3.  To find C, cover  up z +2,and 
set  x  = -2;  you  get  C  =  1/9. 
This leaves  B which  cannot  be  found  by  the  cover-up  method.  But  since  A  and  C  are 
already known  in  (7),  B  can be  found by  substituting  any  numerical  value  (other than  1 or 
for  z in  equation  (7).  For  instance,  if we  put  z  = 0  and  remember  that  A  =  1/3  and 
-2) 
C =  1/9, we  get 
1/3  B  1/9
1 
i = -+-l+-2 

from which  we  see  that  B =  -1/9. 
B  could also be found by applying the method of undetermined  coefficients  to the equation 
(7);  note that  since  A  and  C  are known,  it  is.enough  to get  a single  linear  equation  in order 
to determine  B -
simultaneous  equations  are  no  longer  needed. 
The  fact  that the  cover-up  method works  for just  the  highest power of the  repeated  linear 
factor  can  be  seen just  as  before.  In  the  above  example  for  instance,  the  cover-up method 
for  finding  A  is  just  a  short way  of multiplying  equation  (5)  through  by  (x  - 1)2  and  then 
substituting  z  = 1 into the  resulting equation.
