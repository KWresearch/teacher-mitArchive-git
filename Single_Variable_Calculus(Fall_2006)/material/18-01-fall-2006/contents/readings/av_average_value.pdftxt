AV.  AVERAGE  VALUE 

What  was  the  average  temperature  on  July  4 in Boston? 	
The temperature  is a continuous  function f(z),  whose graph  over the 
24-hour  period inight look  as  shown.  How  should we define  the  average 
value  of such  a function over  the time  interval  [0,  24] -- measuring  time 
18  24  x 
6 
s  in  hours,  with z  = 0  at  12:00AM  ?

We  could  observe  the  temperature  in  the  middle  of  every  hour,  that  is,  at  the  times 
zX  = .5,zs  =  1.5,...  ,z4  = 23.5,  then  average  these  24 observations,  getting

To get  a more  accurate  answer,  we  could  average  measurements  made  more  frequently,  say 
every  ten minutes. 
For a general  interval  [a, b]  and function  f(z),  the analogous  procedure would be to divide 
up  the interval  into n equal  parts,  each  of length 

(1)

A. = -n 
and  average  the values  of the function  f(x) at  a succession  of points zi,  where  sx

We  can  relate the  sum  on  the  right  to  a definite integral:  using  (1),  (2)  becomes 

(3) 	

average  of  f ()  over  [a,b] 

Asn-a 
As  n *- co,  the sum  on  the  right-hand  side  of (3)  approaches  the  definite  integral  of f(z) 
over  [a, b],  and  we  therefore define  the  average  value  of the function f(z)  on  [a, b]  by 

f ()A

A =  averageof  f()  over  [,  ] = 

(x)dx. 

Geometrically,  the  average  value  A  can  be thought  of as  the height  of that 
constant  function  A which  has the  same area  over  [a, b]  as  f(z)  does.  This 
is so  since  (4a)shows that

AV.  AVERAGE  VALUE 

Example  1.  In  alternating  current,  voltage  is  represented  by  a  sine 
wave  with  a  frequency  of 60  cycles/second,  and  a peak  of  120  volts.  What 
is  the  average  voltage? 
21r 
27r
Solution.  The  voltage  function  has  frequency 
-
=  120r, 
11/i2o  period 
1/60 
and  amplitude  120,  so  it  is  given  by V(t)  = 120 sin(120irt).  Thus  by  (4).

(We  integrate  over  [0,1/120]  rather  than  [0,1/60]  since we  don't want  zero 
as  the  average.)

Example  2. 
a) A  point  is  chosen  at  random  on  the  z-axis  between  -1  and  1;  call 
it  P.. What  is  the  average  length  of  the  vertical  chord  to  the  unit  circle 
Dassing  through  P? 
b)  Same  question,  but  now  the point  P  is  chosen  at random  on  the  circumference. 
Solution.  a)  If P  is  at x,  the  chord  has length  2 vTC,  so  we  get 

average  of 2 

X  over  [-1, 1]  =

b)  By  symmetryi  we  can  suppose  P  is  on the  upper  semicircle.  If P  is  at  the  angle  0,the 
chord  has  length  2 sin 0, so  this  time  we  get 

average  of 2sin 0 over  [0,]  =

(Intuitively,  can  you  see  why  the  average  in  part  (b)  should  be  less  than  the  average  in 
part  (a) -
could  you  have  predicted  this  would be  so?)
