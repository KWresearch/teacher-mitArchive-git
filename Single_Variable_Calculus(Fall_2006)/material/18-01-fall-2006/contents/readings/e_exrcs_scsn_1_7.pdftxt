1A-9  a)  Graph  the  function  f  that  consist  of  straight  line  segments  joining  the  points 
(1, 2),  (3,  -1),  and  (5,2).  Such  a  function  is  called  piecewise  linear.

1B.  Velocity  and  rates  of  change 

1B-1  A  test  tube  is  knocked  off  a tower  at the top of the  Green  building.  (For  the purposes 
of this  experiment  the  tower  is  400  feet  above  the  ground,  and  all  the  air  in  the  vicinity  of 
the Green  building  was  evacuated,  so  as  to eliminate  wind  resistance.)  The  test  tube  drops 
16t 2  feet  in  t  seconds.  Calculate 
a) the  average  speed  in  the  first  two  seconds  of the  fall 
b)  the  average  speed  in  the  last  two seconds  of the  fall 
c)  the  instantaneous  speed  at landing 

1B-2  A  tennis  ball  bounces  so  that  its  initial  speed  straight  upwards  is  b feet  per  second.

a) Find  the  velocity  v  = ds/dt at time  t. 
b)  Find  the  time  at which  the  height  of the  ball  is  at  its  maximum height. 
c)  Find  the maximum  height. 
d)  Make a  graph of v and  directly  below  it a graph of a as a function  of time.  Be  sure 
to mark  the  maximum  of s  and the  beginning  and  end  of the  bounce. 
e)  Suppose  that when  the  ball  bounces  a second  time  it rises  to  half the  height  of the 
first  bounce.  Make  a graph  of  s  and  of  v  of both  bounces,  labelling  the  important  points. 
(You  will  have  to  decide  how  long  the  second  bounce  lasts  and  the  initial  velocity  at  the 
start  of the bounce.) 
f)  If the  ball  continues  to  bounce,  how  long  does  it  take  before  it  stops? 

1C.  Slope  and  derivative 

1C-1  a)  Use  the  difference  quotient  definition  of derivative  to calculate  the rate  of  change 
of  the  area  of  a disk with  respect  to  its  radius.  (Your  answer  should  be  the  circumference 
of the  disk.) 
b)  Use  the  difference  quotient  definition  of derivative  to  calculate  the  rate  of  change 
of the  volume  of a ball with  respect  to  the  radius.  (Your  answer  should  be  the  surface  area 
of the ball.) 

10-2  Let  f(z)  = (z - a)g(z).  Use  the  definition  of the  derivative  to  calculate  that  f'(a) = 
g(a), assuming  that g  is  continuous.

1C-68  Graph  the  derivative  of  the  following  functions  directly  below  the  graph  of  the 
function.  It  is  very  helpful  to know  that  the  derivative  of  an  odd  function  is  even  and  the

1H-7 The  decibel  scale of  loudness  is 

L  =  10 loglo(I/Io) 

where  I,  measured  in  watts  per  square  meter,  is  the  intensity  of  the  sound  and  Io= 10-12 
watt/m 2  is  the  softest  audible  sound  at  1000  hertz.  Classical  music  typically  ranges  from 
30  to  100  decibels.  The  human  ear's pain threshold  is  about  120  decibels; 

1.  DIFFERENTIATION 

a) Suppose  that  a  jet  engine  at  50  meters  has  a  decibel  level  of  130,  and  a  normal 
conversation  at  1 meter  has  a decibel  level  of 60.  What  is  the  ratio of the  intensities  of the 
two  sounds? 
b)  Suppose  that  the  intensity  of  sound  is  proportional  to  the  inverse  square  of the 
distance  from  the  sound.  Based  on  this  rule,  calculate  the  decibel  level  of  the  sound  from 
the jet  at.a  distance  of  100  meters,  at distance  of  1 km. 1 
1H-8*  The  mean  distance  of  each  of  the  planets  to  the  Sun  and  their  mean  period  bf

a)  Find  the  pattern  in  these  data  by  making  a.graph  of  (In  ,lny)  where  x  is  the 
distance  to  the  Sun  and  y  is  the  period  of  revolution  for  the  first  four  points  (Mercury 
through  Mars).  Observe  that  these  points  are  nearly  on  a straight  line.  Plot  a  line  with 
ruler  and  estimate  its  slope.  (You  can  check  your  estimated  slope  by  calculating  slopes  of 
lines  connecting  consecutive  data  points.) 
b)  Using  an approximation  to  the slope  m  that  you  found  in  part  (a)  accurate  to  two 
significant  figures,  give  a  formula  for  y  in  the  form 

lny  = mlnx + c 

(Use  the  Earth to  evaluate  c.) 
c)  Solve  for  y  and  make  a  table  for  the  predicted  values  of  the  periods  of revolutions 
of all  the  planets  based  on  their distance  to the  Sun.  (Your  answers  should  be  accurate  to 
one percent.) 
d)  The  Earth  has  radius  approximately  6, 000  km  and  the  Moon  is  at  a distance  of 
about  382, 000  km.  The  period  of  revolution  of  the  Moon  is  a  lunar  month,  say  28  days. 
Assume  that  the  slope  m  is  the same  for  revolution  around  the Earth  as  the  on  you  found 
"for  revolution  around  the  Sun  in  (a).  Find  the  distance  above  the  surface  of  the  Earth  of 
geosynchronous  orbit,  that  is,  the  altitude  of  the  orbit  of a  satellite  that  stays  above  one 
place  on  the  equator.  (For  satellites  this  close  to  Earth  it  is  inportant  to  know  that  y  is 
predicting  the  distance  from  the  satellite  to  the  center  of the  Earth.  This  is  why  you  need 
to know  the radius  of the  Earth.) 
e)  Find  the  period  of revolution  of a satellite  that circles  at  an altitude  of  1,000  km. 

IThe  inverse  square  law  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  the  intensity  is  measured  in  energy  per  unit  time 
per  unit  area.  When  the  sound  has  travelled  a  distance  r,  the  energy  of  a  sound  spread  over  a  sphere  of 
radius  r  centered  at  the  source.  The  area  of  that  sphere  is  proportional  to  r2,.so  the  average  intensity  is 
proportional  to  1/r2. Fortunately  for  people  who  live  near  airpoi-ts,  sound  doesn't  travel  as  well  as  this. 
Part of  the  energy  is  dissipated  into  heating  the air  and  another  part  into  vibration  of  insulating materials 
on  the way  to  the listener's ear.

this  equivalent  simple  interest  rate  is in bank jargon  the  "annual percentage  rate"  or APR.3 
a)  Compute  the APR  of 5%  compounded  monthly, daily,4  and  continuously.  Contin­
uous  compounding  means  the  limit  as  k  tends  to  infinity. 
b)  As  in part  (a),  compute  the APR  of  10%  compounded  monthly,  biweekly  (k=26), 
daily,  and  continuously.  (We  have  thrown  in  the  biweekly  rate  because  loans  can  be  paid 
off  biweekly.) 

3 Banks  are required  to  reveal  this so-called  APR  when  they offer  loans.  The  APR  also  takes  into  account 
certain bank fees  known  as points.  Unfortunately,  not  all fees  are  included  in it, and  the true costs  are higher 
if the  loan  is paid  off  early.
4 For  daily  compounding  assume  that  the  year  has  365  days,  not  365.25.  Banks  are  quite  careful  about 
these  subtle  differences.  If you  look  at official  tables  of rates  from precalculator  days you  will find  that  they 
are  off by  small amounts  because  U.S.  regulations  permitted  banks  to  pretend  that  a year  has  360  days.

The  homogeneous  form  makes  it  possible  to  solve  for  y/x.  You  can  then  find  (x,,y)  by 
substituting  in  the  original  equation.

3F-4  Newton's law  of  cooling  says  that  the  rate  of change  of temperature  is  proportional

surrounding  region  is  at a constant  temperature  Te  (e  for  external),  then  the  rate  of change 
of T is  given  by

a)  Find  using  two  different  methods  the  equation  in  polar  coordinates  for  the  circle  of 
radius  a with  center  at  (a, 0)  on  the x-axis,  as  follows: 
(i) write  its  equation  in  rectangular  coordinates,  and  then  change  it  to polar  coordi­
nates  (substitute  z =  rcos  and  y =  rsin0,  and  then  simplify). 
(ii)
treat  it  as  a  locus  problem:  let  OQ. be  the  diameter  lying  along  the  x-axis,  and 
P :(r,
0)a point  on the  circle;  use AOPQ and trigonometry  to  find  the  relation  connecting 
r  and  0. 
b)  Carry  out  the  analogue  of 4H-2a for  the circle  of radius  a with  center  at  (0,  a)  on  the 
y-axis; OQ  is  now  the  diameter  lying  along.the  y-axis. 
c)  (i) Find  the polar  equation for the line  intersecting  the positive x-and 
y-axes  respectively  at  A  and  B,  and  having  perpendicular  distance  a  from 
the origin. 
(Let  a  =  LDOA;  use  the  right  triangle  DOP to get  the  equation 
connecting  r, 0,a  and  a. 
(ii)  Convert  your  polar  equation  to  the  usual  rectangular  equation 
involving  A  and  B,  by  using  trigonometry. 
d)  In  the  accompanying  figure,  the  point  Q  moves  around  the  circle  of 
radius  a centered  at  the  origin;  QR is  a perpendicular  to  the  x-axis.  P  is 
a  point  on  ray OQ  such that  JQPJ  =  IQRI:  P  is  the point  inside  the circle 
in  the  first  two  quadrants,  but outside  the circle  in  the  last  two  quadrants. 
(i)  Sketch  the  locus  of P; the locus  is  called  a  cardioid(cf.  4H-3c). 
(ii)  find  the  polar  equation  of this  locus. 
e)  The  point  P  moves  in  a locus  so  that the  product  of its  distances  from  the  two points 
Q : (-a,0)  and  R  : (a,0)  is  constant.  Assuming  the  locus  of P  goes  through  the  origin, 
determine  the  value  of the  constant,  and  derive  the  polat  equation  of the  locus of  P. 
(Work with  the squares  of the distances,  rather than  the distances  themselves,  and  use 
the  law of cosines;  the identities  (A+B)(A- B)  A'- B2 and  cos 20 = 2 cos 2 0-1 simplify 
the  algebra  and  produce  a  simple  answer  at  the  end.  The  resulting  curve  is  a  lemniscate,
