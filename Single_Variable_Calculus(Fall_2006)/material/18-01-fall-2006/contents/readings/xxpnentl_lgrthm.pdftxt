X.  EXPONENTIALS 

AND  LOGARITHMS


1.  The  Exponential  and  Logarithm Functions. 
We  have  so  far  worked  with  the  algebraic  functions  -
those  involving  polynomials  and 
root extractions  - and  with  the trigonometric  functions.  We  now  have  to  add to  our  list  the 
exponential  and  logarithm  functions,  since  these  are  used  in your  science  and  engineering 
courses  from the  beginning.  Your  book  will  handle  the  calculus  of  these  functions;  here  we 
want  to  review  briefly  their  algebraic  properties,  and  look  at  applications;  one  or  two  of 
them  might be  new  to you. 
Where  does  one  encounter  exponentials  and  logarithms?  In  general,  exponentials  are 
used  to  express  all  sorts of  simple  growth  and decay  processes. 
1.  The  growth  of a  bacteria  colony which  doubles  in size  every  day:  y =  yo2 t , 
where  t  =  time  in  days,  y =  population  size,  yo  = the  initial size,  i.e.,  size  at  t = 0. 
2.  Dollars  in  a bank  account,  at  5%.interest  compounded  annually:  A  = Ao(l.05) n , 
where  n = number of  years, A  =  amount,  Ao  =  initial  amount  (the  "principal"). 
3.  Amount  of radioactive  substance, with  a  1 year  half-life: 
x  = zo(1/2)n  = zo2 ­n, 
where  n =  number  of years, 
x =  amount, 
0o=  initial  amount. 
There  are  many  other  examples:  the  decay  of  electric  charge  on  a  capacitor,  the  way 
a  hot  and  cold  body  come  to  the  same  temperature  when  they  are  brought  together,  the 
falling  of a  body  through  a  resisting  medium  (a steel  ball  dropped  into  oil, for  instance)  ­
all  involve  exponentials  when  you  express  them  in mathematical  terms. 

We  use  logarithms when  the base  of the exponential  is  unimportant  and we want  to focus 
our  attention  on  the  exponents  instead.  Suppose  the  base  is  10;  writing  simply  "log"  for 
"log  0o" in  what  follows,  we  have 

y = 10' 

€ 

logy  = z. 

1.  Star  magnitude.  The  observed brightness  B  of a  star  is  described  by  comparing  it 
to  a  standard  brightness  Bo,  using the  equation 

B  = BolO-
10 

5 .

The  important  thing  is  the  number  m  called  the  magnitude; it  is  defined  by  the  above 
equation,  or  equivalently,  taking  logs,  by 

m  =  -

5 
B 
2  Bo 
log 
.
Thus, the  higher  the magnitude,  the fainter, the star.  A star of brightness  Bo,  if one existed, 
would  have  magnitude  zero.  Thus  the constant  Bo  gives  the  magnitude  scale  a zero  point. 
This  point  was  chosen  so  that  the  brightest  stars  (other than  the  sun)  - Sirius  and  Vega, 
for  example  - would  have  magnitude  near  1, i.e.,  be  stars  of the  first  magnitude. 

2.  Orders  of magnitude.  We  speak  of  a  kilometer  as  "three  orders  of magnitude" 
greater  than  a meter.  That  is 

km  =  103, 
meter 

3  =  log  (. 
meter 

In  general,  when  we  compare  two  quantities  A  and  B; 

number  of orders  of magnitude  by which  A  is  greater  than  B  =  log(A/B)  . 

3.  Chemical  pH.  In  chemistry,  the  acidity  or  alkalinity  of  a  solution  is  measured  by 
the  concentration  [H+]  of hydrogen  ions  in  the  solution,  in units  of moles/liter. 
If for  some  solution  the  concentration  [H+]  =  10",  then  we  define 

pH of solution  =  -n  =  - log [H+]. 

The negative  sign is  used  to avoid  always  having  negative pH's, since the  concentration  [H+] 
is very  small. 

The  algebraic  laws. 
We  will  begin with  a  brief  review  of  the  algebra  of exponentials.and  logarithms.  Please 
study  the  examples  given  of calculations,  since  many  students  seem  to  have  trouble  with 
this. 
We  fix  a number  a >  0,  called  the  base.  The  pair  of equations 

(1) 

y  = a= 

log,  y = z 

are  equivalent;  both  express  the  same  relation  between  z  and  y. 
If  you  substitute  one 
equation  into  the other, you get  two  other  equations  which  are often  more useful  in practice 
than  those  in  (1) (the  examples  will  illustrate): 

(2) 

y=  logYY 

.-log.(ac )  =  x. 

In  the  first,  we  take  the  log  then  exponentiate;  in  the  second,  we  exponentiate,  then  take 
the  log;  in  both.cases,  we  end  up  where  we started. 
The  two  basic  algebraic  laws  governing  exponentials  and logarithms  are 

(3) 
(4) 

aL2+  =  ='2a  2' 
(a=)k  =  ak.. 

log0 . y  +  log.  y2  = log01912. 
log'y~  = k log.  yl 

The  laws  on  either  side  follow  from  those  on  the  other  side  by  substituting  y1 =  a "- or 
xj  = log.  y1,  and then  using  (1)  or  (2). 

X.  EXPONENTIALS  AND  LOGARITHMS 

Graphs  of the  exponential  and  log  functions 
The  picture  on  the  left  below  shows 'some  graphs  of  the  exponential  function  a"  for 
different  choices  of bases.  (We will  discuss  the  base  e ;  2.718  presently.) 

The,graph  rises  if a  >  1, falls  if  a  <  1.  Since 
=  a-,  the  graph  of  (1/a)"  is 
obtained  by  reflecting  the  graph of  a" in the  y-axis.  (See  Notes G,  p.  G.2.) 
The  pair  of  equivalent  equations  y  =  a'  and  x  =  log.  y  show  that  a f  and  log,  z  are 
inverse functions, according  to Notes  G,  pp.  G.8,9.  Thus  the  graph of log,  z is  obtained  by 
reflecting  the  graph  of  ae  in  the  diagonal  line  y  =  z.  The  reasoning  for  this  needs  a lot  of 
repetition  to sink  in,  so  we  repeat  it  briefly  once  more.  Namely,  consider  in  turn  the  three 
equations 

z  = ay 
y =  log a X 
y  =  ax 
Since  the second  equation  arises  from the first  by  switching  z and y,  the graph  of the  second 
equation  is  obtained  by  flipping  the  first  graph  around  the  diagonal  line  y  =  z;  the  third 
equation  has the same graph  as the  second,  since it's the  same equation  - we've only  solved 
it for  y.  To  sum  up:  the  first and  third  equations  have  graphs which  are  reflections  of each 
other about  y  = x. 

The  base  e.  Changing  the  base. 
There  are  really  only  two  or three  bases  in  common  use. 
For  areas  in  science  and  engineering  where  calculus  does  not  enter,  or  where  at  least 
historically  it was  not  used, the  base  10  is  the  usual  choice,  because  it  associates  naturally 
with  the  decimal  system,  making  rough estimations  of the  size  of exponentials  a  fairly  easy 
thing  to  do. 
Oh the other hand,  if you are going to have to differentiate  or integrate,  the base  e.e 2.718 
(The  symbol  e  was  introduced  by  Euler  -
is  the  usual  choice. 
the  first  letter  of  both 
"exponential"  and  "Euler".)  As  you will  see,  it  is  the  base  which  makes  for  the  simplest-
looking  differentiation  and  integration  formulas  for  exponentials  and  logs. 
(To the above  two, one should perhaps  add  the base 2, which  is useful  in computer science, 
with  its bits  and  bytes.) 
For  base  e and  base  10,  the  corresponding  notations  for  the  logarithm  are 

log ,  x  =  In x 

(the  "natural  logarithm"); 

loglo  X  =  log 

. 

(Warning:  Many  pure  mathematics  books  use  log z  for  the  natural  logarithm;  science  and 
engineering books generally use inz.  Some computer  science books use  log z to mean log12 
.) 

Using  science  and  engineering  notation,  the  logarithm  laws  read,  for  the  bases  e and  10: 

ln(ab) = Ina +  nb 
ln(ab) = b In a 

log(ab)' = log a + log b 
log(ab)  =  blog a 

and 

In(e))=  ,  eIn = 
(6) 
Ine = 1,  Inl= 
0;  el =e, e  = l 

log(10)  = z,  1 0 10og=  X 
log  10  =  1, logl  = 0; 10'  = 10,  100 =  1. 

Other  bases.  The  reason  why  it  is  not  necessary  to  use  other  bases  is  that  all  other 
exponentials  and  logarithms  can  be  written  in  terms  of  e"  and  Ins,  or  if  one  prefers,  in 
terms  of  10S  and  logz.  Since  in  calculus  we  use  the  base  e,  let's use  this  base.  Using  (6), 
we  have  for  any  base  a >  0, 
a" = (e=n  ).  e.n a. 
Thus  the  functions  ek'  ,  for  different- constants  k, represent  all  of the  exponential  functions 
a.  no  matter what  the  base  a is. 
As  for  logarithms,  starting with  the  equations 

a" =  y, 

z  = log, 

, 

taking  the  natural  log  of the  equation  on the  left  gives 

(In a) = Iny  . 

Solving  for  x  and  substituting  into  the  second equation,  we  get 

Iny

log.,  =havIna 
Finally, changing  the  variable  from  yto z,we  have 

log  a  = 

;7a 

in  particular, 

log

Study  these  transformations  until  you  can  reproduce  them  easily. 
In  calculations,  students  usually  find  it  easy  to  use  the  laws  of  exponentials  and  logs. 
The  chief trouble  is  in  passing  from  the  log  to  the  exponential  and  vice-versa.  Study  the 
following  examples,  and  don't go  further  until  you  have  tried some  of the  exercises.  Notice 
that  you  can  almost  always  get  through  using  (2);  whereas  the  equations  (1)  sometimes 
aren't good  enough,  and  even  when  they  are,  they  require  too much  thinking.  The  general 
principle which  governs  the  following  calculations  is:

To get rid of logs, exponentiate; to  get rid of exponentials, take the  logs.

Example  1. 
If one  liquid  has  a  pH  which  is  4  greater  than  the  pH  of  a  second  liquid, 
what  is the  relation  between  the  [H+ ]  concentrations  of the  two  liquids?  (cf.  p.X.1) 
First  Solution.  Using  subscripts  to distinguish  the  two  liquids, 

(pH)i  =  .(pH) 2 +  4 
-log[H+]i  =  -log[H  +] +4 

Multipljing  through  by  -1,  then  exponentiating  both  sides  (base  10)  and  using  (6), 
[H+]  =  [H+]2.-10- 4. 
Second  Solution.  Starting  from  the  second  line,  put  both  logs  on  the  left  side,  and 
combine  them  using  (5)  (remember  that  - log a  =  In(1/a)),  then  exponentiate  both  sides 
(or use  (1)). 

Example  2  A  radioactive  substance  decays  according  to  the  law  y =  yoe k t  .  Two 
measurements  are made:  at  time ti,  there  is  an  amount  y7 present,  where  i  =  1,2.  Express 
k  in  terms  of the  yj- and  ti. 
Solution.  We  have  y2  = yoe6 kt  and  yl  =  yoekt.  Dividing  one equation  by  the  other  to 
get  rid  of 70, 

72/l1  =  e2/ekt  =  ek(t-t); 
ln(y/yl)  =  k(t  -tl), 
k  =  ln(y/yl)-)Iny  - lnyl 
t 2  - tl 
t 2 - tl 

Example  3.  Solve  for  y  the  equation  ln(y  + 1)  =  Iny + x  -2. 
Solution.  Exponentiating  both  sides,  y +  1 =  y.  ef- 2 ; this  is  of the  form  y +  1 =  Ay, 
whose solution  for y  is

=  1- A

1- e  - 2 ' 

(1 + z) S  = 4- ' 
Example  4.  Solve  for  y: 
. 
Solution.  Take  the  log  of both  sides,  to  get  the  y  downstairs: 

31n(1+z)  =  -y2  n4 
ln(1  +  z)
