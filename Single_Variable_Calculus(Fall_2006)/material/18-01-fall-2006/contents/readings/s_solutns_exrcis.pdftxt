using  the function  s(t)  = 16t 2, representing  the distance  down measured  from  the  top.  Then 
all  the  speeds  are  positive  instead  of negative.) 
b)  Solve h(t)  =  0  (or s(t)  =  400)  to  find  landing  time  t  =  5.  Hence  the  average  speed 
for  the last  two  seconds  is

Therefore,  v  =  b - 32t. 
b)  The  ball  reaches  its maximum  height  exactly  when  the  ball  has  finished  going  up. 
This  is time  at which  v(t)  =  0,  namely,  t = b/32. 
c)  The  maximum  height  is  8(b/32)  = b2/64. 
d)  The graph of v is  a straight  line with slope 
-32.  The  graph of 8 is  a  parabola with maximum 
at place where  v  =  0 at  t =  b/32  and landing  time 
at t = b/16.

a)f(1) --- 2/9 and  f(1) = 1/3,  so y= -(2/9)(x  - 1)+ 1/3 = (-2x + 5)/9 

b) f(a) = 2a2 + 5a + 4 and  f'(a) = 4a + 5, so

y= (4a+5)(  -a)+2a2+5a+ 4= (4a+ 5)x -2a2+4


- c)f(O) - 1 and f'(O) = 0,- so y = 0(x-0)+  1,or y =  1.

10-5 Method  1. y(s)=  2(x - 1),  so  the  tangent  line  through  (a,1 + (a- 1)2)  is 

y  =  2(a - 1)(x  - a) +1+ 

(a - 1)2 

In  order  to see  if  the  origin  is  on  this  line,  plug  in x  =  0  and  y  =  0,  to  get  the  following 
equation  for  a. 

0 = 2(a  - 1)(-a) + 1+  (a - 1)2 =  -2a=2 +2a+1+a  2  -2a  +  1= -a  2  + 2 

Therefore  a =  ±4V  and  the  two  tangent  lines  through  the  origin  are 
y=  2(2 - 1)x  and  y = -2(V+  1)x 

(Because  these  are  lines  throught  the  origin,  the constant  terms must  cancel:  this is  a good 
check  of  your  algebra!)  • 
Method  2.  Seek  tangent  lines  of  the  form  y  =  mx.  Suppose  that  y  =  mx  meets 
y  =.1  + (x - 1)2 ,  at  x  =  a,  then  ma  =  1 + (a  - 1)2.  In  addition  we  want  the  slope 
y/(a) =  2(a  - 1) to  be  equal  to m,  so m = 2(a - 1).  Substituting  for  m we  find 

2(a-1)a=  1+(a- 1)2 

This  is  the  same  equation  as  in  method  1:  a2  - 2  0,so  a =

make  f'(x) continuous,  we  want  a = 2. 
Combining  this  with  the  condition  a +  b=1  from  part  (a),  we  get  finally  b =  -1,  a = 2.

1D-6  a)  f(0) = 02  +44  0+1 =  1. Match  the  function  values:

Next match the sldpes: 

f'(O+)  =  lim 2z+ 4= 4

and  f'(O-)  =  a. Therefore,  a = 4,  since f'(0)  exists. 
b) 

f(1)  =  12 +41+1 =6 and  f(1-)=limax+b=a+b 

Therefore  continuity  implies  a +  b = 6.  The  slope  from  the  right is 

f'(1+) =  lim 2x + 4 = 6 

Therefore,  this  must  equal  the  slope  from  the  left,  which  is a. Thus,  a = 6  and  b= 0. 

1D-7


f(1)= cl  2 +4-1+1=  c+5 and  f(-)= limaz+b=a+b 

Therefore,  by  continuity,  c + 5 =  a +  b.Next, match the slopes  from  left  and  right: 

f'(1+  )  = lim 2cx.+ 4 = 2c + 4  and  f '(1-) =  lim a = a

Therefore,  b = 8 and  a can  have any  value.

1F-4  (1/3)x  2/3  +  (1/3)y- 2/ 3y' = 0  implies 

y'  =  _--
Put  u =  1 - x1/3.  Then  y  = u3 ,  and  the  chain  rule  implies 
d= 3u2d  = 3(1  - 1/3) 2(-(1/3)X-2/3)  = ,- 2/3 (1 - 1/3)2 

2 /3y2/3 

The  chain  rule  answer  is  the  same  as  the  one  using  implicit  differentiation  because 
y  =  (1 - 2/  3)3  =,  y2/3  =  (1 - X1/  3 )2 

1F-5  Implicit  differentiation  gives  cos x  +  y' cos y  =  0.  Horizontal  slope  means  y'  =  0, 
so  that  cos x  =  0.  These  are  the  points  x  =  7/2 +  k 7r  for  every  integer  k.  Recall  that 
sin(r/2  +  kr) =  (-1)k  ,  i.e.,  1  if  k  is  even  and  -1  if  k  is  odd.  Thus  at  x  =  ir/2  +  kir, 
±1  +  siny  =  1/2,  or  sin y  =  :F1  +  1/2.  But  sin y  =  3/2  has  no  solution,  so  the  only 
solutions  are when  k  is  even  and  in  that  case  siny  =  -1  +  1/2,  so  that  y  =  -7r/6  + 2nr or 
y  =  77r/6 +  2nr.  In  all  there  are  two  grids  of  points  at  the  vertices  of  squares  of  side  2r, 
namely  the  points 

(r/2  +  2kr, -7r/6  + 2nr)  and  (r/2  +  2kr, 77r/6 +  2nr); 
k,  n any  integers. 
1F-6  Following  the  hint,  let  z  =  -x.  If  f  is  even,  then  f(x)  =  f(z)  Differentiating  and 
using the  chain  rule: 

f'(x) = .f'(z)(dz/dx) = -f'(z)  because  dz/dx  =  -1 
But  this  means  that  f' is  odd.  Similarly,  if  g  is  odd,  then  g(x =  -g(z).  Differentiating  and 
using  the  chain  rule: 

g'(x) =  -g'(z)(dz/dx)  = g'(z)  because  dz/dx  =  -1

I = C/502  -•  C =/ 502  -

I=  I1502 /r 2 

This  shows  that  when  r  =  100,  we  have  I  = 11502/1002  6- 1/4.  It  follows  that 

10 logo (1/Io)  = 10 logo(I1  /41o)  =  10 loglo(I /Io) - 10 log1 o 4  ;  130  - 6.0  ;  124 

The  sound  at  10.0  meters  is  124 decibels. 
The sound at 1 km has  1/100 the intensity of the sound  at 100 meters,  because  100m/lkm =

101ogo(1/100)  = 10(-2)  =.-20

Similarly, differentiating  cosine  twice  switches  from  sine  and then  back  to  cosine  with  only 
one  sign  change,  so 

(cos(kx)"  =  -k2  cos(kx) 

Therefore, 

sin(kz)"  + k2 sin(kz)  =  0  and  cos(kx)"  + k 2 cos(ks)  = 0 
Since  we  are assuming  k >  0,  k =  .

(sin(kx  +  4)"  =  (k cos(kx  + 4))'  =  -k 2 sin(kx  +  4) 

Therefore,  if a = k2 , 

(sin(kx +  c)"  +  a sin(kx +  q)  =  0 

d)  The  sum  formula  for  the  sine function  says 

sin(kx +  4)  =  sin(kx) cos(o)  + cos(kx)  sin(4) 

In  other  words 

sin(kx  +  ) = cl  sin(kx)  +  c2 cos(kx)

1J-4  a)  The  Pythagorean  theorem  implies  that

to  assume  that  these  numbers  are  defined,  in  other  words  that  a +  b $  0.  Then  the  linear

2A-16  a) The  law  of  cosines  says  that  for  a triangle  with  sides  a, b, and  c,  with  0  opposite 
the  side  of length  c, 

c0  = a2  + b2 - 2ab cos 0 
Apply  it  to  one  of  the  n  triangles  with  vertex  at  the  origin:  a =  b =  1  and  0 =  2ir/n.  So 
the  formula  is 

S=c  ...  2- 2cos(27r/n) 

b)  The  perimeter  is  n/2 - 2cos(2ir/n).  The  quadratic  approximation  to cos0  near  0 
is

Therefore,  as  n -+ oo  and  0 =  21r/n -

2B-3  a) y'  = 3z2  + 2az+  b. The roots of the quadratic  polynomial  are distinct  real numbers 
if the discriminant  is  positive.  (The  discriminantis  defined  as  the number  under the  square 
root  in  the  quadratic  formula.)  Therefore  there  are  distinct  real  roots  if and  only  if 

(2a)2  - 4(3)b  >  0,  or 

a2  - 3b  >  0. 

From the  picture,  since  y  -4  oo  as  z  -+ oo  and y  - '-oo as 
z  -+4-oo,  the  larger  root  of  3z 2  +  2az  +  b =  0  (with  the 
plus  sign  in  the  quadratic  formula)  must be  the  local  min, 
and  the  smaller  root  must  be the  local  max. 
b)  y"  = 6x  + 2a,  so  the  inflection  point  is  at  -a/3.  Therefore  the condition  y'  <  0  at 
the  inflection  point  is 

Since y <<-I  when x <<-1 
andy >>  1when x >>  ,  the 
local max. is to the  left of the local min. 

y'(-a/3) = 3(-a/3) 2 +  2a(-a/3)+  b=  -a  2/3  +  b < 0, 

which  is  the  same  as 

a 2  - 3b  >  0. 

If y'  <  0  at  some  point  so,  then  the  function  is  decreasing  at  that point.  But  y  -+ oo  as 
-+ oo,  so  there  must  be  a local  minimum  at  a point  z  >  x0
o.  Similarly,  since  y -+  -oo 
as
-oo,  there must  be  a local  maximum  at a  point  z  <  zo. 
Comment:  We  evaluate  y'  at  the  inflection  point  of  y  (z  =  -a/3)  since  we  are  trying 
to  decide  (cf.  part  (b))  whether  y'  is  ever  negative.  To  do  this,  we  find  the  minimum  of  y' 
(which  occurs  where  y"  =  0).

2C-1  The  base of the  box has sidelength  12 - 2z  and  the

At  the  endpoints  z  =  0  and  z  = 6, the  volume  is  0,  so 
tlIe  maximum  must  occur  in between  at  a critical  point. 
V'  =  (12  - 2x)2  +  z(2)(12  - 2z)(-2)  =  (12  - 2x)(12 - 2x'- 4x)  =  (12  - 2z)(12  - 6x). 
It  follows  that  V'  =  0.when  z  =  6  or  x  =  2.  At  the  endpoints  x  = 0  and  x  =  6  the  volume 
is 0,  so  the  maximum  occurs  when  z  =  2.

2C-3  We  have  y  =  (a - x)/2,  so  xy  =  z(a  - z)/2.  At  the  endpoints  z  =  0  and  x  =  a, the

The  critical  point  z =  18  (3/2  ft.)  corresponds  to  the  length  y  =  36  (3  ft.),  giving  therefore 
a volume  of  (3/2)2(3)  = 27/4  =  6.75  cubic  feet. 
The  endpoints  are  z  =  0,  which  gives  zero  volume,  and  when  z  =  y,  i.e.,  z  =  9/5  feet, 
which  gives  a  volume  of  (9/5)8  cubic  feet,  which.is  less  than  6  cubic  feet.  So  the  critical 
point  gives  the  maximum  volume. 

2C-5  We  let  r  =  radius  of  bottom  and  h  =  height,  then  the  volumne  is 
V  =  irr2 h, and  the  area  is  A  =  Irr 2  +  2irrh.

Checking  the  endpoints,  at  one  h  =  0  and  V  =  0;  at  the  other,  lim  V  = 0  (using  the
Sr-+-0+ 
expression  above  for  V  in  terms  of r); thus  the  critical  point must  occur  at  a maximum. 
(Another  way  to  do  this  .problem  is  to  use  implicit  differentiation  with  respect  to  r. 
Briefly,  since  A  is  fixed,  dA/dr = 0,  and  therefore

A  = 2a/r2  - a2 .

At the  "ends"  zero  price p =  0,  and  no  passengers  p =  (5/2)180  = 450,  the  revenue  is  zero.

2Wz ,  which  implies  z  - 0  or  5z  2  =  1.  In other 
words,  z =:El//.  Now  one  can  check  that  if zl =  1/V  , then  z2  =  -1/V5,  zs =  +1/5, 
etc.

c)  Answers:  If  zx  <  -1/V3,  then  z, 
If  zi  >  I/Vr.,  then  n,-+  1.  If 
-1/V5 < z. <  1/v, 
then  zn -+ 0.  This  can be  found  experimentally,  numerically.  For  a 
complete  analysis  and  proof  one  needs  the methods  of  an  upper  level  course  like  18.100. 

2F-6  a)  To  simplify  this  problem  to  its  essence,  let  V  =  i. 
(We  are  looking  for  ratio  r/h 
and  this  will  be  the  same  no matter  what  value  we  pick  for  V.)  Thus  r 2h = 1 and 

Minimize  B  = A/ir instead. 
B = r2 + 2 r -1 

N== B' = 2r - 2r- 2 

A  =  irr 2  +  27r/r 

and  B' = 0 implies  r = 1.  Endpoints:  B  -+oo as r  -+ 0  and as r -+oo, so we have  found 
the minimum  at  r = 1.  (The  constraint  r2 h = 1 shows  that  this minimum  is  achieved  when 
r  =  h  =  1. As  a doublecheck,  the fact  that the  minimum  area is  achieved  for  r/h =  1 follows 
from  A e-isee part  (b).)

extra  glass  are approximately 

.37 < r/h <  2.5 

b) The  connection  with  Problem  2C-5  is  that  the minimum  area  r = h  is  not  entirely 
obvious, and  not just because  we  are dealing  with glass  beakers  instead  of tin cans.  In E10/5 
the  area is fixed whereas here the volume  is held fixed.  But  because one needs  a larger surface 
area  to  hold  a  larger  volume,  maximizing  volume  with  fixed  area  is  the  same  problem  as 
minimizing  surface  area with  fixed  volume.  This  is an  important  so-called  duality  principle 
often used  in  optimization  problems.  In Problem  20-5  the  answer  was  r  = h,  which  is  the 
proportion  with  minimum  surface  area  as  confirmed  in part  (a). 

S. SOLUTIONS  TO  18.01  EXERCISES 

2F-7  Minimize  the  distance  squared,  z 2 + y2 .  The  critical  points  satisfy 

2x  + 2yy'  =  0 

The  constraint  y  =  cos z  implies  y'  = - sin z.  Therefore, 

0 =  x  + yy'=  z  - coszsinz 

There  is  one  obvious  solution  z  =  0. The  reason  why  this  problem  is  in this  section  is  that 
one  needs  the  tools of inequalities  to make  sure that  there  are  no  other  solutions.  Indeed,  if 

f(z)  = z - cosx sinz,  then  f'(x) = 1 -cos  2 z  +sin  2 z  = 2sin2 x  >  0 

Furthermore,  f'(z)0 is strictly  positive  except  at  the  points  z =  kr,  so  f  is increasing  and 
crosses  zero  exactly  once. 
There  is  only  one  critical  point  and  the  distance  tends  to  infinity  at  the  endpoints  z  -x 
foo, so  this  point  is  the minimum.  The  point  on  the  graph  closest  to  the  origin  is  (0,  1). 

Alternative  method:  To  show that  (0, 1) is  closest  it suffices  to  show  that for  -1  < z  < 0 
and  0<z<  1, 

2  <  cos X 
/i-
Squaring gives  1 - z2  < cos 2 z.  This  can  be  proved  using  the  principles  of  problems  6 and 
7. The  derivative  of cos2 z - (1- z 2) is twice  the  function  f  above,  so  the methods  are  very 
similar.

From  the graph,  it  is  clear  you  should  get  two  values  for  c.  (The 
axes  are not  drawn  to  the  same  scale.) 

2G-2  a)  f () = f(a)+ f'(c)(z - a) ; Take a= 0;  f ()  = sinz,  f'()  = cos

f(z)=0+cosc.z

Thus the  inequality  is valid  for  0  < z  <_ 2r; since  the  function  is  periodic,  it  is  also  valid 
for  all  z >  0.

2G-3.  Let  s(t)  =  distance;  then  average  velocity  =  slope of  chord  = 

= 66. 

Therefore,  by MVT,  there is  some  time  t =  c  such that  s'(c) =  66  >  65. 
(An  application  of the  mean-value  theorem  to traffic  enforcement...) 

2G-4  According to Rolle's Theorem  (Thm.1  p.800:  an important  special case  of the M.V.T, 
and  a  step in its  proof),  between  two  roots  of p(z)  lies  at least  one  root  of p'(x).  Therefore, 
between  the n  roots  al,...  , an  of p(z),  lie  at  least  n - 1 roots  of p'(z). 
There  are  no more  than  n - 1 roots,  since  degree  of p'(z) = n - 1; thus p'(z) has  exactly 
n  - 1 roots. 

2G-5  Assume  f(z)  = 0  at  a,b, c. 
By Rolle's theorem  (as in MVT-4),  there are two  points qi,  q2 where  f'(qi) =  0, f'(q2) = 0. 
By  Rolle's  theorem  again,  applied  to  q,  and  .q2 and  f'(z),  there  is  a  point  p  where 
f"(p) = 0.  Since p  is  between  qj  and  q2 ,it is  also  between  a  and  c. 
2G-6  a)  Given  two  points  zi such  that  a < zl < z2 < b,we  have 

f'(z2) =  f(ZX)  +  f'(c)(Z2  - Xz),  where  zl  < c <  z 2. 

Since  f'(x)  >  0  on  [a,b],  f'(c)  >  0;  also  z2  - zl  >  0.  Therefore  f(z 2 )  >  f(xi),  which 
shows  f(z)  is  increasing. 
b)  We have  f  ()  = f(a) +  f'(c)(z - a) where  a  <  c <  z. 
Since  f'(c) =  0,  f(z) =  f(a) for  a <  x  <  b, which  shows  f(s)  is  constant  on  [a, b].

Thus,  y  =  11/2  + 3v'.

(1/3) ln(3y  + 2 ) =  x  + c

Therefore,  at  x =  8,


(1/3)  ln(3y +  2)  =  8 +.(1/3)1n2  =>  ln(3y  +  2) = 24  +  ln2  4

3F-3  a)  Answers:  y(1/ 2)= 2,  y(-1)  =  1/2,  y(1) is uildefined. 

y-2ddy= dz =  -y-1 =  s + c 

y(0)= 1  =  -1=  0+c  =*  c=-1

1Y=-z


The  values  are  y(1/2)  = 2,  y(-1)  =  -1/2  and  y  is  undefined  at z  =  1. 
b)  Although  the  formula  for  y makes  sense  at  z  = 3/2,  (y(3/2)  =  1/(1  - 3/2)  =  -2),
it is  not  consistent  with  the  rate  of  change  interpretation  of the  differential  equation.  The 
function  is  defined,  continuous  and  differentiable  for  -oo  <  z  <  1.  But  at  z  =  1,y and 
dy/dx are  undefined.  Since  y  =  1/(1  - z)  is  the  only  solution  to the  differential  equation 
in  the  interval  (0,  1) that  satisfies  the  initial  condition  y(0) =  1, it  is  impossible  to define  a 
function  that has  the initial  condition  y(0) = 1 and  also  satisfies  the differential  equation  in 
any  longer  interval  containing  z  =  1. 
To  ask what  happens  to  y after  z  =  1,  say  at  z  = 3/2,  is  something  like  asking  what 
happened  to  a  rocket  ship  after  it  fell  into  a  black  hole.  There  is  no  obvious  reason  why 
one has  to  choose  the  formula  y =  1/(1.- z)  after  the  "explosion."  For  example,  one  could 
define y = 1/(2  - z) for  1 < z < 2.  In  fact,  any  formula  y =.1/(c - z)  for  c>  1 satisfies  the 
differential  equation  at every  point  z > 1. 

3F-4  a) If the surrounding  air  is cooler  (Te - T <  0),  then the object  will  cool,  so dT/dt < 0. 
Thus  k >  0. 
b)  Separate  variables  and  integrate.

Exponentiating,

T - Te  =  -ece  -kt  = Ae-kt 
The  initial  condition  T(0) =  To implies  A  =  To - T,.  Thus 

T = Te + (To  - T,)e- kt

T - T, = (To- T,)e -kt 
The  data  are  To  = 680,  T,= 40  and  T(8)  = 200.  Therefore,

To  solve  the  two equations  on the right  above simultaneously  for  t, it is  easiest just to divide

that  the  square  root  must  have  the  opposite  sign  from  1:  z  =  1 - Vy  and  x =  -1  +  V~ .

if P is  above  thex-axis,  sin0 >  0,OPI =  OQ  - IQRI,  or  r = a - asin0;

if P  is  below  the  z-axis,  sin8  <  0,  OPI  =  IOQJ  +  IQRI,  or  r = a +  al sinel  =  a - asin8.

Thus  the  equation  is  r  =  a(1  - sin 0).

IPQI2 = r2 + a2  - 2ar cos(r - 0) = r2  + a2  + 2arcos

One  gets  the  same  answer  by  using  the  binomial  formula;  this  is  the  way  to  remember  the

(We  could use either  R,(z)  or  RE(z),  since  the above  polynomial  is  both Ts(z)  and T6s(),
but  R6(z)  gives  a smaller  error  estimation  if IzI  < 1,  since  it  contains  a higher  power  of z.)

Therefore  we want n = 7,  i.e.,  we should  use the Taylor polynomial of degree  7; calculation 
gives  e  ,1 + 1 + 1/2 +  1/6 +  1/24 +  1/120 + 1/720 +  1/5040.=  2.71825...,  which  is  indeed

So the  answer  is  no,  if  IxI <  .5.  (If  the  interval  is shrunk  to  IzI  <  .3,  the  answer  will be yes,
since  (.3)4/24  <  .001.)
