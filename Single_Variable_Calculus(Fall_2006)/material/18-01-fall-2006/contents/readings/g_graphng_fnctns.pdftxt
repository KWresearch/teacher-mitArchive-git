G.  GRAPHING  FUNCTIONS 

To get  a  quick  insight  into  how  the  graph of  a  function  looks,  it  is  very  helpful  to know 
how  certain  simple  operations  on  the  graph  are  related  to  the way  the  function  expression 
looks.  We  consider  these  here. 

1.  Right-left  translation. 
Let  c >  0.  Start with  the  graph  of some  function  f(x).  Keep  the  x-axis  and  y-amis  fixed, 
but move  the graph  c units  to the  right, or c units  to  the left.  (See  the pictures  below.)  You 
get  the graphs  of two  new  functions: 

(1)  Moving the  f(x)  graph c  units to  the 

(x  - c)
right 
S left 
f (X + c) 
If  f(x)  is given  by  a  formula  in x,  then  f(x  - c)  is  the function  obtained  by  replacing  x by 
x  - c  wherever  it  occurs  in the  formula.  For  instance, 
2 -- z,  byalgebra. 
) 2+(X-) 
f() 
(x-
=(--)= 

gives  the  graph  of 

Example  1.  Sketch  the  graph  of f(s)  = x2  - 2x  +  1. 
Solution.  By  algebra,  f(x) =  (X - 1)2.  Therefore  by  (1),  its  graph  is 
the one obtained  by moving  the graph of x2  one unit  to the right,  as shown. 
The  result  is  a  parabola  touching  the x-axis  at  x = 1. 

To see  the reason  for the  rule  (1),  suppose  the graph  of f(z)  is moved  c units  to the  right: 
it  becomes  then  the  graph  of  a  new  function  g(x),  whose  relation  to  f(s)  is  described  by 
(see  the picture): 

value  of g()  at  zo  = 

value  off(z)  at  o - c 

f(zo-c). 

This  shows that  g(z)  =  f(x  - c). 
The  reasoning  is similar  if the 
graph  is  translated  c  units  to  the  left.  Try  giving  the  argument 
yourself while  referring  to  the  picture.

The  effect  of up-down  translation  of the  graph  is  much  simpler  to  see.  If c >  0, 
(2)  Moving  the  f (x)graph c units 
f(T) +
gives  the graph  of 
-c 
f (x)-- c 
since  for  example  moving  the  graph  up  by  c  units  has  the  effect  of adding  c  units to  each 
function  value,  and  therefore  gives  us  the  graph of the  function  f(s) + c 

down

Example  3.  Sketch  the  curve y  =  z2  + 4x + 1. 
Solution  We  "complete  the  square": 
2+4z+  =  (z2 +4z+4)-3  =  (z+2)2 -3, 
so we  move  the graph  of  z2  to  the  left  2  units,  then  3  units  down, 
nettinethe  granh shown. 

2.  Changing  scale:  _stretching  and  shrinking. 
Let  c >  1. To stretch the  z-axis by  the  factor  c means  to move the  point  1 to the position 
formerly occupied  by  c, and in general,  the point  so to the position formerly occupied  by c0o. 
Similarly,  to shrink  the z-axis  by  the  factor  c means  to move  so  to the  position  previously 
taken  by zo/c.  What  happens  to the  graph  of f(z)  when  we  stretch or  shrink  the  z-axis? 
{f(z/c) 
Stretching 	
the  -ais by  c changes  the  graph  of f(z)  into that of 
f(c)

The picture explains  this  rule;  it illustrates  stretching by  the factor 
fr 
c >  1. The  new  function  has  the  same  value  at  so  that  f(z)  has 
at  zo/c,  so  that it  is  given  by  the  rule zo  -+ f(zo/c),  which means 
that  it  is the  function  f(z/c). 
- o 
/e 
If the  y-axis  is  stretched  by  the  factor  c >  1, each y-value  is multiplied  by  c, so  the  new 
graph  is  that of the function  cf(z):

Solution.  Start with  the graph  of  1/z, move  it 1lunit  to the 
right  to get  the  graph  of  1/(z  - 1),  then  shrink  the x-axis  by  the 
factor  2  to get  the graph  of the  given  function.  See  the picture. 

3.  Reflecting  in  the  z- and  V-axes:  even  and  odd  functions. 
To  reflect  the graph  of f(z) in the  y-axis, just  flip the  plane  over  around 
the y-axis.  This carries the point  (z, y)  into the point  (-z,y),  and the graph 
of  f(z)  into  the graph  of  f(-z).  Namely,  the  new  function  has  the  same 
y-value  at  zo  as  f(s)  has  at  -zo,  so  it  is given  by  the  rule  so  -+  f(-zo) 
and  is  the  function  f(-z). 
)  an  the 
Similarly,  reflecting  the si-plane  in the  x-axis  carries  (z, y) to the  point  (Z,-y)  and  the 
graph of  f(z)  gets  carried  into that  of -f(s). 
Finally,  relecting  first  in  the  y-axis  and  then  in  the  x-axis  carries  the

point  (z,y)  into  the  point  (-z, -y).  This  is  called  a  reflection through

the  origin.  The  graph  of  f(z)  gets  carried  into  the  graph  of  -f(-z),  by

combining  the above  two results.  Summarizing:

Of  importance  are  those  functions  f(t) whose  graphs, are  symmetric  with  respect  to  the 
y-axis  -
that  is,  reflection  in the  y-axis  doesn't change  the graph;  such  functions  are  called 
even.  Funrctions  whose  graphs  are  symmetric  with  respect  to  the  origin  are  called  odd.  In

definition of  odd function 

Example  5.  Show  thit  a polynomial  with  only  even  powers,  like  z4  - 2s2  +  7,  is  an 
even function,  and  a polynomial with  only  odd powers,  like 35s - s  + 2z,  is  an odd  function 
this,  by  the  way,  explains  the  terminology  "even"  and  uodd"  used  for  functions..

Solution.  We  have  to  show  (6)  and  (7)  hold  for polynomials  with  respectively  only even 
or  odd  powers,  but  this follows  immediately  from the  fact  that  for  any  non-negative  integer

The following  easily  proved rules predict  the odd-  or even-ness  of the product  or quotient 
of two  odd or  even  functions: 
(8) 
even- even  =  even 
even/even  = even 
(9) 

odd. even  = odd 
odd/even  = odd 

odd  odd =  even 
odd/odd = even 

Example  6. 
(3 + x4)1/2(X  - s) 

is of the  form  odd/even, therefore  it is  odd; 
has  the  form  even  odd, so  it is odd. 

4.  The  trigonometric  functions. 
...  e  trigonometric  functions  offer  further  illustrations  of  the  ideas  about  translation, 
change  of scale, and symmetry  that we have  been discussing.  Your book reviews  the standard 
facts about  them  in  section  9.1,  which  you  should  refer  to as  needed. 
The  graphs  of sinx  and  cos  are  crudely  sketched  below.  (In  calculus,  the  variable  s  is 
always to be in radians;  review radian measure  in section  9.1  if you have  forgotten it. Briefly, 
there  are  2r radians  in  a  3600  angle,  so that for  example  a  right  angle  is  r/2  radians.) 
As  the  graphs suggest  and  the unit  circle  picture shows, 
sin(-s)  =  -sin 
cos(-s) = cos 	
(10) 
(even function) 

(odd  function). 

From  the standard  triangle  at the  right,  one  sees  that 

L 

cos(7r/2 - x) "= sinz, 

and  since  cos x  is an  even  function,  this  shows  thi 

(11.) 

cos(x - r/2)  =  sinx. 

From (11),  we see  that moving the graph 
of cosax  to  the  right  by  r/2 units turns  it 
into the graph  of sin z.  (See  picture.) 

The  trigonometric function 

cos X 
(12) 
is  also  important;  its  graph  is  sketched  at  the  right.  It  is  an  odd 
function,  by  (9)  and  (10),  since  it  has  the  form  odd/even.

Aix-important  property  of  the trigonometric  functions  is  that  they  repeat  their  values: 
(13) 
sin(x  +  27)  =  sinx, 
. 
cos(r  +  2w)  =  cos 
This  is  so because x  + 2wr and  x represent  in  radians  the  same  angle. 
From  the  graphical  point  of view,  equations  (13)  say  that  if  we  move  the  graph  of  sin 
or  cosax  to the  left  by  2wr units,  it will  coincide  with  itself. 
From the function  viewpoint,  equations  (13)  say that sin x and cos x are periodicfunctions, 
with  period  2r. In  general,  let  c >  0;  we  say  that  f(x) is  periodic,  with  period  c,  if 
f(x +  c)  =  f  () 
for  all x,  and

(14) 
(14') 
c 
is  the  smallest  positive  number  for  which  (14)  is  true. 

By  rule  (1),  the  graph  of a  periodic  function  having  period  c  coincides  with  itself when  it  is 
translated  c units  to  the left.  If we  replace x  by x- c in  (14),  we  see  that  the graph  will  also 
coincide  with  itself  if it  is moved  to  the  right  by c units.  But  beware:  if a  function  is  made 
by  combining  other  periodic  functions,  you cannot  always  predict  the  period.  For example, 
although  it is  true  that 
tan(m + 2r) = tanx 
cos 2(x + 2r)= cos 2x , 
and 
the  period  of  both  tan x and  cosa2  is  actually  r,as  the  above  figure  suggests  for  tan x. 

The  general  sinusoidal  wave. 
The  graph. of sin i 
is  referred  to  as  a  "pure  wave"  or  a  "sinusoidal  oscillation".  We  now 
consider  to what  extent  we  can  change  how  it  looks  by  applying  the  geometric  operations 
of translation  and  scale  change  discussed- earlier. 
a) Start  with  sin i,  which, has period  2r and  oscillates  between  11. 
b) Stretch  the  y  axis  by  the  factor  A  >  0;  by.(4) this  gives  A sin x,which  has period  2r 
and  oscillates  between  ±A. 
c)  Shrink  the  x-axis  by  the  factor  k  >  0;  by  (3),  this gives  Asin ks,  which  has  period 
2r/k,since 
2x 
Asink(  +  2 )  =  Asin(kx + 2r)  A sin kx. 
Asmk(  +%-)  =

Notice  that  the  function  (15)  depends  on  three  constants:  k,A,  and  4.  We  call  such 
constants  parameters;their  value  determines  the  shape  and  position  of the  wave. 
By  using  trigonometric  identities,  it  is possible  to write  (15)  in  another  form, which  also 
has  three  parameters:

Proof of the equivalence  of  (15)  and  (16). 
(15)  =  (16):  from  the identity  sin(a  +  6) = sin acosf  + cosasinfl,  we  get 
Asin(k(x - ~)) = Asin(kx - kl)= AcosckIsin kC- Asin klcoskc 
which has  the  form  of (16),  with the  values  for  a and  b given  in  (17).

Example  7.  Find  the  period,  frequency,  amplitude,  and  phase  angle  of  the  wave 
represented  by  the  functions 
a)  2sin(3z  - r/6) 
Solution. 
a)  Writing  the  function  in  the  form  (15),  we  get  2sin3(x  - r/18),  which  shows  it  has 
period  2r/3, frequency  3,  amplitude  2,  and  phase  angle  r/18  (or  100). 

b)  -2  cos(2x  - r/2) 

b)  We  get  rid  of  the  - sign  by  using  - cos  =  cos(z  - 7r)  -
translating  the  cosine 
curve  wr  units  to  the  right  is  the  same  as  reflecting  it in  the  z-axis  (this  is  the  best  way  to 
remember  such  relations).  We  get  then 

-2  cos(2z  -

r/2)  =  2.cos(2z  - r/2 -

Example  8.  Sketch  the  curve  sin2z  + cos 2z. 
Solution  Transforming  it into  the form  (15),  we  can  get A and # by  using  (19): 

A= v; 

tan 20=-l  -

2  =135=  3r/4,  ~ 

=3Ir/8. 

So  the  function  is  also  representable  as  V2sin2(z  - 3r/8);  it  is  a wave  of amplitude  V2,9 
period  r, frequncy  2,  and phase  angle  37r/8,  and  can be  sketched using  this data. 

5.  Reflection  in the  diagonal  line;  inverse  functions. 
As  our  final  geometric  operation  on  graphs,  we  consider  the  effect  of 
in the  diagonal  line  p  = z. 
This  reflection  can  be  carried  out by  flipping  the  plane  over  about  t] 
diagonal  line.  Each  point  of the  diagonal  stays  fixed;  the  z-and y-axes  a 
interchanged.  The points  (a, b)  and  (b,a) are interchanged,  as  the  picts 
shnws_  because  the  two  rectangles  are interchanged. 

To  see  the effect  of this on the  function,  let's consider first  a simple  example. 

z  >  0  is  reflected  in  the  diagonal,  what 

If  the  graph  of f()  =  a,

function corresponds  to  the  reflected graph? 
Solution.  The original  curve  is  the graph  of the equation:  p=-z 2 , 
Reflection corresponds to interchanging  the two axes; thus the reflected  curve is the graph 
of the  equation: 
z =  y, 
y  2  0. 
To  find the  corresponding  function, we  have to express  p  explicitly  in terms  of z,  which 
z  _20  ;  the  restriction  on  a  follows 
we  do  by  solving  the  equation  for  y: 
y  =  V, 
because if  z  = y  and  y  2  0,  then  x2  0  also.

In this  scheme, the  equations  z  =  f (y)  and  y = g(z)  have the  same graph; all  that  has been 
done  is  to transform  the  equation  algebraically,  so  that  y  appears  as  an  explicit  function 
of z.  This  function  g(z)  is  called  the  inverse  function  to  f(z)  over  the  given  interval;  in 
general  it will  be necessary to restrict the domain of f(x)  to an interval, so that the reflected 
graph will  be the graph  of a function. 
To  summarize:  f(z)  and g(z)  are inverse  functions  if 
(i)  geometically, the graphs  of f(z)  and g(z)  are reflections  of each  other  in the diagonal 
line y  =z; 
(ii)  analytically,  = f  (y)  and y  = g(z)  are equivalent  equations,  either arising  from  the 
other by  solving  exIlicitly  for the  relevant  variable. 

Example  10.  Find  the inverse  function  to

(The domain  is  restricted  because  if y >  1, then  equation  (20)  implies  that 
x  >  0.)  The  right  side  of  (20)  is  the desired  inverse  function.  The  graphs

It often happens  that  in determining  the  inverse to  f(z),  the  equation 
(21) 
= f(y) 
cannot  be  solved  explicitly  in  terms  of previously known  functions.  In  that  case,  the  corre­
sponding  equation 
(22) 

, = 9() 
is  viewed  as  deftning the  inverse function  to  f(z),  when  taken with  (21)..  Once  again,  care 
must  be  taken  to restrict  the domain  of  f(z)  as necessary  to ensure  that  the relected  will 
indeed  define  a  function  g(z),  i.e.,  will  not  be  multiple-valued.  A  typical  example  is  the 
following. 

Example  11.  Find  the inverse  function  to sinx. 
Solution.  Considering  its graph, we see  that for the reflected graph to  define a function, 
we have to restrict the domain.  The most natural  choice is to consider the restricted function

The  domain  [-1,  1]  of sin - 1  
sinx  over  [--r/2, r/2]. 
As examples  of its  values,  sin - ' = r/2, since  sinir/2 = 1;  similarly, sin - '  1/2 =  r/6. 
Care  is  needed  in  handling  this  function.  For  example,  substituting  the  left  equation  in 
(24)  into  the  right  equation  says  that 
(25) 
sin-1(sin y) = y, 

it  is  the  same  as  the  range  of 

-r/2  < y 5 x/2 . 

It is common  to see  the restriction  on y  carelessly omitted,  since  the equation  by  itself seems 
"obvious".  But without  the  restriction,  it  is  not even  true;  for  example  if y  = i, 
sin - 1(sin 7r)  =  0.
