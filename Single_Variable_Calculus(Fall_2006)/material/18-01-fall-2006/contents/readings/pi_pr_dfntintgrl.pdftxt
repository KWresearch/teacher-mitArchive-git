PI. PROPERTIES  OF INTEGRALS 

For  ease  in  using the  definite  integral,  it  is  important  to know  its properties.  Your book 
lists the  following'  (on  the  right, we  give  a name  to the  property):

Property  (5) is  useful  in  estimating  definite  integrals  that cannot  be  calculated  exactly.

Example  1.  Show  that 

r-dz <  1.3. 

Solution.  We  estimate  the  integrand,  and then  use  (6).  We  have

Property  (6)  is used  to estimate the size  of an integral whose  integrand  is both positive and 
negative  (which  often makes  the direct use  of  (5)  awkward).  The idea behind  (6) is that  on 
the left  side,  the  intervals  on which  f(x)  is negative  give  a negative  value  to  the  integral, 
and  these  "negative"  areas  lower the overall value of the integral;  on the right  the integrand 
has  been  changed  so that it  is  always  positive, which  makes  the  integral  larger.

A final  property  tells  one  how  to  change  the variable  in a  definite  integral.  The.formula  is 
the most important  reason for including  dz in  the  notation  for  the  definite  integral,  that is, 
f (z),as  some  authors  do.

In words,  we  can  change  the variable  from u  to z,  provided  we

(i) express  du  in terms  of dx; 
There  are various  possible  hypotheses  on u(x);  the simplest  is  that it should  be differen­
tiable,  and  either  increasing  or decreasing  on  the  x-interval  [a, b].

For  the  limits,  we  have  u  =  0,1  corresponding  to  z =  0,  /4;  tan x  is.

Proof of  (7).  We  use the  First  Fundamental  Theorem3  and  the  chain  rule.  Let  F(u) be
