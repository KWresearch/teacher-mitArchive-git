IMPROPER INTEGRALS 

In  deciding  whether  an improper  integral  converges  or  diverges,  it  is  often  awkward  or 
impossible  to  try  to  decide  this  by  actually  carrying  out  the  integration,  i.e.,  finding  an 
antiderivative  explicitly.  For  example  both of these  two  improper  integrals  converge: 

daz 
0" 
z+3xs  +22 +  1' 
z 

and 

1 

but  there  is  no  explicit  antiderivative  for  the  second  integral,  and  finding  one  for  the  first 
would be a hairy exercise in partial fractions,  even  ifone were able to factor the denominator. 
Instead  of  explicit  integration,  therefore,  we  show  they  converge  by  using  estimation 
instead,  comparing  them with  simpler integrals  which  are known  to converge.  Thus,  for the 
first,

Since  the right hand integral  converges,  so  does the left,  which is  smaller  (but still positive). 
In  a similar  way, for the  second  integral,  we estimate

In  other  words,  if  the  area  under  g(z)  is  finite  and  .f(x)  lies  below  g(x) 
(but  still  over  the x-axis),  then  the  area under  f(z)  will be  finite also.  Or 
equivalently,  if the  area under  f(x)  is  infinite,  so  is the  area under  g(z). 
In using  the test,  the  lower  limit  of integration  is of no  importance,  since  if a < b, 
f (x) dx  + 
f (z) di, 

f()  dT =

As  another  example  of the  use of  the  comparison  test,  we  recall  one  used  to  illustrate  the 
Second  Fundamental  Theorem  (cf.  p. FT.3): 

e- Z  < e -
for  z  >  1, and  therefore 
e-"dz  converges. 
e- 2 dz  converges,  since 

(Here  we  use  (3)  above  to shift the  lower  limit  from  I to  0;  also  the  comparison  test  (1).) 
In  using  the  comparison  test,  we  have  to  have  some  standard  integrals  that  we  know 
converge or  diverge,  to use  for  comparison  purposes.  The most  useful  are: 
jd/" ds converges  if p >  1,diverges ifp  1; 
converges  ifa > 0.

It  is  important  to  notice  that  in  using  the  test,  you  must  make  the  inequality  go  in  the 
right direction,  which  means  you must  guess in  advance whether  the integral  will  converge

so  from  (4) we  guess  it  will  converge.  Unfortunately,  s-

Improper  integrals  of the  second  kind 
The  comparison  test  also  works  for  improper  integrals  of the  form 

f(x) dz,  where 

lim  f(z)  = oo, 

and 

f (x)d,  where 

lim  f ()  = oo. 

Sometimes  these  are called improper  integrals of the  second  kind 
-
the first kind being the  previous type of improper  integral, where 
b 
one  of the  limits  of integration  is  oo  or  -oo. 
For  improper  integrals  of the  second  kind,  useful  standard  comparison  integrals  are

which  converge  if  p  <  1,  diverge  if p  _  1  .  Note  that  this  is  just  the 
opposite  of  (4).  However,  it's easy  to  remember  which  is  which  if  you 
think  of  the  picture  at  the  right,  which  compares  the  graphs  for  p  <  1 
and  >  1.

Solution.  The. integrand becomes  infinite when  x  =  0  and  when  z  =  2,  but  2  is  of no 
importance,  since  it's not  in the  interval over which  we  are integrating.  In making our  guess 
as  to  convergence  or  divergence,  we  note  that

Where  is  (7)  valid  (if  at all)?  Crossmultiplying,  it  claims  that

or  squaring,  x <  2x - z 2,  or  X2 < . 

This  last  inequality  is true  if 0  <  z <  1, so we're safe,  since  this  is  the region  of integration. 
So  we  see  by  the  comparison  test  above  that  our  integral  converges  because  according  to 
f 1  dx
(6),  the  integral

converges. 

Remark.  It isn't customary  to  include  the  +  and  - symbols  in  a+  and  b- when  one 
writes  integrals of the second  kind.  We only  did it here  to point  out where  they  are improper,
and on which side.  It  doesn't appear  in the  solutions  to the  exercises  on  improper  integrals.
