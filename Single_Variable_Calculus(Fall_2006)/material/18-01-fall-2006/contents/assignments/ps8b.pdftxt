Part  II 

(17  points  +  5  extra) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  pts)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with  whom  you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 
1.	 (Lecs 34-36, 6 + 5 pts:  1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + (5 extra)) 
a)  Use  L’Hospital’s  rule  to  evaluate 

lim  x m e−x 
x→∞ 

� 
0 

∞ 

b) Use part (a) and limit comparison to show that the improper integral 
� 
for  n ≥ 0.  (Do  not  integrate  by  parts.) 
∞ 
x n e−x dx.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  ﬁnd  the  constant  cn  for  which 
0 

c)  Denote  A(n) = 

x n e−xdx converges 

(Explain  what  happens  at  the  inﬁnite  limit  using  part  (a).) 

A(n + 1) = cnA(n) 

1 

d)  Find  A(0)  and  deduce  from  part  (c)  the  formula  for  A(n),  n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. 
e) (optional; 5pts extra credit) Show that the improper integral representing A(−1/2) converges 
and  evaluate  it  using  a  change  of  variables. 
2.  (Review  problem  using  solids  and  surfaces  of  revolution;  9pts:  4  +  2  +  3) 
a)  Show  that  the  volume  V  of  the  solid  of  revolution  enclosed  on  the  top  by  a  spherical  cap  of 
� 
� 
radius  r  of  height  h  and  underneath  by  a  horizontal  plane  is 
h3 
V  = π  rh2  − 
3 

Draw  a  picture.  Doublecheck  this  answer  in  the  three  cases:  the  empty  set  (h  =  0);  the  half  ball 
(h = r);  the  whole  ball  (h = 2r).  We  will  always  assume  that  0 ≤ h ≤ 2r .  Why? 
b) Find  the  surface area of  the  spherical cap of radius r  and height h.  Doublecheck your answer 
by  evaluating  it  in  the  three  cases  h = 0,  h = r  and  h = 2r . 
c) We will  now  ﬁnd  the  shape  of  a  soap  bubble  sitting  on  a  table.  Suppose  that  the  bubble  is  a 
portion of a  sphere as above,  that  it  encloses a ﬁxed volume V ,  and  that  its  surface area  is as  small 
as possible  (area of  the  curved  surface, not counting  the ﬂat bottom =  table).  Find  the minimizing 
shape,  and  describe  it  geometrically.  (Hint:  ﬁnd  h/r .)
