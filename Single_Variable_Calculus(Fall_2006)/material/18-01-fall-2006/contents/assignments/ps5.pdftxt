Part  II 

(30  points  +  5  extra  credit) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not until due date; 3 pts) Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 

1.  (Lec  19,  6  pts:  3  +  3)  (+  5  extra  for  part  (c)) 
a)  Suppose  that  at  the  beginning  of  day  0,  some  time  last  summer,  the  temperature  in  Boston 
was  y(0) = 65◦  Fahrenheit  and  that  over  a  50-day  period,  the  temperature  increased  according  to 
the  rule  y � (t) = y(t)/100,  with  time  t measured  in  days.  Find  the  formula  for  y ,  and  draw  a  graph 
of  temperature  on  days  3  and  4,  3 ≤ t ≤ 5,  and  label with  the  correct  day  and  shade  in  the  regions 
whose  areas  represent  the  average  temperature  each  of  the  two  days.2 

1A  more  colorful  way  of  expressing  4B-6  is  in  terms  of  the  volume  of  a  tent,  as  in  the  textbook  problem  7.3/7. 
Unfortunately,  the  problem  is  ill-posed  and  can’t  be  done  without  pretending  that  the  cross-sections  are  triangles. 
In  real  life,  the  canvas  would  have  creases.  In  general,  the  shapes  formed  by  stretching  canvas  or  nylon  over  various 
�  b
arrays  of  tent  poles  are  quite  hard  to  compute. 
2The  continuous  average  of  a  function  is 
1 
f (x)dx 
b − a  a 
In  this  case  b − a = 1,  so  the  average  is  the  same  as  integral.  For  more,  see  Notes,  AV,  and  Lecture  23.

b)  The  number  of  cooling  degree  days  is  the  sum  for  each  day  of  the  diﬀerence  between  the 
average temperature for that day and 65◦ .  The number is used to estimate the demand for electricity 
for air conditioning.  Draw a  second graph of y  for  the whole 50 days and  shade  in  the  region whose 
area represents the total number of degree days.  Write a formula for this total area as the diﬀerence 
·
between 65 50 and a deﬁnite integral.  Evaluate the deﬁnite integral using the fundamental theorem 
of  calculus.  (Alternatively,  write  the  whole  quantity  as  an  integral  expressing  the  area  between 
curves  as  in  Lecture  21,  and  7.2.) 
c) (extra credit) Compute the deﬁnite integral in part (b) directly by evaluating a lower Riemann 
sum  and  taking  a  limit.  Follow  the  procedure  in  Problem  5,  PS4,  but  with  diﬀerent  scale  factors. 
This  rather  elaborate  calculation  shows  how  much  time  and  eﬀort  we  save  every  time  we  use  the 
� 
fundamental  theorem  and  the  change  of  variable  formula  in  integrals. 
2.  (Lec  20,  16  pts:  2 +  2 +  4 +  2 +  6) Consider  the  function  f (x) = 
cos(t2 )dt.  There  is  no 
0 
expression  for  f (x)  in  terms  of  standard  elementary  functions.  It  is  known  as  a  Fresnel  integral, 
along  with  the  corresponding  sine  integral. 
a) Draw  a  rough  sketch  of  cos(t2 ),  showing  the ﬁrst positive  and negative  zeros.  What does  the 
curve  look  like  at  t = 0?  Is  the  function  even  or  odd? 
b)  List  the  critical  points  of  f (x)  in  the  entire  range  −∞ < x < ∞.  Which  critical  points  are 
local maxima  and  which  ones  are  local  minima? 
c)  Sketch  the  graph  of  f  on  the  interval  −2  ≤  x  ≤  2,  with  labels  for  the  critical  points  and 
inﬂection  points.  (The  drawing  should  be  qualitatively  correct,  but  just  estimate  the  values  of  f 
at  the  labelled  points.) 
d)  Estimate  f (0.1)  to  six  decimal  places. 
� 
e)  Fresnel  integrals  are  sometimes  expressed  using  diﬀerent  scaling  of  the  variables. 
x 
i)  Let  g(x) = 
cos((π/2)u 2 )du.  Make  a  change  of  variables  to  show  that  f (x) = c1g(c2x)  for 
� 
0 
some  constants  c1  and  c2 .  Why  did  we  choose  the  factor  π/2? 
x  cos v

ii) Let h(x) = 
v  is  inﬁnite3  at  v = 0.) 
dv .  (This  integral  is  called  improper because  1/
v 
0 
Make  a  diﬀerent  change  of  variable  to  show  that  f (x) =  ch(x2 )  for  some  constant  c  (assume  that 
�  1 
x > 0). 
iii) Let k(x) = 
cos(xt2 )dt, x > 0.  Use  the  change of variable  z = xt2  and part  (ii)  to ﬁnd 
x 
0 
the  relationship  between  the  functions  k  and  f .  Hint:  Which  quantities  are  variable  and which  are 
constant?  (Not  assigned:  you  can  also  work  out  this  relationship  using  a  change  of  variables  like 
the  one  in  part  (i).) 
3.  (Lec 21, 5 pts:  2 + 3) 
a)  Do  7.3/22. 
b)  Find  the  volume  of  the  region  in  3-space  with  x > 0,  y > 0  and  z > 0  given  by 

√

x 

√

z 2/2 < x + y < z 

Hint:  First  ﬁnd  the  area  of  the  horizontal  cross-sections. 
3
Although  the  integrand  is  inﬁnite,  the  area  under  the  curve  is  ﬁnite.  The  function  h  is  continuous,  h(0) = 0,  but 
its  graph  has  inﬁnite  slope  at  x = 0.
