18.01  Problem  Set  1 

Due  Friday  9/15/06,  1:55  pm 

18.01/18.01A  Supplementary  Notes,  Exercises  and  Solutions  are  for  sale . This  is where  to 
ﬁnd the  exercises  labeled  1A,  1B,  etc.  You will  need these  for  the  ﬁrst  day’s  homework. 
Part  I  consists  of  exercises  given  in  the  Notes  and  solved  in  section  S  of  the  Notes.  It  will  be 
graded  quickly,  checking  that  all  is  there  and  the  solutions  not  copied. 
Part  II  consists  of  problems  for  which  solutions  are  not  given;  it  is  worth  more  points.  Some  of 
these  problems  are  longer multi-part  exercises  posed  here  because  they  do  not  ﬁt  conveniently  into 
an exam or short-answer  format.  See the guidelines below  for what collaboration  is acceptable, and 
follow  them. 
To  encourage  you  to  keep  up  with  the  lectures,  both  Part  I  and  Part  II  tell  you  for  each  problem 
on  which  day  you  will  have  the  needed  background  for  it.

Part  II 

(40  points) 

Directions  and  Rules:  Collaboration  on  problem  sets  is  encouraged,  but 
a) Attempt each part of each problem yourself.  Read each portion of  the problem before asking 
for  help.  If  you  don’t  understand  what  is  being  asked,  ask  for  help  interpreting  the  problem  and 
then make  an  honest  attempt  to  solve  it. 
b) Write  up  each  problem  independently.  On  both  Part  I  and  II  exercises  you  are  expected  to 
write  the  answer  in  your  own  words. 
c) Write  on  your  problem  set  whom  you  consulted  and  the  sources  you  used.  If  you 
fail  to  do  so,  you may  be  charged  with  plagiarism  and  sub ject  to  serious  penalties. 
d)  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters. 

0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  points) 
Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you collaborated and the resources 
you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  This  includes  visits  outside  recitation  to  your 
recitation  instructor.  If  you  don’t  know  a  name,  you  must  nevertheless  identify  the  person,  as  in, 
“tutor  in  Room  2-106,”  or  “the  student  next  to  me  in  recitation.”  Optional:  note  which  of  these 
people  or  resources,  if  any,  were  particularly  helpful  to  you. 
This “Problem 0” will be assigned with every problem  set.  Its purpose  is  to make  sure  that you 
acknowledge  (to  yourself  as  well  as  others)  what  kind  of  help  you  require  and  to  encourage  you  to 
pay  attention  to  how  you  learn  best  (with  a  tutor,  in  a  group,  alone).  It  will  help  us  by  letting  us 
know  what  resources  you  use. 

1.  (Wed,  3  pts)  Express  (x − 1)/(x + 1)  as  the  sum  of  an  even  and  an  odd  function.  (Simplify 
as  much  as  possible.) 
2.  (Thurs, 6 pts:  3 + 3) Sensitivity of measurement:  Suppose f  is a function of x.  If x = x0+Δx, 
then  we  deﬁne  Δf  =  f (x) − f (x0 )  and  Δf /Δx  measures  how  much  changes  in  x  aﬀect  the  value 
of  f . 
The  planet  Quirk  is  ﬂat.  GPS  satellites  hover  over  Quirk  at  an  altitude  of  20, 000  km  (unlike 
Earth  where  the  satellites  circle  twice  a  day).  See  how  accurately  you  can  estimate  the  distance  L 
from  the  point  directly  below  the  satellite  to  a  point  on  the  planet  surface  knowing  the  distance  h 
from  the  satellite  to  the  point  on  the  surface  in  two  cases.  (The  letter  h  is  for  hypotenuse.) 
a) Use a calculator to compute ΔL/Δh for h = h0 ±Δh = 25, 000±Δh, and Δh = 1,  10−1 ,  10−2 . 
Write  an  estimate  for  L  in  the  form 

|L − L0 | = |ΔL| ≤ C |Δh| 
choosing  the  simplest  round  number  C  that  works  for  all  three  cases. 
b) Do  the  same  for  h = 20, 001 ± Δh, Δh = 1,  10−1 ,  10−2 .  Is  the  value  of  L  estimated more  or 
less  accurately  than  in  part  (a)?  We  will  revisit  this  problem  more  systematically  using  calculus. 
3.  (Thurs,  4pts)  On  the  planet  Quirk,  a  cell  phone  tower  is  a  100-foot  pole  on  top  of  a  green 
mound  1000  feet  tall  whose  outline  is  described  by  the  parabolic  equation  y  =  1000 − x2 .  An  ant 
climbs  up  the  mound  starting  from  ground  level  (y  =  0).  At  what  height  y  does  the  ant  begin  to 
see  the  tower?

4.  (Thurs,  6  pts)  3.1/21  (parabolic  mirrors)

5.  (Thurs,  4pts:  2  +  2)

a)  A  water  cooler  is  leaking  so  that  its  volume  at  time  t  in  minutes  is  (10 − t)2/5  liters.  Find

the  average  rate  at  which  water  drains  during  the  ﬁrst  5 minutes. 
b)  At  what  rate  is  the  water  ﬂowing  out  5 minutes  after  the  tank  begins  to  drain. 
6.  Friday (8 pts:  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2) 2.5/19d (put  u = 1/x),  19f,  19g,  20c,  20g  (show 
work);  22a  (needs  a  calculator),  22b  (see  the  proof  on  page  73). 
7.  Tuesday  (6  pts:  2  +  4) 
a)  If u,  v  and w  are diﬀerentiable  functions, ﬁnd  the  formula  for  the derivative of  their product, 
D(uvw). 
b)  Generalize  your  work  in  part  (a)  by  guessing  the  formula  for  D(u1u2  · · · un )—the  derivative 
of  the  product  of  n  diﬀerentiable  functions. 
Then  prove  your  formula  by  mathematical  induction  (i.e.,  prove  its  truth  for  the  product  of 
n + 1  functions,  assuming  its  truth  for  the  product  of  n  functions).
