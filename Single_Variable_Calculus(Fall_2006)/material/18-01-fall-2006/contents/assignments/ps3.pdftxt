Part  II 

(31  points  +  8  extra  credit) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not until due date; 3 pts) Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 

1.  (Friday,  6pts:  3  +  3) 
a)  4.3/28 
(Use  as  variable  the  distance  x  from  the  foot  of  the  ladder  to  the  house.  Check 
endpoints.) 
b)  4.4/28 
2.  (Tuesday,  2pts)  Hypocycloid.  Show  that  every  tangent  line  to  the  curve  x 2/3  + y 2/3  = 1 
in  ﬁrst  quadrant  has  the  property  that  portion  of  the  line  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  has  length  1.  (Use 
implicit  diﬀerentiation;  this  is  the  same  as  problem  45  page  114  of  text.) 
3.  (Tuesday,  7pts:  3  +  3  +  1)  Sensitivity  of  measurement,  revisited. 
a)  Recall  that  in  problem  2,  PS1/Part  II,  L2  +  20, 0002  =  h2 .  Use  implicit  diﬀerentiation 
to  calculate  dL/dh.  Compare  the  linear  approximation  dL/dh  to  the  error  ΔL/Δh  computed  in 
examples  on  PS1.  Explain why ΔL/Δh ≤ dL/dh  if  the  derivative  is  evaluated  at  the  left  endpoint 
of  the  interval  of  uncertainty  (or,  in  other  words,  Δh >  0).  In  what  range  of  values  of  h  is  it  true 
|
| ≤ 2|
|
that  ΔL
Δh ?
b)  Suppose  that  the  Planet  Quirk  is  a  not  only  ﬂat,  but  one-dimensional  (a  straight  line). 
There  are  several  satellites  at  height  20, 000  kilometers  and  you  get  readings  saying  that  satellite  1 
is  directly  above  the  point  x1  ± 10−10  and  is  at  a  distance  h1  =  21, 000 ± 10−2  from  you,  satellite

2  is  directly  above  x2  ± 10−10  and  at  a  distance  h2  =  52, 000 ± 10−2 .  Where  are  you  and  to  what 
accuracy?  Hint:  Consider  separately  the  cases  x1  < x2  and  x2  > x1 . 
c) Express dL/dh in terms of the angle between the line of sight to the satellite and the horizontal 
from  the  person  on  the  ground.  (When  expressed  using  the  line-of-sight  angle,  the  formula  also 
works  for  a  curved  planet  like  Earth.) 
4.  (Tuesday,  5pts:  3  +  2  +  0)  More  sensitivity  of  measurement.  Consider  a  parabolic 
mirror  with  equation  y  = −1/4 + x2  and  focus  at  the  origin.  (See  Problem  Set  1.)  A  ray  of  light 
traveling down vertically along the line x = a hits the mirror at the point (a, b) where b = −1/4 + a2 
and  goes  to  the  origin  along  a  ray  at  angle  θ  measured  from  the  positive  x-axis. 
a)  Find  the  formula  for  tan θ  in  terms  of  a  and  b,  and  calculate  dθ/da  using  implicit  diﬀerenti­
ation.  (Express  your  answer  in  terms  of  a  and  θ .) 
b) If the telescope records a star at θ = −π/6 and the measurement  is accurate to 10−3  radians, 
use  part  (a)  to  give  an  estimate  as  to  the  location  of  the  star  in  the  variable  a. 
c)  (optional;  no  credit)  Solve  for  a  as  a  function  of  θ  alone  and  doublecheck  your  answers  to 
parts  (a)  and  (b). 
5.  (Thursday,  8  pts:  3  +  3  +  2) Newton’s  method. 
a) Compute  the  cube  root of 9  to 6  signiﬁcant ﬁgures using Newton’s method.  Give  the general 
formula,  and  list  numerical  values,  starting  with  x0  =  2.  At  what  iteration  k  does  the  method 
surpass  the  accuracy  of  your  calculator  or  computer?  (Display  your  answers  to  the  accuracy  of 
your  calculator  or  computer.) 
b)  For  each  step  xk ,  k  = 0, 1, . . .,  say  whether  the  value  is  i)  larger  or  smaller  than  91/3 ;  ii) 
larger  or  smaller  than  the  preceding  value  xk−1 .  Illustrate  on  the  graph  of  x3  − 9  why  this  is  so. 
c)  Find  a  quadratic  approximation  to  91/3 ,  and  estimate  the  diﬀerence  between  the  quadratic 
approximation  and  the  exact  answer.  (Hint:  To  get  a  reasonable  quadratic  approximation,  use 
9 = 8(1 + 1/8).) 
6.  (extra credit 8 pts:  3 + 2 + 2 + 1)  Hypocycloid,  again.  Here  we  derive  the  equation 
for  the  hypocycloid  of  Problem  2  from  the  sweeping  out  property  directly.  This  takes  quite  a  bit 
longer.  We  will  look  at  the  hypocycloid  from  yet  another  (easier)  point  of  view  later  on. 
Think of  the ﬁrst quadrant of  the xy -plane as  representing  the  region  to  the  right of a wall with 
the  ground as  the positive x-axis  and  the wall as  the positive  y -axis.  A unit  length  ladder  is placed 
vertically  against  the  wall.  The  bottom  of  the  ladder  is  at  x =  0  and  slides  to  the  right  along  the 
x-axis  until  the  ladder  is  horizontal.  At  the  same  time,  the  top  of  the  ladder  is  dragged  down  the 
y -axis  ending  at  the  origin  (0, 0).  We  are  going  to  describe  the  region  swept  out  by  this  motion, 
in  other  words,  the  blurry  region  formed  in  a  photograph  of  the motion  if  the  eye  of  the  camera  is 
open  the  whole  time. 
a)  Suppose  that  L1  is  the  line  segment  from  (0, y1 )  to  (x1 , 0)  and  L2  is  the  line  segment  from 
(0, y2 )  to  (x2 , 0).  Find  the  formula  for  the  point  of  intersection  (x3 , y3 )  of  the  two  line  segments. 
Don’t  expect  the  formula  to  be  simple:  It must  involve  all  four  parameters  x1 ,  x2 ,  y1 ,  and  y2 .  But 
simplify  as  much  as  possible! 
It’s  important  to  make  sure  you  have  the  right  formulas  before  proceeding  further.  You  can 
doublecheck  your  formulas  in  several  ways.  (This  is  optional.) 
i)  If  y2  = 0,  then  x3  = x1 . 

2 

ii) When the x’s and y ’s are interchanged the formulas should be the same.  What transformation 
of  the  plane  does  the  exchange  of  x  and  y  represent? 
iii)  It  is  impossible  to  ﬁnd  x3  and  y3  if  the  lines  are  parallel,  so  the  denominator  in  the  formula 
must  be  zero  when  L1  and  L2  have  the  same  slope. 
iv)  Rescaling  all  variables  by  a  factor  c  leaves  the  formula  unchanged,  so  the  numerator  of  the 
formula  for  x3  and  y3  should  have  degree  (in  all  variables)  one  greater  than  the  denominator. 
b) Write the equation  involving x2  and y2  that expresses the property that  ladder L2  has  length 
one.  We  will  suppose  that  L1  represents  the  ladder  at  a  ﬁxed  position,  and  L2  tends  to  L1 .  Thus 

Use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  (related  rates)  to  ﬁnd 

x2  = x1  + Δx;  y2  = y1  + Δy 

Δy
lim 
Δx 0  Δx→

(Express  the  limit  as  a  function  of  the  ﬁxed  values  x1  and  y1 .) 
c)  Substitute  x2  = x1  + Δx  and  y2  = y1  + Δy  into  the  formula  in  part  (a)  for  x3  and  use  part 
(b)  to  compute 

X  =  lim  x3  =  lim  x3 
x2→x1 
Δx 0→
Simplify  as  much  as  possible.  Deduce,  by  symmetry  alone,  the  formula  for 

Y  =  lim  y3 
x2→x1 

d) Show that X 2/3 + Y 2/3  = 1.  (The limit point (X, Y ) that you found in part (c) is expressed as 
a  function  of x1  and  y1 .  This  is  the  unique  point  of  the  ladder L1  that  is  also  part  of  the  boundary 
curve  of  the  region  swept  out  by  the  family  of  ladders.)
