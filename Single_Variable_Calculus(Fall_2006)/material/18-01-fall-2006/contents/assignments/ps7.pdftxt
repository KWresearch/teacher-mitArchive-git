Part  II 

(22  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not until due date; 3 pts) Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 

1.  (Lec  27,  4pts)  (from  PS6)  The  voltage  V  of  house  current  is  given  by 

V (t) = C sin(120πt) 

where  t  is  time,  in  seconds  and  C  is  a  constant  amplitude.  The  square  root  of  the  average  value 
of  V 2  over  one  period  of  V (t)  (or  cycle)  is  called  the  root-mean-square  voltage,  abbreviated  RMS. 
This  is  what  the  voltage  meter  on  a  house  records.  For  house  current,  ﬁnd  the  RMS  in  terms  of 
the  constant C .  (The  peak  voltage  delivered  to  the  house  is ±C .  The  units  of  V 2  are  square  volts; 
when  we  take  the  square  root  again  after  averaging,  the  units  become  volts  again.) 
2.  (Lec  27,  4pts)  The  solid  torus  is  the  ﬁgure  obtained  by  rotating  the  disk  (x − b)2  + y2  ≤ a2 
around  the  y -axis.  Find  its  volume  by  the  method  of  shells.  (Hint:  Substitute  for  x − b.  As  noted 
p.  229/11,  the  answer  happens  to  be  the  area  of  the  disk  multiplied  by  the  distance  travelled  by 
the  center  as  it  revolves.)

sec x dx  by  writing  sec x = 
a)  Derive  a  formula  for 
1 − sin2 x 
a  substitution  for  sin x  and  using  partial  fractions.  (Your  ﬁnal  answer  must  be  expressed  in  terms 
of  x.) 
b) Convert  the  formula  into  the more  familiar  one  by multiplying  the  fraction  in  the  answer  on 
√
both  top  and  bottom  by  1 + sin x.  (Note  that  (1/2) ln u =  ln 
u.) 
5.  (Lec 29, 3pts) Find the volume under the ﬁrst hump of the function y = cos x rotated around 
the  y -axis  by  the  method  of  shells.
