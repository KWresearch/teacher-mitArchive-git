***** Format *****
Students will need both the course textbook ([Amazon_logo] Simmons, George F.
Calculus with Analytic Geometry. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, October 1,
1996, ISBN: 9780070576421) and the course_reader (18.01/18.01A Supplementary
Notes, Exercises and Solutions; Jerison, D., and A. Mattuck. Calculus 1) to
complete the assigned problem sets. The course reader is where to find the
exercises labeled 1A, 1B, etc.
Problem sets have two parts, I and II
Part I consists of exercises given in the course reader and solved in section S
of the course reader. It will be graded quickly, checking that all is there and
the solutions not copied.
Part II consists of problems for which solutions are not given; it is worth
more points. Some of these problems are longer multi-part exercises posed here
because they do not fit conveniently into an exam or short-answer format. See
the guidelines below for what collaboration is acceptable, and follow them.
To encourage you to keep up with the lectures, both Part I and Part II tell you
for each problem on which class session day you will have the needed background
for it.
***** Homework Rules *****
Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but
   1. Attempt each part of each problem yourself. Read each portion of the
      problem before asking for help. If you don't understand what is being
      asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest
      attempt to solve it.
   2. Write up each problem independently. On both Part A and B exercises you
      are expected to write the answer in your own words.
   3. Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If
      you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to
      serious penalties.
   4. It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.
***** Key to Notation *****

1A-3 = Exercise 1A-3 in Section E (Exercises) of the Notes (solved in section
S)
2.4/13; 81/4 = in Simmons, respectively, section 2.4 Problem 13; page 81
Problem 4
