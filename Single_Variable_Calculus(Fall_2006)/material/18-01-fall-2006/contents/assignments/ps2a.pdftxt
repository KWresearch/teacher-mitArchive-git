18.01  Problem  Set  2A 

Due  Friday  9/29/06,  1:55  pm 

2A  is  the  ﬁrst  half  of  Problem  Set  2,  all  of  which  is  due  a  week  after  Exam  1  (the  second  half,  2B, 
will  be  issued  at  the  exam,  or  the  day  before).  Even  though  it  won’t  be  collected  until  later,  you 
should  do  2A  before  the  exam,  to  prepare  for  it. 

Part  I 

(15  points) 

Lecture  5.  Fri.  Sept.  15 
Implicit  diﬀerentiation;  inverse  functions  and  their  derivatives. 
Read:  3.5,  Notes  G  section  5,  9.5  (bottom  p.913  - 915) 
Work:  1F-3,5,8c;  1A-5b;  5A-1a,b,c(just  sin,  cos,  sec);  5A-3f,h 
Lecture  6.  Tues.  Sept,  19 
Exponentials  and  logs:  def ’n,  algebra,  applications,  derivatives. 
Read:  Notes  X  (8.2  has  some  of  this),  8.3  to  middle  p.  267;  8.4  to  top  p.  271 
Work:  1H-1,  2,  3a,  5b;  1I-1c,d,e,f,m;  1I-4a 
Lecture 7.  Thurs.  Sept.  21 
Logarithmic diﬀerentiation.  Hyperbolic functions (not on exam). 
Review. 
Read:  9.7  to  p.  326 
Lecture  8.  Fri.  Sept.  22 

Work:  5A-5abc 
Exam  1  covering  0-7. 

Students  not  passing  will  get  e-mail  on  Friday  evening.  Make-up  exams  are  oﬀered  Monday-
Thursday  of  the  week  following  at  times  posted  at  the  web  site.  (see  “Exams”  on  Syllabus  sheet). 

Part  II 

(30  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not  until  due  date;  2  points)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with 
whom  you  collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full 
explanation  on  PS1). 

1.  (now;  4  pts)  Graph  the  even  and  odd  functions  you  found  in  Problem  1,  Part  II  of  PS1. 
Directly  below,  graph  their  derivatives.  Do  this  qualitatively  using  your  estimation  of  the  slope. 
Do  not  use  the  formulas  for  the  derivatives  (except  to  check  your  work  if  you  want).  You  can  use 
a  graphing  calculator  to  check  your  answer,  provided  that  you  mention  it  in  Problem  0.  (Note, 
however,  that  you may  not  use  books,  notes  or  calculators  during  tests,  so  it  is  unwise  to  rely  on  a 
graphing  calculator  here.) 
2.  (before  Fri;  5  pts  =  2  +  3)  Compute

a)  (d/dx) tan3 (x4 )


1 

b)  (d/dy)(sin2 y cos2 y) 
(Do  this  two ways:  ﬁrst use  the product  rule,  then write  it as f (2y).  Show  that  the answers agree.) 
3.  (before  Fri;  3pts  =  1  +  2)

a)  If  y = uv ,  show  that  y ��  = u��v + 2u�v �  + uv ��

b)  Find  y ��� . 
4.  (Fri;  4pts  3  +1) 
a)  The  function  cos−1 x  is  the  inverse  of  the  cos θ  on  0 ≤ θ ≤ π .  Use  implicit  diﬀerentiation  to 
derive  the  formula  for  (d/dx) cos−1 x.  Pay  particular  attention  to  the  sign  of  the  square  root.  (See 
the  book  or  lecture  for  the  case  of  the  inverse  of  sine.) 
b) Without  calculation,  explain  why  (d/dx) cos−1 x + (d/dx) sin−1 x = 0 
5.  (Tues  +  Thurs;  10pts  =  2+2+2+2+2)  Do  8.2/8ac,  10,  11;  8.4/18,19a. 
6.  (Thurs;  2pts) Derive  the  formula  for D(u1u2  · · · un )  from PS1, Part  II,  7b,  using  logarithmic 
diﬀerentiation.
