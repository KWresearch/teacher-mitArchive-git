Part  II 

(16  points  +  3  extra) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not  until  due  date;  2  points)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with 
whom  you  collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full 
explanation  on  PS1). 

1.  (10  points:  2  +  4  +  4;  and  3  extra) Golf  balls 
The  area  of  a  section  of  a  sphere  of  radius  R  between  two  parallel  planes  that  are  a  distance  h 
apart  is  1 

area  of  a  spherical  section  = 2πhR 

Slice  the  sphere  of  radius  R  by  a  horizontal  plane.  The  portion  of  the  plane  inside  the  sphere 
is  a  disk  of  radius  r ≤ R.  The  portion  of  the  spherical  surface  above  the  plane  is  called  a  spherical 
cap.  For  example,  if  the  plane  passes  through  the  center,  then  the  disk  has  radius  r  =  R,  its 
circumference  is  the  equator,  and  the  spherical  cap  is  the  Northern  Hemisphere.  More  generally, 
a  spherical  cap  is  the  portion  of  surface  of  the  Earth  north  of  a  latitude  line.  The  formula  above 
applies  to  regions  between  two  latitude  lines,  and,  in  particular,  to  spherical  caps. 
a)  Consider  a  spherical  cap  which  is  the  portion  of  the  surface  of  the  sphere  above  horizontal 
plane  that  slices  the  sphere  at  or  above  its  center.  Find  the  area  of  the  cap  as  a  function  of R  and 
r .  Do  this  by  ﬁnding  ﬁrst  the  formula  for  the  height  h  of  the  spherical  cap  in  terms  of  r  and  R. 
(This  height  is  the  vertical  distance  from  the  horizontal  slicing  plane  to  the North Pole.)  Then  use 
your  formula  for  h  and  the  formula  above  for  the  area  of  spherical  sections.

This  formula will be derived  in Unit 4.  Two  examples may  convince you  that  it  is  reasonable.  For h = R,  it gives 
the  area  of  the  hemisphere,  2πR2 .  For  h = 2R  it  gives  4πR2 ,  the  area  of  the  whole  sphere.

b) Express  the  formula  for  the  area  of  a  spherical  cap  in  terms  of R2  and  r/R.  (This  is  natural 
because  the  proportional  scaling  cr  and  cR  changes  the  area  by  the  factor  c2 .)  Then  use  the 
linear  and  quadratic  approximations  to  (1 + x)1/2  near  x  =  0  to  ﬁnd  a  good  and  an  even  better 
approximation  to  the  area  of  the  spherical  cap,  appropriate  when  the  ratio  r/R  is  small.  (Hint: 
What  is  x?)  Simplify  your  answers  as  far  as  possible:  the  approximation  corresponding  to  the 
linear  approximation  to  (1 + x)1/2  should  be  very  familiar. 
c)  The  following  problem  appeared  on  a  middle  school  math  contest  exam.  The  numbers  have 
been  changed  to  protect  the  innocent.  Consider  a  golf  ball  that  is  3  centimeters  in  diameter  with 
100  hemispherical  dimples  of  diameter  3  millimeters.  (Note  that  this  is  not  a  realistic  golf  ball 
because  the  dimples  are  too  deep).  Find  the  area  of  the  golf  ball  rounded  to  the  nearest  1/100  of  a 
square  centimeter  using  the  approximation  π ≈ 3.14.  (The  students  were  given  three minutes.  We 
are  spending more  time  on  it.) 
Under  the  rules  of  the  contest,  an  incorrectly  rounded  answer  was  counted  as  wrong  with  no 
partial  credit,  so  correct  numerical  approximation  was  crucial.  Some  students  ob jected  that  they 
could  not  ﬁgure  out  the  area  of  portion  of  the  large  sphere  that  is  removed  when  a  dimple  is 
inserted.  A careless examiner had assumed that the students would use the approximation that the 
area  removed  for  each dimple was nearly  the  same  as  the  area  of  a ﬂat disk.  We  are  going  to ﬁgure 
out  whether  this  approximation  is  adequate  or  gives  the  wrong  answer  according  to  the  rules. 
Write  down  formulas  for  the  surface  area  of  the  golf  ball  in  the  three  cases  listed  below.  (Put 
in  100  dimples,  but  leave  r ,  R,  and  π  as  letters.) 
i)  the  approximation  pretending  that  the  removed  surface  is  ﬂat  (what  is  the  relationship  be­
tween  this  and  the  approximations  of  part  (b)?) 
ii)  the  higher  order  approximation  you  derived  in  part  (b) 
iii)  the  exact  formula 
Finally,  evaluate  each  of  the  answers  for  the  given  values  r =  .15  and R = 1.5  centimeters,  and 
ﬁnd  the  accuracy  of  the  approximations. 
d)  (extra  credit:2  3pts)  Although  nobody  noticed  at  the  time,  the  examiner  who  created  this 
problem  made  a  much  bigger  mistake.  With  the  diameters  actually  given,  it  would  have  been 
impossible  for  the  number  of  dimples  given  to  be  placed  on  the  golf  ball  without  overlap.  Give  a 
(reasonable)  estimate  for  the  largest  number  of  dimples  that  can  ﬁt  on  our  golf  ball. 
2.  (4  points)  Draw  the  graph  of  f (x) = 1/(1 + x2 )  and,  directly  underneath,  it  the  graphs  of 
f � (x) and f �� (x).  Label critical points and inﬂection points on the graph of f  with their coordinates. 
Draw vertical  lines  joining  these  special points of  the graph of f  to  the corresponding points on  the 
graphs  below.

Extra  credit points  are  tabulated  separately  and  only  added  to your ﬁnal  score  at  the  end  of  the  semester  so  that 
they  do  not  inﬂuence  any  grading  cutoﬀs.
