18.01  Problem  Set  4 

Due  Friday  10/20/06,  1:55  pm 

This  is  all  of  Problem  Set  4  (not  split  into  4A  and  4B).  Although  it  is  not  due  until  after  Exam 
2,  you  should  do  all  the  Part  I  exercises  through  Lecture  16  and  all  the  Part  II  problems  through 
Problem  4  before  the  exam,  in  order  to  prepare  for  it.  Practice  exam  problems  and  an  actual  past 
exam  will  be  posted  on  line  as  usual.

Part  II 

(36  points  +  10  extra  credit) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not until due date; 3 pts) Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 

1.  (Lec 14, 10pts:  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2))

a)  Use  the  mean  value  property  to  show  that  if  f (0) =  0  and  f � (x) ≥  0,  then  f (x) ≥  0  for  all

x ≥ 0. 
b)  Deduce  from  part  (a)  that  ln(1 + x) ≤ x  for  x ≥ 0.  Hint:  Use  f (x) = x − ln(1 + x). 
c) Use  the  same method  as  in  (b)  to  show  ln(1 + x) ≥ x − x2/2  and  ln(1 + x) ≤ x − x2/2 + x3/3 
for  x ≥ 0.

d)  Find  the  pattern  in  (b)  and  (c)  and make  a  general  conjecture. 
e)  Show  that  ln(1 + x) ≤ x  for  −1 < x ≤ 0.  (Use  the  change  of  variable  u = −x.) 
2.  (Lec 15, 4 pts:  2 + 2) 
a)  Do  5.3/68

b)  Show  that  both  of  the  following  integrals  are  correct,  and  explain. 

tan x sec2 xdx = (1/2) tan2 x; 

tan x sec2 xdx = (1/2) sec2 x 

3.  (Lec 16, 6 pts:  3 + 3) 
a)  Do  8.6/5  (answer  in  back  of  text) 
b)  Do  8.6/6  (optional?) 
4.  (Lec  16,  7  pts:  2  +  3  +  2)  Do  3F-5abc 
�  1 
STOP  HERE.  DO  THE  REST  AFTER  EXAM  2. 
e xdx  using  lower  Riemann  sums.  (You  will  need  to  sum  a 
5.  (Lec  18,  6  pts)  Calculate 
0 
geometric  series  to  get  a  usable  formula  for  the  Riemann  sum.  To  take  the  limit  of  Riemann 
sums,  you  will  need  to  evaluate  lim  n(e 1/n  − 1),  which  can  be  done  using  the  standard  linear 
n→∞
approximation  to  the  exponential  function.) 
6.  (Lec  16;  extra  credit:  10  pts:  2  +  2  +  3  +  3)  More  about  the  hypocycloid.  We  use 
diﬀerential  equations  to  ﬁnd  the  curve with  the  property  that  the  portion  of  its  tangent  line  in  the 
ﬁrst  quadrant  has  ﬁxed  length. 
a)  Suppose  that  a  line  through  the  point  (x0 , y0 )  has  slope m0  and  that  the  point  is  in  the  ﬁrst 
quadrant.  Let  L  denote  the  length  of  the  portion  of  the  line  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant.  Calculate  L2  in 
terms  of  x0 ,  y0  and m0 .  (Do  not  expand  or  simplify.) 
b)  Suppose  that  y  = f (x)  is  a  graph  on  0 ≤ x ≤ L  satisfying  f (0) = L  and  f (L) = 0  and  such 
that the portion of each tangent  line to the graph  in the ﬁrst quadrant has the same  length L.  Find 
the  diﬀerential  equation  that  f  satisﬁes.  Express  it  in  terms  of  L,  x,  y  and  y �  =  dy/dx.  (Hints: 
This  requires  only  thought,  not  computation.  Note  that  y  =  f (x),  y �  =  f � (x).  Don’t  take  square 
roots,  the  expression  using  L2  is  much  easier  to  use.  Don’t  expand  or  simplify;  that  would  make 
things  harder  in  the  next  step.) 
c)  Diﬀerentiate  the  equation  in  part  (b)  with  respect  to  x.  Simplify  and  write  in  the  form 
(something)(xy �  − y)y ��  = 0 

(This  starts  out  looking  horrendous,  but  simpliﬁes  considerably.) 
d)  Show  that  one  solution  to  the  equation  in  part  (c)  is  x2/3  + y2/3  =  L2/3 .  What  about  two 
other  possibilities,  namely,  those  solving  y ��  = 0  and  xy �  − y = 0?
