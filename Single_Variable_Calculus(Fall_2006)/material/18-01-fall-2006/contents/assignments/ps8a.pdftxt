18.01  Problem  Set  8A 

Due  Friday  12/08/06,  1:55  pm 

8A  is  the  ﬁrst  half  of  Problem  Set  8,  all  of  which  is  due  a  week  after  Exam  4.  (The  second  half, 
8B,  will  be  issued  at  the  exam.)  Even  though  it  won’t  be  collected  until  later,  you  should  do  8A 
before  the  exam,  to  prepare  for  it.

Part  II 

(30  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not  until  due  date;  3  pts)  Write  the  names  of  all  the  people  you  consulted  or  with  whom  you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 
1.  (Lec 30, 7 pts:  3 + 1 + 3) 
a)  Find  the  algebraic  equation  in  x  and  y  for  the  curve 

x = a cosk  t,  y = a sink  t. 
Draw  the  portion  of  the  curve  0 ≤ t ≤ π/2  in  the  three  cases  k = 1,  k = 2,  k = 3. 
b) Without  calculation,  ﬁnd  the  arclength  in  the  cases  k = 1  and  k = 2. 
c)  Find  a  deﬁnite  integral  formula  for  the  length  of  the  curve  for  general  k .  Then  evaluate  the 
integral  in  the  three  cases  k  =  1,  k  =  2,  and  k  =  3.  (Your  answer  in  the  ﬁrst  two  cases  should 
match  what  you  found  in  part  (b),  but  the  calculation  takes  more  time.) 
2.  (Lec  30,  9  pts:  3  +  1  +  3  +  2)  The  hyperbolic  sine  and  cosine  are  deﬁned  by 
ex  − e−x 
ex  + e−x

i) 

cosh x = sinh x. 

iii)  cosh2 x =

a)  Show  that

ii)  cosh2 x = 1 + sinh2 x  and

b)  What  curve  is  described  parametrically  by  x  =  cosh t,  y  =  sinh t?  (Give  the  equation  and 
its  name.) 
c)  The  curve  y  =  cosh x  is  known  as  a  catenary.  It  is  the  curve  formed  by  a  chain  whose  two 
ends  are  held  at  the  same  height. 
i)  Sketch  the  curve 
ii)  Find  its  arclength  from  the  lowest  point  to  the  point  (x1 , cosh x1 )  for  a  ﬁxed  x1  > 0. 
d)  Find  the  area  of  the  surface  of  revolution  formed  by  revolving  the  portion  of  the  curve  from 
part  (c)  around  the  x-axis.  This  surface  is  known  as  a  catenoid.  It  is  interesting  because  it  is  the 
surface  of  least  area  connecting  the  two  circles  that  form  its  edges.  If  you  dip  two  circles  of wire  in 
a  soap  solution,  then  (with  some  coaxing)  a  soap  ﬁlm  will  form  in  this  shape.  In  general,  the  soap 
ﬁlms  try  to  span  a  frame  of  wires  with  a  surface  with  the  least  area  possible. 
3.  (Lec  31,  11  pts:  3  +  2  +  2  +  4)  Area  in  polar  coordinates. 
a)  Find  the  area  of  the  right  triangle  with  vertices  at  (x, y)  =  (0, 0),  (x, y) = (a, 0)  and  at 
(x, y) = (a, h),  using  polar  coordinates.  (One  of  the  less  convenient  ways  to  ﬁnd  the  area  of  a 
triangle.) 
b)  Find  the  equation  in  (x, y)  coordinates  for  the  curve  r = 1/(1 + sin θ)  and  sketch  it. 
c) Find  the area of  the  region 0 ≤ r ≤ 1/(1 + sin θ),  0 ≤ θ ≤ π , using  the  rectangular  coordinate 
formula  you  found  in  part  (b). 
d)  Find  the  area  of  the  region  in  part  (c)  using  polar  coordinates.  One  way  to  evaluate  the 
integral  is  to  change  variables  to  u = θ − π/2,  and  then  use  the  half  angle  formula 

1 + cos u = 2 cos2 (u/2) 

This  area  was  already  computed  in  part  (c),  but  the  polar  coordinate  formula  is  still  valuable 
because  it  gives  the  area  of  any  sector,  not  just  the  one  that  is  bounded  by  a  horizontal  line.  The 
area  swept  out  from  the  viewpoint  of  the  focus  of  an  ellipse,  parabola,  or  hyperbola  is  related  by 
Kepler’s  law  to  the  speed  of  planets  and  comets.
