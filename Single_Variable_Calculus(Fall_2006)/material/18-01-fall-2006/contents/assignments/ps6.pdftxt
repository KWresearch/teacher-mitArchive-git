18.01  Problem  Set  6 

Due  THURSDAY  11/09/06,  12:55  pm 

Warning:  This  problem  set  is  due  on  a  THURSDAY  not  Friday,  because  of  the  Veterans’ 
Day  holiday.  It  is  due  before  lecture,  which  is  at  1:05  on  Thursday. 
Even  though  this  problem  set  is  due  two  days  after  Exam  3,  you  will  need  to  do  most  of  it  by 
Tuesday,  in  the  process  of  preparing  for  Exam  3  —  all  except  the  Part  I  problems  connected  to 
Lecture  25.

Part  II 

(30  points) 

Directions:  Attempt  to  solve  each  part  of  each  problem  yourself.  If  you  collaborate,  solutions 
must  be  written  up  independently.  It  is  illegal  to  consult materials  from  previous  semesters.  With 
each  problem  is  the  day  it  can  be  done. 

0.  (not until due date; 3 pts) Write the names of all the people you consulted or with whom you 
collaborated  and  the  resources  you  used,  or  say  “none”  or  “no  consultation”.  (See  full  explanation 
on  PS1). 

1.  (Lec  22,  7pts:  3  +  4)  Do  7.4/12  and  13. 
2.  (Lec  23,  4pts)  The  voltage  V  of  house  current  is  given  by 

V (t) = C sin(120πt) 

where  t  is  time,  in  seconds  and  C  is  a  constant  amplitude.  The  square  root  of  the  average  value 
of  V 2  over  one  period  of  V (t)  (or  cycle)  is  called  the  root-mean-square  voltage,  abbreviated  RMS. 
This  is  what  the  voltage  meter  on  a  house  records.  For  house  current,  ﬁnd  the  RMS  in  terms  of 
the  constant C .  (The  peak  voltage  delivered  to  the  house  is ±C .  The  units  of  V 2  are  square  volts; 
when  we  take  the  square  root  again  after  averaging,  the  units  become  volts  again.)

a)  What  is  the  probability  that  x2  < y  if  (x, y)  is  chosen  from  the  unit  square  0  ≤  x  ≤  1, 
0 ≤ y ≤ 1  with  probability  equal  to  the  area. 
b) What  is  the  probability  that  x2  < y  if  (x, y)  is  chosen  from  the  square  0 ≤ x ≤ 2,  0 ≤ y ≤ 2 
with  probability  proportional  to  the  area.  (Probability  =  Part/Whole).

c)  Evaluate

This  is  known  as  an  improper  integral  because  it  represents  the  area  of  an  unbounded  region.  We 
are  using  the  letter W  to  signify  “whole.” 
The  probability  that  a  radioactive  particle  will  decay  some  time  in  the  interval  0 ≤ t ≤ T  is

Note  that  P ([0, ∞)) = 1 = 100%. 
d)  The  half-life  is  the  time  T  for  which  P ([0, T ]) =  1/2.  Find  the  value  of  a  and  W  for  which 
the  half-life  is  T  =  1.  Suppose  that  a  radioactive  particle  has  a  half-life  of  1  second.  What  is  the 
probability  that  it  survives  to  time  t  =  1,  but  decays  some  time  during  the  interval  1  ≤  t  ≤  2? 
(Give  an  integral  formula,  and  use  a  calculator  to  get  an  approximate  numerical  answer.) 
4.  (Lec  24,  6pts) The  basis  for  Simpson’s  rule  is  the  following  formula.  Let  x1  be  the midpoint 
of  the  interval  [x0 , x2 ],  and  denote  its  length  by  2h.  Consider  any  three  points  (x0 , y0 ),  (x1 , y1 ), 
(x2 , y2 ).  There  is  a  unique  quadratic  function  (parabola) 

y = Ax2  + Bx + C 

whose graph passes  through  the  three points.  Simpson’s  rule  says  that  the area under  the parabola 
above  [x0 , x2 ]  is 

h (y0  + 4y1  + y2 )
3 
This  problem  is  devoted  to  proving  this  formula.  It  is  signiﬁcant  because  it  illustrates  how  calcu­
lations  can  be  simpliﬁed  by  using  symmetry,  and  by  looking  ahead  to  see  what  you  need. 
Since  the  area will be  the  same  if  the  parabola  is  translated  to  the  left  or  right, we may  assume 
that  x0  = −h,  x1  = 0,  and  x2  = h.  Then  in  terms  of  the  rest  of  the  data  (i.e.,  h  and  the  yi ) 
make  a  sketch  and  determine  C ; 
show,  by  integrating,  that  to  ﬁnd  the  area  we  need  only  determine  A  (or  better,  2Ah2 ); 
determine  2Ah2  using  the  data; 
put  the  results  together  to  establish  the  formula  for  area.

5.  (Lec  24,  4pts)  Use  a  calculator  to  make  a  table  of  values  of  the  integrand  and  ﬁnd  approx­
a 
imations  to  the  Fresnel  integral 
cos(t2 )dt  for  a  =  π/2,  using  Simpson’s  rule  with  four  and 
0 
eight  intervals.  (The  exact  answer  to  ﬁve  decimal  places  is  1.22505.  Record  your  approximations 
to  six  decimal  places  to  compare.)
