[Photo of a tarantula spider on a frisbee.]
Multiple frames of reference help explain the position, velocity and
acceleration of a spider on a spinning frisbee. See the video_for_lecture_2 and
the reading on kinematics for more on this introductory problem. (Frisbee photo

***** Course Description *****
This class is an introduction to the dynamics and vibrations of lumped-
parameter models of mechanical systems. Topics include kinematics; force-
momentum formulation for systems of particles and rigid bodies in planar
motion; work-energy concepts; virtual displacements and virtual work;
Lagrange's equations for systems of particles and rigid bodies in planar
motion; linearization of equations of motion; linear stability analysis of
mechanical systems; free and forced vibration of linear multi-degree of freedom
models of mechanical systems; and matrix eigenvalue problems. The class
includes an introduction to numerical methods and using MATLABÂ® to solve
dynamics and vibrations problems.
This version of the class stresses kinematics and builds around a strict but
powerful approach to kinematic formulation which is different from the approach
presented in Spring 2007. Our notation was adapted from that of Professor Kane
of Stanford University.
