Problem 9.1 :  Equation of the lateral vibration of a 100 story building. 
Consider the lateral vibration of a 100 story building. The mass are assumed to be concentrated 
100th floor 
at the floors. The walls constitutes springs. This can be models as a 1-D system. (See figure)

Problem 9.2 :  Generating code to calculate vibration modes of a 100 story building 
In this problem, your task is to generate MATLAB code to calculate vibration mode of a 100 story 
building. In order to simplify the problem, it is assumed that  M 1  = M 2  = " = M 99
= 3kg 
= M 100
 
 
/N m   are given. ‘Building_your_kerberos_name’ 
and  k1  = k2  = " = k99  = k100  = 8
should be function name (as well as m-file name) and upload it to 2.003 MIT Server site. You 
also submit the hardcopy of your code with appropriate comments. Function has following 
structure. 

function v= Building_your_kerberos_name(nvm) 
nvm: vibration mode number you want to generate 
v: eigen vector for nvm-th vibration mode 

(Hint: Define the mass and the stiffness matrices first, and then solve eigenvalue problem.) 

Problem 9.3 :  Plotting some vibration modes of a 100 story building 
With m-code you generated in problem 9.2, print a single figure for each sub-question where x 
axis represents the eigenvector value, and y axis represents the building floor. Use different line 
types for different vibration modes. Legend for the vibration modes should be provided. 
i)  The first four vibration modes 
ii)  The 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th vibration modes
