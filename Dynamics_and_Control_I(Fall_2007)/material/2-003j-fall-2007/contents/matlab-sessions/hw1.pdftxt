Problem 1.1 :  Matrix generation 
i)  Create the following matrixes 
⎡1 4 7 ⎤
⎡1 2 3⎤

⎥  &  B = ⎢
A = ⎢
⎢0 3 1⎥
⎢2 5 8 ⎥
⎥

⎣3 6 9 ⎦
⎣2 1 1⎦ 
⎢
⎥ 
⎢
⎥

ii)  Create  C : a 3×3 identity matrix. Use the most convenient method. 

Problem 1.2 :  Basic matrix operations 
Use the matrixes you made in Problem 1.1. 

i)  Compare the results of  A * B and  A. * B . Explain what MATLAB did.  

ii)  Does  A * B B A ? Explain.  

=  *

iii) Does  A B  B A
.* ? Explain.  

.*   = 
iv) Create matrix  D B −1 . What is  B * D
? 

= 
A B and  A B
. Can you explain what is going on? 

v)  Compare 
/
\
vi) Create  a  new  3×3  matrix  E with  all  diagonal  elements  equal  to  5  and  other  elements 
equal to 0. 

Problem 1.3 :  Understanding data types 
Use the matrixes you made in Problem 1.1. 

i)  What are the data types of the elements of matrixes  A ,  B , and  C ? 

ii)  How many bits of memory are required to store the information in matrix  A ?

iii) Convert  A   and  B  to 8 bit  signed  integer matrixes  and define  them  as matrix  F   and 
G  respectively (check out function int8( ) in the help menu). 
iv) Calculate  F G   and  F G .  Explain results.

Problem 1.4 :  Submatrix extraction and plotting 
You are given the trajectory of a ball in a MATLAB file: ball.mat. (Please, download it from MIT 
Server  site.)  The  first  column  contains  100  time  points  and  the  second  column  contains 
the corresponding 100 positions of the ball. The third and the fourth column contain a second trial of 
the same experiment. 

i)  Extract the time data from column 1 and assign that to a new matrix “t”.

ii)  Extract the position data from column 2 and assign that to a new matrix “x”. 

iii) Plot “x” vs. “t”. 

iv) Extract only the first 50 time points from column 3 and make a new matrix “t2”.  

v)  Extract only the first 50 positions from column 4 and make a new matrix “x2”.  

vi) Plot “x2” vs. “t2”.  

vii) Superimpose both trajectories. Plot them in different color.
