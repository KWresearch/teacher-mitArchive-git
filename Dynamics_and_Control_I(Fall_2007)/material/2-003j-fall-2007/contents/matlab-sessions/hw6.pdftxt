A  mass-spring-damper  system  is  subject  to  an  external  sinusoidal  force  F t( )   with  amplitude 
F0 ,  and  angular  frequency  ω.  The  position  of  particle,  x ,  is  zero  when  the  spring  is  neither 
compressed  or  stretched.  The  mass  of  the  particle  is  m ,  the  damping  coefficient  is  b   and  the 
spring  constant  is  k .  Initial  condition  is  expressed  as  x(0) = x0  and  v(0) = v0  .  Derive  the 
equation of motion for this mass-spring-damper system. 

Problem 6.2 :  Solver for a mass-spring-damper system using Euler method 
You are familiar with Euler method used to obtain the trajectory of a ball dropping and bouncing 
in Homework  #3.  In  this  homework,  you will  create  a  function  that  use Euler method  to  derive 
the  particle  trajectory  (two  column  matrix  for  time  and  position  each)  in  mass-spring-damper 
system from  t=0  to 50 sec. The  input parameters of  the function are coefficients ( m ,  b ,  k ,  F0

MIT Server site. You also submit the hardcopy of your code with appropriate comments.

Problem 6.3 :  Solver for a mass-spring-damper system with using Runge-Kutta method 
Using Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve the differential equation of this system, generate a m-file 
function  with  input  parameters  ( m  ,  b  ,  k  ,  F0 ,  ω,  x0   and  v0  )  to  calculate  particle 
trajectory (two column matrix for time and position each) from t=0 to 50 sec. You may use either 
Runge-Kutta 23 or 45 algorithm (See ode23 or ode45 in the MATLAB help, and use one of them 
for  both  the  time  step  size  for  the  solver  (See  also odeset 
t
in  your m-code.). Use 
0.1sec 
Δ = 
in the MATLAB help) and the time step for the output time from the solver (See input argument for 
tspan 
in  ode23  or  ode45).  Function  name 
(and  m-file  name)  should  be 
‘MSDSRK_your_kerberos_name’  and  upload  it  to  2.003  MIT  Server  site.  You  also 
submit  the hardcopy of your code with appropriate comments. 

Problem 6.4 :	 Trajectory  of  a  mass-spring-damper  system  with  different  parameters  and 
initial conditions 
For the following cases, plot the time response of the particle. Plot the trajectories with Euler and 
Runge-Kutta  solvers  on  a  single  graph  with  appropriate  legends.  Compare  the  results  for  these 
two approaches. Submit a hardcopy of your trajectory plots.
