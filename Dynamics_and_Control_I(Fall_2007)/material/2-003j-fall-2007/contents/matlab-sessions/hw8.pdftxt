Problem 8.1 :  Nonlinear parametric pendulum 

The equation of motion governing an undamped simple pendulum is given by: 
d 2θ 
2  sinθ= 0 
dt 2  +ω0

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)

where  ω0  = 

is  the  natural  frequency  of  the  pendulum,  g  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity, 

g 
L 
L  the  length  of  the  pendulum  and  θ  the  angle  made  with  the  vertical.  Now,  we  can  add  a 
damping  force  to  the  equation  by  including  a  term  that  is  proportional  to  the  velocity  of  the 
pendulum. The equation of motion now becomes: 
dθ +ω2  sin
d 2θ
+ 2γ 
0 
dt 2 
dt 
where  γ  is the damping coefficient. 
In  this  problem,  we  are  interested  in  studying  the  nonlinear  parametric  pendulum,  whose 
equation of motion is given by: 

θ= 0

The  above  is  a  simple  model  for  a  child  playing  on  a  swing.  The  forcing  term  models  the 
periodic  pumping  of  the  child's  legs  at  approximately  twice  the  natural  frequency  of  the  swing. 
h  is  the  amplitude  of  forcing.  Let  us  see  if  we  can  answer  the  following  question  in  this 
problem:  starting  near  the  equilibrium  point  θ θ = 0
,  can  the  child  get  the  swing  going  by 
=
pumping his/her legs this way, or does he/she need a push ?

For  this  problem,  choose  ω0  = 1 . Unless  otherwise  specified,  use  γ= 0.1 . Also,  remember  that 
θ  physically  varies  between  0   and  2π ,  and  any  value  greater  than  2π  in  the  solution 
should be brought back to the physical range using the function mod. 

i)  For  the  unforced  and  undamped  pendulum  ( h = γ = 0 ),  find  the  time  series  θ( t ) vs.  t 
with the initial conditions: 
 
a)  θ( )0  = 0, θ  0
( ) = 0.01

 
b)  θ( )0  = 0,
( ) = 3 
 θ  0

Show  that  the  trajectory  in  a)  is  sinusoidal,  whereas  the  trajectory  in  b)  is  not.  This 
happens because, in part b),  θ  is so large that sinθ≈θ  is not a  good  approximation, 
and  hence  nonlinear  effects  kick  in.  Also,  show  that  the  time  period  of  oscillations  is 
dependent on the initial conditions for large  θ  (and  θ ), and is independent of the initial 
conditions for small  θ  (and  θ ). 
θ θ  0 
ii)  The  rest  state 
to  be  unstable  when
is  known 
the  pendulum 
of 
= =
γ2  < ( hω0 )2  / 16  . Verify  the  prediction  of  the  critical  value  of  h  necessary  for  sustained 
oscillations  of  the  pendulum.  (Get  the  time  series  for  two  values  of  h ,  one  that  is  just 
below  and  the  other  that  is  just  above  the  critical  value  of  h  given  by  the  instability 
condition.) 
iii)  Plot  the  time series 

( )
θ  t 
Calculate the time periods and comment on the pattern you observe. (Remember to let the 
initial transients die away before you estimate the time period.) 

(for any initial condition) for  h =1.50, 1.80, 2.00, 2.05, 2.062.

iv)  The motion  of  the  pendulum  for  h =2.2  is  on  a  "strange  attractor." An  attractor  (a  set  of 
points  to which solutions get attracted) is informally described as strange  if  the dynamics 
on  the  attractor  are  chaotic. When  a  system  gets  into  the  chaotic  regime,  the  behavior  of 
the  solution will  seem  random  even  though we  have  a  deterministic  system  that  governs 
the  motion  of  the  pendulum.  For  h =2.2,  plot  the  trajectory  on  a  θ −θ   plane,  and 
observe  the  chaotic  (random)  nature  of  the  "strange  attractor"!  (Use  any  non-zero  initial 
condition; you can also plot  the  time  series of  θ  or  θ  and observe  that  the behavior  is 
random and  there  is no clear  time period  in  the signal.) Again, remember  to  let  the  initial 
transients die away before you make your plots. Unpredictability is an essential feature of 
chaos.  If  a  system  is  in  the  chaotic  regime,  it  is  impossible  to  predict  the  exact  position 
and  velocity  of  the  pendulum  at  a  future  time  even  if  we  are  given  the  current  position 
and velocity with maximum  accuracy. This property of unpredictability  arises  from what 
we call "sensitive dependence on  initial conditions." We may start  the system at  (0.1,0.1) 
and  observe  a  specific  trajectory;  but,  starting  at  (0.1,0.10000001)  may  result  in  a 
completely  different  trajectory  if  the  behavior  is  chaotic.  Show  that  there  is  sensitive 
dependence on initial conditions for  h =2.2. (For showing sensitive dependence on initial 
conditions, consider  two  initial conditions  that are different only by a very small quantity 
(something  like  δθ =  0.001  radians  should  do  the  job),  and  show  that  the  solutions  are 
very different after some time when plotted on top of each other.) 
v)  Finally,  make  a  quick  comparison  of  the  time  series  of  θ  for  h =1.8,  which  is  well 
below  the  critical  value  for  chaos,  and  h =2.2 when  the  system  is  chaotic. Use  the  same 
initial conditions for the two cases. 

Problem 8.2 :  The growth/decay of population of animal species 
A  popular  model  for  the  growth/decay  of  population  of  animal  species  is  given  by  the  logistic 
map. It takes into account the two basic factors that contribute to the birth or death of any animal 
species: 
a)	 Reproduction  means  the  population  will  increase  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  current 
population.  This  can  be  stated  as  "the  population  at  a  future  time  is  proportional  to  the 
population at the current time," i.e. 
xn +1  ∝ xn

where  xn +1  is  the  population  at  time  n + 1   given  that  the  population  at  time  n   is  xn . 
The proportionality constant signifies the growth rate because of reproduction. 
b)	 Starvation means  the population will decrease at a rate proportional to the value obtained 
by  taking  the  theoretical  "carrying  capacity"  of  the  environment  less  the  current 
population. In a given environment, the presence of more number of animals will result in 
more rapid consumption of the available resources, and this will result in more likelihood 
of starvation. This can be written as 
xn +1  ∝ −( 
) 
1  xn	
 
 
Since  xn   and  xn +1  are  normalized  populations  (actual  population  divided  by  the 
maximum  population  possible),  they  cannot  be  greater  than  1.  (1 − xn )   is  a  measure  of 
how  close  the  system  is  to  the  maximum  carrying  capacity  of  the  environment.  The 
proportionality constant signifies the inverse of the death rate because of starvation. 

(5)

 

 

 

 

 

Mathematically,  the  complete model  that  includes  both  the  birth  and  the  death  processes  can  be 
written as: 

 

xn +1  = rxn  (
) 
1 − xn	
is  a  number  between  zero  and  one,  and  represents  the  population  at  year  n ;  hence 

where  xn
x0	
represents the initial population (at year 0);  r  is a positive number, and represents a 
combined rate for reproduction and starvation. 

(6)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i)  For  values  of  r  less  than  1,  show  that,  irrespective  of  the  initial  population,  the 
population will eventually die. 

ii)  With  r  between 1 and 2, show  that  the population quickly stabilizes  to  the value 

r − 1
r 

, 

independent of the initial population. 
iii) What happens for values of  r  between 2 and 3 ? 
iv)  Play around with the value of  r , and see if you can find a critical value above which the 
r − 1
r 
never  settles  to  a  single  value  even  for  large  n .  Instead  of  converging  to  a  single  value, 

.  Plotting  xn   vs.  n  should  reveal  that  the  solution 

solution  no more  converges  to

the  solution  converges  to  a  2-period  oscillation  or  a  4-period  oscillation,  or  some  2k  ­
period  oscillation  as  you  increase  r .  At  the  first  critical  value  of  r ,  the  solution  will 
switch  from  settling  to  a  single  value  to  settling  to  an  oscillation  between  two  values; 
similarly,  at  the  second  critical  value  of  r ,  the  solution  will  switch  from  settling  to  an 
oscillation between two values to settling to an oscillation between four values; and so on. 
This is known as period-doubling. As we can guess, for large enough  r , the solution will 
converge  to  an  oscillation  between  2k   values,  where  k  is  large,  and  effectively,  there 
is  no  finite-period  oscillation  to  which  the  system  settles,  and  this  is  known  as  the 
"period-doubling route to chaos". 
Show  sample  plots  of  xn   Vs  n  for  various  values  of  r  to  confirm  that  period-
doubling happens. Find the first four values of  r  where period doubling occurs. 
v)  Create a rough map of the asymptotic values of  xn   for varying  r . (What we are looking 
for  is  the  following:  On  the  x-axis,  you  should  plot  r .  On  the  y-axis  should  be  the 
asymptotic  values  to  which  the  population  converges  for  the  corresponding  value  of  r . 
The asymptotic values to which the population converges will be either 1 or 2 or 4 or 8 or 
in number depending on the value of  r . You can do something like getting the 
some  2k 
solution for a large number of iterations (say 50000) and plot the last 10000 values. If the 
solution converges  to a  single value, we can expect  the  last 10000 values  to be  the same; 
if  the solution converges  to a 2-period oscillation, we can expect  the  last 10000 values  to 
be  switching  between  the  two  values  of  the  2-period  oscillation,  and  so  plotting  the  last 
10000 values  is equivalent  to plotting  just  the  two values  in  the oscillation cycle; See  the 
below figure which your rough map should look like!).

vi)  At  r =  3.57  (approximately)  is  the  onset  of  chaos,  at  the  end  of  the  period-doubling 
cascade. We  can no  longer  see  any oscillations. Take  r =3.7,  and  show  that  there  is now 
sensitive dependence on initial conditions. (Slight variations in the initial population yield 
dramatically  different  results  over  time,  a  prime  characteristic  of  chaos. For more  details 
on  unpredictability  and  sensitive  dependence  on  initial  conditions,  see  part  iv)  of  the 
previous question.)

The  above  figure  shows  a  double  well  potential  system.  The  double  well  is  attached  to  a  rigid 
framework and the particle moves along the double well. As seen in the figure, the two wells are 
separated  by  a  hump  at x = 0  has  two  stable  states  where  their  potentials  are  minimal.  So,  it  is 
called  bistable  system.  The  potential  energy  is  proportional  to  the  height  of  the  particle.  The 
( ) 
double well potential can be expressed as  V x = 1  x 4  − 1  x 2 . Suppose  the double well  is  shaken

periodically  by  the  external  force  from  side  to  side. What  happens  to  the motion  of  the  damped 
particle?  If  the  shaking  is  very weak,  the  particle will  go  into  one of  the wells  and  stay  near  the 
bottom  of  the  well,  jiggling  slightly.  With  strong  shaking,  the  particle  trajectory  will  become 
larger. At  this moment, we  can  guess  that  two  types  of  particle motion  exist:  a  small-amplitude, 
low-energy oscillation about the bottom of a well, and a large-amplitude, high-energy oscillation 
where  the particle goes back  and  forth over  the hump without  settling down  in one of  the wells. 
Your  task  is  to  observe  the  particle  motion  under  Stokes  type  damping  with  coefficient  δ as  a

function  of  initial  conditions  and  the  magnitude  of  external  force.  The  motion  equation  of  the 
particle along the double well is given as follows:

x  F	

(8) 

In  this  problem,  the  damping  coefficient  and  the  frequency  of  the  external  force  are  given: 
δ= 0.25  &  ω= 1 . 

i)	 Suppose  that  small  external  force  F = 0.18  is  applied.  Show  that  the  motion  of  the 
particle  depends  on  the  initial  conditions.  (You  can  choose  different  initial  conditions, 
and  calculate  their  trajectory,  and  compare  together.  100-200  sec  is  enough  to  simulate 
the motion.) Confirm that all the trajectories of the particle are oscillatory and confined to 
single  well  at  the  steady  state.  Is  there  any  change  of  the  period  for  different  initial 
conditions? 
ii)	 Suppose  that  large  external  force  F = 0.4  is  applied.  Compare  the  particle  trajectories 
for  different  initial  conditions.  Are  they  relevant?  Irrelevant?  Or  chaotic?  Describe  what 
you observe (for the definition of chaos, see problem 1). 
iii)  Now,  we  introduce  the  phase  plane  analysis.  Phase  plane  is  sometimes  very  useful  to 
analyze  the  nonlinear  dynamic  motions.  Phase  plane  is  defined  as  the  plot  of  x ( t )  (x 

( ) 
axis)  vs.  x  t (y  axis),  and  you  can  observe  dynamic  behavior,  independent  of  time.

Generate  phase  plane  plot  for  different  initial  conditions  you  used  in  ii)  (separate  plots), 
and  compare  them  together.  (Use  simulation  time  of  1000-2000  sec  to  observe  the 
behavior well.) 
iv)  From  iii),  you  may  recognize  phase  plane  analysis  is  hard  to  interpret.  At  this  time, 
another  nonlinear  dynamic  analysis  tool  is  suggested,  Poincaré  section.  It  is  obtained  by 
( ) 
( ) 
  vs  x  t 
plotting  x t

for  the  same  phase.  (Since  the  external  force  is  periodic,  you

obtain  time  values  when  they  have  same  phase.  For  example,  the  phase  of  the  external 
force  at  t=0,  2π/ω,  4π/ω,  ……  are  same.).  From  a  physical  view  point,  we  take 
“snapshot” of the system at the same phase in each driver cycle. Plot Poincaré section for 
the  initial  conditions  used  in  ii).  (Plot  the  points,  not  line  between  two  points  in  the 
figures.  10000-20000  sec  simulation  time  is  enough  to  generate  Poincaré  section.)  Is  it 
better  than phase plane analysis  in  terms of visualization? Describe what you observe for 
different initial conditions.

v)  In  general,  chaos  still  happens  even  when  time  goes  to  the  infinity,  but  this  system  has 
different  type  of  chaos:  with  two  initial  conditions  which  are  close  together,  their 
trajectories  aren’t  similar  even  in  the  transient  response.  However,  either  trajectory 
eventually  goes  to  a  steady  state,  depending  on  particle’s  transient  behavior.  It  is  called 
transient  chaos,  and  chaos happens only  in  the  transient  response. To  find  suitable  initial 
conditions,  trial and error  is used. Plot the trajectories of particle separately for following 
initial conditions. 
a. 	 x ( )0  = 0.177  &  x  0  = 0.1
 ( ) 

b. 	 x ( )0  = 0.176  &  x  0  = 0.1
 ( ) 

Use  F  = 0.25  as  the  magnitude  of  external  force  and  500  sec  as  the  simulation  time. 
Describe what you observe by comparing both trajectories. 
vi)  Now,  you  understand  it  can  be  very  hard  to  predict  the  final  state  of  this  system 
depending  on  the  initial  condition.  Therefore,  the  sensitivity  of  initial  condition  is 
conveyed more vividly by the following graphical method. 

a. 	

( ) 
( ) 
 
Initial conditions for position and velocity should be  −2.5 ≤ x  0 , x  0
≤ 2.5 

b.	 Make a 101 x 101 color grids with each grid point representing the particle’s final 
state with the given initial condition. 
c. 	 Calculate trajectory up to 500 second for each initial condition. 
d.	 A  red  dot  is  placed  in  a  corresponding  grid  point  if  the  trajectory  ends  up  in  the 
right well. 
e. 	 Blue dot is placed in a corresponding grid point if the trajectory ends up in the left 
well. 
Plot  the  color-coded  grids  for  different  initial  conditions.  Is  it  beautiful?  (Hint:  you  plot 
the map with ‘imagesc’ function. This function requires matrix (grid)  to be  imaged  in 
the figure. You define empty matrix for color coding. If color is red in corresponding grid, 
matrix element has 1. Otherwise, it has -1.)
