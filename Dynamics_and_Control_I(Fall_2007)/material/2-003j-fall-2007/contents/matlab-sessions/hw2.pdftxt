Problem 2.1 :  Matrix creation with loop 
i)  Create  a  5×5 matrix  in which  each  element  has  a  value  equal  to  the  sum  of  its  row  and 
column numbers. 
ii)  Create a 5×5 matrix in which each element has a value equal to the square of the sum of 
the element’s row and column numbers. 

Problem 2.2 :  Matrix creation with conditional 
Make  a  one  dimensional  array  that  contains  all  integers  in  the  range  of  1  to  100  that  are  not 
divisible by 2, 3, and 7. 

Problem 2.3 :  Velocity and acceleration profile calculation from the ball trajectory 
Use  the  same  trajectory  file,  ‘ball.mat’  from  the  last  homework.  Time(t)  and  trajectory(x) 
are  from  the  first  and  the  second  columns,  respectively.  Write  an  m-file  to  calculate  the  ball’s 
velocity and acceleration  in  two different ways. You should follow  the below guidelines  to make 
m-file. (Otherwise, you may lose point.) 

	 You should submit only m-file through the MIT Server site. 
	 Your m-file name  should be ‘HW023_your_Kerberos_name’(For  example,  it 
should be‘HW023_ptso.m’ with e-mail address of ptso@mit.edu) 
In  the  first  line  of m-file,  ‘function [v1,a1,v2,a2,t]=HW023’  should  be 
added. 
	 You can also start by downloading and using the template m-file from the MIT Server 
site (HW023.m)

v(i) ≈ 

i)  Write a “for” loop and calculate the difference between adjacent points. For examples, 
x(i + 1) − x(i) 
t (i + 1) − t (i) 
Velocity  and  acceleration  should  be  assigned  to  the  variables  ‘v1’  and  ‘a1’ 
respectively. 
ii)  Use  the  MATLAB  function  ‘diff’.  Velocity  and  acceleration  should  be  assigned  to  the 
variables ‘v2’ and ‘a2’ respectively. 

Is this neighboring point approach good in the presence of noise? Explain it.
