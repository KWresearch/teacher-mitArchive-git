The  following  three  problems  aim  to  get  you  familiarize with MATLAB  functions. You  don’t  need 
to worry about exceptional cases  such as when n  is not a non-negative  integer  in problem 4.3.  It 
is assumed that input arguments are well-defined. 

Problem 4.1 :	 Writing a function to perform multiple matrix operations 
Write  a  function  that  will  calculate  the  sum,  difference,  element-by-element  multiplication,  and 
matrix  multiplication  of  two  arbitrary  same  size  matrices  at  once.  The  results  of  function  with 
⎡1 3⎤

given matrices 	 ⎢

⎥  are shown as below in the command window:

Function name (and m-file name) should be ‘bop_your_kerberos_name’, and upload it to 
2.003 MIT Server site. You also submit print-out of your function. Calculate sum, difference, element-

Problem 4.2 :	

Integrating  two  functions  numerically  over  a  given  interval  using  function 
handlers 
Evaluate  the  following  two  integrals  using  the  ‘quad’  function.  You  don’t  need  to  turn  in  the 
code  electronically.  Just  manually  write  down  the  MATLAB  codes  that  you  have  used  and  the 
evaluation result that you get.

Does  the  ‘quad’  function  give  reasonable  results  for  both  functions  i)  and  ii)?  For  ii), 
analytically  evaluate  the Gaussian  function  (or  look  it  up  in  an  integral  table)  and  compare with 
your numerical result.  Explain any differences. 

Problem 4.3 :	 Calculating the factorial of a non-negative integer 
Write  a  function  to  calculate  the  factorial  of  a  non-negative  integer,  n ! .  It  is  not  allowed  to  use 
recursive  algorithm  you will  learn  next week  in  this  problem.  Function  name  (and m-file  name) 
should  be  ‘fctrl_your_kerberos_name’  and  upload  it  to  2.003  MIT  Server  site.  You 
also  submit print-out of your function. Calculate  125!  with this function.
