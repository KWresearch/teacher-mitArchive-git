Problem 7.1 :  Derivation of the equation of the motion for a rolling half-disk 

Half-disk is rolling without slipping on the plane surface. 
i)  Derive the equation of the motion.  Keep all nonlinear terms and do not linearize. 
ii)  Linearize the nonlinear motion in case of small angle oscillation. 
Hint: use small angle approximations such as  sinθ≈θ 
iii)  Solve  the  linearized  equation  of motion  obtained  in  ii)  analytically with  following  initial

Problem 7.2 :  Generate simulation codes for motion for rolling half-disk 
Generate  functions  to  simulate  the  trajectory  of  θ  for  rolling  half-disk  based  on  following 
instructions. Simulation time is 10 seconds. Set  r =1m. 
i) 	 Use  the  nonlinearized  equation  of  motion  obtained  in  problem  7.1.  i).  Use  “ode45” 
Function 
name 
(and  m-file 
name) 
should 
be 
for 
simulation. 
‘RockerRK_your_kerberos_name’  and upload it to 2.003 MIT Server site. You 
also submit  the  hardcopy  of  your  code  with  appropriate  comments.  Function 
has  following structure. 
function [t,theta]= RockerRK_your_kerberos_name(theta0) 
t: time matrix (N×1) 

theta: angle matrix (N×1) 

theta0: initial condition matrix (1×2) 

ii)  Use  analytical  solution  obtained  in  7.1.  iii).  Trajectory  can  be  obtained  by  simply 
evaluating  the  analytical  solution  as  a  function  of  time.  Function  name  (and  m-file 
name)  should  be  ‘RockerAN_your_kerberos_name’  and  upload  it  to  2.003 
MIT Server  site. You  also  submit  the hardcopy  of  your  code with  appropriate  comments. 
Function has following structure. 
function [t,theta]= RockerAN_your_kerberos_name(theta0) 
t: time matrix (N×1) 

theta: angle matrix (N×1)  

theta0: initial condition matrix (1×2) 


Problem 7.3 :  Trajectory of  θ ( )t 

for both small and large angle oscillations 

For  the  initial  conditions  given  below,  simulate  the  nonlinear  motion  and  the  linearized  motion 

for  rolling  half-disk  up  to  10  seconds  (use  results  of  Problem  7.2).  Compare  these  results  by 

plotting  both  of  them  in  the  same  figure  with  the  appropriate  legends.  Are  they  identical? 

Otherwise, explain why not. You should hand in hardcopy of the plots. 

i) 	 Small angle oscillation:  θ(0) = 5 o  and  θ&(0) = 0 . 

ii)  Large angle oscillation:  θ (0) = 30o  and  θ&(0) = 0 .
