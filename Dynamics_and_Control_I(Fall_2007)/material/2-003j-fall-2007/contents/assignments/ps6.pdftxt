1. A disc sliding in a circular well 
 
A  circular  disc  of  radius  r  and  mass  m  is  sliding  in  a  semi-circular  well  of  radius  R  as 
shown  in  the  figure  below. The  contact  between  the  disc  and  the well  is  frictionless. Let 
O be  the center of  the  semi-circular well. Let C  represent  the center of  the disc and  let Q 
be some fixed point on the edge of the disc. At t = 0, the disc is held such that Q is at the 
tip of the well as shown in the figure. The disc is then released. Note that gravity acts. 
 
a.  Where is the instantaneous center of rotation for the disc, if it exists? 
b.  Find the equation of motion of the disc. 
c.  Find  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  disc  using  the  work-energy  principle  (Take  the 
derivative to verify whether the answer matches with the answers in the above part).

2. A slender rod sliding in a circular well 
 
A  slender  rod  of  length  2L  and  mass  m  is  sliding  in  a  semi-circular  well  of  radius  R  as 
shown in the figure below. The contact between the rod and the well is frictionless. Let O 
be  the center of  the semi-circular well. Let C represent  the center of  the rod. Let P and Q 
represent endpoints of the rod. At t = 0, the rod is held such that P is at one tip of the well 
and Q is in contact with the surface of the well. The rod is then released. Note that gravity 
acts. 
 
a.  Use the torque equation about the center of mass of the rod and the force equations to 
find the equation of motion of the rod. 
b.  Where  is  the  instantaneous  center  of  rotation  for  the  rod?  Use  the  torque  equation 
about the instantaneous center of rotation to find the equation of motion of the rod. 
c.  Find  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  rod  using  two methods,  once  about  the  center  of mass 
and  once  about  the  ICR.   Find  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  rod  using  the  work-
energy  principle  (Take  the  derivative  to  verify  whether  the  answer  matches  with  the 
answers in the above parts).

3. A disc purely rolling on a circular well 
 
A  circular  disc  of  radius  r  and  mass  m  is  rolling  in  a  semi-circular  well  of  radius  R  as 
shown  in  the  figure below. Let O be  the center of  the  semi-circular well. Let C  represent 
the  center of  the disc  and  let Q be  some  fixed point on  the  edge of  the disc. At  t = 0,  the 
disc  is  held  such  that  Q  is  at  the  tip  of  the  well  as  shown  in  the  figure.  The  disc  is  then 
released. Note that gravity acts. 
 
a.  What  is  the  kinematics  constraint  for  the  rolling  motion  of  the  disc  in  the  circular 
well?  
b.  Use the torque equation about the center of mass of the rod and the force equations to 
find the equation of motion of the rod. 
c.  What  is  the  instantaneous  center  of  rotation  (ICR)  for  the  disc?  Use  the  torque 
equation  about  the  instantaneous  center  of  rotation  to  find  the  equation  of motion  of 
the rod. 
d.  Use  the  torque equation about point O and  the  force equations  to  find  the equation of 
motion of the rod. 
e.  Find  the kinetic energy of  the disc using  two methods, once about  the center of mass 
and  once  about  the  ICR.   Find  the  equation  of  motion  of   the  disc  using  the  work-
energy  principle  (Take  the  derivative  to  verify  whether  the  answer  matches  with  the 
answers in the above parts).
