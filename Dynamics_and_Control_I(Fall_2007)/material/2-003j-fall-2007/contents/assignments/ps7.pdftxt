1.  Oscillating slender rod 

An L-shaped groove  is  shown  in  the  figure below.   Two ends of a  slender  rod of mass m 
and  length  L  are  attached  to  identical  springs,  each  with  a  spring  constant  k.  Both  the 
springs  are  fixed  to  the L-shaped  groove  as  shown  in  the  figure  below. Both  the  ends  of 
the  rod  are  constrained  to  move  only  along  the  L-shaped  groove.  Ignore  gravity  for  this 
problem.  Choose  appropriate  generalized  coordinate(s)  and  derive  the  equation(s)  of 
motion for this system using the Lagrangian approach.

2.  Double pendulum 

A  double  pendulum  is  formed  using  two  rigid,  slender  rods  each  of mass m  and  length  l 
as  shown  in  the  figure  below.  Link  1  is  free  to  pivot  about  point O  and  link  2  is  free  to 
pivot about point P.  Note  that gravity acts. Choose appropriate generalized coordinate(s) 
and derive the equation(s) of motion for this system using the Lagrangian approach.

3.  Carts and springs 

Two carts, of masses m1 and m3 respectively, are constrained to move together by a bar of 
mass m2 and length l (this can be approximated as a slender rod).  The bar is connected to 
the  first  cart  via  a  fixed  pin-joint,  and  to  the  second  cart  via  a  pin-joint  that  can  translate 
vertically  in  a  slot.    Furthermore,  each  cart  is  connected  to  an  adjacent wall  by  a  spring, 
and both springs have stiffness k.  Note  that gravity acts. Choose appropriate generalized 
coordinate(s)  and  derive  the  equation(s)  of  motion  for  this  system  using  the  Lagrangian 
approach.

4.  Wheeled pendulum 

The  figure  below  shows  an  inverted  pendulum mounted  on  a  rolling wheel.    The wheel, 
which can be modeled as a disk of radius r1 and mass m1, rolls on the flat ground without 
slipping.  The pendulum can be modeled as a point mass m2 at one end of a mass-less rod 
of  length  r2.  The  other  end  of  the  rod  is  attached  to  the  disk  and  is  free  to  pivot  about 
point  C.  Note  that  gravity  acts.  Choose  appropriate  generalized  coordinate(s)  and  derive 
the equation(s) of motion for this system using the Lagrangian approach.
