1. Pulley problem 

Recall  the  pulley  problem  we  solved  so  far  again  and  again.  A  pulley  of  radius  R  is 
rigidly  fixed  to  the wall  as  shown  in  the  figure. A  point mass  is  attached  to  one  end  of  a 
non-elastic  string  of  length  lo  and  the  other  end  of  the  string  is  fixed  to  the  top  of  the 
pulley  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Initially  the  mass  is  held  such  that  the  string  is  tight  and 
horizontal and  is suddenly  released. Note  that gravity acts.  In one of  the problem sets we 
found  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  mass  using  Newton’s  laws  and  the  work-energy 
principle. Now find the equation of motion of the mass using the equation that relates the 
torque  and  the  angular  momentum  about  an  arbitrary  point  (the  one  with  the  “pesky 
term”).

2. Semicircular platform 

A semicircular platform of radius R is shown in the figure below. A particle of mass m is 
held at the tip of the platform. At t = 0, the platform is powered such that it starts moving 
to  the  left  with  the  constant  velocity  v  and  simultaneously  the  point  mass  is  released. 
Assume  that  the platform continues  to move with  the constant velocity. Note  that gravity 
acts.  Now  find  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  mass  using  the  equation  that  relates  the 
torque  and  the  angular  momentum  about  an  arbitrary  point  (the  one  with  the  “pesky 
term”).

3. Dumbbell Problem 
 
Two  particles  of masses m1  and m2  are  connected  by  a massless  rigid  rod  of  length  L  to 
form  a  dumbbell.  Imagine  that  the  dumbbell  is  lying  on  a  frictionless  table-top.  A 
massless  rocket  is  attached  to  each  mass.  At  t  =  0  both  the  rockets  are  ignited.  Each 
rocket exerts a force that is always perpendicular to the massless rod. Both the rockets are 
positioned  such  that  the  forces  they  exert  are  equal  and opposite with magnitude F. Find 
the equation(s) of motion of the dumbbell.

4. The center of mass and the moment of inertia of a 2D rigid body 

 A  2D  rigid  body  shown  in  the  figure  below  has  constant  density  ρ  kg/m2.    It  is  a  thin 
circular  disc  of  radius  R  centered  at  point  P  that  contains  a  circular  cavity  centered  at 
point Q.  The distance PQ = R/3. 
a.  Find the center of mass of the rigid body 
b.  Find its moment of inertia about the vertical axis coming out of page through point P 
c.  Find  its moment of  inertia about  the vertical  axis  coming out of  the page  through  the 
center of mass
