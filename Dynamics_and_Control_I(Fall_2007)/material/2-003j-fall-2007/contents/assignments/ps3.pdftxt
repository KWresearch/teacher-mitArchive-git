1. Pulley problem 

A  pulley  of  radius  R  is  rigidly  fixed  to  the  wall  as  shown  in  the  figure.  A  point  mass  is 
attached  to  one  end  of  a  non-elastic  string  of  length  lo  and  the  other  end  of  the  string  is 
fixed  to  the  top  of  the  pulley  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Initially  the  mass  is  held  such  that 
the string is tight and horizontal and is suddenly released. In the previous problem set we 
found  the  velocity  and  acceleration  of  the  mass  with  respect  to  a  stationary  observer  on 
the ground. Note that gravity acts. Find the equation of motion of the mass: 

a. Using Newton’s laws 
b. Using the work-energy principle

2. Normal reaction due to Coriolis Effect 

A  mass  m  lies  in  a  straight  radial  channel  dug  on  the  surface  of  a  circular,  horizontal 
platform of radius R, as shown in the figure below.  The platform rotates anticlockwise at 
a constant angular velocity ω about  the vertical axis  (coming out of  the page  through  the 
center  of  the  platform).   The mass  is  attached  to  a  string  that  is  being  pulled  in  from  the 
center of the platform at a constant rate dr(t)/dt = -v.  Find the normal force N = N(r) that 
the mass exerts on the wall of the channel.

3. Normal reaction due to Coriolis Effect 

A mass m lies in a straight channel dug on the surface of a circular, horizontal platform of 
radius R,  as  shown  in  the  figure  below. The  center  of  the  channel  is  at  a  distance  d  from 
the  center  of  the  platform.  The  platform  rotates  anticlockwise  at  a  constant  angular 
velocity  ω  about  the  vertical  axis  (coming  out  of  the  page  through  the  center  of  the 
platform).   The mass  is  free  to  slide  in  the channel and  the contact surface  is  frictionless. 
Find  the normal  force  that  the mass exerts on  the wall of  the channel as a  function of  the 
distance of the mass from the center of the channel.

4. Coefficient of restitution 

A ball of mass m is released from height Ho as shown in the figure below. It collides with 
the  floor  for  the  first  time  and  bounces  back  and  rises  up  to  height  H1  and  again  drops 
down. The second time it collides with the floor and again bounces back to height H2 and 
so on… 

The  coefficient  of  restitution  in  each  collision  is  c,  where  c  is  strictly  less  than  1.  Thus, 
after each collision, the height up to which the ball rises back is reduced. 

•	 What is the relation between Ho and H1? 
•	 As  time  tends  to  infinity,  how  many  times  the  ball  would  have  bounced  off  the 
floor? 
•	 What is the total distance traveled by the ball?
