Free and forced system response 

Problem 1. Rack and pinion 

Consider the rack and the pinion system shown in Fig.1 below as in Problem 1 of 
Pset 8. The axis of the pinion is fixed in frictionless bearings. A massless rocket is 
attached to the circular massless pulley of radius a at a point along its edge as 
shown in the figure. It exerts a thrust F(t) which remains tangential to the pulley 
at all times.  Assume that the pinion can be modeled as a uniform cylinder of 
mass m2 and radius b and that the friction between the rack and the horizontal 
surface can be modeled as viscous damping having a dashpot constant c. 

a. 	 Find the equilibrium of the system, and linearize the equations of motion 
about it. 
b.	 Reduce the system to the canonical form with equivalent mass, spring, 
dashpot, and generalized force. Identify the values of parameters ωn and ζ. 
c. 	 Determine the conditions on the values of m1, m2, k and c for which the 
system is under-damped, critically damped and over-damped. 
d. 	 For F(t) = Fo cos(ωt), determine the particular solution to the ODE. 
Determine the value of the driving frequency at which the resonance 
occurs (when ζ = 0).

Problem 2. Design the rack and pinion system 

Constraints on the operation of the system in Problem 1 (about equilibrium) 
require that the system operates in the underdamped mode, with a maximum 
overshoot of 15% and a peak time of 1 ms. The mass of the rack is m1 = 50 kg, and 
that of the pinion is m2 = 20 kg. 

a.  Find k and c required to meet the above specifications. 

b.  Approximately how long will it take the system to settle?

Problem 3. Gear train 

Consider the gear train shown in Fig. 2 below, which consists of three gears, G1, 
G2, and G3,  having radii R1, R2, and R3, and moments of inertia I1, I2, and I3 about 
their centers, respectively.  G1 is connected to a bearing via a shaft having a 
torsional stiffness k such that, when G1 rotates by an angle θ1, an opposing torque 
kθ1 develops about its center. G2 is connected to a bearing which has an angular 
viscous coefficient c such that, when G2 rotates by an angle θ2, an opposing 
torque cθ2 develops about its center. G1 and G2 mesh without backlash (no 
slipping), and G2 and G3 are connected by a rigid, massless shaft. A driving 
counterclockwise torque T(t) is applied to G1. 

a.	 Find the equation of motion of the system. 
b.	 Find the equilibrium of the system, and linearize the equation of motion 
about it. 
c. 	 Reduce the system to the canonical form with equivalent mass, spring, 
dashpot, and generalized force. Identify the values of parameters ωn and ζ. 
d. 	 Determine the conditions on the values of I1, I2, I3, k and c for which the 
system is under-damped, critically damped and over-damped. 
e.	 Determine the conditions on the values of I1, I2, I3, k and c for which the 
system is under-damped with a settling time of 1 s and a maximum 
overshoot of 10%. 
f. 	 For T(t) = To cos(ωt), determine the particular solution to the ODE. 
Determine the value of the driving frequency at which the resonance 
occurs (when ζ = 0).

Problem 4. Mass-spring-dashpot in rotating frame 

A mass m lies in a frictionless groove, on a disk that lies on the horizontal plane 
and rotates at a constant angular velocity Ω, as shown in Fig. 3 below. The mass 
is attached to the center of the disk by a spring and dashpot system, with 
constants k and c respectively. 

a.	 Find the equation of motion of the system. 
b.	 Find any equilibrium point(s). 
c. 	 Reduce the system to the canonical form with equivalent mass, spring, and 
dashpot. Identify the values of parameters ωn and ζ. 
d. 	 For what values of Ω are the equilibrium points unstable?  
e.	 Assuming Ω is chosen so that the equilibrium is stable, determine the 
conditions on the values of m, k and c for which the system is under-
damped, critically damped and over-damped.

Problem 5. Automobile suspension 

A car’s suspension system can be modeled as shown in the figure below. Assume 
the car is made of two equal masses m attached via a spring of constant k and a 
dashpot of constant c. The vertical position of the lower mass, y2(t), is a known 
function determined by the terrain on which the car rides. Note that gravity acts. 

a.	 Find the equation of motion of the system. 
b.	 Find the equilibrium position and examine whether it is stable. Linearize 
the equation of motion if necessary. 
c. 	 Determine the conditions on the values of m, r, k and c for which the 
system is under-damped, critically damped and over-damped. 
d. 	 Assume the vehicle travels horizontally at a constant speed over a 
sinusoidal terrain, such that y2(t) = h sin( Ωt). Determine the 
particularsolution to the ODE. For what value of Ω will resonance occur 
(when ζ = 0) ?
