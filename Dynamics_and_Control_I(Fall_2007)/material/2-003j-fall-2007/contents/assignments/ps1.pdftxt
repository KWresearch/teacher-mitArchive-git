Due: Monday, 17 September, 2007  


1. Curvilinear translation 

A  rotating  arm  and  a  horizontal  platform  are  shown  in  the  figure  below.  The  arm  has 
length L and  rotates  in  the anti-clockwise direction. The  system  is designed  such  that  the 
platform always remains horizontal as shown in the figure. This type of the motion of the 
platform is called as the curvilinear translation (illustrated in Figure 3-6 in the textbook). 
A  person  P  is  starts  walking  on  the  platform.  Set  up  appropriate  frames,  define 
appropriate  parameter(s)  and  find  the  acceleration  of  P with  respect  to  an  observer  fixed 
to the ground.

2. Sliding ladder 

A ladder of length L leans on a wall perpendicular to the ground. The ladder starts sliding 
on  the  wall  and  the  ground.  Set  up  appropriate  frames,  define  appropriate  parameter(s) 
and  find  the  acceleration  of  the  center  of  the  ladder  with  respect  to  an  observer  fixed  to 
the ground.

3. Robot manipulator 

A  robot  arm  consisting  of  links  A  and  B,  and  the  end-effector  E  is  shown  in  the  figure 
below.  Link  A  rotates  in  the  anti-clockwise  direction  with  a  constant  angular  speed  ωA, 
while link B rotates in the anti-clockwise direction with a constant angular speed ωB with 
respect  to  link  A.  End-effector  E  slides  along  link  B.  Set  up  appropriate  frames,  define 
appropriate  parameter(s)  and  find  the  acceleration  of E with  respect  to  an  observer  fixed 
to the ground.
