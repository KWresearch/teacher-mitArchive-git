1.  Rack and pinion (Modified from Williams, Problem 6-109) 

A rack and pinion system is sketched in Figure P6-109.  The axis of the pinion is fixed in 
frictionless  bearings.  A  massless  rocket  is  attached  to  the  circular  massless  pulley  of 
radius  a  at  a  point  along  its  edge  as  shown  in  the  figure.  It  exerts  thrust  F(t)  which 
remains tangential to the pulley at all times.   Assume that the pinion can be modeled as a 
uniform  cylinder  of mass m2  and  radius  b  and  that  the  friction  between  the  rack  and  the 
horizontal  surface  can  be  modeled  as  viscous  damping  having  a  dashpot  constant  c. 
Derive the equation(s) of motion for the system using Lagrangian approach.
