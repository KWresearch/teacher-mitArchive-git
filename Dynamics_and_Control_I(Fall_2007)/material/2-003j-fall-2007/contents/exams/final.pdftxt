Figure for Problem 1 

A  robotic  arm  shown  in  the  figure  above  consists  of  link A  and  link B. Link A  rotates  at 
constant  angular  speed  q#1  = �  (with  respect  to  an  inertial  frame),  driven  by  a  motor  at 
point O. Link A  is  also  telescoping,  i.e.,  increasing  in  length  at  a  constant  rate v from  an 
initial  length  L.  Link  B  is  driven  by  a  motor  at  point  Q  and  rotates  at  constant  angular 
speed  q# 2  = θ with  respect  to  link A.  Link  B  can  be  taken  as  a  rigid  thin  rod  of  constant 
length l. Note that gravity acts, the mass of link B is m, and the center of mass of link B is 
point C. 

The motor  at  point Q must  clearly apply a  torque  (a moment  couple,  in  fact)  to  link B  to 
make  it  move  the  way  it  does.  We  seek  to  calculate  this  torque  for  motor  and  bearing 
sizing purposes. The sub-parts below break this up into two steps. 

Using the Newtonian approach: 

a.  (10 points) Find the acceleration of point C. 

b.  (10 points) Now find the torque exerted on link B by the motor at point Q.

Figure for Problem 2 

We  present  the model  of  the  lower-sheave  of  a  crane  –  the  part  the  hook  hangs  from. A 
pulley  of  mass  M  and  radius  R  is  connected  to  a  spring-damper  system,  with  spring 
constant  k1  and damping  constant  c, on one  side,  and  to  a  spring of  spring  constant  k2  on 
the other side, as shown  in  the figure above. The pulley (which can be approximated as a 
disk)  rolls  without  slipping  about  the  cable,  and  it  can  also  translate  upwards  and 
downwards along the vertical axis, but we assume that the pulley can’t move to the left or 
right,  so  that  the  springs  and  dashpot  remain  vertical  at  all  times. Note  that  gravity  acts. 
We  wish  to  examine  the  behavior  of  the  pulley  and  need  the  equations  of  motion,  say 
when  the  pulley  is  pulled  down  (with  some  rotation  due  to  unequal  extensions  of  cable-
lengths AP and BQ) and released. Broad redundant hint: The system has 2 dof’s! 

(20  points)  Using  the  Lagrangian  approach,  find  the  equation(s)  of  motion  of  the 
system.

Figure for Problem 3 

We seek to model the behavior of skateboard in a half-pipe. A rectangular block of center 
C, mass m,  length  2a,  and width  2b,  slides  along  a  semicircular  surface  of  center O  and 
radius  R,  as  shown  in  Figure.  The  block  and  surface  are  both  smooth  so  that  frictional 
forces can be neglected. Note that gravity acts. Ignore any friction or air-drag. 
Hint:  We  recommend  using  the  angle  �  shown  in  the  figure  as  one  of  the  generalized 
coordinates to simplify the math later. Do you need others? 

Using the Lagrangian approach: 

a.  (2  points)  Gimme  question:  How  many  degrees  of  freedom  does  the  system  have? 
Define the corresponding generalized coordinate(s). 

b.  (7 points) Find the equation(s) of motion of the system. 

c.  (4 points) Find the equilibrium position(s) of the system in the physically meaningful 
range of 
�� π
0 π 

d.  (7 points) Linearize the equation(s) of motion about the equilibrium position(s) found 
in (c), and study the stability of each equilibrium position.

Figure for Problem 4 

We  are  studying  the  behavior  of  a  winch  where  we  worry  about  vibration.  A  pulley  of 
mass M and radius R has a cable wound around it. The cable is attached to an immovable, 
effectively fixed,  load on  the other side. The cable can be modeled as having on one side 
a  spring  constant  k  and  damping  constant  c,  and  on  the other  side  a  spring  constant  k,  as 
shown  in  the  figure  above.  The  pulley  (which  can  be  approximated  as  a  disk)  can  rotate 
about  its  fixed  spindle with  axis  through point S. The  cable winds  around  the pulley and 
the  pulley  rotates  without  slipping.  The  springs  and  dashpot  remain  horizontal  at  all 
times.  The  system  is  un-stretched  but  taut  in  the  stated  configuration.  The  pulley  is 
rotated by a small amount and then released. 

Using any approach you prefer: 

a.	 (15  points)  Find  k  and  c  so  that  the  system  has  a  damped  natural  frequency  �  (a 
known value) and a damping coefficient � = 0.8. 

b.	 (5  points)  Keeping  the  springs  and  dashpot  with  the  values  that  were  found  in  a, 
assume  now  that  the  pulley  is  replaced  with  a  larger  pulley  of  radius  2R  but  having 
the same mass M. How will the system’s damping factor � change?

stick is super-glued

Figure for Problem 5 

In this problem we will study the dynamics of a pogo-stick. An odd friend of yours has 
super-glued a pogo-stick to the ground and is now jumping on it. To model this, assume 
that the pogo-stick and your friend can be treated as a lumped mass m, connected to a 
spring dashpot system with spring constant k and damping constant c, as shown in the 
figure. The jumping action can be modeled as exerting a force F(t) = Fosin(�t). Ignore 
lateral motion, and assume the spring and dashpot remain vertical at all times. Remember 
that in parts (a) and (b), we will assume that the lower end of the pogo-stick is fixed to 
the ground at joint J by using super-glue. Gravity can be neglected in this problem. 

Using any approach you prefer: 

a.	 (2 points) Define  the  generalized  coordinate(s)  and  find  the  equation(s) of motion of 
the system. 

b.	 (8  points)  Derive  the  particular  solution  and  the  complete  solution  for  the 
displacement  of  the mass. Assume  the  system  is  under-damped.  Leave  any unknown 
constants as unknowns because we haven’t given you initial conditions. 

c.	 (10 points)  In  this  part we  assume  that  enough  time has  passed  so  that we only have 
to  worry  about  the  particular  solution.  We  worry,  in  fact  even  hope,  that  the  super-
glue  joint  is  going  to  fail, much  to  the merriment  of all. For  this we need  to calculate 
the vertical  force on  the  joint  J. Please derive  that  force. What  is  the maximum value 
that this force can have?
