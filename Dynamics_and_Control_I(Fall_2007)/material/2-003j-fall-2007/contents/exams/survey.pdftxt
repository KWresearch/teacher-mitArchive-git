2.003J/1.053J Dynamics and Control I 
Fall 2007 
 
A Benevolent Quiz 
5 September, 2007 

 
Important Notes: 
1.  This quiz does not count towards the final grade. 
2.  It  consists  of  two  parts.  The  first  part  consists  of  five  problems  that  you  should  be 
able  to  easily  solve  based  on  your  prerequisites  (8.01,  18.03).  The  second  part 
consists  of  three  problems which  give  you  a  glimpse  into  the  kind  problems we will 
be dealing with in this class. We hope that you would be able to solve these problems 
by the end of the semester.

Part I: Prerequisites check 
1. Suppose  that a weighing  scale measures  the  reaction  force exerted on  it and shows  the 
reading  as  the  corresponding  weight  value.  See  the  figure  below  and  the  corresponding 
force diagrams. 

N

mg 

N = mg 

 
Thus,  a  person with mass m  exerts  a  reaction  force N  (which  is  equal  to mg  in  this  case) 
on  the  weighing  scale.  The  weighing  scale  measures  the  value  of  N  and  divides  it  by 
gravitational acceleration g and shows the corresponding mass. Now the person takes this 
weighing  scale  to  an  elevator  and  decides  to  perform  a  small  experiment.  In  each  of  the 
following  cases,  write  down  the  reading  shown  by  the  weighing  scale.  Clearly  draw  the 
corresponding force diagram.  

1. Elevator is moving down with uniform velocity V.

2. Elevator is moving down with uniform 
acceleration a, where a < g.

3. Elevator is falling freely.

2. A bullet of mass m moving with the uniform velocity V hits a box of mass M as shown 
in the figure below. After penetrating the box, the bullet remains in the box. Find the final 
velocity  of  the  combined  mass.  Assume  that  there  no  friction  at  the  contact  surface 
between the box and the ground.

3. A mass m falls freely under gravity from height h on a weightless platform attached  to 
a  spring  with  spring  constant  k  as  shown  in  the  figure  below.  The  mass  sticks  to  the 
platform after  it  falls on  it. Find  the maximum distance  the mass moves downwards after 
it sticks to the platform.

Part II: Sample future problems 
1.  Alice  and  Bob  are  sitting  facing  each  other  on  a merry-go-round  at  two  diametrically 
opposite  locations.  The  merry-go-round  is  rotating  clockwise  at  a  constant  angular 
velocity  ω  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Alice  pushes  a  hockey-puck  (a  disk-shaped  object) 
along  the  floor  of  the merry-go-round  straight  towards Bob. Both  the  puck  and  the  floor 
are  smooth. Do  you  think  that  the  puck will  reach  Bob?   How  does  the  trajectory  of  the 
puck look to: 
•  Bob? 
•  a stationary observer seeing from above?

2.  A  semicircular  well  of  radius  R  and  a  disc  of  mass  m  and  radius  r  are  shown  in  the 
figure  below. We  paint  an  arrow  on  the  disc  from  the  center  C  going  radially  outwards. 
Initially  the  disc  is  held  such  that  the  disc  touches  the  tip  of  the  well  and  the  arrow  is 
exactly  horizontal  as  shown  in  the  figure  (the  dotted  circle).  The  disc  is  then  suddenly 
released.  Note  that  gravity  acts.  Derive  the  equation  that  specifies  the  orientation  of  the 
arrow  as  observed  by  a  stationary  observer  (looking  directly  into  the  page)  as  a  function 
of time when: 
• 
the disc and the well are smooth. 
• 
the disc purely rolls on the surface of the well.

3. An L-shaped groove  is shown  in  the  figure below.   Two ends of a slender  rod of mass 
m  and  length  L  are  attached  to  identical  springs,  each with  a  spring  constant  k.  Both  the 
springs  are  fixed  to  the L-shaped  groove  as  shown  in  the  figure  below. Both  the  ends  of 
the  rod  are  constrained  to move  only  along  the  L-shaped  groove.  Ignore  gravity  for  this 
problem. Determine the frequency of oscillations of the rod for small perturbations.
