1.  Sliding masses (30 points) 

An  L-shaped  rigid  platform  of mass M  slides  along  the  frictionless  floor  as  shown  in  the  figure 
below. The platform is connected to the fixed side walls by a mass-less spring of spring-constant 
k  and  a mass-less  dashpot  of  damping-constant  c.  A  smaller mass  m  slides  along  the  horizontal 
edge of  the platform without  friction. As  shown  in  the  figure,  the small mass  is connected  to  the 
vertical  edge  of  the  platform  by  a mass-less  spring  of  spring-constant  k  and  a mass-less  dashpot 
of damping-constant c. Constant horizontal force F is applied to the smaller mass. Determine the 
equation(s) of motion of the system using the Lagrangian approach. Assume that both the springs 
are initially un-stretched.

2.  Cam follower – a rolling disc and an oscillating slender rod (35 points) 

A rigid disc of mass M and radius R rolls along the horizontal surface without slippage. The axle 
through the center of the disc is connected to each side-wall by a spring of spring-constant k. The 
springs  are  un-stretched  in  the  center  position  shown  in  the  left  of  the  figure.  A  slender  rod  of 
mass  m  and  length  l  rides  on  top  of  the  roller  without  friction.  The  rod  is  constrained  to  move 
only  vertically,  and  assume  that  it  remains  in  contact  with  the  disc  at  all  times.  The  disc  is 
disturbed  to  the  right or  the  left and  the whole assembly  starts motion –  the disc  to  the  right and 
left, and the rod up and down. Clearly, the system has just one degree of freedom as shown in the 
figure  to  the  right. Hint: Use  the  rotation of  the disc  as your  (obvious) generalized coordinate as 
shown in the figure. 

a.  Define  appropriate  frames  and  determine  the  velocity  of  the  rod  with  respect  to  a  frame 
attached to the ground in terms of q and its derivatives. (10 points) 
b.  Determine the equation of motion of the system using the Lagrangian approach. (20 points) 
c.  You have assumed (because we asked you to) that the rod remains in contact with the disc at 
all  times. How would you determine  later whether  this assumption was valid? Don’t actually 
solve for it, just say it in English (or French). (5 points)

3.  Ski-board on an incline (35 points) 

In  this  problem  we  will  study  dynamics  of  a  ski-board  sliding  down  an  incline  via  a  simple 
model. The ski-board is modeled as a slender rod of mass m and length 2l with two end-points P 
and Q as shown in the figure below. Let C be the center of the rod. The moment of inertia of the 
rod  about  the  axis  coming out of  the page  through C  is 1 ml 2  . The  incline makes 45o  angle with 
3 
the horizontal. Each of  the end-points P and Q  is connected  to a separate mass-less platform  that 
rolls  along  the  inclined  surface  by  a  spring  of  spring-constant  k.  The  center  of  the  rod  is 
connected  to yet  another mass-less platform  that  rolls  along  the  inclined  surface by  a dashpot of 
damping-constant  c.  The  mass-less  trucks  always  maintain  contact  with  the  incline  and  ensure 
that  the  springs  and  the  dashpot  always  remain  perpendicular  to  the  inclined  surface.  In  this 
simple setting, we sum up  the effect of a person standing on  the ski-board as an external  force F 
that  always  acts  vertically  downwards  at  point  Q  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Assume  that  both  the 
springs are  initially un-stretched. Determine  the equation(s) of motion of  the  ski-board using  the 
Lagrangian  approach  following  the  six  steps  we  studied  in  the  class:  define  frames  and 
generalized  coordinate(s),  find  kinetic  energy,  find  potential  energy,  define  Lagrangian  of  the 
system, take derivatives and find the generalized force(s).
