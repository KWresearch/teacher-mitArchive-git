1.  Problem 1 (20 Points) 
 

 
 
Figure 1 

 

 
Two  blocks  of masses m1  and m2  are  connected  by  a  spring with  a  spring  constant  k  and 
are  free  to  slide on a horizontal  surface as shown  in Figure 1(a).   The drag between each 
mass  and  the  surface  can  be  modeled  as  viscous  damping  with  a  dashpot  constant  c  as 
shown  in Figure 1(b).    Initially  the masses are at  rest and  the spring  is un-stretched.   At  t 
= 0, a horizontal force F is applied to mass m2.   Derive the equation(s) of motion for  this 
system.

2.  Problem 2 (20 Points) 
 

Figure 2 

 

 
 
A  block  of mass m2 with  a  semi-circular well  of  radius R  is  free  to  slide  on  a  horizontal 
surface with no friction as shown in Figure 2. Before t = 0, the block is at rest and a point 
mass m1  is held at  the  tip of  the well. At t = 0,  the point mass m1  is released and both  the 
masses are free to move thereafter. Derive the equation(s) of motion for this system. 
 
Hint: Start by picking the generalized coordinates. List your steps.

3.  Problem 3 (20 Points) 
 
 
 
 

 
Figure 3 

 

 
 
A  disc  of mass m  and  radius  r  is  sandwiched  between  a  horizontal  surface  and  a  slender 
rod of mass m which can slide in and out of a horizontal groove without friction as shown 
in Figure 3. The disc rolls without  slippage with  respect  to both  the horizontal bottom as 
well  as  the  rod.  The  rod  is  connected  to  a  spring  of  a  spring  constant  k  as  shown  in  the 
figure,  and  the  other  end  of  the  spring  is  attached  to  the  inertial  frame.  Assume  some 
length  L0  of  the  un-stretched  spring  â€“  although  that  will  turn  out  to  be  irrelevant  to  the 
problem. The rod is pulled out the groove such that the spring is stretched by some length 
and then released. 
 
a.  Show  that  at  any  instant  the  velocity  of  the  rod  with  respect  to  a  frame  fixed  to  the 
ground is twice the velocity of the center of the disc with respect to the same frame. 
b.  Derive the equation(s) of motion for this system.
