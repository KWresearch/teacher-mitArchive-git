1.  A space shuttle orbiter and an astronaut 

Figure 1 

A space shuttle  is orbiting  the earth  in a circular orbit with a constant angular speed ω as 
shown in Figure 1. A point Q fixed on the space shuttle is at distance R from the origin O. 
Frame A  is  fixed. Frame B  is  attached  to  the  space  shuttle. The  space  shuttle  orbits  such 
that  the  basis  vector  b2  always  remains  tangential  to  the  orbit  as  shown  in  the  figure. 
• 
Clearly,θ = ω . 
• 
a.  Find the acceleration of point Q with respect to frame A as a function of θ andθ . 
• 
b.	 An  astronaut  represented  by  point P  begins  to walk with  a  constant  speed  d with 
respect  to  the  space  shuttle  along  –b2,  i.e.  the  negative  b2  direction  from  the 
cockpit  towards  point  Q  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Find  the  acceleration  of  P  with 
respect to frame A if P is at distance d from point Q. 
• 
c.	 Find  a  relationship  between  d   and  ω  such  that  at  a  certain  location  on  her  path, 
her acceleration with respect to frame A is exactly zero. Find that location as well 
relative to the space shuttle.

2.  L-shape 

Figure 2 

Consider  the  L-shaped  structure,  shown  in  Figure  2,  which  consists  of  two  slender  rods 
A1 and A2 that are glued together. Each has mass m and length L. A massless(!) rocket is 
attached  to  one  end  of  rod A1. At  t  =  0,  the  rocket  is  ignited  and  it  produces  a  thrust  of 
magnitude  F  on  the  L-shape.  Throughout  the  motion,  the  direction  of  force  F  remains 
perpendicular  to  rod  A1  as  shown  in  the  figure.  Ignore  gravity  and  assume  that  the 
motion is planer. 
a.	 Find the center of mass of the L-shaped object. 
b.	 Assume  that  the  L-shaped  object  behaves  as  a  rigid  body  in  2D.  Define 
convenient  frames,  identify  generalized  co-ordinates  of  the  L-shaped  object  and 
find the equations of motion of the system.

3.  System of pulleys 

Figure 3 

a.	 A point mass of mass  m  is hanging from a thin, massless and inextensible string that 
2 
winds  several  turns  around  a  pulley  of mass m  and  radius  r  as  shown  in  Figure  3(a). 
The pulley  is  free  to  rotate  about  the pivot  supported  from  the  table  and  accordingly, 
the string winds/unwinds and the point mass moves up and down. This system can be 
imagined  as  a  spool.  Initially  the  point  mass  is  supported  such  that  it  is  hanging 
vertically and suddenly the support is removed. Using the work-energy principle, find 
the acceleration of the point mass. Note that gravity acts. 
Instead of one pulley, now suppose  that  the same point mass  is hanging  from a string 
that goes over  two  identical pulleys, each of mass m and  radius r, as shown  in Figure 
3(b). The  left-most pulley acts  like a spool. Find  the acceleration of  the point mass  in 
this case. 
c.	 Observe  the  pattern  of  your  answers  in  part  a  and  part  b.  Based  on  this,  how  many 
identical  pulleys  you  need  to  design  a  system  such  that  the  acceleration  of  the  point 
mass is  g  , where g is the acceleration due to gravity.
