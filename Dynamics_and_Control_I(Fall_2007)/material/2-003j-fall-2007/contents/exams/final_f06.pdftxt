Problem 1:  Non-uniform disc (20 points) 

Figure 1 

A  non-uniform disc of mass m  and  radius  r has  its  center of mass C  at  a distance d  from 
the  center  of  the  disc  Q,  as  shown  in  figure  1.  The  disc  rolls  on  the  horizontal  surface 
without slippage. 

Initially,  the  disc  is  oriented  such  that  C  lies  vertically  below  Q,  after  which  it  is 
perturbed  and  starts  rolling. Let θ be  the  instantaneous angle  that  the  segment QC makes 
with  the  vertical  direction,  measured  in  the  anti-clockwise  direction  as  shown  in  the 
figure, and let I be the moment of inertia of the disc about point C.  Note that gravity acts. 

a.	

• •
• 
In  terms of θ  and  its derivatives θ  and θ ,  find  the acceleration of C with  respect  to a 
frame that is fixed to the ground. 

Now  use  the Newtonian method  (linear  and  angular momentum  equations)  to  derive  the 
equation of motion for the system as follows. 

b.	 Can  you  use  the  torque  equation  about  the  instantaneous  center  of  rotation  (ICR)? 
Explain. 
c.	 Using  the  torque equation about  the center of mass of  the disc and any other  relevant 
equations, show that the equation of motion is: 
[I  +  m (r  +  d  − 2 rd  cos θ )]θ +  mrd  θ

Problem 2: Non-uniform disc: equilibria and stability (15 points) 

Figure 2 

Consider  the  motion  of  the  non-uniform  disc  studied  in  problem  1.    You  may  use  the 
following equation to describe it: 

sin θ +  mgd  sin θ =  0 

[I  +  m (r  +  d  − 2 rd  cos θ )]θ +  mrd  θ

a.	 For  the  above  system,  find  the  two  equilibrium  points  greater  than  or  equal  to  0  and 
less than 2π. 
b.	 Linearize  the  equation  of  motion  about  both  the  equilibrium  points  and  assess  the 
stability  of  each.  You  may  ignore  any  quadratic  or  higher  order  terms  that  arise  in 
terms  of  the  perturbation  variable  or  its  derivatives.  For  the  stable  equilibrium, 
determine the natural frequency of oscillation.

Problem 3: A rolling disc between parallel rods (20 points) 

Figure 3 

A  disc  of mass m  and  radius  r  is  sandwiched  between  two  slender  rods,  each  of mass m 
and  length  L.  Each  rod  can  slide  in  and  out  of  a  horizontal  groove  without  friction,  as 
shown  in  figure  3.  The  system  starts  at  rest  in  a  position  in  which  both  the  springs  are 
relaxed. The disc  rolls without  slippage with  respect  to both  rods. Each  rod  is  connected 
to  a massless  spring with  spring  constant  k, and  the other end of  the  spring  is attached  to 
the  inertial  frame.  The  system  starts  moving  when  one  of  the  rods  is  pulled  out  and 
released. 

Ignore gravity and derive the equation(s) of motion for this system. 

Hint: This system has two degrees of freedom. If you know the displacements of the rods 
then  the  displacement  and  rotation  of  the  disc  is  uniquely  determined.  We  recommend 
that you write this kinematic constraint out right at the outset.

Problem 4: Composite system (25 points) 

Figure 4 

The system shown in figure 4 consists of four rigid-bodies as described below. 

The  first  block  rolls  on  small,  massless  wheels  and  is  connected  to  a  fixed  wall  using  a 
massless  spring  with  spring  constant  k  and  a massless  dashpot  with  damping  coefficient 
c.  This block  is connected  to a massless,  rigid  rod with  two bearings. At each bearing, a 
disc  of  mass  m  and  radius  r  is  mounted.  The  rod  is  horizontal.  Each  disc  rolls  on  the 
horizontal  surface  without  slippage.  A  horizontal  force  F(t)  is  applied  to  the  free  end  of 
the rod. 

a.	 Derive the equation(s) of motion for the system. 
b.	 Reduce  the  equation(s)  to  an  equivalent  system  consisting  of  a  mass,  a  spring  and  a 
dashpot and an external force. 
c.	 What  is  the natural  frequency of  this  system?   Determine  the  conditions under which 
the  homogeneous  solution  to  system  is  underdamped,  critically  damped  and 
overdamped. 

Now assume that F(t) = F0 cos(Ωt). 

d.	 What is the time response of the system under this forcing in the underdamped case? 
If  the  damping  coefficient  is  zero,  for  what  value  of  Ω  do  you  expect  to  see 
e.	
resonance?

Problem 5: A rolling disc on a see-saw (20 points) 

Figure 5 

A  rigid,  massless  rod  of  length  L  is  free  to  rotate  about  a  pivot  through  its  center.  Both 
ends of the rod are attached to two identical, massless springs with spring constant k.  The 
other  ends  of  the  springs  are  fixed  to  the  ground.  Initially,  the  rod  is  horizontal  and  both 
the  springs  are un-stretched.  A disc of mass m  and  radius  r  is placed  at  the  center of  the 
rod.  The  disc  rolls  on  the  rod  without  slippage.  (The  dashed  lines  in  figure  5  show  a 
possible alternative configuration of the system) 

Choose  appropriate  generalized  coordinate(s)  for  this  system  and  derive  the  equation(s) 
of motion using a method of your choice.  Note that gravity acts.
