This page presents videos for the first half of the class lectures. These
lectures are particularly important because they contain the new kinematics
approach.
Note: video is not available for Lecture 6.
Disclaimer from Professor Sarma: A lecture is like a live performance â there
are no retakes. So when you watch these videos, please keep in mind that I am
human, and I make mistakes. For example, at minute 12 of the video of Lec #2 I
make a mistake when I describe why the earth is an approximate inertial frame.
What I mean to say is that the Earth, though moving, is accelerating relatively
slowly with respect to some imaginary but real inertial frame when compared
with, say a space-craft. So we treat it as an inertial frame, and experiments
show that that is a good approximation. That's not how I say it in the video,
but the students did understand what I meant because the staff of the class
interact with the students in a number of ways. So watch these videos but stay
alert â and keep in mind that besides making mistakes, I also sometimes joke
with my students.
