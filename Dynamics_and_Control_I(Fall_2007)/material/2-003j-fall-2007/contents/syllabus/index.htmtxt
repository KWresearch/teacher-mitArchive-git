***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
MATLABÂ® Sessions: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
***** Course Goals *****
This version of the class stresses kinematics and builds around a strict but
powerful approach to kinematic formulation which is different from the more
traditional approach presented in Spring 2007.
Our notation was adapted from that of Professor Kane of Stanford University. We
use strict frames, a strict notation for relative velocities and accelerations,
frame-oriented derivates of vectors, and a constructive approach to the
derivation of linear and angular velocities and accelerations.
***** Course Materials *****
**** Required Text ****
[Amazon_logo] Williams, J. H., Jr. Fundamentals of Applied Dynamics. New York,
NY: John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2006. ISBN: 9780470133859.
**** Recommended Reading ****
[Amazon_logo] Meriam, J. L., and L. G. Kraige. Engineering Mechanics: Dynamics.

***** Class Meetings *****
**** Course Structure ****
Each week, there will be two class lectures, one MATLABÂ® session, and one
recitation.
    * Lectures will be held for 90-minute periods twice per week. Lecture
      attendance is mandatory. Attendance and participation will be part of the
      grade.
    * You will be assigned to a MATLAB_session that meets once per week,
      covering material relevant to the course and problem sets. These sessions
      are a mix of lecture and hands-on lab activities.
    * The purpose of the recitations is to give students experience in the
      subject by working out examples and expanding on the material presented
      in the lectures. Attendance and participation in the recitations is
      mandatory.
***** Problem Sets *****
There will be two types of problem sets, one for the dynamics part and one for
the MATLAB part. Dynamics problem sets will typically be assigned on Mondays
and due the next Monday. They are available in the assignments section. To
receive credit, problem sets must be handed in at the beginning of class on the
due date. Because of holidays, tests, etc., some problem sets may be provided
and will be due on days other than Mondays for some weeks. For the same reason,
they may not be assigned for a particular week. Late problem sets will not be
accepted. MATLAB problem sets will be handed out during MATLAB sessions and
will be due in class on the due-date.
**** Honesty on Problem Sets ****
You are welcome, and encouraged, to work on the assignment problems with fellow
students. A good way to learn the material is in small study groups. Such
groups work best if members have attempted the problems individually before
meeting as a group. Of course, the assignment solution that you turn in should
reflect your own understanding, and not that of your fellow students. In other
words, do not copy directly from other students. If it is obvious that such
direct copying has occurred, we will disallow that homework.
***** Tests *****
    * There will be two in-class mid-term exams. They are scheduled for:
          o Wednesday, Lec #13
          o Monday, Lec #19
    * The 3-hour final exam will be scheduled by the Registrar's Office.
    * All the exams (including the final) will be closed book. One sheet of
      handwritten notes will be allowed at the first mid-term exam, two sheets
      at the second mid-term exam, and three sheets at the final exam.
    * There will be two optional review sessions before each mid-term exam.
