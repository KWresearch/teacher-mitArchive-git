***** Course Description *****
This course studies representative twentieth and twenty-first-century texts and
films from Hispanic America and Spain. Emphasis is on developing strategies for
analyzing the genres of the novel, the short story, the poem, the fictional
film, and the theatrical script. The novels read this semester are Magali
GarcÃ­a Ramis's Felices dÃ­as, TÃ­o Sergio (1986, Puerto Rico) and Javier
Cercas's Soldados de Salamina (2001, Spain). We will study Lorca's play "La
casa de Bernarda Alba" (1936, Spain), films from Spain, MÃ©xico, and Cuba,
poems by DarÃ­o (Nicaragua), Machado (Spain), Lorca (Spain), HernÃ¡ndez
(Spain), Vallejo (PerÃº), Cernuda (Spain), and Luis PalÃ©s Matos (Puerto Rico),
and short stories from MÃ©xico (by an exiled Spanish writer), Chile, Argentina,
and Cuba. Thematic emphasis is on the Spanish Civil War, changing attitudes
toward gender, the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, and the history of race in the
Americas.
