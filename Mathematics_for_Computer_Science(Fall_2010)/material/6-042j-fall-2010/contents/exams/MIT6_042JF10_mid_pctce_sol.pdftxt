Prove  that  an  ≡ 1  (mod  3)  for  all  n ≥ 0. 
Solution.  Proof  by  strong  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  predicate  that  an  ≡ 1  (mod  3). 

Base  case:  For  0 ≤ n ≤ 3,  an  = 1  and  is  therefore ≡ 1  (mod  3).

Inductive  step:  For  n ≥ 4,  assume  P (k)  for  0 ≤ k ≤ n  in  order  to  prove  P (n + 1).

In  particular,  since  each  of  an−4 ,  an−3 ,  an−2  and  an−1  is  ≡  1  (mod  3),  their  sum  must  be

≡ 4 ≡ 1  (mod  3).  Therefore,  an  ≡ 1  (mod  3)  and  P (n + 1)  holds.

Problem  3.  [20  points]  The  Slipped  Disc  Puzzle�  consists  of  a  track  holding  9  circular 
tiles.  In  the  middle  is  a  disc  that  can  slide  left  and  right  and  rotate  180 ◦  to  change  the 
positions  of  exactly  four  tiles.  As  shown  below,  there  are  three  ways  to  manipulate  the 
puzzle: 

Shift  Right:  The  center  disc  is moved  one  unit  to  the  right  (if  there  is  space) 

Rotate  Disc:  The  four  tiles  in  the  center  disc  are  reversed 

Shift  Left:  The  center  disc  is moved  one  unit  to  the  left  (if  there  is  space)

Prove  that  if  the  puzzle  starts  in  an  initial  state  with  all  but  tiles  1  and  2  in  their  natural 
order,  then  it  is  impossible to reach a goal state where all the tiles are  in their natural order. 
The  initial  and  goal  states  are  shown  below: 

Write  your  proof  on  the  next  page... 

Solution.  Order  the  tiles  from  left  to  right  in  the  puzzle.  Deﬁne  an  inversion  to  be  a  pair 
of  tiles  that  is  out  of  their  natural  order  (e.g.  4  appearing  to  the  left  of  3). 

Lemma.  Starting from the initial state there is an odd number of inversions after any number 
of  transitions. 

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  induction.  Let P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  starting  from  the  initial 
state  there  is  an  odd  number  of  inversions  after  n  transitions. 
Base  case:  After  0  transitions,  there  is  one  inversion,  so  P (0)  holds. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  P (n)  is  true.  Say  we  have  a  conﬁguration  that  is  reachable  after 
n + 1  transitions. 

1.  Case  1:  The  last  transition  was  a  shift  left  or  shift  right 
In  this  case,  the  left-to-right  order  of  the  discs  does  not  change  and  thus  the  number 
of  inversions  remains  the  same  as  in

2.  The  last  transition  was  a  rotate  disc. 
In  this  case,  six  pairs  of  disks  switch  order.  If  there  were  x  inversions  among  these 
pairs  after  n  transitions,  there  will  be  6 − x  inversions  after  the  reversal.  If  x  is  odd, 
6 − x  is  odd,  so  after  n + 1  transitions  the  number  of  inversions  is  odd. 

Conclusion:  Since  all  reachable  states have  an  odd number  of  inversions  and  the  goal  state 
� 
has  an  even  number  of  inversions  (speciﬁcally  0),  the  goal  state  cannot  be  reached.

Problem  4.  [10  points]  Find  the  multiplicative  inverse  of  17  modulo  72  in  the  range 
{0, 1, . . . , 71}. 
Solution.  Since  17 and 72 = 2332  are  relatively  prime,  an  inverse  exists  and  can  be  found 
by  either  Euler’s  theorem  or  the  Pulverizer. 

Solution  1:  Euler’s  Theorem 

· 
φ(72) = φ(23  32 )
· 
= φ(23 )  φ(32 ) 
= (23  − 22 )(32  − 31 ) 
· 
= 4  6 = 24 

(since  23  and  32  are  rel.  prime) 
(since  2  and  3  are  prime) 

Therefore, 17φ(72)−1  = 1723  is an inverse of 17.  To ﬁnd the inverse in the range {0, 1, . . . , 71}
we  take  the  remainder  using  the method  of  repeated  squaring: 

17 = 17 
172  = 289 
≡ 1 
174  ≡ 12  = 1

178  ≡ 1

. . . etc. 

· 
(since  289 = 4  72 + 1) 

Therefore  the  inverse  of  17  in  the  range  {0, 1, . . . , 71}  is  given  by, 

1723  = 1716174172171 
≡ 1  1  1  17

Since  172  − 4  72 = 1, 172  ≡ 1  (mod  72)  and  so  17  is  self  inverse.

Problem  5  continued... 
Now suppose each building has separate mail collection and drop-oﬀ boxes and each collection 
box  has  a  single  package  destined  for  a  unique  drop-oﬀ  box  (i.e.  a  permutation).  We  can 
model this as a permutation routing problem by treating the buildings as switches, attaching 
an  input  and  output  terminal  to  each  of  the  nine  buildings,  and  treating  the  existing  edges 
as  bidirectional  as  in  the  graph  below: 

(c)  [4 pts]  Give  the  diameter  of  this  graph: 

Solution.  The  diameter  is  8,  the  length  of  a  shortest  path  between  the  terminals  for 
� 
buildings  1  and  2. 

(d)  [4 pts] What is the max congestion of this graph?  That is, in the worst case permutation, 
how many packages would need  to pass  through a  single building?  Provide a brief argument 
for  your  answer. 

Solution.  The  maximum  congestion  is  9.  Consider  a  permutation  where  all  the  packages 
on  the  left  side  are destined  for drop-oﬀs  on  the  right  side  and  vice  versa with  the building 
10 package destined for building 10.  In this case, all 9 packages must pass through building 
10,  giving  a  congestion  of  9,  which  is  the  maximum  for  a  graph  with  nine  input-output 
� 
pairs.

Problem  6.  [10  points]

A  tournament  graph G = (V , E )  is  a directed  graph  such  that  there  is  either  an  edge  from u 
to  v  or  an  edge  from  v  to  u  for  every  distinct  pair  of  nodes  u  and  v .  (The  nodes  represent 
→ 
v  indicates  that  player  u  beats  player  v .)
players  and  an  edge  u
Consider  the  “beats”  relation  implied  by  a  tournament  graph.  Indicate whether  or  not  each 
of the following relational properties hold for  al l  tournament graphs and brieﬂy explain your 
reasoning.  You may  assume  that  a  player  never  plays  herself. 

1.  transitive 

Solution.  The  “beats”  relation  is  not  transitive  because  there  could  exist  a  cycle  of 
length 3 where x beats y , y  beats z  and z  beats x.  By the deﬁnition of a tournament, 
� 
x  cannot  then  beat  y  in  such  a  situation. 

2.  symmetric 

Solution.  The  “beats”  relation  is  not  symmetric  by  the  deﬁnition  of  a  tournament: 
� 
if  x  beats  y  then  y  does  not  beat  x. 

3.  antisymmetric 

Solution.  The  “beats”  relation  is  antisymmetric  since  for  any distinct players x  and 
� 
y ,  if  x  beats  y  then  y  does  not  beat  x. 

4.  reﬂexive 

Solution.  The  “beats”  relation  is  not  reﬂexive  since  a  tournament  graph  has  no 
� 
self-loops. 

Problem 7.  [20 points]  An outerplanar graph is an undirected graph for which the vertices 
can  be  placed  on  a  circle  in  such  a  way  that  no  edges  (drawn  as  straight  lines)  cross  each 
other.  For example,  the complete graph on 4 vertices, K4 ,  is not outerplanar but any proper 
subgraph of K4  with  strictly  fewer  edges  is outerplanar.  Some  examples are provided below: 

Prove  that  any  outerplanar  graph  is  3-colorable.  A  fact  you  may  use  without  proof  is  that 
any  outerplanar  graph  has  a  vertex  of  degree  at most  2. 

Midterm  Practice  Problems

Solution.  Proof.  Proof by induction on the number of nodes n with the induction hypothesis 
P (n) =  ”every  outerplanar  graph  with  n  vertices  is  3-colorable.” 

Base  case:  For  n  =  1  the  single  node  graph  with  no  edges  is  trivially  outerplanar  and 
3-colorable. 
Inductive step:  Assume P (n) holds and let Gn+1  be an outerplanar graph with n + 1 vertices. 
There must  exist  a  vertex  v  in Gn+1  with  degree  at most  2.  Removing  v  and  all  its  incident 
edges  leaves  a  subgraph Gn  with  n  vertices. 
Since Gn+1  could  be  drawn with  its  vertices  on  a  circle  and  its  edges  drawn  as  straight  lines 
without  intersections,  any  subgraph  can  also  be  drawn  in  such  a  way  and  so  Gn  is  also  an 
outerplanar  graph.  P (n)  implies  Gn  is  3-colorable.  Therefore  we  can  color  all  the  vertices 
in  Gn+1  other  than  v  using  only  3  colors  and  since  deg(v)  ≤  2  we  may  color  it  a  color 
diﬀerent  than  the  vertices  adjacent  to  it  using  only  3  colors.  Therefore,  Gn+1  is  3-colorable 
and  P (n + 1)  holds.
