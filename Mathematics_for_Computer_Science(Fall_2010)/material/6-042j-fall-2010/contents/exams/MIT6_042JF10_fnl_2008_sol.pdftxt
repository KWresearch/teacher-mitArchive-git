Problem 1.  [25 points]  The Final Breakdown 
Suppose the 6.042 ﬁnal consists of: 

•	 36 true/false questions worth 1 point each. 

•	 1 induction problem worth 15 points. 

•	 1 giant problem that combines everything from the semester, worth 49 points. 

Grading goes as follows: 

•	 The TAs  choose  to  grade  the  easy  true/false  questions.  For  each  individual point, 
they ﬂip a fair coin.  If it comes up heads, the student gets the point. 

•	 Marten and Brooke split the task of grading the induction problem. 

–	 With  1/3  probability,  Marten  grades  the  problem.  His  grading  policy  is  as 
follows:  Either he gets exasperated by the  improper use of math symbols and 
gives  0  points  (which  happens  with  2/5  probability),  or  he  ﬁnds  the  answer 
satisfactory and gives 15 points (which happens with 3/5 probability). 
–	 With  2/3  probability,  Brooke  grades  the  problem.  Her  grading  policy  is  as 
follows:  She selects a random integer point value from the range from 0 to 15, 
inclusive, with uniform probability. 

•	 Finally,  Tom  grades  the  giant  problem.  He  rolls  two  fair  seven-sided  dice  (which 
have values  from 1  to 7,  inclusive),  takes  their product,  and  subtracts  it  from 49  to 
determine the score.  (Example:  Tom rolls a 3 and a 4.  The score is then 49 − 3 4 = 
· 
37.) 

Assume all random choices during the grading process are mutually independent.

(a)  [7 pts] What is the expected score on the exam? 

Final Exam

Solution. 
36/2 + (1/3)15(3/5) + (2/3)15/2 + (49 − (4 ∗ 4)) = 18 + 3 + 5 + 33 = 59 

The  expected  score  on  the  exam  is  the  sum  of  the  expected  scores  on  the  individual 
problems. 

Ex (test score) = Ex (mc score) + Ex (ind score) + Ex (giant score) 

•	 The  expected  multiple  choice  score  is  just  the  sum  of  the  expectations  on  36  coin 
tosses. Since the coin is fair, the expected number of heads on each ﬂip is 1/2. There­
fore: 
· 
Ex (mc score) = 36  1/2 = 18
•	 The  expected  induction  score  is  a  weighted  sum  of  the  expectations  on  problems 
graded by Marten and Brooke.  Let M be the event that Marten graded the problem, 
and B be the event that Brooke graded the problem. Therefore: 
Ex (ind score  | M) = 0
· 2/5 + 15 · 3/5 = 9 
15 
| 
·
Ex (ind score  B) = ∑ (i  1/16) = 15/2 
i=0 
Ex (ind score) = Ex (ind score  | M) Pr {M} + Ex (ind score  |  B) Pr {B} 
·
· 
= 9  1/3 + 15/2  2/3 = 8

•	 The expected giant problem score is the expectation on 49 minus the product of rolls 
of  two  fair  seven-sided  dice.  We  can  pull  out  the  constant  49,  and  (since  the  dice 
are  independent)  the  expectation  on  the  product  of  the  rolls  becomes  the  product 
of  the  expectations on  the  rolls, which  is  4  in  this  case  (average of numbers  1  to  7). 
� 
� 
Therefore, if R is the random variable representing the roll of a single die: 
Ex (giant score) = Ex  49 − R2  = 49 − Ex (R)2  = 49 − (4)2  = 49 − 16 = 33 

Therefore, the overall expectation is: 

Ex (test score) = 18 + 8 + 33 = 59

(b)  [5 pts] What is the variance on the 36 true/false questions? 

Solution.  Since the coin ﬂips are independent, we can sum the variances of each ﬂip.

Var [mc score] = 36  1/2  1/2 = 9

(d)  [3 pts] Argue why  the Markov bound can be used  to determine an upper bound on 
the probability that the score on the exam is ≥ 80. You do not need to compute the actual 
bound. 

Solution.  The  Markov  bound  can  be  used  if  there  is  a  lower  bound  on  the  possible 
values of the random variable.  In this case, all test scores are ≥ 0. 
� 

(e)  [5 pts]  Use  the  Chebyshev  bound  to  determine  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability 
that the score on the true/false questions is ≥ 24. 
Solution.  If C be the random variable representing the multiple choice score: 
Pr {C ≥ 24} ≤ Pr {| C − 18  |≥ 6}

Problem 2.  [25 points]  Woodchucks Chucking Wood 
All woodchucks can chuck wood, but only some can do it well. 

•	 1/3 of all woodchucks like to chuck wood. 

•	 2/3 of all woodchucks can chuck wood well. 

•	 1/2 of those that like chucking wood can do it well. 

•	 The  expected  amount  of  wood  chucked  by  a  woodchuck  (randomly  chosen  with 
uniform probability) is 7 kg/day. 

•	 The expected amount of wood chucked by a woodchuck that  likes chucking wood 
but can’t do it well is 1 kg/day. 

•	 A  woodchuck  that  does  not  like  chucking  wood  does  not  chuck  any  wood  at  all, 
regardless of its wood-chucking skillz or lack thereof.

(a)  [10 pts] What  is  the  probability  that  a  woodchuck  (randomly  chosen  with  uniform 
probability) likes chucking wood, given that it can do it well? 
Solution.  Let L be the event that a woodchuck likes chucking wood and C be the event 
that a woodchuck can chuck wood well. We are given: 
Pr(L) = 1/3 
Pr(C) = 2/3 
Pr(C |L) = 1/2 
We wish to ﬁnd Pr(L|C). Using Bayes’ rule, we have

Pr(C |L)Pr(L)

Pr(L C) = 
Pr(C)

� 

(b)  [15 pts] On average, how much wood would a woodchuck chuck  if  the woodchuck 
could chuck wood well? 
Solution.  Let W be a random variable representing the amount of wood the woodchuck 
chucks. We are given (in units of kg/day): 
E(W ) = 7 
E(W |(L ∩ U¯ )) = 1 

Using the law of total expectation, we can partition the sample space into three events: 
(1)  the  woodchuck  can  chuck  wood  well;  (2)  the  woodchuck  can’t  chuck  wood  well 
but  likes  chucking  wood;  (3)  the  woodchuck  can’t  chuck  wood  well  and  doesn’t  like 
chucking wood. 
E(W ) = E(W |C)Pr(C) + E(W |(C¯ ∩ L))Pr(C¯ ∩ L) + E(W |(C¯ ∩ L¯ ))Pr(C¯ ∩ L¯ ) 
7 = E(W |C)(2/3) + 1 · Pr(C¯ ∩ L) + E(W |(C¯ ∩ L¯ ))Pr(C¯ ∩ L¯ ) 
Since a woodchuck that doesn’t like chucking wood does not chuck any wood, whether 
or not it can do so, E(W |C¯ ∩ L¯ ) = 0, so the last product in the sum vanishes: 
7 = E(W |C)(2/3) + Pr(C¯ ∩ L) 
Finally, from the deﬁnition of conditional expection, we have 
Pr(C¯ ∩ L) =  P(C¯ |L)P(L) 
= (1 − P(C |L))P(L) 
= (1 − 1/2)(1/3) 
= 1/6 

Final Exam 
5 
We wish  to ﬁnd  E(W |C),  the  expected amount of wood  chucked by a woodchuck  that 
can chuck wood well: 

7 = E(W |C)(2/3) + 1/6 
41/6 = E(W |C)(2/3) 
41/4 = E(W |C) 

So E(W |C) = 41/4 = 10.25.

Problem 3.  [25 points]  Cardsharing�Revolution 
Three 6.042 students—Kirari, Noelle, and Cobeni—are playing a game of Tan Tan Taan!. 
During  each  round  of  Tan  Tan  Taan!,  each  player  is  dealt  4  cards  of  their  own,  and  one 
additional card is shared among all players, so that each player has 5 cards that they can 
use  (the  4  cards  of  their  own  along  with  the  single  shared  card).  Cards  are  uniformly 
distributed from a 52-card deck.  If you get four of a kind (for example, four aces or four 
2’s), you can continue playing in the next round.  If you don’t get four of a kind, you must 
quit and return to doing your 6.042 homework. Cards from round to round are mutually 
independent.  This  game  is  so  fun  that  even  if  two  of  the  three  players  must  quit  and 
return  to  their  6.042  homework,  the  third  player will  continue  playing  alone  as  long  as 
they are able to. 

(a)  [5 pts] What is the probability that Kirari has four aces in the ﬁrst round? 

Solution.  The total number of hands that Kirari can possibly get is (52 
5 ).  Now we count 
how many ways they can make quad aces. There is only one way to get all four aces, and 
52 − 4 =  48 choices for the last card in the hand.  So there are 48 hands that correspond 
to quad aces, and the probability of making quad aces is 

48 
(52 
5 ) 

� 

(b)  [5 pts] What is the probability that Kirari doesn’t get four of a kind in the ﬁrst round 
(and must quit playing)? 

Solution.  The different four-of-a-card hands do not overlap at all (no one hand  is both 
four-of-a-kind  for  two  different  numbers),  so  the  probability  of  getting  any  four-of-a­
kind hand is 

King 
Pr [ any four-card hand ] =  ∑  Pr [ four-of-a-kind of card i] 
i=Ace 

Final Exam

By symmetry, all these probabilities are the same, so the probability of getting four-of-a­
kind is 13 ∗  48  .  The event of not getting a four-of-a-kind is the complement of this set, 
(52 
5 ) 
and so has probability


1 −

� 

(c)  [5 pts] What is the expected number of rounds that Kirari will play? 

Solution.  This  is  a  mean-time-to-failure  problem.  Imagine  ﬂipping  a  coin  that  has 
“heads” with probability 

624 
52
( 5 ) 
.  We  ﬂip  the  coin  until we  get  heads.  From  results  in  our  class  (or  through  doing  the 
� 
summation ourselves), we know that the result is 1/ p. 

p = 1 − 

(d)  [10 pts] What is the probability that all three can play a second round? 

Solution.  There  are  two  problems  in  play  here.  First,  we  have  to  ﬁgure  out  the  total 
number  of  hands  that  can  be  assigned  to  everyone:  second,  we  have  to  ﬁgure  out  the 
number of ways that everyone can get four-of-a-kind. 
First,  consider  the problem of ﬁnding  the  total number of hands  that can be given out. 
Note  that we can  represent each dealing of hands as an ordered  list of 13 cards chosen 
from  the  52  cards  in  the  deck,  where  the  ﬁrst  4  cards  belong  to  Kirari,  the  second  4 
belong  to Noelle,  the  third  four  belong  to  Cobeni,  and  the  ﬁnal  card  is  the  communal 
card.  There  are  52!/(52 − 13)! ways  to do  this.  However, we must  remember  that  the 
ordering  of  cards  in  Kirari,  Noelle,  and  Cobeni’s  hands  do  not  matter  - so  we  must 
“remove” the ordering in each of those four-card hands. This is done by dividing out by 
4! three times.  So the total number of ways we can deal cards is: 

52!/39!4!4!4! 

Now, we must count  the number of ways  to have all  three people make  four-of-a-kind 
hands.  There  are  two  cases:  when  the  communal  card  is  part  of  a  four-of-a-kind,  and 
when it is not. 

•	 First consider when it is not part of a four-of-a-kind. Choose ﬁrst the four-of-a-kinds 
that could happen:  there are 13 ∗ 12 ∗ 11 ways to assign numbers to the three people. 
After  these  numbers  have  been  assigned,  there  are  52 − 12  =  40  choices  for  the 
communal card. So there are 13 ∗ 12 ∗ 11 ∗ 40 ways to make a four-of-a-kind this way. 
•	 Now  say  the  communal  card  is  part  of  a  four-of-a-kind.  Say  it was  part  of Kirari’s 
four-of-a-kind  (by  symmetry,  the  counting  is  the  same  if  it  were  part  of  the  other 
two’s  four-of-a-kinds).  Once  again,  there  are  13  choices  for  Kirari,  12  choices  for 

Final Exam 

7 

Noelle, and 11 choices for Cobeni. And once again, there are 40 choices for the extra 
card in Kirari’s hand. So in total, there are 13 ∗ 12 ∗ 11 ∗ 40 ∗ 3 ways for four-of-a-kind 
to happen in this case. 
In total, there are 4(13 ∗ 12 ∗ 11 ∗ 40) ways to make four-of-a-kind hands in this format. 
So the probability of everyone getting a four-of-a-kind is 
4 ∗ 13 ∗ 12 ∗ 11 ∗ 40 ∗ (39!4!4!4!) 
52!

Problem 4.  [15 points]  Packet Racket! 
Consider  the  complete  ternary-tree  network  with  9  inputs  and  9  outputs  shown  below 
where  packets  are  routed  randomly.  The  route  each  packet  takes  is  the  shortest  path 
between input and output.  Let  I0 ,  I1 , and  I2  be indicator random variables for the events 
that a packet originating at  in0 ,  in1 , and  in2 ,  respectively,  crosses  the dashed edge  in  the 
ﬁgure.  Let  T  =  I0  +  I1  +  I2  be  a  random  variable  for  the  number  of  packets  passing 
through the dashed edge. 

(a)  [10 pts] Suppose that each input sends a single packet to an output selected uniformly 
at  random;  the  packet  destinations  are mutually  independent.  (Note  that  outputs may 
receive packets from multiple inputs including their corresponding input.) 
What are the expectation and variance of T? 

Solution.  A packet will pass through the dashed edge if it originates in inputs 0–2 and 
is destined  for outputs 3–8.  For  j  ∈ {0, 1, 2} Let  I j  be an  indicator  random variable  for 
the event that a packet leaving input  j passes through the dashed edge.  The probability 
of this event is  2
3 .  It follows that:

(b)  [5 pts] Now consider the situation where a permutation of inputs to outputs is chosen 
uniformly at random; each input sends a packet to a distinct output. What is the expected 
value of T? Brieﬂy justify your answer. 

Solution.  Once  again,  T  =  I1  +  I2  +  I3 .  By  linearity  of  expectation,  E [T ] =  E [ I1 ] + 
E [ I2 ] + E [ I3 ]. We know that E [ Ii ] = 2/3 still, because each input is equally likely routed 
to  any  of  the  outputs  (even  when  we  only  restrict  ourselves  to  permutations).  Thus, 
E [T ] = 3 ∗ 2/3 = 2.

Problem 5.  [15 points]  Connected or Not? That Is the Question 
Suppose  we  have  a  simple,  undirected  graph  G  with  2n  vertices  and  2n  edges,  where 
n ≥ 3. The graph consists of two disjoint cycles with n edges each.  For example, if n = 6, 
the graph would look like this: 

(a)  [5 pts]  A  pair  of  vertices  u  and  v  from  G  is  selected  uniformly  at  random  from  the 
pairs of distinct vertices with no edge between them. A new graph G �  is constructed to be 
the same as G, except that there is an edge between u and v.  What is the probability that 
G �  is connected? 
Solution.  G �  is connected if and only if u and v come from different cycles. There are n2

pairs of vertices consisting of vertices in different cycles.  In all, there are (2

n)  pairs  of  vertices  and  2n  of 
of  vertices with  no  edge  between  them,  since  there  are  (2

(b)  [10 pts]  k  pairs  of  vertices  from  G  are  selected  uniformly  at  random  from  the  pairs 
of distinct vertices with no  edge between  them.  Repetition  is  allowed;  it  is possible,  for 
example,  that  the  same  pair  appears multiple  times  in  the  set  of  k  pairs.  A  new  graph 
G ��  is  constructed  to be  the  same as G,  except  that  there are  k  new edges:  the edges  that 
correspond to the k selected pairs. What is the probability that G ��  is not connected? 
(Hint:  For k = 1, the sum of your answers to part (a) and part (b) should equal 1.) 
Solution.  Note that the probability of not connecting the graph in one sampling of two 
nonadjacent vertices is

Because  we  are  able  to  choose  the  same  pair  many  times,  we  are  simply  taking  inde­
pendent  samples  of  two nonadjacent vertices.  Furthermore,  in  k  samples,  the  graph  is 
not  connected  if  and  only  if  none  of  the  pairs  chosen  have  connected  the  graph.  The

Problem 6.  [15 points]  6.042: The Ultimate Showdown 
There are 100 homework problems  in 6.042 throughout the term.  Let Ti , 1  ≤  i  ≤  100, be 
the random variable  indicating the fraction of a day that  is needed by a student to solve 
the ith problem of 6.042. 
The  distribution  for  each  Ti  is  different  and  unknown.  We  only  know  that  the  Ti  are 
mutually independent and that for all i, 0 ≤ Ti  ≤ 1 and Ex[Ti ] = 0.3. 
Let  T  be  the  sum  of  all  Ti ’s;  T  represents  the  total  number  of  days  needed  by  a  student 
to complete all homework problems for 6.042.  Prove that the probability that T  is greater 
than  30e  is  exceedingly  small  by  deriving  the  best  bound  you  can  on  this  probability. 
(Hint: We do not consider 1/e to be exceedingly small.) 
Solution.  We know that T = ∑i Ti . Thus, we know that Ex[T ] = Ex[∑i Ti ] = ∑i Ex[Ti ] = 
100(.3) = 30 
Now, from the Chernoff bound (which we can use because the Ti  are mutually indepen­
dent), we have that 

Pr{T ≥ 30e} ≤  e−(e−e+1) 30  =  e−30
·

Which is quite a small bound.

Problem 7.  [25 points]  Gotta Count ’Em All! 
An unusual species inhabits the forest surrounding Functional City.  Each member of the 
species can take one of three possible forms, called Schemander, Haskeleon, and Camlizard. 
In January of every year, each individual undergoes “evolution”—a process by which the 
individual splits into two individuals, whose forms depend on the form of the original: 

•  A Schemander splits into a Schemander and a Haskeleon. 

•  A Haskeleon splits into a Schemander and a Camlizard. 

•  A Camlizard splits into a Schemander and a Haskeleon. 

Final Exam 

11 

We  are  investigating  the  distribution  of  forms  within  a  large  population  of  this  species 
over time.  It is known that in June of year 0, the population consisted of a single Scheman­
der.  Assume  that  no  individual  ever  dies  and  that  all  individuals  successfully  undergo 
evolution exactly once every January. 

(a)  [3 pts]  Let  Sn ,  Hn ,  and  Cn  be  the  number  of  Schemanders,  Haskeleons,  and  Cam-
lizards, respectively, in June of year n. Express Sn , Hn , and Cn  in terms of Sn−1 , Hn−1 , and 
Cn−1 , for n > 0. 
Solution.  For each  form, we  look at what forms can be possible parents  for  it.  A Sche­
mander  can  have  any  of  the  three  forms  as  a  parent,  so  the  number  of  Schemanders 
at  time  n  is  the  number  of  Schemanders,  Haskeleons,  and  Camlizards  at  time  n − 1. 
Likewise, a Haskeleon can have either a Schemander or a Camlizard as a parent, and a 
Camlizard can have only a Haskeleon as a parent. 
Therefore, we can the recurrence equations as 

Sn  = Sn−1 + Hn−1 + Cn−1 
Hn  = Sn−1 + Cn−1 
Cn  =  Hn−1 

� 

(b)  [5 pts] Let  Tn  =  Sn  + Hn  + Cn  be  the  total number  of  individuals  in  June  of  year  n. 
Use induction to prove that Tn  = 2n  for all n ≥ 0. 
Solution.  We expand each of the three terms using the recurrence: 

Tn  = Sn + Hn + Cn 
= (Sn−1 + Hn−1 + Cn−1 ) + (Sn−1 + Cn−1 ) + (Hn−1 )

= 2(Sn−1 + Hn−1 + Cn−1 )

= 2(Tn−1 )


We can see  that  the population doubles every year.  Since  T0  =  1  (just a single  individ­
� 
ual), Tn  = 2n . 
(c)  [2 pts] Show that Hn  = Tn−1 − Hn−1  for n > 0. 
Solution.  We use the expression for Hn  from the recurrence: 

Hn  = Sn−1 + Cn−1 
= (Sn−1 + Hn−1 + Cn−1 ) − Hn−1 
= Tn−1 − Hn−1 

� 

Final Exam 

12 

(d)  [15 pts] Give a closed-form expression  for  Hn .  You may use, without proof,  the  fact 
stated in part (b) and the recurrence given in part (c). 
Solution.  From parts (b) and (c), we have 
Hn  = Tn−1 − Hn−1 
= 2n−1 − Hn−1 
= (1/2)2n − Hn−1 
Hn + Hn−1  = (1/2)2n 

This  is  a  linear  recurrence.  We ﬁrst  solve  for  the particular  solution.  Since  the  (1/2)2n 
term is an exponential, we try  f (n) =  a2n . Plugging this into the recurrence gives us 
a2n + a2n−1  = (1/2)2n 
a2n + (1/2)a2n  = (1/2)2n 
(3/2)a = 1/2 
a = 1/3 

Next we solve for the homogeneous solution: 
Hn + Hn−1  = 0 
r + 1 = 0 
r = −1 

So our expression for Hn  is of the form 
Hn  =  A(−1)n + (1/3)2n 

We  solve  for  A  by using  the  initial  condition  H0  =  0,  since  there  are no Haskeleons  in 
year 0. 

0 =  A(−1)0 + (1/3)20 
=  A + 1/3 
A = −1/3 

The ﬁnal expression for Hn  is thus 
Hn  = (−1/3)(−1)n + (1/3)2n 

Problem 8.  [15 points]  Asymptotic Awesomeness 
For each row in the following table, determine whether there exist functions  f  and g that 
satisfy all the properties marked Yes and do not satisfy the properties marked No. You do

Solution. 

(a)  No.  f  = Θ(g) implies that  f  = Ω(g). 
(b)  Yes. Example:  f (n) = n2 ; g(n) = n. 

(c)  No.  f  = o(g) implies that  f  = O(g). 

(d)  Yes. Example:  f (n) = n; g(n) = 2n. 
(e)  Yes. Example:  f (n) = n2 ; g(n) = n(−1)n+1 . 
(f)  Yes. Example:  f (n) = n(−1)n+1+1 ; g(n) = n(−1)n+1 .

Problem 9.  [20 points]  Yet Another Graph Proof 
Prove  that  in  a  ﬁnite  directed  graph,  if  every  node  has  at  least  one  outgoing  edge,  then 
the graph has a cycle. 
(Hint: Consider the longest path.) 

Solution.  Suppose that every node has at least one outgoing edge.  Since the digraph is 
ﬁnite,  there  exists  a  longest path  v1  →  v2  →  . . . 
→
vh .  Node  vh  has an outgoing  edge 
vh  →  v.  If v  �∈  {v1 , v2 , . . . , vh }, then v1  →  v2  →  . . . 
→  vh  →  v  is a longer path of length 
h + 1.  Therefore, v ∈ {v1 , v2 , . . . , vh }, that is, v =  vi  for some 1 ≤  i ≤  h.  This means that 
the graph has a cycle vi  →  . . . → vh  → vi .

The  Super  Awesome  Extreme  zomgroﬂolwut  Spifftastic-to-the-Max  Slipped  Disc  Puz­
zle™  consists  of  a  track  holding  9  circular  tiles.  In  the  middle  is  a  disc  that  can  slide 
left and right and rotate 180◦  to change the positions of exactly ﬁve tiles. As shown below, 
there are three ways to manipulate the puzzle: 

Shift Right:  The center disc is moved one unit to the right (if there is space). 

Rotate Disc:  The ﬁve tiles in the center disc are reversed. 

Shift Left:  The center disc is moved one unit to the left (if there is space). 

Prove  that  if  the puzzle  starts  in an  initial  state with all but  tiles 1 and 2  in  their natural 
order,  then  it  is  impossible  to  reach  a  goal  state  where  all  the  tiles  are  in  their  natural 
order. The initial and goal states are shown below: 

Write your proof on the next page... 

Solution.  Order the tiles from left to right in the puzzle. Deﬁne an inversion to be a pair 
of tiles that is out of their natural order (e.g.  4 appearing to the left of 3).

Lemma.  Starting from the initial state there is an odd number of inversions after any number of 
transitions. 

Proof.  The proof is by induction. Let P(n) be the proposition that starting from the initial 
state there is an odd number of inversions after n transitions. 
Base case: After 0 transitions, there is one inversion, so P(0) holds. 
Inductive step:  Assume P(n) is true.  Say we have a conﬁguration that is reachable after 
n + 1 transitions. 

1.  Case 1: The last transition was a shift left or shift right 
In this case, the left-to-right order of the discs does not change and thus the number 
of inversions remains the same as in 

2.  The last transition was a rotate disc. 
In  this case, six pairs of disks switch order.  If  there were  x  inversions among  these 
pairs after n transitions, there will be 6 − x  inversions after the reversal.  If x  is odd, 
6 − x is odd, so after n + 1 transitions the number of inversions is odd. 

Conclusion:  Since  all  reachable  states  have  an  odd  number  of  inversions  and  the  goal 
state has an even number of inversions (speciﬁcally 0), the goal state cannot be reached.
