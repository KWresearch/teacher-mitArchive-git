Problem 3.  [20 points] 
In  the  game  of  Squares  and  Circles,  the  players  (you  and  your  computer)  start  with  a 
shared  ﬁnite  collection  of  shapes:  some  circles  and  some  squares.  Players  take  turns 
making  moves.  On  each  move,  a  player  chooses  any  two  shapes  from  the  collection. 
These two are replaced with a single one according to the following rule: 
A pair of identical shapes is replaced with a square. A pair of different shapes is replaced 
with a circle. 
At the end of the game, when only one shape remains, you are a winner if the remaining 
shape is a circle. Otherwise, your computer wins. 

(a)  [5 pts] Prove that the game will end. 

Solution.  Proof.  We use  induction on  the number of  turns  to prove  the statement.  Let n 
be  the number of shapes originally, and  let P(k) be  the proposition  that  if 0  ≤  k  ≤  n − 1 
then  after  k  turns,  the  number  of  remaining  shapes  is  n − k.  Thus  the  game  ends  after 
n − 1 steps. 
Base  case:  P(0)  is  true  by  deﬁnition;  the  number  of  reamaining  shapes  after  0  turns  is 
n − 0 = n, the original number of shapes. 
Inductive step: Now we must show that P(k) implies P(k + 1) for all k ≥ 0.  If k >= n − 1, 
P(k) implies P(k + 1) would always be true, since P(k + 1) would be trivially true.  So we 
only need to prrove this for k < n − 1.  So assume for your inductive hypothesis that P(k) 
is  true,  where  0  ≤  k  <  n − 1;  that  is,  after  k  turns  the  number  of  remaining  shapes  in 
n − k.  Since k  <  n − 1,  the number of remaining shapes  is n − k  >  1.  Hence there are at 
least  2  shapes  to  choose  from  and  the  game  has  not  ended  yet.  In  the  k+1st  turn  either 
the computer will choose 2 shapes, or you will choose two shapes.  In either case the two 
shapes chosen, will be replaced by exactly once.  Hence the number of shapes remaining 
will be n − k − 2 + 1 =  n − k − 1 =  n − (k + 1) as desired.  This proves that P(k) implies 
P(k + 1) for all k ≥ 0. 
By the principle of induction, P(k) is true for all k ≥ 0. 
Hence, by our inductve hypothes after n-1 turns, 1 shape remains, which by the problem 
deﬁnition implies the game ends.

(b)  [15 pts] Prove that you will win if and only if the number of circles initially is odd. 

Solution.  Proof.  We use  induction on  the number of  turns  to prove  the  statement.  Let  a 
be the number of circles initially, and let P(k) be the proposition that if 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 then 
after  k  turns,  the  number  of  remaining  ciircles  is  a − 2i,  for  some  nonnegative  integer  i. 
Thus if a is odd initially, at turn n − 1, when the game ends, a − 2i circles - an odd number 
- remain, and since there  is only one shape remaining,  there must be exactly 1 circle  left, 
and you win. 
Base  case:  P(0)  is  true  by  deﬁnition;  the  number  of  reamaining  circles  after  0  turns  is 
a − 2 ∗ 0 =  a, the original number of shapes. 
Inductive step: Now we must show that P(k) implies P(k + 1) for all k ≥ 0.  If k >= n − 1, 
P(k) implies P(k + 1) would always be true, since P(k + 1) would be trivially true.  So we 
only  need  to  prrove  this  for  k  <  n − 1.  So  assume  for  your  inductive  hypothesis  that 
P(k) is true, where 0 ≤  k <  n − 1; that is, after k turns the number of remaining circles is 
a − 2i1 .  for some nonnegative integer i1 . Since k < n − 1, the number of remaining shapes 
is n − k  >  1 (from part a), hence there are at least 2 shapes to choose from and the game 
has  not  ended  yet.  In  the  k+1st  turn  either  the  computer  will  choose  2  shapes,  or  you 
will choose two shapes.  If the two shapes chosen are both squares, then they are replaced 
by  a  square,  and  the  number  of  circles  doe  not  change,  and  hence  is  still  a − 2i1 .  If  the 
two shapes chosen are both circles, then they are replaced by a square, and the number of 
circles gets decreased by 2, and is a − 2i − 2 =  a − 2(i + 1).  If one of the shapes chosen was 
a circle and the other was a square, they get replaced by a circle, and again the number of 
circles does not change and remains a − 2i. Hence in all three transitions P(k+1) holds. 
By the principle of induction, P(k) is true for all k ≥ 0. 
Hence, by induction when the game ends the parity of the number of circles is the same as 
the original parity of the number of circles.  So you will win only if the number of circles 
to begin with was odd.

Problem 4.  [15 points] 
(a)  [8 pts] Find a number x ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 112} such that 11x ≡ 1  (mod  113). 
Solution.  We  can do  this using  the pulverizer.  Speciﬁcally,  if we ﬁnd a pair  (s, t)  such 
that 11s + 113t = 1, then we know that 11s ≡ 1  (mod  113). 
rem (x, y)	 =  x − q y·

· 
·
· 
= (4  113 − 41  11)
·
· 
From the above work we see that 1  =  4  113 − 41  11, and so −41  11  ≡  1  (mod  113).
·
·	
· 
Therefore  -41  is  an  inverse  of  113.  However,  it  is  not  the  unique  inverse  of  113  in  the 
range {1, . . . , 113}, which is given by  rem (−41, 113) = 72. So the multiplicative inverse 
� 
of 11 modulo 113 is 72. 
(b)  [7 pts]  Find  a  number  y  ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 112}  such  that  11112111  ≡  y  (mod  113)  (Hint: 
Note that 113 is a prime.)

Solution.  By Fermat’s Theorem, since 113 is prime and 113 and 11 are relatively prime, 
it must be that 
11  11111  ≡ 11113−1  ≡ 1  (mod  113),
· 
so x ≡ 111  (mod  113) (where x is deﬁned as in part a). As a result, 
11112111  ≡ 11112·1000+111  ≡ 11112 1000  11111  ≡ 11000  x ≡  x ≡ 72  (mod  113),
·
· 

so the answer is 72.

Solution.  Recall that the diameter is the maximum of all shortest path lengths between 
pairs of vertices.  Note that the shortest path length between D and  F  is 3, and all other 
� 
pairs of non-adjacent vertices share a neighbor.

(c)  [4 pts]  Give  a  coloring  on  G  and  show  that  it  uses  the  smallest  possible  number  of 
colors. 
Solution.  One possible 3-coloring is:  { A, D, E} red; {B, F} green; C blue.  Because there 
exists  an  odd-length  cycle  (e.g.  (B, D, C)),  no  2-coloring  exists.  Therefore  the  given 
� 
coloring uses the least possible number of colors. 

(d)  [4 pts] Does G have an Eulerian cycle?  Justify your answer. 

Solution.  No.  This  follows  from  the  fact  that  there exist vertices with odd degree;  e.g.

Now consider graph H , which is like G but with weighted edges, in ﬁgure 2:

(e)  [4 pts] Give a list of edges reﬂecting the order in which one of the greedy algorithms 
presented in class (i.e.  in lecture, recitation, or the course text) would choose edges when 
ﬁnding an MST on H . 

Solution.  Kruskal’s  alg  (building  up  an  acyclic  subgraph)  gives  two  possible  orders:

((C, D), (B, C), ( A, B), (E, F), (C, E)) and ((C, D), (B, C), (E, F), ( A, B), (C, E)). Prim’s al­

gorithm (building up a connected, acyclic subgraph) gives one possible order:

((C, D), (B, C), ( A, B), (C, E), (E, F)).  Figure  3  below  gives  the  MST  generated  in  any

case.

Problem  6.  [25  points]  Let  G  be  a  graph  with  m  edges,  n  vertices,  and  k  components. 
Prove  that  G  contains  at  least  m − n + k  cycles.  (Hint:  Prove  this  by  induction  on  the 
number of edges, m) 

Solution.  The proof is by induction on m with hypothesis P(n):= If G is a graph with n 
vertices, m edges and k components, then G contains at least m + k − n =  c cycles 

Proof.  Base  Case  m  =  0:  Let  G  be  any  graph  with  0  edges  and  n  vertices.  Then  since 
there  are  no  edges,  each  vertex  is  its  own  connected  component,  hence  there  are  k  =  n 
connected components.  Since there are no edges there are also no cycles.  Lastly we note 
that m + k − n = n + 0 − n = 0, and hence our base case. 
Inductive Step Assume that P(m) holds,  that  is any graph with m edges, n vertices, and 
k components has at least m − n + k cycles. We must show that P(m+1) holds. 
Consider an arbitrary graph G with m + 1 edges, n vertices, and k components.  Suppose 
we remove an arbitrary edge, e, from G to obtain G � .  This edge, e, was either in a cycle in 
G or not: 
Case 1:  e is part of a cycle in G 
If e is in a cycle in G then removing it removes at least one cycle.  Furthermore, removing 
e  does not disconnect  the graph  so  the number  of  components  remains  the  same.  So  G � 
has m edges, n vertices, and  k  components, which by  the  inductive hypothesis  tells us  it 
has at least m + k − n cycles. But G has at least one more cycle than G �  (since e is part of a 
cycle).  So G has at least m + k − n + 1, or (m + 1) + k − n cycles, as desired. 
Case  2:  e  is  not  part  of  a  cycle  in  G  If  e  is  not  part  of  a  cycle  removing  it  disconnects 
the  graph  of G,  so  the number  of  components  in  G �  is  k + 1.  So,  G �  contains m  edges,  n 

ABCDEF10323143Midterm 

10 

vertices,  and  k + 1  components,  so  by  the  inductive  hypothesis  it  contains  at  least  m + 
(k + 1) − n cycles.  Now since  e was not part of a cycle, G and G �  have the same number 
of cycles.  So G  also has at  leastm + (k + 1) − n  cycles.  Rearranging we get  that G  has at 
least (m + 1) + k − n cycles as desired.
