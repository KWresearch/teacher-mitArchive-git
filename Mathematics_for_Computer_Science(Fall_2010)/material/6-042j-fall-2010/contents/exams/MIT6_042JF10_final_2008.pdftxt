Final Exam 

Name:


•	 This  ﬁnal  is  closed  book,  but  you may  have  three  8.5” × 11”  sheets with  notes  in 
your own handwriting on both sides. 

•	 You may not use a calculator or a Python interpreter, and while exercising skill with 
a  PostScript  interpreter  would  highly  impress  at  least  one  member  of  the  course 
staff, you are not allowed  to use  that either.  You may work with any of  the  follow­
ing:  a  slide  rule,  an  abacus,  a  Curta,  Napier ’s  bones,  any  original  version  of  the 
Antikythera  mechanism,  an  Enigma  machine,  and/or  the  difference  engine.  You 
are also permitted to use a perpetual motion machine as a source of energy, and an 
antigravity device to elevate yourself above the rest of the class. 

•	 You may assume all of the results presented in class. 

•	 Please  show your work.  Partial  credit  cannot be given  for a wrong answer  if your 
work isn’t shown. 

•	 Write  your  solutions  in  the  space  provided.  If  you  need more  space,  write  on  the 
back of the sheet containing the problem. Please keep your entire answer to a prob­
lem on that problem’s page. 

•	 Be  neat  and write  legibly.  You will  be  graded  not  only  on  the  correctness  of  your 
answers, but also on the clarity with which you express them. 

•	 If you get stuck on a problem, move on to others. The problems are not arranged in 
order of difﬁculty. 

•	 Please resist the urge to roll on the ﬂoor laughing out loud. 

•	 You have three hours to complete the exam.

Problem 1.  [25 points]  The Final Breakdown 
Suppose the 6.042 ﬁnal consists of: 

•	 36 true/false questions worth 1 point each. 

•	 1 induction problem worth 15 points. 

2 

•	 1 giant problem that combines everything from the semester, worth 49 points. 

Grading goes as follows: 

•	 The TAs  choose  to  grade  the  easy  true/false  questions.  For  each  individual point, 
they ﬂip a fair coin.  If it comes up heads, the student gets the point. 

•	 Marten and Brooke split the task of grading the induction problem. 

–	 With  1/3  probability,  Marten  grades  the  problem.  His  grading  policy  is  as 
follows:  Either he gets exasperated by the  improper use of math symbols and 
gives  0  points  (which  happens  with  2/5  probability),  or  he  ﬁnds  the  answer 
satisfactory and gives 15 points (which happens with 3/5 probability). 
–	 With  2/3  probability,  Brooke  grades  the  problem.  Her  grading  policy  is  as 
follows:  She selects a random integer point value from the range from 0 to 15, 
inclusive, with uniform probability. 

•	 Finally,  Tom  grades  the  giant  problem.  He  rolls  two  fair  seven-sided  dice  (which 
have values  from 1  to 7,  inclusive),  takes  their product,  and  subtracts  it  from 49  to 
determine the score.  (Example:  Tom rolls a 3 and a 4.  The score is then 49 − 3 4 = 
· 
37.) 

Assume all random choices during the grading process are mutually independent. 
The problem parts start on the next page.  Show your work to receive partial credit.

Problem 2.  [25 points]  Woodchucks Chucking Wood 
All woodchucks can chuck wood, but only some can do it well. 

•	 1/3 of all woodchucks like to chuck wood. 

•	 2/3 of all woodchucks can chuck wood well. 

•	 1/2 of those that like chucking wood can do it well. 

•	 The  expected  amount  of  wood  chucked  by  a  woodchuck  (randomly  chosen  with 
uniform probability) is 7 kg/day. 

•	 The expected amount of wood chucked by a woodchuck that  likes chucking wood 
but can’t do it well is 1 kg/day. 

•	 A  woodchuck  that  does  not  like  chucking  wood  does  not  chuck  any  wood  at  all, 
regardless of its wood-chucking skillz or lack thereof. 

(a)  [10 pts] What  is  the  probability  that  a  woodchuck  (randomly  chosen  with  uniform 
probability) likes chucking wood, given that it can do it well?

Problem 3.  [25 points]  Cardsharing�Revolution 
Three 6.042 students—Kirari, Noelle, and Cobeni—are playing a game of Tan Tan Taan!. 
During  each  round  of  Tan  Tan  Taan!,  each  player  is  dealt  4  cards  of  their  own,  and  one 
additional card is shared among all players, so that each player has 5 cards that they can 
use  (the  4  cards  of  their  own  along  with  the  single  shared  card).  Cards  are  uniformly 
distributed from a 52-card deck.  If you get four of a kind (for example, four aces or four 
2’s), you can continue playing in the next round.  If you don’t get four of a kind, you must 
quit and return to doing your 6.042 homework. Cards from round to round are mutually 
independent.  This  game  is  so  fun  that  even  if  two  of  the  three  players  must  quit  and 
return  to  their  6.042  homework,  the  third  player will  continue  playing  alone  as  long  as 
they are able to. 

(a)  [5 pts] What is the probability that Kirari has four aces in the ﬁrst round? 

(b)  [5 pts] What is the probability that Kirari doesn’t get four of a kind in the ﬁrst round 
(and must quit playing)? 

Final Exam

(c)  [5 pts] What is the expected number of rounds that Kirari will play? 

(d)  [10 pts] What is the probability that all three can play a second round?

Problem 4.  [15 points]  Packet Racket! 
Consider  the  complete  ternary-tree  network  with  9  inputs  and  9  outputs  shown  below 
where  packets  are  routed  randomly.  The  route  each  packet  takes  is  the  shortest  path 
between input and output.  Let  I0 ,  I1 , and  I2  be indicator random variables for the events 
that a packet originating at  in0 ,  in1 , and  in2 ,  respectively,  crosses  the dashed edge  in  the 
ﬁgure.  Let  T  =  I0  +  I1  +  I2  be  a  random  variable  for  the  number  of  packets  passing 
through the dashed edge. 

(a)  [10 pts] Suppose that each input sends a single packet to an output selected uniformly 
at  random;  the  packet  destinations  are mutually  independent.  (Note  that  outputs may 
receive packets from multiple inputs including their corresponding input.) 
What are the expectation and variance of T?

Problem 5.  [15 points]  Connected or Not? That Is the Question 
Suppose  we  have  a  simple,  undirected  graph  G  with  2n  vertices  and  2n  edges,  where 
n ≥ 3. The graph consists of two disjoint cycles with n edges each.  For example, if n = 6, 
the graph would look like this: 

(a)  [5 pts]  A  pair  of  vertices  u  and  v  from  G  is  selected  uniformly  at  random  from  the 
pairs of distinct vertices with no edge between them. A new graph G �  is constructed to be 
the same as G, except that there is an edge between u and v.  What is the probability that 
G �  is connected? 

(b)  [10 pts]  k  pairs  of  vertices  from  G  are  selected  uniformly  at  random  from  the  pairs 
of distinct vertices with no  edge between  them.  Repetition  is  allowed;  it  is possible,  for 
example,  that  the  same  pair  appears multiple  times  in  the  set  of  k  pairs.  A  new  graph 
G ��  is  constructed  to be  the  same as G,  except  that  there are  k  new edges:  the edges  that 
correspond to the k selected pairs. What is the probability that G ��  is not connected? 
(Hint:  For k = 1, the sum of your answers to part (a) and part (b) should equal 1.)

Problem 6.  [15 points]  6.042: The Ultimate Showdown 
There are 100 homework problems  in 6.042 throughout the term.  Let Ti , 1  ≤  i  ≤  100, be 
the random variable  indicating the fraction of a day that  is needed by a student to solve 
the ith problem of 6.042. 
The  distribution  for  each  Ti  is  different  and  unknown.  We  only  know  that  the  Ti  are 
mutually independent and that for all i, 0 ≤ Ti  ≤ 1 and Ex[Ti ] = 0.3. 
Let  T  be  the  sum  of  all  Ti ’s;  T  represents  the  total  number  of  days  needed  by  a  student 
to complete all homework problems for 6.042.  Prove that the probability that T  is greater 
than  30e  is  exceedingly  small  by  deriving  the  best  bound  you  can  on  this  probability. 
(Hint: We do not consider 1/e to be exceedingly small.)

Problem 7.  [25 points]  Gotta Count ’Em All! 
An unusual species inhabits the forest surrounding Functional City.  Each member of the 
species can take one of three possible forms, called Schemander, Haskeleon, and Camlizard. 
In January of every year, each individual undergoes “evolution”—a process by which the 
individual splits into two individuals, whose forms depend on the form of the original: 

•  A Schemander splits into a Schemander and a Haskeleon. 

•  A Haskeleon splits into a Schemander and a Camlizard. 

•  A Camlizard splits into a Schemander and a Haskeleon. 

We  are  investigating  the  distribution  of  forms  within  a  large  population  of  this  species 
over time.  It is known that in June of year 0, the population consisted of a single Scheman­
der.  Assume  that  no  individual  ever  dies  and  that  all  individuals  successfully  undergo 
evolution exactly once every January. 

(a)  [3 pts]  Let  Sn ,  Hn ,  and  Cn  be  the  number  of  Schemanders,  Haskeleons,  and  Cam-
lizards, respectively, in June of year n. Express Sn , Hn , and Cn  in terms of Sn−1 , Hn−1 , and 
Cn−1 , for n > 0.

(b)  [5 pts] Let  Tn  =  Sn  + Hn  + Cn  be  the  total number  of  individuals  in  June  of  year  n. 
Use induction to prove that Tn  = 2n  for all n ≥ 0. 

(c)  [2 pts] Show that Hn  = Tn−1 − Hn−1  for n > 0. 

Final Exam

(d)  [15 pts] Give a closed-form expression  for  Hn .  You may use, without proof,  the  fact 
stated in part (b) and the recurrence given in part (c).

Problem 10.  [20 points]  Revenge of the Slipped Disc Puzzle™: The Curse of 6.042 
(This problem is similar to the Slipped Disc Puzzle™ of Quiz 1, but here we rotate 5 tiles 
instead of 4.)

The  Super  Awesome  Extreme  zomgroﬂolwut  Spifftastic-to-the-Max  Slipped  Disc  Puz­

zle™  consists  of  a  track  holding  9  circular  tiles.  In  the  middle  is  a  disc  that  can  slide

left and right and rotate 180◦  to change the positions of exactly ﬁve tiles. As shown below,

there are three ways to manipulate the puzzle:


Shift Right:  The center disc is moved one unit to the right (if there is space). 

Rotate Disc:  The ﬁve tiles in the center disc are reversed. 

Shift Left:  The center disc is moved one unit to the left (if there is space). 

Prove  that  if  the puzzle  starts  in an  initial  state with all but  tiles 1 and 2  in  their natural 
order,  then  it  is  impossible  to  reach  a  goal  state  where  all  the  tiles  are  in  their  natural 
order. The initial and goal states are shown below:
