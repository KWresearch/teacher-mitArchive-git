Problem  2.  [20 points] Coin-Flip  is  a  2 player game.  Each player wins with probability 
exactly 0.5. There are no ties. 
n  people  are  playing  a  Coin-Flip  tournament.  Every  person  plays  a  Coin-Flip  game 
with every other person exactly once.  Thus everybody plays n − 1 games.  The outcomes 
of all the games are mutually independent of one another. 
We say that the tournament is a success if for every i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}, there is exactly 
one player, which we will refer to as pi , with exactly i wins. 

(a)  [10  points]  Prove  that  if  the  tournament  is  a  success,  then  for  any  integers  j, k 
with 0 ≤ k < j  ≤ n − 1, pj  defeats pk . 
Solution.  We prove it by induction on k .  The inductive hypothesis P (k) is that for 
all 0 ≤ � ≤ k and all � < j < n, pj  defeats p� . 
The  base  case  is  k  = 0.  Now  p0  loses  all  n − 1  games.  Thus,  for  every  j >  0,  pj 
defeats p0 . Suppose P (k) and let us show P (k + 1). Since the tournament is a sucess, 
pk+1  wins  exactly  k + 1  games.  Because P (k)  holds,  pk+1  defeats  the  k + 1  players 
p0 , p1 , . . . , pk . Thus, for all k + 1 < j < n, pj  defeats pk+1 .  So P (k + 1) holds. 

(b)  [6 points] What is the probability that the tournament will be a success? 
Solution.  Let π  be a permutation of {0, 2, . . . , n − 1} and deﬁne the event Eπ  to be 
that  the  tournament  is a success with players pi  winning exactly  i games, where pi 
is the π(i)th player.  Then the events Eπ  and Eσ  are disjoint for π  =� σ .  Moreover, by 
symmetry, Pr[Eπ ]  =  Pr[Eσ ]  for all permutations σ, π .  Let E  be  the event  the  tourna­
� 
ment is a success.  Since the events are disjoint, 
Pr[Eπ ] = n! Pr[Eσ ], 
Pr[E ] = 
�  � 
π 
where  σ  is  some  ﬁxed  permutation.  Now  Eσ  determines  all  the  outcomes  of  the 
2  games, we have  � �(n)

Now,  n  − n log n = Ω(n2 ), so there is a positive constant c such that for sufﬁciently

which for sufﬁciently  large n,  is clearly  less  than any positive constant, and  thus  is

Problem 3.  [8 points] A person is passing time by advancing a token on the set of natural 
numbers.  In the beginning, a token is placed on 0. 
The person keeps playing moves forever. Each move proceeds as follows: 

1.  First the person tosses a fair coin (with heads/tails equally likely). 

2.  Suppose the token is currently placed on n.  If heads came up, then the person moves 
the token to n + 3, otherwise he moves the token to n + 4. 
For each n  ∈ N, let En  be the event ”There was a move on which the token landed on 
n”. Let pn  = Pr[En ]. 
Find  a  recurrence  relation  for  pn .  You  do  not  need  to  solve  the  recurrence,  but  you  should 
specify the boundary conditions that would be necessary to ﬁnd a solution to the recurrence. 
Solution.  For all n ≥ 4,

Problem 4.  [10 points] Exactly 1/5th of the people in a town have Beaver Fever© . 
There are two tests for Beaver Fever, TEST1 and TEST2. When a person goes to a doctor 
to test for Beaver Fever, with probability 2/3 the doctor conducts TEST1 on him and with 
probability 1/3 the doctor conducts TEST2 on him. 
When TEST1 is done on a person, the outcome is as follows: 

•  If the person has the disease, the result is positive with probability 3/4. 

•  If the person does not have the disease, the result is positive with probability 1/4. 

When TEST2 is done on a person, the outcome is as follows: 

•  If the person has the disease, the result is positive with probability 1. 

•  If the person does not have the disease, the result is positive with probability 1/2. 

A person  is picked uniformly at random  from  the  town and  is sent  to a doctor  to  test 
for Beaver Fever.  The  result  comes out positive.  What  is  the probability  that  the person 
has the disease? 
Solution.  Let B  be the event that the person has BLAH. Let T 1 be the event that the 
person is tested with test1.  Let T 2 be the event that the person is tested with test2.  Let P 
be the event that the test comes out positive.

Problem  5.  [10 points] Two  identical  complete decks of  cards,  each with  52  cards,  have 
been mixed together.  A hand of 5 cards is picked uniformly at random from amongst all 
subsets of exactly 5 cards. 

(a)  [5 points] What is the probability that the hand has no identical cards (i.e., cards 
with the same suit and value. For example, the hand �Q♥, 5♠, 6♠, 8♣, Q♥� has iden­
tical cards.)? We can calculate this probability by computing 

hands with no identical cards 
total possible hands 

�

There are 104 cards.  There are 5 cards  in a hand.  Order does not matter.  The  total 
number of possible hands is:

There are 52 possible card  faces,  and we can choose 5 of  them  if no  identical cards 
are allowed.  Additionally, each card can be from either deck 1 or deck 2.  Therefore

the number of hands with no identical cards, chosen from 2 decks is:

(b)  [5 points] What is the probability that the hand has exactly one pair of identical 
cards?  This can be solved by a similar approach.  A hand of this type can be distin­

guished by  the  face  (suit and value) of  the  repeated  card,  and by  the  faces of  the 3 
non-repeated  cards.  There  are  52 possible values  for  the  face  of  the  repeated  card. 
�
� 
There are  51  possible  faces  for  the non-repeated cards,  since none of  these can be 
3 
repeated.  Each of these could come from either the 1st deck or the 2nd deck.  There 
are  104  possible hands, as before.  So the probability of getting a hand with exactly

Problem  7.  [16  points]  1000  ﬁles  F1 , F2 , . . . , F1000  have  just  reached  a  disk  manager  for 
writing onto disk. Each ﬁle’s size is between 0M B and 1M B . The sum of all ﬁles’ sizes is 
400M B . 
The  disk  manager  has  4  disks  under  its  control.  For  each  ﬁle  Fi ,  the  disk  manager 
chooses  a disk uniformly  at  random  from  amongst  the  4 disks,  and Fi  is written  to  that 
disk. The choices of disk for the different ﬁles are mutually independent. 

(a)  [2  points] What  is  the  expected  number  of  ﬁles  that  will  be  written  to  the  ﬁrst 
disk? 

We can use indicator variables.  For each ﬁle, Pi  = 1 if Fi  is written to the ﬁrst disk. 
The chance of an individual ﬁle being written to the ﬁrst disk is 1/4.  By linearity of 
�(  1000)1/4  =  250,  so  the expected number of ﬁles  to be written  to  the ﬁrst disk 
expectation,  the expected number of ﬁles written  to  the ﬁrst disk  is  the  sum of  the 
expected  values  of  Pi ’s.  The  expected  value  of  each  indicator  variable  is  1/4,  and 
i=1 
is 250. 
(b)  [2 points] What is the expected number of bytes written on the ﬁrst disk? 

We can say that each ﬁle Fi  has bit size Si . Each ﬁle has a 1/4 chance of being written 
do the ﬁrst disk. Therefore, by linearity of expectation, the expected number of bytes 
written  to  the ﬁrst disk  is  the sum of  the expected number of bytes per ﬁle written

(c)  [8 points] Find  the best upper bound you  can on  the probability  that 200M B  or 
more are written on the ﬁrst disk? 

For this we can use the ﬁrst Chernoff bound, which is: 
Pr (X  ≥ c Ex (X )) ≤ e−(c ln c − c + 1) Ex (X ) 
The Chernoff bound only works if X  is the sum of random variables that each take 
on a value between 0 and 1. The ﬁle size of each ﬁle in the ﬁrst disk is between 0 and 
1Mb  .  So we  can deﬁne X  to be  the  total number of bytes  in disk  1.  The  expected 
value of X  is 100, so we take c to be 2. We get: 
Pr (X  ≥ 2  100) ≤ e−(2 ln 2 − 2 + 1)100 
· 

(d)  [4  points]  Find  the  best  upper  bound  you  can  on  the  probability  that  there  is 
some disk with 200M B or more written on it? 

For this we can use the Union Bound along with our result from above.  The proba­
bility of this event happening in one or more disks is upper bounded by the sum of 
the probabilities of the event happening in each disk. This gives us an upper bound 
of 

4  e−(2 ln 2 − 1)100
