Problem 1.  [13 points] Give an  inductive proof  that  the Fibonacci numbers Fn  and Fn+1 
are relatively prime for all n ≥ 0. The Fibonacci numbers are deﬁned as follows: 
(for n ≥ 2) 

Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2 

F0  = 0 

F1  = 1 

Solution.  We  use  induction  on  n.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  Fn  and  Fn+1  are 
relatively prime. 
Base case: P (0) is true because F0  = 0 and F1  = 1 are relatively prime. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  that P (n)  is  true where  n  ≥  0;  that  is,  Fn  and Fn+1  are  relatively 
prime. We must show that Fn+1  and Fn+2  are relatively prime as well.  If Fn+1  and Fn+2  had 
a common divisor d >  1, then d would also divide the linear combination Fn+2  − Fn+1  = 
Fn , contradicting the assumption that Fn  and Fn+1  are relatively prime.  So Fn+1  and Fn+2 
are relatively prime. 
The theorem follows by induction.

Problem  2.  [15  points]  The  double  of  a  graph  G  consists  of  two  copies  of  G  with  edges 
joining  corresponding  vertices.  For  example,  a  graph  appears  below  on  the  left  and  its 
double appears on the right. 

Some edges in the graph on the right are dashed to clarify its structure. 

(a)  Draw the double of the graph shown below. 

Solution.

(b)	 Suppose  that G1  is a bipartite graph, G2  is  the double of G1 , G3  is  the double of 
G2 , and so forth. Use induction on n to prove that Gn  is bipartite for all n ≥ 1. 
Solution. We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that Gn  is bipartite. 
Base case: P (1) is true because G1  is bipartite by assumption. 
Inductive  step:  For  n  ≥  1,  we  assume  P (n)  in  order  to  prove  P (n + 1).  The  graph 
Gn+1  consists of two subgraphs isomorphic to Gn  with edges joining corresponding 
vertices.  Remove  these  extra  edges.  By  the  assumption  P (n),  we  can  color  each 
vertex of one subgraph black or white so that adjacent vertices get different colors.  If 
we color the corresponding vertices in the other subgraph oppositely, then adjacent 
vertices get different colors within that subgraph as well.  And now if we add back 
the  extra  edges,  each  of  these  joins  a  white  vertex  and  a  black  vertex.  Therefore, 
Gn+1  is bipartite. 
The theorem follows from the principle of induction.

Problem  3.  [12 points] Finalphobia  is a  rare disease  in which  the victim has  the delusion 
that he or she is being subjected to an intense mathematical examination. 

•  A person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia with probability 1/100. 

•  A person with ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 9/10. 

•  A person without ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 1/20. 

What is the probablility that a person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia, given 
that he or she has shaky hands? 
Solution.  Let F  be the event that the randomly-selected person has ﬁnalphobia, and 
let S  be the event that he or she has shaky hands. A tree diagram is worked out below: 

Pr (F  | S ) = 

The probability that a person has ﬁnalphobia, given that he or she has shaky hands is:

Problem 4.  [12 points] Suppose that you roll ﬁve 6-sided dice that are fair and mutually 
independent. For the problems below, answers alone are sufﬁcient, but we can award par­
tial credit only if you show your work.  Also, you do not need to simplify your answers; 
you may leave factorials, binomial coefﬁcients, and arithmetic expressions unevaluated. 

(a)  What is the probability that all ﬁve dice show different values? 
Example:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 3, 4) is not. 
Solution.  The probability space is the uniform distribution on the 65  possible num­
bers  rolled  on  the  ﬁve  (distinguishable)  dice.  So  the  probability  that  all  dice  are 
different is the number of outcomes in which the dice have distinct values divided 
·
·
·
· 
by 65 . There are (6)5  = 6  5  4  3  2 such outcomes so

An  alternative  approach  uses  the  observation  that  the  conditional  probability  that 
the  i + 1st  die  value  differs  from  the  preceding  rolls,  given  that  the  ﬁrst  i  values 
differ, is (6 − i)/6 for 1 ≤  i ≤  4, and the probability that all ﬁve values are different 
is the product of these conditional probabilities, namely 

Pr (all rolls distinct) =

(b)	 What  is  the  probability  that  two  dice  show  the  same  value  and  the  remaining 
three dice all show different values?

Example:  (6, 1, 6, 2, 3) is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 2, 3) and (4, 4, 4, 5, 6) are not. 
Solution.  There are  5
2  possible pairs of rolls that might have the same value and 
·

6  possibilities  for what  this  value  is.  There  5 4 3  possible  distinct  values  for  the

An  alternative  way  to  count  is:  there  are  4  sets  of  four  values  among  the  ﬁve

5

Problem 5.  [12 points] An electronic  toy displays a 4 × 4 grid of  colored  squares.  At all

For parts (a) and (b) below, you need not simplify your answers. 

(a)  How many such conﬁgurations are possible? 
Solution.  This  is  equal  to  the  number  of  sequences  containing  4  R’s,  4  G’s,  4  B’s, 
and 4 Y’s, which is: 

16! 
(4!)4 

(b)	 Below  the display,  there  are ﬁve buttons numbered  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5.  The player 
may press a sequence of buttons; however, the same button can not be pressed twice 
in a row. How many different sequences of n button-presses are possible? 
Solution.  There are 5 choices  for  the ﬁrst button press and 4  for each subsequence 
· 
press. Therefore, the number of different sequences of n button presses is 5 4n−1 .
(c) 	 Each  button  press  scrambles  the  colored  squares  in  a  complicated,  but  nonran­
dom  way.  Prove  that  there  exist  two  different  sequences  of  32  button  presses  that 
both  produce  the  same  conﬁguration,  if  the  puzzle  is  initially  in  the  state  shown 
above.  (Hint:  432  = 1616  > 16!) 
Solution.  We use  the Pigeonhole Principle.  Let A  be  the  set  of  all  sequences  of  32 
→ 
button  presses,  let B  be  the  set  of  all  conﬁgurations,  and  let  f  :  A
B  map  each 
sequence of button presses to the conﬁguration that results. Now: 
|A| > 432  > 16! >  |B | 

Thus,  by  the  Pigeonhole  Principle,  f  is  not  injective;  that  is,  there  exist  distinct  el­
ements  a1 , a2  ∈  A  such  taht  f (a1 ) =  f (a2 ).  In  other words,  there  are  two different 
sequences of button presses that produce the same conﬁguration.

Problem  6.  [12 points] MIT  students  sometimes delay  laundry  for  a  few days.  Assume 
all random values described below are mutually independent. 

(a)	 A busy student must complete 3 problem sets before doing  laundry.  Each prob­
lem  set  requires 1 day with probability 2/3 and 2 days with probability 1/3.  Let B 
be the number of days a busy student delays laundry. What is Ex (B )? 
Example:  If  the ﬁrst problem  set  requires 1 day and  the  second and  third problem 
sets each require 2 days, then the student delays for B  = 5 days. 
Solution.  The expected time to complete a problem set is:

(b)	 A relaxed student rolls a  fair, 6-sided die  in  the morning.  If he rolls a 1,  then he 
does  his  laundry  immediately  (with  zero days  of delay).  Otherwise,  he delays  for 
one day and repeats the experiment the following morning. Let R be the number of 
days a relaxed student delays laundry. What is Ex (R)? 
Example:  If the student rolls a 2 the ﬁrst morning, a 5 the second morning, and a 1 
the third morning, then he delays for R = 2 days. 
Solution.  If we  regard doing  laundry  as  a  failure,  then  the mean  time  to  failure  is 
1/(1/6)  =  6.  However,  this counts  the day  laundry  is done,  so  the number of days 
delay is 6 − 1 = 5. Alternatively, we could derive the answer as follows:

(c) 	 Before doing laundry, an unlucky student must recover from illness for a number 
of days equal to the product of the numbers rolled on two fair, 6-sided dice. Let U  be 
the expected number of days an unlucky student delays laundry. What is Ex (U )? 
Example:  If the rolls are 5 and 3, then the student delays for U  = 15 days. 
Solution.  Let D1  and D2  be  the  two die rolls.  Recall  that a die roll has expectation

What is the expected number of adjacent pairs with the same value?  In the example, there 
are two adjacent pairs with the same value, the 3’s and the 5’s. 
We can award partial credit only if you show your work. 

Solution.  Consider  an  adjacent  pair.  The  left  card matches  only  one  of  the  other  11 
cards, which is equally likely to be in any of the 11 other positions.  Therefore, the proba­
bility that an adjacent pair matches is 1/11.  Since there are 11 adjacent pairs, the expected 
· 
number of matches is 11  1/11 = 1 by linearity of expectation.

(a)  Let X  be the total number times these ﬁve players hit the ball next season. What

assume that hits happen mutually independently.

This gives: 

Pr (X  ≤ 400) = Pr (X  ≤ (1 − 1/5) Ex (X ))
