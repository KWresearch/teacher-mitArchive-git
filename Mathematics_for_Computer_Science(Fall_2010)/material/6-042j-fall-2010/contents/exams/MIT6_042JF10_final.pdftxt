Problem 1.  [20 points] 
We deﬁne the following recurrence for n ≥ 0: 

2 

Tn+2  = Tn+1 + 2Tn 

where T0  = T1  = 1. 
(a)  [8 pts]  Prove  by  induction  that  Tn  is  odd  for  n  ≥  0.  You  do  not  need  to  solve  the 
recurrence for this.

(b)  [12 pts] Prove by  induction  that gcd(Tn+1 , Tn ) =  1  for n  ≥  0.  You may assume  that 
Tn  is odd for all n. You do not need to solve the recurrence for this.

Problem 2.  [12 points] 
Find a closed-form solution to the following recurrence: 

x0  =  4

x1  =  23

xn  =  11xn−1 − 30xn−2  for n ≥ 2.

Problem 3.  [10 points]  Note:  in this question, you may use “choose” notation or factorials 
in your answers for both (a) and (b).  In the card game of bridge, you are dealt a hand of 
13 cards from the standard 52-card deck. 

(a)  [5 pts]  A  balanced  hand  is  one  in  which  a  player  has  roughly  the  same  number  of 
cards  in  each  suit.  How many different hands  are  there where  the player has  4  cards  in 
one suit and 3 cards in each of the other suits? 

(b)  [5 pts] Not surprisingly, a non-balanced hand is one in which a player has more cards 
in some suits than others. Hands that are very desired are ones where over half the cards 
are  in  one  suit.  How many  different  hands  are  there where  there  are  exactly  7  cards  in 
one suit?

Problem 4.  [10 points]  Three pairs of twins are sharing a bucket of 24 pieces of chicken 
from  Olive  Oyl’s.  Through  the  magic  of  twinship,  each  person  always  eats  exactly  as 
many pieces of chicken as his or her twin.  If each person eats at least one piece of chicken, 
how many ways can the chicken pieces be distributed amongst this family?  For the pur­
poses of this problem, chicken pieces are indistinguishable, and every piece is eaten.

Problem 5.  [15 points]  A family of seven folk eat a meal at Kansas Flightless Chicken that 
comes with unlimited free biscuits (the restaurant owner has deep pockets).  Being a car­
ing family, they only eat biscuits by sharing them with other family members.  However, 
the family obeys the following two rules: 

•  A biscuit must be shared between exactly two people 

•  If two people share a biscuit, they cannot share another biscuit with each other. 

Prove  that  two  members  of  this  family  must  have  shared  the  same  number  of  biscuits 
over the course of dinner.

Problem 7.  [10 points]  Let G be a bipartite graph with n nodes and k connected compo­
nents. You (mutually) independently color each of the nodes of G red or black with equal 
probabilities. What is the probability that your coloring is a valid 2-coloring of G?  (Hint: 
the answer does not depend on the number of edges.)

Problem  8.  [20  points]  In  the  far-off  land  of  Spain,  two  soccer  teams,  Barcelona  and 
Madrid  have  been  battling  each  other  for  centuries  to  see who  is more  awesome.  They 
play  two  games  a  year:  one  in  the  Spring  and  one  in  the  Fall.  The Madrid  team  has  a 
tendency to ﬁre their coaches very often to try to improve their results.  The outcomes of 
the games are as follows: 

1.  If Madrid has not ﬁred their coach since the previous game: 
•  Barcelona wins with probability  2
5 
•  Madrid wins with probability  2
5 
•  They tie with probability  1
5 
2.  If Madrid  has  ﬁred  their  coach  since  the  previous  game  (they  haven’t  yet  realized 
that it’s a bad idea): 

•  Barcelona wins with probability  3
5 
•  Madrid wins with probability  1
5 
•  They tie with probability  1
5 

Now, Madrid does not ﬁre their coach if they win or tie, but if they lose, they will ﬁre their 
coach with 90% probability  following  the  loss.  For  the  following  two questions, assume 
that  Madrid  did  not  ﬁre  their  coach  before  the  Spring  2010  game.  Here,  everything  is 
mutually  independent unless otherwise speciﬁed.  You can use the following timeline to 
help you visualize the situation. 

(a)  [10 pts] Given  that Madrid  lost  the Fall 2010 game, what  is  the probability  that  they 
ﬁred their coach between the Spring and Fall games of 2010?

(b)  [10 pts] What is the probability that Madrid ﬁred their coach between the Spring and 
Fall games in 2010 given that they lost BOTH of the games in 2010?

Problem 9.  [11 points]  Harvard’s loan ofﬁcer is evaluating her portfolio of student loans. 
There  are  4  especially  suspicious  loans.  Loan A  is given  to  an  average Harvard  student 
who does average Harvard stuff.  It has a probability of 1/10 of being paid back.  Loan B 
was given to Bill Gates and has a 1/5 probability of being paid back. Loan C was given to 
David the evil TA and has a probability of 1/3 of being paid back. Loan D was given to a 
6.042 student and has 1/2 probability of being paid back.  In each of these parts, express 
any numbers in your answer as ratios of integers. 

(a)  [3 pts]  If  the probabilities of being paid back are mutually  independent, what  is  the 
probability that all four loans are paid back? 

(b)  [4 pts]  If  the  probabilities  are  pairwise  independent,  what  is  the most  that  you  can 
say about the probability that all four loans get paid back? 

Final

(c)  [4 pts] If you cannot assume any independence, what is the most you can say about 
the probability that all four loans are paid back?

Problem 10.  [10 points] 
Consider a length n vector of integers, x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) where the entries of the vector 
are integers in the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, and the xi  are selected uniformly at random. Note that 
this means numbers can repeat;  x  could,  for example, be a vector of all 1’s.  Let  A be  the 
number of entries  xi  in the vector for which  xi  ≤  i.  Calculate Ex[ A] and give it in closed 
form. 

Final 

15 

Problem 11.  [10 points]  Let R be a positive random variable with Ex[R3 ] = k. Prove that 
Pr(R ≥  x) ≤ k/x3  for any x > 0. 

Final

Problem 12.  [32 points] 
In  all  parts  of  this  problem,  assume  that  we  are  using  fair,  regular  dice  (six-sided  with 
values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 appearing equally  likely).  Furthermore, assume  that all dice rolls are 
mutually independent events. 

(a)  [4 pts] You  roll  two dice and  look at  the  sum of  the  faces  that come up.  What  is  the 
expected value of this sum? Express your answer as a real number. 

(b)  [7 pts]  Assuming  that  the  two  dice  are  independent,  calculate  the  variance  of  their 
sum. Express your answer as a real number. 

Final 

17 

(c)  [7 pts] You repeatedly roll two fair dice and look at the sum.  What is the probability 
that  you will  roll  a  sum  of  4  before  you  roll  a  sum  of  7?  Express  your  answer  as  a  real 
number. 

(d)  [7 pts] What  is  the expected number of  rolls until you get a  sum of 4 or a  sum of 7? 
(For example, if you get 7 on the ﬁrst roll, the number of rolls is 1.)  Express your answer 
as a real number. 

Final 

18 

(e)  [7 pts]  You  roll  10  dice.  Using  the  Chernoff  Bound,  give  an  upper  bound  for  the 
probability that 8 or more of them rolled a 1 or a 2?  You don’t need to calculate the value 
with a calculator (since you do not have one), but please write it in simplest terms.

Problem 13.  [10 points] 
An MIT student is walking along Mass Ave and is torn between making a trip to the pub 
and going to her dorm to ﬁnish her 6.042 homework. The student is n steps from the pub 
and  T − n  steps  from  the dorm where  T  >=  3  is  the distance  between  the pub  and  the 
dorm, both located on Mass Ave (which we will assume to be a straight line). The student 
ﬂips a coin at each step to decide which way to go. With probability p, the student takes 2 
steps toward the pub and with probability 1 − p, she takes 1 step toward her dorm.  If the 
student is one or two steps away from the pub and takes two steps toward the pub, then 
she reaches  the pub.  If she  is one step away  from her dorm and  takes a step  toward her 
dorm,  then she reaches the dorm..  Let Xn  be the probability that the student reaches the 
pub before she reaches the dorm.  Assume that all coin tosses are mutually independent. 
Find  a  recurrence  for  Xn .  (You  do  not  need  to  solve  the  recurrence,  but  your  answer 
should contain sufﬁcient information such that a 6.042 could solve it given enough time.)
