Final Exam 

YOUR NAME: 

•	 You may use two 8.5× 11” sheets with notes in your own handwriting on both sides, 
but no other reference materials. Calculators are not allowed. 

•	 You may assume all results presented in class. 

•	 Write  your  solutions  in  the  space  provided.  If  you  need more  space,  write  on  the 
back of the sheet containing the problem. Please keep your entire answer to a prob­
lem on that problem’s page. 

•	 Be  neat  and write  legibly.  You will  be  graded  not  only  on  the  correctness  of  your 
answers, but also on the clarity with which you express them. 

GOOD LUCK!

Problem 1.  [13 points] Give an  inductive proof  that  the Fibonacci numbers Fn  and Fn+1 
are relatively prime for all n ≥ 0. The Fibonacci numbers are deﬁned as follows: 
(for n ≥ 2) 

Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2 

F0  = 0 

F1  = 1

Problem  2.  [15  points]  The  double  of  a  graph  G  consists  of  two  copies  of  G  with  edges 
joining  corresponding  vertices.  For  example,  a  graph  appears  below  on  the  left  and  its 
double appears on the right. 

Some edges in the graph on the right are dashed to clarify its structure. 

(a)  Draw the double of the graph shown below.

(b)	 Suppose  that G1  is a bipartite graph, G2  is  the double of G1 , G3  is  the double of 
G2 , and so forth. Use induction on n to prove that Gn  is bipartite for all n ≥ 1.

Problem  3.  [12 points] Finalphobia  is a  rare disease  in which  the victim has  the delusion 
that he or she is being subjected to an intense mathematical examination. 

•  A person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia with probability 1/100. 

•  A person with ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 9/10. 

•  A person without ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 1/20. 

What is the probablility that a person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia, given 
that he or she has shaky hands?

Problem 4.  [12 points] Suppose that you roll ﬁve 6-sided dice that are fair and mutually 
independent. For the problems below, answers alone are sufﬁcient, but we can award par­
tial credit only if you show your work.  Also, you do not need to simplify your answers; 
you may leave factorials, binomial coefﬁcients, and arithmetic expressions unevaluated. 

(a)	 What is the probability that all ﬁve dice show different values?

Example:  (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 3, 4) is not.


(b)	 What  is  the  probability  that  two  dice  show  the  same  value  and  the  remaining 
three dice all show different values? 
Example:  (6, 1, 6, 2, 3) is a roll of this type, but (1, 1, 2, 2, 3) and (4, 4, 4, 5, 6) are not. 

(c) 	 What  is  the probability  that  two dice show one value,  two different dice show a 
second value, and the remaining die shows a third value? 
Example:  (6, 1, 2, 1, 2) is a roll of this type, but (4, 4, 4, 4, 5) and (5, 5, 5, 6, 6) are not.

Problem 5.  [12 points] An electronic  toy displays a 4 × 4 grid of  colored  squares.  At all 
times,  four are red,  four are green,  four are blue, and four are yellow.  For example, here

For parts (a) and (b) below, you need not simplify your answers. 

(a)  How many such conﬁgurations are possible? 

(b)	 Below  the display,  there  are ﬁve buttons numbered  1,  2,  3,  4,  and  5.  The player 
may press a sequence of buttons; however, the same button can not be pressed twice 
in a row. How many different sequences of n button-presses are possible? 

Final Exam

(c) 	 Each  button  press  scrambles  the  colored  squares  in  a  complicated,  but  nonran­
dom  way.  Prove  that  there  exist  two  different  sequences  of  32  button  presses  that 
both  produce  the  same  conﬁguration,  if  the  puzzle  is  initially  in  the  state  shown 
above.  (Hint:  432  = 1616  > 16!)

Problem  6.  [12 points] MIT  students  sometimes delay  laundry  for  a  few days.  Assume 
all random values described below are mutually independent. 

(a)	 A busy student must complete 3 problem sets before doing  laundry.  Each prob­
lem  set  requires 1 day with probability 2/3 and 2 days with probability 1/3.  Let B 
be the number of days a busy student delays laundry. What is Ex (B )? 
Example:  If  the ﬁrst problem  set  requires 1 day and  the  second and  third problem 
sets each require 2 days, then the student delays for B  = 5 days. 

(b)	 A relaxed student rolls a  fair, 6-sided die  in  the morning.  If he rolls a 1,  then he 
does  his  laundry  immediately  (with  zero days  of delay).  Otherwise,  he delays  for 
one day and repeats the experiment the following morning. Let R be the number of 
days a relaxed student delays laundry. What is Ex (R)? 
Example:  If the student rolls a 2 the ﬁrst morning, a 5 the second morning, and a 1 
the third morning, then he delays for R = 2 days. 

Final Exam

(c) 	 Before doing laundry, an unlucky student must recover from illness for a number 
of days equal to the product of the numbers rolled on two fair, 6-sided dice. Let U  be 
the expected number of days an unlucky student delays laundry. What is Ex (U )? 
Example:  If the rolls are 5 and 3, then the student delays for U  = 15 days. 

(d)	 A student is busy with probability 1/2, relaxed with probability 1/3, and unlucky 
with probability 1/6. Let D be the number of days the student delays laundry. What 
is Ex (D)?  Leave your answer in terms of Ex (B ), Ex (R), and Ex (U ).

Problem 8.  [12 points] Each time a baseball player bats, he hits the ball with some proba­
bility. The table below gives the hit probability and number of chances to bat next season 
for ﬁve players.
