Midterm  Practice  Problems 

Name: 

�	 This  quiz  is  closed  book,  but  you  may  have  one  8.5 × 11”  sheet  with  notes  in  your 
own  handwriting  on  both  sides. 

�	 Calculators  are  not  allowed. 

�	 You may  assume  all  of  the  results  presented  in  class. 

�	 Please show your work.  Partial credit cannot be given  for a wrong answer  if your work 
isn’t  shown. 

�	 Write  your  solutions  in  the  space  provided.  If  you  need more  space, write  on  the  back 
of  the  sheet  containing  the  problem.  Please  keep  your  entire  answer  to  a  problem  on 
that  problem’s  page. 

�	 Be  neat  and  write  legibly.  You  will  be  graded  not  only  on  the  correctness  of  your 
answers,  but  also  on  the  clarity  with  which  you  express  them. 

�	 If  you  get  stuck  on  a  problem,  move  on  to  others.  The  problems  are  not  arranged  in 
order  of  diﬃculty.

Problem 1.  [10 points]  In problem set 1 you showed that the nand operator by itself can be 
used  to write  equivalent  expressions  for  all  other Boolean  logical  operators.  We  call  such  an

Problem  3.  [20  points]  The  Slipped  Disc  Puzzle�  consists  of  a  track  holding  9  circular 
tiles.  In  the  middle  is  a  disc  that  can  slide  left  and  right  and  rotate  180 ◦  to  change  the 
positions  of  exactly  four  tiles.  As  shown  below,  there  are  three  ways  to  manipulate  the 
puzzle: 

Shift  Right:  The  center  disc  is moved  one  unit  to  the  right  (if  there  is  space) 

Rotate  Disc:  The  four  tiles  in  the  center  disc  are  reversed 

Shift  Left:  The  center  disc  is moved  one  unit  to  the  left  (if  there  is  space) 

Prove  that  if  the  puzzle  starts  in  an  initial  state  with  all  but  tiles  1  and  2  in  their  natural 
order,  then  it  is  impossible to reach a goal state where all the tiles are  in their natural order. 
The  initial  and  goal  states  are  shown  below:

Problem 5.  [15 points]  Consider a graph representing the main campus buildings at MIT. 

(a)  [3 pts]  Is  this  graph  bipartite?  Provide  a  brief  argument  for  your  answer. 

(b)  [4 pts] Does this graph have an Euler circuit?  Provide a brief argument for your answer.

Problem  5  continued... 
Now suppose each building has separate mail collection and drop-oﬀ boxes and each collection 
box  has  a  single  package  destined  for  a  unique  drop-oﬀ  box  (i.e.  a  permutation).  We  can 
model this as a permutation routing problem by treating the buildings as switches, attaching 
an  input  and  output  terminal  to  each  of  the  nine  buildings,  and  treating  the  existing  edges 
as  bidirectional  as  in  the  graph  below: 

(c)  [4 pts]  Give  the  diameter  of  this  graph: 

(d)  [4 pts] What is the max congestion of this graph?  That is, in the worst case permutation, 
how many packages would need  to pass  through a  single building?  Provide a brief argument 
for  your  answer.

Problem  6.  [10  points]

A  tournament  graph G = (V , E )  is  a directed  graph  such  that  there  is  either  an  edge  from u 
to  v  or  an  edge  from  v  to  u  for  every  distinct  pair  of  nodes  u  and  v .  (The  nodes  represent 
→ 
v  indicates  that  player  u  beats  player  v .)
players  and  an  edge  u
Consider  the  “beats”  relation  implied  by  a  tournament  graph.  Indicate whether  or  not  each 
of the following relational properties hold for  al l  tournament graphs and brieﬂy explain your 
reasoning.  You may  assume  that  a  player  never  plays  herself. 

1.  transitive 

2.  symmetric 

3.  antisymmetric 

4.  reﬂexive

Problem 7.  [20 points]  An outerplanar graph is an undirected graph for which the vertices 
can  be  placed  on  a  circle  in  such  a  way  that  no  edges  (drawn  as  straight  lines)  cross  each 
other.  For example,  the complete graph on 4 vertices, K4 ,  is not outerplanar but any proper 
subgraph of K4  with  strictly  fewer  edges  is outerplanar.  Some  examples are provided below: 

Prove  that  any  outerplanar  graph  is  3-colorable.  A  fact  you  may  use  without  proof  is  that 
any  outerplanar  graph  has  a  vertex  of  degree  at most  2.

Problem  9.  [15  points]  Circle every  symbol on  the  left  that  could correctly appear  in  the 
box  to  its  right.  For  each  of  the  six  parts  you may  need  to  circle  any  number  of  symbols.
