Name: 

•	 This quiz is closed book, but you may have one 8.5 × 11” sheet with notes in your 
own handwriting on both sides. 

•	 Calculators are not allowed. 

•	 You may assume all of the results presented in class. 

•	 Please  show your work.  Partial  credit  cannot be given  for a wrong answer  if your 
work isn’t shown. 

•	 Write  your  solutions  in  the  space  provided.  If  you  need more  space,  write  on  the 
back of the sheet containing the problem. Please keep your entire answer to a prob­
lem on that problem’s page. 

•	 Be  neat  and write  legibly.  You will  be  graded  not  only  on  the  correctness  of  your 
answers, but also on the clarity with which you express them. 

•	 If you get stuck on a problem, move on to others. The problems are not arranged in 
order of difﬁculty. 

•	 The exam ends at 9:30 PM.

Problem 1.  [10 points] 
Consider these two propositions: 

P:  ( A ∨ B) ⇒ C 
Q:  (¬C ⇒ ¬ A) ∨ (¬C ⇒ ¬B) 

2 

Which  of  the  following  best  describes  the  relationship  between  P  and  Q?  Please  circle 
exactly one answer. 

2.  P

1.  P and Q are equivalent 
Q⇒ 
P⇒ 
4.  All of the above 

3.  Q

5.  None of the above 

Draw  a  truth  table  to  illustrate  your  reasoning.  You  can  use  as  many  columns  as  you 
need.

Problem 2.  [10 points] 
Let G0  = 1, G1  = 3, G2  = 9, and deﬁne 

Gn  = Gn−1 + 3Gn−2 + 3Gn−3 
for n ≥ 3.  Show by induction that Gn  ≤ 3n  for all n ≥ 0.

Problem 3.  [20 points] 
In  the  game  of  Squares  and  Circles,  the  players  (you  and  your  computer)  start  with  a 
shared  ﬁnite  collection  of  shapes:  some  circles  and  some  squares.  Players  take  turns 
making  moves.  On  each  move,  a  player  chooses  any  two  shapes  from  the  collection. 
These two are replaced with a single one according to the following rule: 
A pair of identical shapes is replaced with a square. A pair of different shapes is replaced 
with a circle. 
At the end of the game, when only one shape remains, you are a winner if the remaining 
shape is a circle. Otherwise, your computer wins. 

(a)  [5 pts] Prove that the game will end.

(b)  [15 pts] Prove that you will win if and only if the number of circles initially is odd.

Problem 4.  [15 points] 
(a)  [8 pts] Find a number x ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 112} such that 11x ≡ 1  (mod  113). 

(b)  [7 pts]  Find  a  number  y  ∈ {0, 1, . . . , 112}  such  that  11112111  ≡  y  (mod  113)  (Hint: 
Note that 113 is a prime.)

(c)  [4 pts]  Give  a  coloring  on  G  and  show  that  it  uses  the  smallest  possible  number  of 
colors. 

(d)  [4 pts] Does G have an Eulerian cycle?  Justify your answer.

Now consider graph H , which is like G but with weighted edges, in ﬁgure 2: 

Figure 2: Weighted graph H 

(e)  [4 pts] Give a list of edges reﬂecting the order in which one of the greedy algorithms 
presented in class (i.e.  in lecture, recitation, or the course text) would choose edges when 
ﬁnding an MST on H .

Problem  6.  [25  points]  Let  G  be  a  graph  with  m  edges,  n  vertices,  and  k  components. 
Prove  that  G  contains  at  least  m − n + k  cycles.  (Hint:  Prove  this  by  induction  on  the 
number of edges, m)
