Events and Probability Spaces

14.1 Let’s Make a Deal

In the September 9, 1990 issue of Parade magazine, columnist Marilyn vos Savant
responded to this letter:

Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three
doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a
door, say number 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors,
opens another door, say number 3, which has a goat. He says to you,
”Do you want to pick door number 2?” Is it to your advantage to
switch your choice of doors?

Craig. F. Whitaker
Columbia, MD

The letter describes a situation like one faced by contestants in the 1970’s game
show Let’s Make a Deal, hosted by Monty Hall and Carol Merrill. Marilyn replied
that the contestant should indeed switch. She explained that if the car was behind
either of the two unpicked doors—which is twice as likely as the the car being
behind the picked door—the contestant wins by switching. But she soon received
a torrent of letters, many from mathematicians, telling her that she was wrong. The
problem became known as the Monty Hall Problem and it generated thousands of
hours of heated debate.
This incident highlights a fact about probability: the subject uncovers lots of
examples where ordinary intuition leads to completely wrong conclusions. So until
you’ve studied probabilities enough to have reﬁned your intuition, a way to avoid
errors is to fall back on a rigorous, systematic approach such as the Four Step
Method that we will describe shortly. First, let’s make sure we really understand
the setup for this problem. This is always a good thing to do when you are dealing
with probability.

14.1.1 Clarifying the Problem
Craig’s original letter to Marilyn vos Savant is a bit vague, so we must make some
assumptions in order to have any hope of modeling the game formally. For exam-
ple, we will assume that:

1“mcs-ftl” — 2010/9/8 — 0:40 — page 392 — #398

Chapter 14 Events and Probability Spaces

1. The car is equally likely to be hidden behind each of the three doors.

2. The player is equally likely to pick each of the three doors, regardless of the
car’s location.

3. After the player picks a door, the host must open a different door with a goat
behind it and offer the player the choice of staying with the original door or
switching.

4. If the host has a choice of which door to open, then he is equally likely to
select each of them.

In making these assumptions, we’re reading a lot into Craig Whitaker’s letter. Other
interpretations are at least as defensible, and some actually lead to different an-
swers. But let’s accept these assumptions for now and address the question, “What
is the probability that a player who switches wins the car?”

14.2 The Four Step Method

Every probability problem involves some sort of randomized experiment, process,
or game. And each such problem involves two distinct challenges:

1. How do we model the situation mathematically?

2. How do we solve the resulting mathematical problem?

In this section, we introduce a four step approach to questions of the form, “What
is the probability that. . . ?” In this approach, we build a probabilistic model step-
by-step, formalizing the original question in terms of that model. Remarkably, the
structured thinking that this approach imposes provides simple solutions to many
famously-confusing problems. For example, as you’ll see, the four step method
cuts through the confusion surrounding the Monty Hall problem like a Ginsu knife.

14.2.1 Step 1: Find the Sample Space
Our ﬁrst objective is to identify all the possible outcomes of the experiment. A
typical experiment involves several randomly-determined quantities. For example,
the Monty Hall game involves three such quantities:

1. The door concealing the car.

2. The door initially chosen by the player.

14.2. The Four Step Method

Figure 14.1 The ﬁrst level in a tree diagram for the Monty Hall Problem. The
branches correspond to the door behind which the car is located.

3. The door that the host opens to reveal a goat.

Every possible combination of these randomly-determined quantities is called an
outcome. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space for the exper-
iment.
A tree diagram is a graphical tool that can help us work through the four step
approach when the number of outcomes is not too large or the problem is nicely
structured. In particular, we can use a tree diagram to help understand the sample
space of an experiment. The ﬁrst randomly-determined quantity in our experiment
is the door concealing the prize. We represent this as a tree with three branches, as
shown in Figure 14.1. In this diagram, the doors are called A, B , and C instead of
1, 2, and 3, because we’ll be adding a lot of other numbers to the picture later.
For each possible location of the prize, the player could initially choose any of
the three doors. We represent this in a second layer added to the tree. Then a third
layer represents the possibilities of the ﬁnal step when the host opens a door to
reveal a goat, as shown in Figure 14.2.
Notice that the third layer reﬂects the fact that the host has either one choice
or two, depending on the position of the car and the door initially selected by the
player. For example, if the prize is behind door A and the player picks door B, then

14.2. The Four Step Method

the host must open door C. However, if the prize is behind door A and the player
picks door A, then the host could open either door B or door C.
Now let’s relate this picture to the terms we introduced earlier: the leaves of the
tree represent outcomes of the experiment, and the set of all leaves represents the
sample space. Thus, for this experiment, the sample space consists of 12 outcomes.
For reference, we’ve labeled each outcome in Figure 14.3 with a triple of doors
indicating:
.door concealing prize; door initially chosen; door opened to reveal a goat/:
S D (cid:26) .A; A; B /; .A; A; C /; .A; B ; C /; .A; C ; B /; .B ; A; C /; .B ; B ; A/;
(cid:27)
In these terms, the sample space is the set
.B ; B ; C /; .B ; C ; A/; .C ; A; B /; .C ; B ; A/; .C ; C ; A/; .C ; C ; B /
The tree diagram has a broader interpretation as well: we can regard the whole
experiment as following a path from the root to a leaf, where the branch taken at
each stage is “randomly” determined. Keep this interpretation in mind; we’ll use it
again later.

14.2.2 Step 2: Deﬁne Events of Interest
Our objective is to answer questions of the form “What is the probability that . . . ?”,
where, for example, the missing phrase might be “the player wins by switching”,
“the player initially picked the door concealing the prize”, or “the prize is behind
door C”. Each of these phrases characterizes a set of outcomes. For example, the
outcomes speciﬁed by “the prize is behind door C ” is:
f.C ; A; B /; .C ; B ; A/; .C ; C ; A/; .C ; C ; B /g:
A set of outcomes is called an event and it is a subset of the sample space. So the
event that the player initially picked the door concealing the prize is the set:
f.A; A; B /; .A; A; C /; .B ; B ; A/; .B ; B ; C /; .C ; C ; A/; .C ; C ; B /g:
And what we’re really after, the event that the player wins by switching, is the set
of outcomes:
f.A; B ; C /; .A; C ; B /; .B ; A; C /; .B ; C ; A/; .C ; A; B /; .C ; B ; A/g:
These outcomes are denoted with a check mark in Figure 14.4.
Notice that exactly half of the outcomes are checked, meaning that the player
wins by switching in half of all outcomes. You might be tempted to conclude that
a player who switches wins with probability 1=2. This is wrong. The reason is that
these outcomes are not all equally likely, as we’ll see shortly.

Chapter 14 Events and Probability Spaces

14.2.3 Step 3: Determine Outcome Probabilities
So far we’ve enumerated all the possible outcomes of the experiment. Now we
must start assessing the likelihood of those outcomes. In particular, the goal of this
step is to assign each outcome a probability, indicating the fraction of the time this
outcome is expected to occur. The sum of all outcome probabilities must be one,
reﬂecting the fact that there always is an outcome.
Ultimately, outcome probabilities are determined by the phenomenon we’re mod-
eling and thus are not quantities that we can derive mathematically. However, math-
ematics can help us compute the probability of every outcome based on fewer and
more elementary modeling decisions. In particular, we’ll break the task of deter-
mining outcome probabilities into two stages.

Step 3a: Assign Edge Probabilities
First, we record a probability on each edge of the tree diagram. These edge-
probabilities are determined by the assumptions we made at the outset: that the
prize is equally likely to be behind each door, that the player is equally likely to
pick each door, and that the host is equally likely to reveal each goat, if he has a
choice. Notice that when the host has no choice regarding which door to open, the
single branch is assigned probability 1. For example, see Figure 14.5.

1

Step 3b: Compute Outcome Probabilities
Our next job is to convert edge probabilities into outcome probabilities. This is a
purely mechanical process: the probability of an outcome is equal to the product of
the edge-probabilities on the path from the root to that outcome. For example, the
probability of the topmost outcome in Figure 14.5, .A; A; B /, is
D 1
(cid:1) 1
(cid:1) 1
3
3
18
2
There’s an easy, intuitive justiﬁcation for this rule. As the steps in an experiment
progress randomly along a path from the root of the tree to a leaf, the probabilities
on the edges indicate how likely the path is to proceed along each branch. For
example, a path starting at the root in our example is equally likely to go down
each of the three top-level branches.
How likely is such a path to arrive at the topmost outcome, .A; A; B /? Well,
there is a 1-in-3 chance that a path would follow the A-branch at the top level,
a 1-in-3 chance it would continue along the A-branch at the second level, and 1-
in-2 chance it would follow the B -branch at the third level. Thus, it seems that
1 path in 18 should arrive at the .A; A; B / leaf, which is precisely the probability
we assign it.

Chapter 14 Events and Probability Spaces

We have illustrated all of the outcome probabilities in Figure 14.6.
Specifying the probability of each outcome amounts to deﬁning a function that
maps each outcome to a probability. This function is usually called Pr. In these
terms, we’ve just determined that:
PrŒ.A; A; B / D 1

PrŒ.A; A; C / D 1

PrŒ.A; B ; C / D 1

etc.

14.2.4 Step 4: Compute Event Probabilities
We now have a probability for each outcome, but we want to determine the proba-
bility of an event. The probability of an event E is denoted by PrŒE  and it is the
sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in E . For example, the probability of the
event that the player wins by switching is:1
PrŒswitching wins D PrŒ.A; B ; C / C PrŒ.A; C ; B / C PrŒ.B ; A; C /C

It seems Marilyn’s answer is correct! A player who switches doors wins the car
with probability 2=3. In contrast, a player who stays with his or her original door
wins with probability 1=3, since staying wins if and only if switching loses.
We’re done with the problem! We didn’t need any appeals to intuition or inge-
nious analogies. In fact, no mathematics more difﬁcult than adding and multiplying
fractions was required. The only hard part was resisting the temptation to leap to
an “intuitively obvious” answer.

Was Marilyn really right? Our analysis indicates that she was. But a more accurate
conclusion is that her answer is correct provided we accept her interpretation of the

f.A; B ; C /; .A; C ; B /; .B ; A; C /; .B ; C ; A/; .C ; A; B /; .C ; B ; A/g. We will frequently use such
shorthand to denote events.

question. There is an equally plausible interpretation in which Marilyn’s answer
is wrong. Notice that Craig Whitaker’s original letter does not say that the host is
required to reveal a goat and offer the player the option to switch, merely that he
did these things. In fact, on the Let’s Make a Deal show, Monty Hall sometimes
simply opened the door that the contestant picked initially. Therefore, if he wanted
to, Monty could give the option of switching only to contestants who picked the
correct door initially. In this case, switching never works!

14.3 Strange Dice

The four-step method is surprisingly powerful. Let’s get some more practice with
it. Imagine, if you will, the following scenario.
It’s a typical Saturday night. You’re at your favorite pub, contemplating the
true meaning of inﬁnite cardinalities, when a burly-looking biker plops down on
the stool next to you. Just as you are about to get your mind around P .P .R//,
biker dude slaps three strange-looking dice on the bar and challenges you to a $100
wager.
The rules are simple. Each player selects one die and rolls it once. The player
with the lower value pays the other player $100.
Naturally, you are skeptical. A quick inspection reveals that these are not ordi-
nary dice. They each have six sides, but the numbers on the dice are different, as
shown in Figure 14.7.
Biker dude notices your hesitation and so he offers to let you pick a die ﬁrst, and

abc12“mcs-ftl” — 2010/9/8 — 0:40 — page 403 — #409

14.3. Strange Dice

403

then he will choose his die from the two that are left. That seals the deal since you
ﬁgure that you now have an advantage.
But which of the dice should you choose? Die B is appealing because it has
a 9, which is a sure winner if it comes up. Then again, die A has two fairly large
numbers and die B has an 8 and no really small values.
In the end, you choose die B because it has a 9, and then biker dude selects die A.
Let’s see what the probability is that you will win.2 Not surprisingly, we will use
the four-step method to compute this probability.

14.3.1 Die A versus Die B
Step 1: Find the sample space.
The sample space for this experiment is worked out in the tree diagram shown in
Figure 14.8.3
For this experiment, the sample space is a set of nine outcomes:
S D f .2 ; 1/; .2 ; 5/; .2 ; 9/; .6; 1/; .6; 5/; .6; 9/; .7; 1/; .7; 5/; .7; 9/ g:
Step 2: Deﬁne events of interest.
We are interested in the event that the number on die A is greater than the number
on die B . This event is a set of ﬁve outcomes:
f .2 ; 1/; .6; 1/; .6; 5/; .7; 1/; .7; 5/ g:

These outcomes are marked A in the tree diagram in Figure 14.8.

Step 3: Determine outcome probabilities.
To ﬁnd outcome probabilities, we ﬁrst assign probabilities to edges in the tree di-
agram. Each number on each die comes up with probability 1=3, regardless of
the value of the other die. Therefore, we assign all edges probability 1=3. The
probability of an outcome is the product of the probabilities on the correspond-
ing root-to-leaf path, which means that every outcome has probability 1=9. These
probabilities are recorded on the right side of the tree diagram in Figure 14.8.

Step 4: Compute event probabilities.
The probability of an event is the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes in that
event. In this case, all the outcome probabilities are the same. In general, when the
probability of every outcome is the same, we say that the sample space is uniform.
Computing event probabilities for uniform sample spaces is particularly easy since

2Of course, you probably should have done this before picking die B in the ﬁrst place.
3Actually, the whole probability space is worked out in this one picture. But pretend that each
component sort of fades in—nyyrrroom!—as you read about the corresponding step below.

you just have to compute the number of outcomes in the event. In particular, for
any event E in a uniform sample space S ,
PrŒE  D jE j

In this case, E is the event that die A beats die B , so jE j D 5, jS j D 9, and
PrŒE  D 5=9:

(14.1)

This is bad news for you. Die A beats die B more than half the time and, not
surprisingly, you just lost $100.
Biker dude consoles you on your “bad luck” and, given that he’s a sensitive guy
beneath all that leather, he offers to go double or nothing.4 Given that your wallet
only has $25 in it, this sounds like a good plan. Plus, you ﬁgure that choosing die A
will give you the advantage.
So you choose A, and then biker dude chooses C . Can you guess who is more
likely to win? (Hint: it is generally not a good idea to gamble with someone you
don’t know in a bar, especially when you are gambling with strange dice.)

14.3.2 Die A versus Die C
We can construct the three diagram and outcome probabilities as before. The result
is shown in Figure 14.9 and there is bad news again. Die C will beat die A with
probability 5=9, and you lose once again.
You now owe the biker dude $200 and he asks for his money. You reply that you
need to go to the bathroom.
Being a sensitive guy, biker dude nods understandingly and offers yet another
wager. This time, he’ll let you have die C . He’ll even let you raise the wager
to $200 so you can win your money back.
This is too good a deal to pass up. You know that die C is likely to beat die A
and that die A is likely to beat die B , and so die C is surely the best. Whether biker
dude picks A or B , the odds are surely in your favor this time. Biker dude must
really be a nice guy.
So you pick C , and then biker dude picks B . Let’s use the tree method to ﬁgure
out the probability that you win.

4Double or nothing is slang for doing another wager after you have lost the ﬁrst. If you lose again,
you will owe biker dude double what you owed him before. If you win, you will now be even and
you will owe him nothing.

but with the condition that instead of rolling each die once, you each roll your die
twice and your score is the sum of your rolls.
Believing that you ﬁnally have a winning wager, you agree.5 Biker dude chooses
die B and, of course, you grab die A. That’s because you know that die A will beat
die B with probability 5=9 on one roll and so surely two rolls of die A are likely to
beat two rolls of die B , right?
Wrong!

14.3.4 Rolling Twice
If each player rolls twice, the tree diagram will have four levels and 34 D 81 out-
comes. This means that it will take a while to write down the entire tree diagram.
We can, however, easily write down the ﬁrst two levels (as we have done in Fig-
ure 14.11(a)) and then notice that the remaining two levels consist of nine identical
copies of the tree in Figure 14.11(b).
The probability of each outcome is .1=3/4 D 1=81 and so, once again, we have
a uniform probability space. By Equation 14.1, this means that the probability that
A wins is the number of outcomes where A beats B divided by 81.
To compute the number of outcomes where A beats B , we observe that the sum

of pairs for which x > y is
1 C 3 C 3 C 3 C 3 C 6 C 6 C 6 C 6 D 37:
A similar count shows that there are 42 pairs for which x > y , and there are
two pairs (.14 ; 14/, .14 ; 14/) which result in ties. This means that A loses to B
with probability 42=81 > 1=2 and ties with probability 2=81. Die A wins with
probability only 37=81.
How can it be that A is more likely than B to win with 1 roll, but B is more
likely to win with 2 rolls?!? Well, why not? The only reason we’d think otherwise
is our (faulty) intuition. In fact, the die strength reverses no matter which two die
we picked. So for 1 roll,
A (cid:31) B (cid:31) C (cid:31) A;
but for two rolls,
A (cid:30) B (cid:30) C (cid:30) A;
where we have used the symbols (cid:31) and (cid:30) to denote which die is more likely to
result in the larger value. This is surprising even to us, but at least we don’t owe
biker dude $1400.

14.3.5 Even Stranger Dice
Now that we know that strange things can happen with strange dice, it is natural,
at least for mathematicians, to ask how strange things can get. It turns out that
things can get very strange. In fact, mathematicians6 recently made the following
discovery:
Theorem 14.3.1. For any n (cid:21) 2, there is a set of n dice D1 , D2 , . . . , Dn such that
for any n-node tournament graph7 G , there is a number of rolls k such that if each

7Recall that a tournament graph is a directed graph for which there is precisely one directed edge
between any two distinct nodes. In other words, for every pair of distinct nodes u and v , either u
beats v or v beats u, but not both.

Chapter 14 Events and Probability Spaces

Figure 14.12 All possible relative strengths for three dice D1 , D2 , and D3 . The
edge Di ! Dj denotes that the sum of rolls for Di is likely to be greater than the
sum of rolls for Dj .
die is rolled k times, then for all i ¤ j , the sum of the k rolls for Di will exceed
the sum for Dj with probability greater than 1=2 iff Di ! Dj is in G .
It will probably take a few attempts at reading Theorem 14.3.1 to understand
what it is saying. The idea is that for some sets of dice, by rolling them different
numbers of times, the dice have varying strengths relative to each other. (This is
what we observed for the dice in Figure 14.7.) Theorem 14.3.1 says that there is a
set of (very) strange dice where every possible collection of relative strengths can
be observed by varying the number of rolls. For example, the eight possible relative
strengths for n D 3 dice are shown in Figure 14.12.
Our analysis for the dice in Figure 14.7 showed that for 1 roll, we have the
relative strengths shown in Figure 14.12(a), and for two rolls, we have the (reverse)
relative strengths shown in Figure 14.12(b). Can you ﬁgure out what other relative
strengths are possible for the dice in Figure 14.7 by using more rolls? This might
be worth doing if you are prone to gambling with strangers in bars.

14.4 Set Theory and Probability

The study of probability is very closely tied to set theory. That is because any set
can be a sample space and any subset can be an event. This means that most of
the rules and identities that we have developed for sets extend very naturally to
probability. We’ll cover several examples in this section, but ﬁrst let’s review some
deﬁnitions that should already be familiar.

14.4.1 Probability Spaces
Deﬁnition 14.4.1. A countable8 sample space S is a nonempty countable set. An
element w 2 S is called an outcome. A subset of S is called an event.
Deﬁnition 14.4.2. A probability function on a sample space S is a total function
Pr W S ! R such that
(cid:15) P
(cid:15) PrŒw  (cid:21) 0 for all w 2 S , and
w 2S PrŒw  D 1.
A sample space together with a probability function is called a probability space.
For any event E  S , the probability of E is deﬁned to be the sum of the probabil-
PrŒE  WWD X
ities of the outcomes in E :
w 2E
14.4.2 Probability Rules from Set Theory
An immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of event probability is that for disjoint
events E and F ,
PrŒE [ F  D PrŒE  C PrŒF :
This generalizes to a countable number of events, as follows.

ter 13, don’t worry—countable means that you can list the elements of the sample space as w1 , w2 ,
w3 , . . . .

Chapter 14 Events and Probability Spaces

The Sum Rule lets us analyze a complicated event by breaking it down into
simpler cases. For example, if the probability that a randomly chosen MIT student
is native to the United States is 60%, to Canada is 5%, and to Mexico is 5%, then
the probability that a random MIT student is native to North America is 70%.
Another consequence of the Sum Rule is that PrŒA C PrŒA D 1, which follows
because PrŒS  D 1 and S is the union of the disjoint sets A and A. This equation
often comes up in the form:

Rule 14.4.4 (Complement Rule).
PrŒA D 1 (cid:0) PrŒA:

(Difference Rule)
(Inclusion-Exclusion)
(Boole’s Inequality
(Monotonicity)

Sometimes the easiest way to compute the probability of an event is to compute
the probability of its complement and then apply this formula.
Some further basic facts about probability parallel facts about cardinalities of
ﬁnite sets. In particular:
PrŒB (cid:0) A D PrŒB  (cid:0) PrŒA \ B ,
PrŒA [ B  D PrŒA C PrŒB  (cid:0) PrŒA \ B ,
PrŒA [ B   PrŒA C PrŒB ,
If A  B , then PrŒA  PrŒB .
The Difference Rule follows from the Sum Rule because B is the union of the
disjoint sets B (cid:0) A and A \ B . Inclusion-Exclusion then follows from the Sum
and Difference Rules, because A [ B is the union of the disjoint sets A and B (cid:0)
A. Boole’s inequality is an immediate consequence of Inclusion-Exclusion since
probabilities are nonnegative. Monotonicity follows from the deﬁnition of event
probability and the fact that outcome probabilities are nonnegative.
The two-event Inclusion-Exclusion equation above generalizes to n events in
the same way as the corresponding Inclusion-Exclusion rule for n sets. Boole’s
inequality also generalizes to
PrŒE1 [ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) [ En   PrŒE1  C (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) C PrŒEn :
(Union Bound)
If Pn
This simple Union Bound is useful in many calculations. For example, suppose
that Ei is the event that the i -th critical component in a spacecraft fails. Then
E1 [ (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) [ En is the event that some critical component fails.
i D1 PrŒEi 
is small, then the Union Bound can give an adequate upper bound on this vital
probability.

14.4.3 Uniform Probability Spaces
Deﬁnition 14.4.5. A ﬁnite probability space S , Pr is said to be uniform if PrŒw  is
the same for every outcome w 2 S .
As we saw in the strange dice problem, uniform sample spaces are particularly
easy to work with. That’s because for any event E  S ,
PrŒE  D jE j
jS j :
(14.2)
This means that once we know the cardinality of E and S , we can immediately
obtain PrŒE . That’s great news because we developed lots of tools for computing
the cardinality of a set in Part III.
For example, suppose that you select ﬁve cards at random from a standard deck
of 52 cards. What is the probability of having a full house? Normally, this question

would take some effort to answer. But from the analysis in Section 11.7.2, we know

Inﬁnite Probability Spaces
General probability theory deals with uncountable sets like R, but in computer sci-
ence, it is usually sufﬁcient to restrict our attention to countable probability spaces.

fair coin. The ﬁrst player to ﬂip heads wins.

It’s also a lot easier—inﬁnite sample spaces are hard enough to work with without
having to deal with uncountable spaces.
Inﬁnite probability spaces are fairly common. For example, two players take
turns ﬂipping a fair coin. Whoever ﬂips heads ﬁrst is declared the winner. What is
the probability that the ﬁrst player wins? A tree diagram for this problem is shown
in Figure 14.13.
The event that the ﬁrst player wins contains an inﬁnite number of outcomes, but
we can still sum their probabilities:

9 In the diagram, ﬂipping forever corresponds to following the inﬁnite path in the tree without
ever reaching a leaf or outcome. Some texts deal with this case by adding a special “inﬁnite” sample
point wforever to the sample space, but we will follow the more traditional approach of excluding such
sample points, as long as they collectively have probability 0.
