Inﬁnite Sets
So you might be wondering how much is there to say about an inﬁnite set other
than, well, it has an inﬁnite number of elements. Of course, an inﬁnite set does
have an inﬁnite number of elements, but it turns out that not all inﬁnite sets have
the same size—some are bigger than others! And, understanding inﬁnity is not as
easy as you might think. Some of the toughest questions in mathematics involve
inﬁnite sets.
Why should you care? Indeed, isn’t computer science only about ﬁnite sets? Not
exactly. For example, we deal with the set of natural numbers N all the time and it
is an inﬁnite set. In fact, that is why we have induction: to reason about predicates
over N. Inﬁnite sets are also important in Part IV of the text when we talk about
random variables over potentially inﬁnite sample spaces.
So sit back and open your mind for a few moments while we take a very brief
look at inﬁnity.

13.1

Injections, Surjections, and Bijections

We know from Theorem 7.2.1 that if there is an injection or surjection between two
ﬁnite sets, then we can say something about the relative sizes of the two sets. The
same is true for inﬁnite sets. In fact, relations are the primary tool for determining
the relative size of inﬁnite sets.
Deﬁnition 13.1.1. Given any two sets A and B , we say that
iff there is a surjection from A to B ,
A surj B
iff there is an injection from A to B ,
A inj B
A bij B
iff there is a bijection between A and B , and
A strict B iff there is a surjection from A to B but there is no
bijection from B to A.
Restating Theorem 7.2.1 with this new terminology, we have:
Theorem 13.1.2. For any pair of ﬁnite sets A and B ,
jAj (cid:21) jB j
iff A surj B ;
jAj  jB j
iff A inj B ;
jAj D jB j
iff A bij B ;
jAj > jB j
iff A strict B:

Chapter 13 Inﬁnite Sets

Theorem 13.1.2 suggests a way to generalize size comparisons to inﬁnite sets;
namely, we can think of the relation surj as an “at least as big” relation between sets,
even if they are inﬁnite. Similarly, the relation bij can be regarded as a “same size”
relation between (possibly inﬁnite) sets, and strict can be thought of as a “strictly
bigger” relation between sets.
Note that we haven’t, and won’t, deﬁne what the size of an inﬁnite set is. The
deﬁnition of inﬁnite “sizes” is cumbersome and technical, and we can get by just
ﬁne without it. All we need are the “as big as” and “same size” relations, surj
and bij, between sets.
But there’s something else to watch out for. We’ve referred to surj as an “as big
as” relation and bij as a “same size” relation on sets. Most of the “as big as” and
“same size” properties of surj and bij on ﬁnite sets do carry over to inﬁnite sets,
but some important ones don’t—as we’re about to show. So you have to be careful:
don’t assume that surj has any particular “as big as” property on inﬁnite sets until
it’s been proved.
Let’s begin with some familiar properties of the “as big as” and “same size”
relations on ﬁnite sets that do carry over exactly to inﬁnite sets:

Theorem 13.1.3. For any sets, A, B , and C ,

1. A surj B and B surj C IM P L I E S A surj C .

2. A bij B and B bij C IM P L I E S A bij C .

3. A bij B IM P L I E S B bij A.

Parts 1 and 2 of Theorem 13.1.3 follow immediately from the fact that composi-
tions of surjections are surjections, and likewise for bijections. Part 3 follows from
the fact that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection. We’ll leave a proof of these
facts to the problems.
Another familiar property of ﬁnite sets carries over to inﬁnite sets, but this time
it’s not so obvious:

Theorem 13.1.4 (Schr ¨oder-Bernstein). For any pair of sets A and B , if A surj B
and B surj A, then A bij B .

The Schr ¨oder-Bernstein Theorem says that if A is at least as big as B and, con-
versely, B is at least as big as A, then A is the same size as B . Phrased this way,
you might be tempted to take this theorem for granted, but that would be a mis-
take. For inﬁnite sets A and B , the Schr ¨oder-Bernstein Theorem is actually pretty
technical. Just because there is a surjective function f W A ! B—which need
not be a bijection—and a surjective function g W B ! A—which also need not

2“mcs-ftl” — 2010/9/8 — 0:40 — page 381 — #387

13.2. Countable Sets
be a bijection—it’s not at all clear that there must be a bijection h W A ! B .
The challenge is to construct h from parts of both f and g . We’ll leave the actual
construction to the problems.

13.1.1
Inﬁnity Is Different
A basic property of ﬁnite sets that does not carry over to inﬁnite sets is that adding
something new makes a set bigger. That is, if A is a ﬁnite set and b … A, then
jA [ fb gj D jAj C 1, and so A and A [ fb g are not the same size. But if A is
inﬁnite, then these two sets are the same size!
Theorem 13.1.5. Let A be a set and b … A. Then A is inﬁnite iff A bij A [ fb g.
Proof. Since A is not the same size as A [ fb g when A is ﬁnite, we only have to
show that A [ fb g is the same size as A when A is inﬁnite.
That is, we have to ﬁnd a bijection between A [ fb g and A when A is inﬁnite.
Since A is inﬁnite, it certainly has at least one element; call it a0 . Since A is inﬁnite,
it has at least two elements, and one of them must not be equal to a0 ; call this new
element a1 . Since A is inﬁnite, it has at least three elements, one of which must
not equal a0 or a1 ; call this new element a2 . Continuing in this way, we conclude
that there is an inﬁnite sequence a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . . , of different elements of A.
Now it’s easy to deﬁne a bijection f W A [ fb g ! A:
f .b / WWD a0 ;
f .an / WWD anC1
f .a/ WWD a

for n 2 N;
for a 2 A (cid:0) fb; a0 ; a1 ; : : : g:

13.2 Countable Sets

13.2.1 Deﬁnitions
A set C is countable iff its elements can be listed in order, that is, the distinct
elements in C are precisely

c0 ; c1 ; : : : ; cn ; : : : :

This means that if we deﬁned a function f on the nonnegative integers by the rule
that f .i / WWD ci , then f would be a bijection from N to C . More formally,
Deﬁnition 13.2.1. A set C is countably inﬁnite iff N bij C . A set is countable iff
it is ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite.

Chapter 13 Inﬁnite Sets

Discrete mathematics is often deﬁned as the mathematics of countable sets and
so it is probably worth spending a little time understanding what it means to be
countable and why countable sets are so special. For example, a small modiﬁcation
of the proof of Theorem 13.1.5 shows that countably inﬁnite sets are the “smallest”
inﬁnite sets; namely, if A is any inﬁnite set, then A surj N.

13.2.2 Unions
Since adding one new element to an inﬁnite set doesn’t change its size, it’s obvi-
ous that neither will adding any ﬁnite number of elements. It’s a common mis-
take to think that this proves that you can throw in countably inﬁnitely many new
elements—just because it’s ok to do something any ﬁnite number of times doesn’t
make it ok to do it an inﬁnite number of times.
For example, suppose that you have two countably inﬁnite sets A D fa0 ; a1 ; a2 ; : : : g
and B D fb0 ; b1 ; b2 ; : : : g. You might try to show that A[B is countable by making
the following “list” for A [ B :

a0 ; a1 ; a2 ; : : : ; b0 ; b1 ; b2 ; : : :

(13.1)

But this is not a valid argument because Equation 13.1 is not a list. The key property
required for listing the elements in a countable set is that for any element in the set,
you can determine its ﬁnite index in the list. For example, ai shows up in position i
in Equation 13.1, but there is no index in the supposed “list” for any of the bi .
Hence, Equation 13.1 is not a valid list for the purposes of showing that A [ B is
countable when A is inﬁnite. Equation 13.1 is only useful when A is ﬁnite.
It turns out you really can add a countably inﬁnite number of new elements to
a countable set and still wind up with just a countably inﬁnite set, but another
argument is needed to prove this.
Theorem 13.2.2. If A and B are countable sets, then so is A [ B .
Proof. Suppose the list of distinct elements of A is a0 , a1 , . . . , and the list of B is
b0 , b1 , . . . . Then a valid way to list all the elements of A [ B is

a0 ; b0 ; a1 ; b1 ; : : : ; an ; bn ; : : : :

(13.2)

Of course this list will contain duplicates if A and B have elements in common, but
then deleting all but the ﬁrst occurrence of each element in Equation 13.2 leaves a
(cid:4)
list of all the distinct elements of A and B .

Note that the list in Equation 13.2 does not have the same defect as the purported
“list” in Equation 13.1, since every item in A [ B has a ﬁnite index in the list
created in Theorem 13.2.2.

13.2.3 Cross Products
Somewhat surprisingly, cross products of countable sets are also countable. At ﬁrst,
you might be tempted to think that “inﬁnity times inﬁnity” (whatever that means)
somehow results in a larger inﬁnity, but this is not the case.
Theorem 13.2.3. The cross product of two countable sets is countable.
Proof. Let A and B be any pair of countable sets. To show that C D A (cid:2) B is also
countable, we need to ﬁnd a listing of the elements
f .a; b / j a 2 A; b 2 B g:
There are many such listings. One is shown in Figure 13.1 for the case when A
and B are both inﬁnite sets. In this listing, .ai ; bj / is the k th element in the list
for C where

ai is the i th element in A,
bj is the j th element in B , and
k D max.i ; j /2 C i C max.i (cid:0) j ; 0/:
The task of ﬁnding a listing when one or both of A and B are ﬁnite is left to the
problems at the end of the chapter.

13.2.4 Q Is Countable
Theorem 13.2.3 also has a surprising Corollary; namely that the set of rational
numbers is countable.
Corollary 13.2.4. The set of rational numbers Q is countable.

5“mcs-ftl” — 2010/9/8 — 0:40 — page 384 — #390

Chapter 13 Inﬁnite Sets
Proof. Since Z(cid:2)Z is countable by Theorem 13.2.3, it sufﬁces to ﬁnd a surjection f
(
from Z (cid:2) Z to Q. This is easy to to since
f .a; b / D
a=b
0

if b ¤ 0
if b D 0

is one such surjection.

(cid:4)

At this point, you may be thinking that every set is countable. That is not the
case. In fact, as we will shortly see, there are many inﬁnite sets that are uncountable,
including the set of real numbers R.

13.3 Power Sets Are Strictly Bigger

It turns out that the ideas behind Russell’s Paradox, which caused so much trouble
for the early efforts to formulate Set Theory, also lead to a correct and astonishing
fact discovered by Georg Cantor in the late nineteenth century: inﬁnite sets are not
all the same size.
Theorem 13.3.1. For any set A, the power set P .A/ is strictly bigger than A.
Proof. First of all, P .A/ is as big as A: for example, the partial function f W
P .A/ ! A where f .fag/ WWD a for a 2 A is a surjection.
To show that P .A/ is strictly bigger than A, we have to show that if g is a
function from A to P .A/, then g is not a surjection. So, mimicking Russell’s
Paradox, deﬁne
Ag WWD f a 2 A j a … g.a/ g:
Ag is a well-deﬁned subset of A, which means it is a member of P .A/. But Ag
can’t be in the range of g , because if it were, we would have
Ag D g.a0 /
for some a0 2 A. So by deﬁnition of Ag ,
a 2 g.a0 /
iff a 2 Ag
iff a … g.a/
for all a 2 A. Now letting a D a0 yields the contradiction
a0 2 g.a0 /
iff a0 … g.a0 /:
So g is not a surjection, because there is an element in the power set of A, namely
(cid:4)
the set Ag , that is not in the range of g .

13.3. Power Sets Are Strictly Bigger

13.3.1 R Is Uncountable
To prove that the set of real numbers is uncountable, we will show that there is a
surjection from R to P .N/ and then apply Theorem 13.3.1 to P .N/.
Lemma 13.3.2. R surj P .N/.
Proof. Let A (cid:26) N be any subset of the natural numbers. Since N is countable, this
means that A is countable and thus that A D fa0 ; a1 ; a2 ; : : : g. For each i (cid:21) 0,
deﬁne bin.ai / to be the binary representation of ai . Let xA be the real number
using only digits 0, 1, 2 as follows:
xA WWD 0:2 bin.a0 /2 bin.a1 /2 bin.a2 /2 : : :
(
We can then deﬁne a surjection f W R ! P .N/ as follows:
A if x D xA for some A 2 N;
otherwise:
0

f .x / D

(13.3)

(cid:4)

Hence R surj P .N/.
Corollary 13.3.3. R is uncountable.
Proof. By contradiction. Assume R is countable. Then N surj R. By Lemma 13.3.2,
R surj P .N/. Hence N surj P .N/. This contradicts Theorem 13.3.1 for the case
when A D N.
(cid:4)
So the set of rational numbers and the set of natural numbers have the same size,
but the set of real numbers is strictly larger. In fact, R bij P .N /, but we won’t
prove that here.
Is there anything bigger?

13.3.2 Even Larger Inﬁnities
There are lots of different sizes of inﬁnite sets. For example, starting with the
inﬁnite set N of nonnegative integers, we can build the inﬁnite sequence of sets
N; P .N/; P .P .N//; P .P .P .N///; : : :

By Theorem 13.3.1, each of these sets is strictly bigger than all the preceding ones.
But that’s not all, the union of all the sets in the sequence is strictly bigger than each
set in the sequence. In this way, you can keep going, building still bigger inﬁnities.

Chapter 13 Inﬁnite Sets

13.3.3 The Continuum Hypothesis
Georg Cantor was the mathematician who ﬁrst developed the theory of inﬁnite sizes
(because he thought he needed it in his study of Fourier series). Cantor raised the
question whether there is a set whose size is strictly between the “smallest” inﬁnite
set, N, and P .N/. He guessed not:
Cantor’s Continuum Hypothesis. There is no set A such that P .N/ is strictly
bigger than A and A is strictly bigger than N.

The Continuum Hypothesis remains an open problem a century later. Its difﬁ-
culty arises from one of the deepest results in modern Set Theory—discovered in
part by G ¨odel in the 1930s and Paul Cohen in the 1960s—namely, the ZFC axioms
are not sufﬁcient to settle the Continuum Hypothesis:
there are two collections
of sets, each obeying the laws of ZFC, and in one collection, the Continuum Hy-
pothesis is true, and in the other, it is false. So settling the Continuum Hypothesis
requires a new understanding of what sets should be to arrive at persuasive new
axioms that extend ZFC and are strong enough to determine the truth of the Con-
tinuum Hypothesis one way or the other.

13.4

Inﬁnities in Computer Science

If the romance of different size inﬁnities and continuum hypotheses doesn’t appeal
to you, not knowing about them is not going to lower your professional abilities
as a computer scientist. These abstract issues about inﬁnite sets rarely come up in
mainstream mathematics, and they don’t come up at all in computer science, where
the focus is generally on countable, and often just ﬁnite, sets. In practice, only
logicians and set theorists have to worry about collections that are too big to be sets.
In fact, at the end of the 19th century, even the general mathematical community
doubted the relevance of what they called “Cantor’s paradise” of unfamiliar sets of
arbitrary inﬁnite size.
That said, it is worth noting that the proof of Theorem 13.3.1 gives the simplest
form of what is known as a “diagonal argument.” Diagonal arguments are used
to prove many fundamental results about the limitations of computation, such as
the undecidability of the Halting Problem for programs and the inherent, unavoid-
able inefﬁciency (exponential time or worse) of procedures for other computational
problems. So computer scientists do need to study diagonal arguments in order to
understand the logical limits of computation. Ad a well-educated computer scien-
tist will be comfortable dealing with countable sets, ﬁnite as well as inﬁnite.
