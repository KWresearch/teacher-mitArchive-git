Problem  Set  3 

Problem  1.  [16  points]  Warmup  Exercises 

For  the  following  parts,  a  correct  numerical  answer  will  only  earn  credit  if  accompanied  by 
it’s  derivation.  Show  your  work. 

(a)  [4 pts]  Use  the  Pulverizer  to  ﬁnd  integers  s  and  t  such  that  135s + 59t = gcd(135, 59). 
(b)  [4 pts] Use the previous part to ﬁnd the inverse of 59 modulo 135 in the range {1, . . . , 134}. 
(c)  [4 pts] Use Euler’s theorem to ﬁnd the  inverse of 17 modulo 31  in the range {1, . . . , 30}. 

(d)  [4 pts]  Find  the  remainder  of  3482248  divided  by  83.  (Hint:  Euler’s  theorem.) 

Problem  2.  [16  points] 

Prove  the  following  statements,  assuming  all  numbers  are  positive  integers. 

(a)  [4 pts]  If  a | b,  then  ∀c,  a | bc 
(b)  [4 pts]  If  a | b  and  a | c,  then  a  | sb + tc. 
(c)  [4 pts]  ∀c,  a | b ⇔ ca | cb 

(d)  [4 pts]  gcd(ka, kb) = k gcd(a, b) 

Problem  3.  [20  points]  In  this  problem,  we  will  investigate  numbers  which  are  squares 
modulo  a  prime  number  p. 

(a)  [5 pts]  An  integer  n  is  a  square  modulo  p  if  there  exists  another  integer  x  such  that 
n  ≡  x2  (mod  p).  Prove  that  x2  ≡  y 2  (mod  p)  if  and  only  if  x  ≡  y  (mod  p)  or  x  ≡ −y 
(mod  p).  (Hint:  x2  − y 2  = (x + y)(x − y)) 

(b)  [5 pts]  There  is  a  simple  test  we  can  perform  to  see  if  a  number  n  is  a  square  modulo 
p.  It  states  that


Theorem  1  (Euler’s  Criterion).  :

p−1

2.  If  n  is  not  a  square  modulo  p  then  n  ≡ −1  (mod  p).

Prove  the  ﬁrst  part  of  Euler’s  Criterion.  (Hint:  Use  Fermat’s  theorem.) 
(c)  [10 pts]  Assume  that  p  ≡  3  (mod  4)  and  n  ≡  x2  (mod  p).  Given  n  and  p,  ﬁnd  one 
possible value of x. (Hint:  Write  p  as  p = 4k + 3  and  use Euler’s Criterion.  You might  have 
to  multiply  two  sides  of  an  equation  by  n  at  one  point.) 

Problem  4.  [10  points]  Prove  that  for  any  prime,  p,  and  integer,  k ≥ 1, 
φ(p k ) = p k  − p k−1 , 
where  φ  is  Euler’s  function.  (Hint:  Which  numbers  between  0  and  pk  − 1  are  divisible  by  p? 
How  many  are  there?) 

Problem 5.  [18 points]  Here is a very,  very  fun game.  We start with two distinct, positive 
integers written on a blackboard.  Call  them x and y .  You and  I now  take  turns.  (I’ll  let you 
decide who goes ﬁrst.)  On each player’s  turn, he or  she must write a new positive  integer on 
the  board  that  is  a  common  divisor  of  two  numbers  that  are  already  there.  If  a  player  can 
not  play,  then  he  or  she  loses. 

For  example,  suppose  that  12  and  15  are  on  the  board  initially.  Your  ﬁrst  play  can  be  3  or 
1.  Then  I  play  3  or  1,  whichever  one  you  did  not  play.  Then  you  can  not  play,  so  you  lose. 

(a)  [6 pts]  Show  that  every  number  on  the  board  at  the  end  of  the  game  is  either  x,  y ,  or 
a  positive  divisor  of  gcd(x, y). 

(b)  [6 pts]  Show  that  every  positive  divisor  of  gcd(x, y)  is  on  the  board  at  the  end  of  the 
game. 

(c)  [6 pts]  Describe  a  strategy  that  lets  you  win  this  game  every  time. 

Problem  6.  [20  points]  In  one  of  the  previous  problems,  you  calculated  square  roots  of 
numbers modulo primes  equivalent  to 3 modulo 4.  In  this problem you will prove  that  there 
are  an  inﬁnite  number  of  such  primes! 

(a)  [6 pts]  As  a  warm-up,  prove  that  there  are  an  inﬁnite  number  of  prime  numbers. 
(Hint:  Suppose  that  the  set  F  of  al l  prime  numbers  is  ﬁnite,  that  is  F  = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pk }  and 
deﬁne  n = p1p2  . . . pk  + 1.) 
(b)  [2 pts]  Prove  that  if  p  is  an  odd  prime,  then  p ≡ 1  (mod  4)  or  p ≡ 3  (mod  4). 
(c)  [6 pts]  Prove  that  if  n ≡ 3  (mod  4),  then  n  has  a  prime  factor  p ≡ 3  (mod  4).

(d)  [8 pts] Let F  be the set of all primes p such that p ≡ 3 (mod 4).  Prove by contradiction 
that  F  has  an  inﬁnte  number  of  primes. 
(Hint:  Suppose  that  F  is  ﬁnite,  that  is  F  = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pk }  and  deﬁne  n = 4p1p2  . . . pk  − 1. 
Prove  that  there  exists  a  prime  pi  ∈ F  such  that  pi |n.)
