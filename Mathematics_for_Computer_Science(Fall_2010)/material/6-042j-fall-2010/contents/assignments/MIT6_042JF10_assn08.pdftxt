Problem  Set  8 

Problem  1.  [25  points]  Find Θ  bounds  for  the  following  divide-and-conquer  recurrences. 
Assume  T (1) = 1  in  all  cases.  Show  your  work. 

(a)  [5 pts]  T (n) = 8T (�n/2�) + n 
(b)  [5 pts]  T (n) = 2T (�n/8� + 1/n) + n 
(c)  [5 pts]  T (n) = 7T (�n/20�) + 2T (�n/8�) + n 
� 
� 
(d)  [5 pts]  T (n) = 2T (�n/4� + 1) + n1/2 
(e)  [5 pts]  T (n) = 3T (  n/9 + n1/9  ) + 1 
Problem  2.  [30  points]  It  is  easy  to  misuse  induction  when  working  with  asymptotic 
notation. 

False  Claim  If 

Then  T(n)  =  O(n).


T (1) = 1  and


T (n) = 4T (n/2) + n


False  Proof  We  show  this  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  T (n) = O(n).


Base  Case:  P (1)  is  true  because  T (1) = 1 = O(1).

Inductive  Case:  For  n ≥ 1,  assume  that  P (n − 1), . . . , P (1)  are  true.  We  then  have  that 


T (n) = 4T (n/2) + n = 4O(n/2) + n = O(n) 

And  we  are  done. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Identify  the  ﬂaw  in  the  above  proof.

(b)  [10 pts]  A  simple  attempt  to  prove  T (n) =  O(n)  via  induction  ultimately  fails.  We 
assume  for  sake  of  contradiction  that  T (n) =  O(n).  Then  there  exists  positive  integer  n0 
and  positive  real  number  c  such  that  for  all  n ≥ n0 ,  T (n) ≤ cn.  We  then  deﬁne  P (n)  as  the 
proposition  that  T (n) ≤ cn. 
We  then  proceed  with  strong  induction.

Base  Case,  n = n0 :  P (n0 )  is  true,  by  assumption.

Inductive  Step:  We  assume  P (n0 ),  P (n0  + 1),  . . . ,  P (n − 1)  true.

Fill  in  the  rest  of  this  proof  attempt,  and  explain  why  it  doesn’t  work.

Note:  As  this  problem  was  updated  so  late,  the  graders  wil l  be  instructed  to  be  exceedingly 
lenient  when  grading  this. 

(c)  [5 pts]  Using  Akra-Bazzi  theorem,  ﬁnd  the  correct  asymptotic  behavior  of  this  recur­
rence. 
(d)  [10 pts] We have now  seen  several  recurrences of  the  form T (n) = aT (�n/b�) + n.  Some 
of  them  give  a  runtime  that  is  O(n),  and  some  don’t.  Find  the  relationship  between  a  and 
b  that  yields  T (n) = O(n),  and  prove  that  this  is  suﬃcient. 

Problem  3.  [15  points]  Deﬁne  the  sequence  of  numbers  Ai  by

A0  = 2

An+1  = An/2 + 1/An  (for  n ≥ 1)

Prove  that  An  ≤ √
2 + 1/2n  for  all  n ≥ 0.

Problem  4.  [30  points]  Find  closed-form  solutions  to  the  following  linear  recurrences. 

(a)  [15 pts]  xn  = 4xn−1  − xn−2  − 6xn−3 
(x0  = 3, x1  = 4, x2  = 14) 
(b)  [15 pts]  xn  = −xn−1  + 2xn−2  + n  (x0  = 5, x1  = −4/9)
