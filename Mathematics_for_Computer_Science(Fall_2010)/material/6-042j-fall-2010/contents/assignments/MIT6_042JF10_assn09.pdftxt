Problem  Set  9 

Problem  1.  [10  points] 

(a)  [5 pts]  Show  that  of  any  n + 1  distinct  numbers  chosen  from  the  set  {1, 2, . . . , 2n},  at 
least  2 must  be  relatively  prime.  (Hint:  gcd(k , k + 1) = 1.) 
(b)  [5 pts]  Show  that  any  ﬁnite  connected  undirected  graph  with  n ≥ 2  vertices must  have 
2  vertices  with  the  same  degree. 

Problem  2.  [10  points]  Under  Siege! 

Fearing  retribution  for  the  many  long  hours  his  students  spent  completing  problem  sets, 
Prof.  Leighton  decides  to  convert  his  oﬃce  into  a  reinforced  bunker.  His  only  remaining 
task  is  to  set  the  10-digit  numeric  password  on  his  door.  Knowing  the  students  are  a  clever 
bunch, he  is not going to pick any passwords containing the  forbidden consecutive sequences 
”18062”,  ”6042”  or  ”35876”  (his MIT  extension). 

How  many  10-digit  passwords  can  he  pick  that  don’t  contain  forbidden  sequences  if  each 
number  0, 1, . . . , 9  can  only  be  chosen  once  (i.e.  without  replacement)? 

Problem  3.  [50  points]  Be  sure  to  show  your work  to  receive  full  credit.  In  this  problem 
we  assume  a  standard  card  deck  of  52  cards. 

(a)  [4 pts]  How many  5-card  hands  have  a  single  pair  and  no  3-of-a-kind  or  4-of-a-kind? 

(b)  [4 pts]  For  ﬁxed  positive  integers  n  and  k ,  how  many  nonnegative  integer  solutions 
� 
x0 , x1 , . . . , xk  are  there  to  the  following  equation? 
k
xi  = n 
i=0 

(c)  [4 pts]  For  ﬁxed  positive  integers  n  and  k ,  how  many  nonnegative  integer  solutions 
� 
x0 , x1 , . . . , xk  are  there  to  the  following  equation? 
k
xi  ≤ n 
i=0

(d)  [4 pts]  How many  simple  undirected  graphs  are  there  with  n  vertices? 

(e)  [4 pts]  How many  directed  graphs  are  there  with  n  vertices  (self  loops  allowed)? 

(f )  [4 pts]  How many  tournament  graphs  are  there  with  n  vertices? 

(g)  [4 pts]  How many  acyclic  tournament  graphs  are  there  with  n  vertices? 

(h)  [4 pts]  How  many  numbers  are  there  that  are  in  the  range  [1..700]  which  are  divisible 
by  2, 5  or  7? 

(i)  [9 pts]  In  how many ways  can  you  arrange n  books  on  k  bookshelf  (assuming  the  order 
of  books  on  a  shelf matters?) 

(j)  [9 pts]  How  about  if  there  has  to  be  at  least  1  book  at  each  bookshelf ?

Problem  4.  [15  points]  Give  a  combinatorial  proof  of  the  following  theorem: 
n 
k 
k 
k=1 

n2n−1  = 

(Hint:  Consider  the  set  of  al l  length-n  sequences  of  0’s,  1’s  and  a  single  *.) 

Problem 5.  [15 points]  At a congressional hearing, there are 2n members present.  Exactly 
n  of  them  are  Democrats  and  n  of  them  are  Republicans.  The  members  want  to  select  a 
smaller  subcommittee of  size n  from within  those present at  the hearing.  However,  since  the 
Democrats currently hold ma jority, they want there to be more Democrats then Republicans 
in the committee.  In how many ways can you select such a committee?  (Hint:  Consider  two 
cases:  n  odd  and  n  even.)
