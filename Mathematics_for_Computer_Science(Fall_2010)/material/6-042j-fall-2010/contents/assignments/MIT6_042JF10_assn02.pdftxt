Problem  Set  2 

Problem  1.  [12  points]  Deﬁne a 3-chain  to be a (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence 
of  three  integers,  which  is  either  monotonically  increasing  or  monotonically  decreasing.  We 
will  show  here  that  any  sequence  of  ﬁve  distinct  integers  will  contain  a  3-chain.  Write 
the  sequence  as  a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 , a5 .  Note  that  a  monotonically  increasing  sequences  is  one  in 
which  each  term  is  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  previous  term.  Similarly,  a  monotonically 
decreasing  sequence  is  one  in  which  each  term  is  less  than  or  equal  to  the  previous  term. 
Lastly,  a  subsequence  is  a  sequence  derived  from  the  original  sequence  by  deleting  some 
elements  without  changing  the  location  of  the  remaining  elements. 

(a)  [4 pts]  Assume  that  a1  < a2 .  Show  that  if  there  is  no  3-chain  in  our  sequence,  then  a3 
must  be  less  than  a1 .  (Hint:  consider  a4 !) 

(b)  [2 pts]  Using  the  previous  part,  show  that  if  a1  < a2  and  there  is  no  3-chain  in  our 
sequence,  then  a3  < a4  < a2 . 

(c)  [2 pts]  Assuming  that  a1  < a2  and  a3  < a4  < a2 ,  show  that  any  value  of  a5  must  result 
in  a  3-chain. 

(d)  [4 pts] Using the previous parts, prove by contradiction that any sequence of ﬁve distinct 
integers must  contain  a  3-chain.

Problem  3.  [25  points]  The  following  problem  is  fairly  tough  until  you  hear  a  certain 
one-word clue.  The solution is elegant but is slightly tricky, so don’t hesitate to ask for hints! 
During  6.042,  the  students  are  sitting  in  an  n × n  grid.  A  sudden  outbreak  of  beaver  ﬂu 
(a  rare  variant  of  bird  ﬂu  that  lasts  forever;  symptoms  include  yearning  for  problem  sets 
and  craving  for  ice  cream  study  sessions)  causes  some  students  to  get  infected.  Here  is  an 
example  where  n = 6  and  infected  students  are marked ×.

Now  the  infection  begins  to  spread  every minute  (in  discrete  time-steps).  Two  students  are 
considered adjacent  if  they  share an  edge  (i.e.,  front, back,  left or  right, but NOT diagonal); 
thus,  each  student  is adjacent  to 2,  3 or 4 others.  A  student  is  infected  in  the next  time  step 
if  either 

× 

�  the  student  was  previously  infected  (since  beaver  ﬂu  lasts  forever),  or 

�  the  student  is  adjacent  to  at  least  two  already-infected  students. 

In  the  example,  the  infection  spreads  as  shown  below.

In  this  example,  over  the  next  few  time-steps,  all  the  students  in  class  become  infected.

Theorem.  If  fewer  than  n  students  in  class  are  initial ly  infected,  the  whole  class  wil l  never 
be  completely  infected. 

Prove  this  theorem. 

Hint:  When  one  wants  to  understand  how  a  system  such  as  the  above  “evolves”  over  time, 
it  is  usual ly  a  good  strategy  to  (1)  identify  an  appropriate  property  of  the  system  at  the 
initial  stage,  and  (2)  prove,  by  induction  on  the  number  of  time-steps,  that  the  property  is 
preserved  at  every  time-step.  So  look  for  a  property  (of  the  set  of  infected  students)  that 
remains  invariant  as  time  proceeds. 

If  you  are  stuck,  ask  your  recitation  instructor  for  the  one-word  clue  and  even more  hints! 

Problem  4.  [10  points]  Find  the  ﬂaw  in  the  following  bogus  proof  that  an  =  1  for  all 
nonnegative  integers  n,  whenever  a  is  a  nonzero  real  number. 

Proof.  The  bogus  proof  is  by  induction  on  n,  with  hypothesis 
P (n) ::= →k � n. a k  = 1, 

Problem  Set  2

where  k  is  a  nonnegative  integer  valued  variable. 

Base  Case:  P (0)  is  equivalent  to  a0  = 1, which  is  true  by  deﬁnition  of  a0 .  (By  convention,

this  holds  even  if  a = 0.)

Inductive  Step:  By  induction  hypothesis,  ak  = 1  for  all  k ≥ N  such  that  k � n.  But  then

which  implies  that  P (n + 1)  holds.  It  follows  by  induction  that  P (n)  holds  for  all  n  ≥  N, 
and  in  particular,  a = 1  holds  for  all  n ≥ N.

Problem  5.  [10  points]  Let  the  sequence G0 , G1 , G2 , . . .  be  deﬁned  recursively  as  follows: 
G0  = 0, G1  = 1,  and Gn  = 5Gn−1  − 6Gn−2 ,  for  every  n ≥ N, n � 2. 
Prove  that  for  all  n ≥ N, Gn  = 3n  − 2n . 
Problem  6.  [20  points] 
In  the 15-puzzle,  there are 15  lettered  tiles and a blank  square arranged  in a 4 × 4 grid.  Any 
lettered tile adjacent to the blank square can be slid into the blank.  For example, a sequence 
of  two moves  is  illustrated  below: 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J  K  L 
M  O  N 

� 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J  K  L 
N 
M  O 

� 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J 
L 
M  O  K  N 

In  the  leftmost  conﬁguration  shown  above,  the  O  and  N  tiles  are  out  of  order.  Using  only 
legal moves,  is  it  possible  to  swap  the  N  and  the  O,  while  leaving  all  the  other  tiles  in  their 
original  position  and  the  blank  in  the  bottom  right  corner?  In  this  problem,  you  will  prove 
the  answer  is  “no”. 

Theorem.  No  sequence  of moves  transforms  the  board  below  on  the  left  into  the  board  below 
on  the  right. 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J  K  L 
M  O  N 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J  K  L 
M  N  O 

(a)  [2 pts]  We  deﬁne  the  “order”  of  the  tiles  in  a  board  to  be  the  sequence  of  tiles  on  the 
board  reading  from  the  top  row  to  the  bottom  row  and  from  left  to  right  within  a  row.  For 
example,  in  the  right board depicted  in  the  above  theorem,  the  order  of  the  tiles  is A, B , C , 
D,  E ,  etc. 

Can  a  row move  change  the  order  of  the  tiles?  Prove  your  answer.

Problem  Set  2 

(b)  [2 pts] How many pairs of tiles will have their relative order changed by a column move? 
More  formally,  for  how  many  pairs  of  letters  L1  and  L2  will  L1  appear  earlier  in  the  order 
of  the  tiles  than  L2  before  the  column  move  and  later  in  the  order  after  the  column  move? 
Prove  your  answer  correct. 

(c)  [2 pts]  We  deﬁne  an  inversion  to  be  a  pair  of  letters  L1  and  L2  for  which  L1  precedes 
L2  in  the  alphabet,  but  L1  appears  after  L2  in  the  order  of  the  tiles.  For  example,  consider 
the  following  conﬁguration: 

A  B  C  E 
D  H  G  F 
I  J  K  L 
M  N  O 

There  are  exactly  four  inversions  in  the  above  conﬁguration:  E  and D, H  and G, H  and F , 
and G  and  F . 

What  eﬀect  does  a  row  move  have  on  the  parity  of  the  number  of  inversions?  Prove  your 
answer. 

(d)  [4 pts] What eﬀect does a column move have on  the parity of  the number of  inversions? 
Prove  your  answer. 

(e)  [8 pts] The previous problem part  implies that we must make an odd  number of column 
moves  in  order  to  exchange  just  one  pair  of  tiles  (N  and  O,  say).  But  this  is  problematic, 
because  each  column  move  also  knocks  the  blank  square  up  or  down  one  row.  So  after  an 
odd  number  of  column  moves,  the  blank  can  not  possibly  be  back  in  the  last  row,  where  it 
belongs!  Now  we  can  bundle  up  all  these  observations  and  state  an  invariant,  a  property  of 
the  puzzle  that  never  changes,  no matter  how  you  slide  the  tiles  around. 

Lemma.  In  every  conﬁguration  reachable  from  the  position  shown  below,  the  parity  of  the 
number  of  inversions  is  diﬀerent  from  the  parity  of  the  row  containing  the  blank  square. 

row  1 
row  2 
row  3 
row  4 

A  B  C  D 
E  F  G  H 
I  J  K  L 
M  O  N 

Prove  this  lemma. 

(f )  [2 pts]  Prove  the  theorem  that  we  originally  set  out  to  prove. 

Problem  7.  [15  points]  There  are  two  types  of  creature  on  planet  Char,  Z-lings  and  B-
lings.  Furthermore,  every  creature belongs  to a particular generation.  The  creatures  in  each 
generation  reproduce according  to  certain  rules and  then die oﬀ.  The  subsequent generation 
consists  entirely  of  their  oﬀspring. 

Problem  Set  2 

5 

The  creatures  of  Char  pair  with  a  mate  in  order  to  reproduce.  First,  as  many  Z-B  pairs  as 
possible  are  formed.  The  remaining  creatures  form  Z-Z  pairs  or  B-B  pairs,  depending  on 
whether  there  is  an  excess  of  Z-lings  or  of  B-lings.  If  there  are  an  odd  number  of  creatures, 
then one in the ma jority species dies without reproducing.  The number and type of oﬀspring 
is  determined  by  the  types  of  the  parents 

�  If  both  parents  are  Z-lings,  then  they  have  three  Z-ling  oﬀspring. 

�  If both parents are B-lings, then they have two B-ling oﬀspring and one Z-ling oﬀspring. 

�  If  there  is  one  parent  of  each  type,  then  they  have  one  oﬀspring  of  each  type. 

There  are  200  Z-lings  and  800  B-lings  in  the  ﬁrst  generation.  Use  induction  to  prove  that 
the  number  of  Z-lings  will  always  be  at most  twice  the  number  of  B-lings. 

Hint:  You  may  want  to  use  a  stronger  hypothesis  for  the  induction.
