Problem  Set  12 

Problem  1.  [15  points] 
In  this  problem,  we  will  (hopefully)  be  making  tons  of  money!  Use  your  knowledge  of 
probability  and  statistics  to  keep  from  going  broke! 
Suppose the stock market contains N  types of stocks, which can be modelled by independent 
random  variables.  Suppose  furthermore  that  the  behavior  of  these  stocks  is  modelled  by  a 
double-or-nothing  coin  ﬂip.  That  is,  stock  Si  has  half  probability  of  doubling  its  value  and 
half  probability  of  going  to  0.  The  stocks  all  cost  a  dollar,  and  you  have N  dollars.  Say  you 
only keep these stocks for one time-step (that is, at the end of this timestep, all stocks would 
have  doubled  in  value  or  gone  to  0). 

(a)  [3 pts]  What  is  your  expected  amount  of  money  if  you  spend  all  your  money  on  one 
stock?  Your  variance? 

(b)  [3 pts]  Suppose  instead  you  diversiﬁed  your  purchases  and  bought  N  shares  of  all  dif­
ferent  stocks.  What  is  your  expected  amount  of money  then?  Your  variance? 

(c)  [3 pts]  The  money  that  you  have  invested  came  from  your  ﬁnancially  conservative 
mother.  As  a  result,  your  goals  are  much  aligned  with  hers.  Given  this,  which  investment 
strategy  should  you  take? 

(d)  [3 pts]  Now  instead  say  that  you  make  money  on  rolls  of  dice.  Speciﬁcally,  you  play  a 
game where  you  roll  a  standard  six-sided  dice,  and  get  paid  an  amount  (in  dollars)  equal  to 
the  number  that  comes  up.  What  is  your  expected  payoﬀ ?  What  is  the  variance? 

(e)  [3 pts] We  change  the  rules  of  the  game  so  that  your  payoﬀ  is  the  cube  of  the  number 
that  comes  up.  In  that  case,  what  is  your  expected  payoﬀ ?  What  is  its  variance?

Problem  Set  12 
1.  Each  proposition  is  the  OR  of  three  terms  of  the  form  xi  or  the  form  xi .¬
2.  The  variables  in  the  three  terms  in  each  proposition  are  all  diﬀerent. 

Suppose  that  we  assign  true/false  values  to  the  variables  x1 , . . . , x9  independently  and  with 
equal  probability. 

(a)  [5 pts] What  is  the  expected  number  of  true  propositions? 

(b)  [5 pts]  Use  your  answer  to  prove  that  there  exists  an  assignment  to  the  variables  that 
makes  al l  of  the  propositions  true. 

Problem  3.  [20  points]  MIT  students  sometimes  delay  laundry  for  a  few  days  (to  the 
chagrin  of  their  roommates).  Assume  all  random  variables  described  below  are  mutually 
independent. 

(a)  [5 pts]  A  busy  student  must  complete  3  problem  sets  before  doing  laundry.  Each 
problem  set  requires  1  day  with  probability  2/3  and  2  days  with  probability  1/3.  Let  B  be 
the  number  of  days  a  busy  student  delays  laundry.  What  is  E [B ]? 
Example:  If  the ﬁrst problem  set  requires  1 day  and  the  second  and  third problem  sets  each 
require  2  days,  then  the  student  delays  for  B  = 5  days. 

(b)  [5 pts]  A  relaxed  student  rolls  a  fair,  6-sided  die  in  the  morning.  If  he  rolls  a  1,  then 
he does his  laundry  immediately  (with  zero days of delay).  Otherwise, he delays  for one day 
and  repeats  the  experiment  the  following  morning.  Let  R  be  the  number  of  days  a  relaxed 
student  delays  laundry.  What  is  E [R]? 
Example:  If  the  student  rolls  a  2  the  ﬁrst  morning,  a  5  the  second  morning,  and  a  1  the 
third morning,  then  he  delays  for  R = 2  days. 

(c)  [5 pts] Before doing laundry, an unlucky  student must recover from illness for a number 
of  days  equal  to  the  product  of  the  numbers  rolled  on  two  fair,  6-sided  dice.  Let  U  be  the 
expected  number  of  days  an  unlucky  student  delays  laundry.  What  is  E [U ]? 
Example:  If  the  rolls  are  5  and  3,  then  the  student  delays  for  U  = 15  days. 

(d)  [5 pts]  A  student  is  busy  with  probability  1/2,  relaxed  with  probability  1/3,  and 
unlucky  with  probability  1/6.  Let  D  be  the  number  of  days  the  student  delays  laundry. 
What  is  E [D]? 

Problem  4.  [10  points]  We  have  two  coins:  one  is  a  fair  coin  and  the  other  is  a  coin  that 
produces  heads  with  probability  3/4.  One  of  the  two  coins  is  picked,  and  this  coin  is  tossed 
n times.  Explain how to calculate the number of tosses to make us 95% conﬁdent which coin 
was  chosen.  You  do  not  have  to  calculate  the  minimum  value  of  n,  though  we’d  be  pleased 
if  you  did.

Problem 5.  [13 points]  Each 6.042 ﬁnal exam (out of 100 points) will be graded according 
to  a  rigorous  procedure: 

7  the  exam  is  graded  by  a  TA;  with  probability  2
�  With  probability  4
7  it  is  graded  by 
a  lecturer;  and  with  probability  1
7 ,  it  is  accidentally  dropped  behind  the  radiator  and 
arbitrarily  given  a  score  of  84. 

�  TAs  score  an  exam  by  scoring  each  problem  individually  and  then  taking  the  sum. 

–	 There  are  ten  true/false  questions  worth  2  points  each.  For  each,  full  credit  is 
given  with  probability  3/4,  and  no  credit  is  given  with  probability  1/4. 
–	 There  are  four  questions  worth  15  points  each.  For  each,  the  score  is  determined 
by  rolling  two  fair  dice,  summing  the  results,  and  adding  3. 
–	 The  single  20  point  question  is  awarded  either  12  or  18  points  with  equal  proba­
bility. 

�  Lecturers  score  an  exam  by  rolling  a  fair  die  twice,  multiplying  the  results,  and  then 
adding  a  “general  impression”  score. 

4 
–	 With  probability  10 ,  the  general  impression  score  is  40.

3

–	 With  probability  10 ,  the  general  impression  score  is  50. 
–	 With  probability  3  ,  the  general  impression  score  is  60.

Assume  all  random  choices  during  the  grading  process  are  independent. 

(a)  [5 pts] What  is  the  expected  score  on  an  exam  graded  by  a  TA? 

(b)  [5 pts] What  is  the  expected  score  on  an  exam  graded  by  a  lecturer? 

(c)  [3 pts] What  is  the  expected  score  on  a  6.042  ﬁnal  exam? 

Problem  6.  [32  points] 

Suppose  n  balls  are  thrown  randomly  into  n  boxes,  so  each  ball  lands  in  each  box  with 
uniform probability.  Also, suppose the outcome of each throw  is  independent of all the other 
throws. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Let Xi  be  an  indicator  random  variable whose  value  is  1  if  box  i  is  empty  and  0 
otherwise.  Write  a  simple  closed  form  expression  for  the  probability  distribution  of Xi .  Are 
X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn  independent  random  variables? 

(b)  [5 pts]  Find  a  constant,  c,  such  that  the  expected  number  of  empty  boxes  is  asymptot­
ically  equal  (∼)  to  cn.
