Problem  Set  10 

Problem  1.  [15  points]  Suppose  Pr {}  :  S →  [0, 1]  is  a  probability  function  on  a  sample 
� 
space, S , and let B  be an event such that Pr {B } > 0.  Deﬁne a function PrB  {·} on outcomes 
w ∈ S  by  the  rule: 
Pr {w} / Pr {B } 
if  w ∈ B , 
if  w /∈ B . 
0 

PrB  {w} =

(a)  [7 pts]  Prove  that  PrB  {·}  is  also  a  probability  function  on  S  according  to  Deﬁnition 
14.4.2. 

(b)  [8 pts]  Prove  that 

for  all  A ⊆ S . 

Problem  2.  [20  points] 

PrB  {A} = 

Pr {A ∩ B }
Pr {B } 

(a)  [10 pts]  Here  are  some  handy  rules  for  reasoning  about  probabilities  that  all  follow 
directly  from  the  Disjoint  Sum  Rule.  Use  Venn  Diagrams,  or  another  method,  to  prove 
them. 

Pr {A − B } = Pr {A} − Pr {A ∩ B }

Pr  A  = 1 − Pr {A}

(Diﬀerence  Rule) 

(Complement  Rule) 

Pr {A ∪ B } = Pr {A} + Pr {B } − Pr {A ∩ B } 

(Inclusion-Exclusion) 

Pr {A ∪ B } ≤ Pr {A} + Pr {B } .	

(2-event  Union  Bound) 

If  A ⊆ B ,  then  Pr {A} ≤ Pr {B } .

(b)  [10 pts]  Prove  the  following  probabilistic  identity,  referred  to  as  the  Union  Bound. 
You  may  assume  the  theorem  that  the  probability  of  a  union  of  disjoint  sets  is  the  sum  of 
their  probabilities.

In  the  book  we  proved  that  if  we  roll  each  die  once,  then  die  A  beats  B  more  often,  die  B 
beats  die  C  more  often,  and  die  C  beats  die  A more  often.  Thus,  contrary  to  our  intuition, 
the  “beats”  relation >  is  not  transitive.  That  is,  we  have  A > B > C > A. 

We then looked at what happens if we roll each die twice, and add the result.  In this problem 
we will show that the “beats” relation reverses  in this game,  that  is, A < B < C < A, which 
is  very  counterintuitive! 

(a)  [5 pts]  Show  that  rolling  die  C  twice  is more  likely  to  win  than  rolling  die  B  twice. 

(b)  [5 pts]  Show  that  rolling  die  A  twice  is more  likely  to  win  that  rolling  die  C  twice. 

(c)  [5 pts]  Show  that  rolling  die  B  twice  is more  likely  to  win  than  rolling  die  A  twice. 

Problem  4.  [14  points]  Let’s  play  a  game!  We  repeatedly  ﬂip  a  fair  coin.  You  have  the 
sequence  HH T ,  and  I  have  the  sequence  H T T .  If  your  sequence  comes  up  ﬁrst,  then  you 
win.  If my  sequence  comes  up  ﬁrst,  then  I  win.  For  example,  if  the  sequence  of  tosses  is: 

T T H T H T HH T

then  you  win.  What  is  the  probability  that  you  win?  It  may  come  as  a  surprise  that  the 
answer  is  very  diﬀerent  from  1/2. 

This  problem  is  tricky,  because  the  game  could  go  on  for  an  arbitrarily  long  time.  Draw 
enough  of  the  tree  diagram  to  see  a  pattern,  and  then  sum  up  the  probabilities  of  the 
(inﬁnitely many)  outcomes  in  which  you  win. 

It  turns  out  that  for  any  sequence  of  three  ﬂips,  there  is  another  sequence  that  is  likely  to 
come up before it.  So there is no sequence of three ﬂips which turns up earliest!  . . . and given 
any sequence of three ﬂips, knowing how to pick another sequence that comes up sooner more 
than  half  the  time  gives  you  a  nice  chance  to  fool  people  gambling  at  a  bar  :-) 

Problem  5.  [15  points]  We’re  interested  in  the probability  that a  randomly  chosen poker 
hand  (5  cards  from  a  standard  52-card  deck)  contains  cards  from  at most  two  suits. 

(a)  [7 pts]  What  is  an  appropriate  sample  space  to  use  for  this  problem?  What  are  the 
outcomes  in  the  event,  E ,  we  are  interested  in?  What  are  the  probabilities  of  the  individual 
outcomes  in  this  sample  space? 
(b)  [8 pts] What  is  Pr (E )? 

Problem  6.  [21  points] 

I  have  a  deck  of  52  regular  playing  cards,  26  red,  26  black,  randomly  shuﬄed.  They  all  lie 
face  down  in  the  deck  so  that  you  can’t  see  them.  I  will  draw  a  card  oﬀ  the  top  of  the  deck 
and  turn  it  face  up  so  that  you  can  see  it  and  then  put  it  aside.  I  will  continue  to  turn 
up  cards  like  this  but  at  some  point  while  there  are  still  cards  left  in  the  deck,  you  have  to 
declare  that  you want  the  next  card  in  the  deck  to  be  turned  up.  If  that  next  card  turns  up 
black  you  win  and  otherwise  you  lose.  Either  way,  the  game  is  then  over. 

(a)  [4 pts]  Show  that  if  you  take  the  ﬁrst  card  before  you  have  seen  any  cards,  you  then 
have  probability  1/2  of  winning  the  game. 

(b)  [4 pts]  Suppose  you  don’t  take  the  ﬁrst  card  and  it  turns  up  red.  Show  that  you  have 
then  have  a  probability  of  winning  the  game  that  is  greater  than  1/2. 

(c)  [4 pts] If there are r red cards left in the deck and b black cards, show that the probability 
of  winning  in  you  take  the  next  card  is  b/(r + b). 

(d)  [9 pts]  Either, 

1.  come  up  with  a  strategy  for  this  game  that  gives  you  a  probability  of  winning  strictly 
greater  than  1/2  and  prove  that  the  strategy  works,  or, 
2.  come  up  with  a  proof  that  no  such  strategy  can  exist.
