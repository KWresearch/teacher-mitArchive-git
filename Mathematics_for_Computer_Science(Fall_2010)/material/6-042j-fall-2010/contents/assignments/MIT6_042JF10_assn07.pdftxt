Problem  4.  [15  points]  There  is  a  bug  on  the  edge  of  a  1-meter  rug.  The  bug  wants  to 
cross  to  the  other  side  of  the  rug.  It  crawls  at  1  cm  per  second.  However,  at  the  end  of 
each  second,  a malicious  ﬁrst-grader  named Mildred Anderson  stretches  the  rug by  1 meter. 
Assume  that  her  action  is  instantaneous  and  the  rug  stretches  uniformly.  Thus,  here’s what 
happens  in  the  ﬁrst  few  seconds: 

�  The  bug  walks  1  cm  in  the  ﬁrst  second,  so  99  cm  remain  ahead. 

�  Mildred  stretches  the  rug by  1 meter, which doubles  its  length.  So now  there  are  2  cm 
behind  the  bug  and  198  cm  ahead. 

�  The  bug  walks  another  1  cm  in  the  next  second,  leaving  3  cm  behind  and  197  cm 
ahead. 

�  Then Mildred  strikes,  stretching  the  rug  from  2  meters  to  3  meters.  So  there  are  now 
·
· 
3  (3/2) = 4.5  cm  behind  the  bug  and  197  (3/2) = 295.5  cm  ahead. 

�  The  bug  walks  another  1  cm  in  the  third  second,  and  so  on. 

Your  job  is  to  determine  this  poor  bug’s  fate. 

(a)  [5 pts]  During  second  i,  what  fraction  of  the  rug  does  the  bug  cross?

(b)  [5 pts] Over  the ﬁrst n  seconds, what  fraction  of  the  rug does  the bug  cross  altogether? 
Express  your  answer  in  terms  of  the  Harmonic  number Hn . 

(c)  [5 pts]  Approximately  how many  seconds  does  the  bug  need  to  cross  the  entire  rug? 

Problem  5.  [20  points]  For  each  of  the  following  six pairs  of  functions  f  and  g  (parts  (a) 
through  (f )),  state  which  of  these  order-of-growth  relations  hold  (more  than  one  may  hold, 
or  none may  hold): 

f  = o(g) 

f  = O(g) 

f  = ω(g) 

f  = Ω(g) 

f  = Θ(g) 

f  ∼ g

Problem  6.  [15  points]  This  problem  continues  the  study  of  the  asymptotics  of  factori­
als. 

(a)  [5 pts] 
Either  prove  or  disprove  each  of  the  following  statements. 

�  n! = O((n + 1)!) 
�  n! = Ω((n + 1)!) 
�  n! = Θ((n + 1)!) 
�  n! = ω((n + 1)!) 
�  n! = o((n + 1)!)

(b)  [5 pts]  Show  that  n! = ω

(c)  [5 pts]  Show  that  n! = Ω(2n )
