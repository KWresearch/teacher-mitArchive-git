Problem  Set  5 

Readings:  Section  5.4  to  5.7  and  6.1-6.2. 

Problem  1.  [20  points]  Recall  that  a  tree  is  a  connected  acyclic  graph.  In  particular,  a 
single  vertex  is  a  tree.  We  deﬁne  a  Splitting  Binary  Tree,  or  SBTree  for  short,  as  either  the 
lone  vertex,  or  a  tree  with  the  following  properties: 

1.  exactly  one  node  of  degree  2  (called  the  root). 

2.  every  other  node  is  of  degree  3  or  1  (called  internal  nodes  and  leaves,  respectively). 

For  the  case  of  one  single  vertex  (see  above),  that  vertex  is  considered  to  be  a  leaf.  It  is 
easier to understand the deﬁnition visually,  so an example  is shown  in Figure 1.  An example 
of  a  tree  which  is  not  an  SBTree  is  shown  in  Figure  2. 

(a)  [10 pts]  Show  if  an  SBTree  has  more  than  one  vertex,  then  the  induced  subgraph  ob­
tained  by  removing  the  unique  root  consists  of  two  disconnected  SBTrees.  You may  assume 
that by removing the root you obtain two separate connected componenents,  so all you need 
to  prove  is  that  those  two  components  are  SBTrees. 

(b)  [10 pts]  Prove  that  two  SBTrees  with  the  same  number  of  leaves  must  also  have  the 
same total number of nodes.  Hint:  As  a  conjecture,  guess  an  expression  for  the  total  number 
of  nodes  in  terms  of  the  number  of  leaves  N (l).  Then  use  induction  to  prove  that  it  holds 
for  al l  trees  with  the  same  l 

Problem  2.  [20  points] 

In ”Die Hard:  The Afterlife”,  the ghosts of Bruce and Sam have been sent by the evil Simon 
on  another mission  to  save midtown Manhattan.  They  have  been  told  that  there  is  a  bomb 
on  a  street  corner  that  lies  in Midtown Manhattan,  which  Simon  deﬁnes  as  extending  from 
41st  Street  to  59th  Street  and  from  3rd  Avenue  to  9th  Avenue.  Additionally,  the  code  that 
they need to defuse the bomb is on another street corner.  Simon,  in a good mood, also tosses 
them  two  carrots: 

�  He  will  have  a  helicopter  initially  lower  them  to  the  street  corner  where  the  bomb  is.

Problem  Set  5 

Figure  1:  Splitting  Binary  Tree:  Node  A  is  the  root,  B  and  E  are  internal  nodes,  and  C, D, 
F,  and  G  are  leaves.  Notice  how  all  internal  nodes  have  degree  3. 

Figure  2:  This  is  an  example  of  a  tree  which  is  NOT  a  Splitting  Binary  Tree.  Notice  how 
both  A  and  C  have  degree  2,  when  a  BSTree  can  only  have  one  such  node.

�	 He  promises  that  the  code  is  placed  only  on  a  corner  of  a  numbered  street  and  a 
numbered  avenue,  so  they  don’t  have  to  search  Broadway. 

The map of midtown Manhattan is an example of an N ×M  (undirected) grid.  In particular, 
midtown Manhattan  is  a  19 × 7  grid. 
· 
Bruce  and  Sam  need  to  check  all  19  7 =  133  street  corners  for  the  code.  Once  they  are  at 
a  corner,  they  don’t  need  any  additional  time  to  verify  if  the  code  is  there.  Once  they  ﬁnd 
the  code  and  return  to  the  bomb,  they  can  disarm  it  in  2  minutes  (even,  or  especially,  as 
the  timer  ticks  down  to  0).  Also,  they  can  run  one  block  (in  any  of  the  four  directions)  in 
exactly 1 minute.  They are given 135 minutes total  in which to ﬁnd the code and disarm the 
bomb,  which means  that  they  need  to  return  to  the  bomb,  code  in  hand,  in  133 minutes. 

Sam  realizes  that  the  map  of  NYC  is  actually  a  graph,  and  that  they  need  to  use  a  cool 
new  6.042  concept:  A Hamiltonian  cycle  is  a  path  that  visits  each  vertex  in  a  graph  exactly 
once  and  ends  at  its  starting  point  (so  it  is  a  cycle).  A  graph  is  Hamiltonian  if  it  has  a 
Hamiltonian  cycle. 

Hamiltonian  graphs  are  really  useful  because  you  can  visit  each  node  and  return  to  the 
starting  point  by  taking  only  n  steps,  where  n  is  the  number  of  nodes  –  if  a  graph  is  not 
Hamiltonian,  you  would  need  at  least  n + 1  steps  to  visit  each  of  the  n  nodes  and  return  to 
the  starting  point. 

In general, we don’t know how to eﬃciently determine whether a general graph is Hamiltonian 
or  not.  However,  Sam  is  very  excited  because  he  thinks  that  he  can  show  that  Midtown 
Manhattan  is  Hamiltonian.  If  it  is,  Bruce  and  Sam  can  save  the  day!  Will  they make  it? 

(a)  [10 pts] Show  that  they  cannot do  it  –  that  is, more  generally,  show  that  if both N  and 
M  are  odd,  then  the  N  × M  grid  is  not  Hamiltonian.  Hint:  First  show  that  any  N  × M 
2-dimensional  undirected  grid  is  bipartite. 

(b)  [10 pts]  Suppose  Simon  deﬁned  Midtown  in  the  more  standard  way  as  extending  from 
40th  Street  to  59th  Street  and  from  3rd  Avenue  to  9th  Avenue  (that  is  suppose  Midtown 
Manhattan  was  a  20 × 7  grid),  and  gave  them  another  7 minutes, 
1.  Show  that  if  either  N  is  even  and  M >  1  or  M  is  even  and  N >  1,  then  the  N  × M 
grid  is  Hamiltonian. 

2.  Explain  why  your  proof  breaks  down  when N  and M  are  odd. 

3.  Would  they  survive?  Does  it  depend  on  where  the  bomb  is  placed? 

Problem  3.  [20  points] 
An  n-node  graph  is  said  to  be  tangled  if  there  is  an  edge  leaving  every  set  of  � n 
3 �  or  fewer 
vertices.  As a special case, the graph consisting of a single node is considered tangled.  (Recall 
that  the  notation  �x�  refers  to  the  smallest  integer  greater  than  or  equal  to  x.)

Problem  Set  5 

(a)  [7 pts]  Find  the  error  in  the  proof  of  the  following  claim. 

Claim.  Every  non-empty,  tangled  graph  is  connected. 

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  strong  induction  on  the  number  of  vertices  in  the  graph.  Let  P (n) 
be  the proposition  that  if an n-node graph  is  tangled,  then  it  is  connected.  In  the base  case, 
P (1)  is  true  because  the  graph  consisting  of  a  single  node  is  deﬁned  to  be  tangled  and  is 
trivially  connected. 
In  the  inductive  step,  for  n ≥ 1  assume  P (1), . . . , P (n)  to  prove  P (n + 1).  That  is, we want 
to  prove  that  if  an  (n + 1)-node  graph  is  tangled,  then  it  is  connected.  Let  G  be  a  tangled, 
(n + 1)-node  graph.  Arbitrarily  partition  G  into  two  pieces  so  that  the  ﬁrst  piece  contains 
exactly  � n 
3 �  vertices,  and  the  second  piece  contains  all  remaining  vertices.  Note  that  since 
n ≥ 1,  the  graph  G  has  a  least  two  vertices,  and  so  both  pieces  contain  at  least  one  vertex. 
By  induction,  each  of  these  two  pieces  is  connected.  Since  the  graph  G  is  tangled,  there  is 
an  edge  leaving  the  ﬁrst  piece,  joining  it  to  the  second  piece.  Therefore,  the  entire  graph 
is  connected.  This  shows  that  P (1), . . . , P (n)  imply  P (n + 1),  and  the  claim  is  proved  by 
strong  induction. 

(b)  [5 pts]  Draw  a  tangled  graph  that  is  not  connected. 
(c)  [8 pts] An n-node graph is said to be mangled if there is an edge leaving every set of � n 
2 �
or  fewer vertices.  Again, as a special case,  the graph consisting of a single node  is considered 
mangled.  Prove  the  following  claim.  Hint:  Prove  by  contradiction. 

Claim.  Every  non-empty, mangled  graph  is  connected. 

Problem  4.  [15  points] 

(a)  [5 pts]  Suppose  that  G  is  a  simple,  connected  graph  on  n  nodes.  Show  that  G  has 
exactly  n − 1  edges  iﬀ  G  is  a  tree. 

(b)  [10 pts]  Prove  by  induction  that  any  connected  graph  has  a  spanning  tree. 

Problem  5.  [15  points]  The  adjacency matrix  of  a  graph  is  given  below  (Section  5.1.6  in 
⎡ 
⎤
the  book  deﬁnes  adjacency matrices)

(a)  [4 pts]  Draw  the  graph  deﬁned  by  this  adjacency  matrix.  Label  the  vertices  of  your 
graph  1, 2, . . . , 6  so  that  vertex  i  corresponds  to  row  and  column  i  of  the matrix. 

(b)  [4 pts]  In  a  graph,  we  deﬁne  the  distance  between  to  vertices  to  be  the  length  of  the 
shortest  path  between  them.  We  deﬁne  the  diameter  of  a  graph  to  be  the  largest  distance 
between  any  two  nodes.  What  is  the  diameter  of  this  graph?  Explain  why. 

(c)  [3 pts] Find  a  cycle  in  this  graph  of maximum  length  and  explain why  it has maximum 
length. 

(d)  [4 pts]  Give  a  coloring  of  the  vertices  that  uses  the  minimum  number  of  colors.  Prove 
that  this  a minimum  coloring. 

Problem  6.  [10  points]  Let  G  be  a  graph.  In  this  problem  we  show  every  vertex  of  odd 
degree  is  connected  to  at  least  one  other  vertex  of  odd  degree  in G. 

(a)  [6 pts]  Let  v  be  an  odd  degree  node.  Consider  the  longest  walk  starting  at  v  that  does 
not repeat any edges (though it may omit some).  Let w be the ﬁnal node of that walk.  Show 
that  w = v . 

(b)  [4 pts]  Show  that  w  must  also  have  odd  degree.
