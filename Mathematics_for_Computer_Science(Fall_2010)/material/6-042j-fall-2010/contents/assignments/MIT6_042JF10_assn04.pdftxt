Problem  Set  4 

Problem  1.  [15  points]  Let  G  = (V , E )  be  a  graph.  A  matching  in  G  is  a  set  M  ⊂  E 
such  that  no  two  edges  in M  are  incident  on  a  common  vertex. 
Let M1 , M2  be  two matchings  of G.  Consider  the  new  graph G�  = (V , M1 ∪ M2 )  (i.e.  on  the 
same vertex  set, whose  edges  consist  of  all  the  edges  that  appear  in  either M1  or M2 ).  Show 
that G�  is  bipartite. 
Helpful deﬁnition: A connected  component is a subgraph of a graph consisting of some vertex 
and  every  node  and  edge  that  is  connected  to  that  vertex. 

Problem  2.  [20  points]  Let  G  = (V , E )  be  a  graph.  Recall  that  the  degree  of  a  vertex 
v  ∈  V ,  denoted  dv ,  is  the  number  of  vertices  w  such  that  there  is  an  edge  between  v  and 
w.

(b)  [5 pts] At  a  6.042  ice  cream  study  session  (where  the  ice  cream  is  plentiful  and  it  helps 
you study too) 111 students showed up.  During the session, some students shook hands with 
each  other  (everybody being happy  and  content with  the  ice-cream  and  all).  Turns  out  that 
the University of Chicago did another spectacular study here, and counted that each student 
shook  hands  with  exactly  17  other  students.  Can  you  debunk  this  too? 

(c)  [5 pts]  And  on  a  more  dull  note,  how  many  edges  does  Kn ,  the  complete  graph  on  n 
vertices,  have? 

Problem  3.  [15  points]  Two graphs are isomorphic if they are the same up to a relabeling 
of  their  vertices  (see  Deﬁnition  5.1.3  in  the  book).  A  property  of  a  graph  is  said  to  be 
preserved  under  isomorphism  if whenever G has  that property,  every graph  isomorphic  to G 
also  has  that  property.  For  example,  the  property  of  having  ﬁve  vertices  is  preserved  under 
isomorphism:  if G  has  ﬁve  vertices  then  every  graph  isomorphic  to  G  also  has  ﬁve  vertices. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Some  properties  of  a  simple  graph,  G,  are  described  below.  Which  of  these 
properties  is  preserved  under  isomorphism?

Problem  Set  4 

1.  G  has  an  even  number  of  vertices. 
2.  None  of  the  vertices  of G  is  an  even  integer. 
3.  G  has  a  vertex  of  degree  3. 
4.  G  has  exactly  one  vertex  of  degree  3. 

(b)  [10 pts] Determine which among the four graphs pictured in the Figures are isomorphic. 
If two of these graphs are isomorphic, describe an isomorphism between them.  If they are not, 
give  a  property  that  is  preserved  under  isomorphism  such  that  one  graph  has  the  property, 
but  the  other does not.  For  at  least  one  of  the properties  you  choose,  prove  that  it  is  indeed 
preserved  under  isomorphism  (you  only  need  prove  one  of  them).

Problem  4.  [15  points]  Recall  that  a  coloring  of  a  simple  graph  is  an  assignment  of  a 
color  to  each  vertex  such  that  no  two  adjacent  vertices  have  the  same  color.  A  k-coloring 
is  a  coloring  that  uses  at most  k  colors. 

False  Claim.  Let  G  be  a  (simple)  graph  with  maximum  degree  at  most  k .  If  G  also  has  a 
vertex  of  degree  less  than  k ,  then  G  is  k-colorable. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Give  a  counterexample  to  the  False  Claim  when  k = 2. 

(b)  [10 pts]  Consider  the  following  proof  of  the  False  Claim:

Proof.  Proof  by  induction  on  the  number  n  of  vertices: 
Induction  hypothesis:  P (n)  is  deﬁned  to  be:  Let  G  be  a  graph  with  n  vertices  and

maximum degree a most k .  If G also has a vertex of degree less than k , then G is k -colorable. 

Base  case:  (n=1) G  has  only  one  vertex  and  so  is  1-colorable.  So  P (1)  holds.

Inductive  step:

We  may  assume  P (n).  To  prove  P (n + 1),  let  Gn+1  be  a  graph  with  n + 1  vertices  and

maximum  degree  at  most  k .  Also,  suppose  Gn+1  has  a  vertex,  v ,  of  degree  less  than  k .  We

need  only  prove  that  Gn+1  is  k -colorable.

To  do  this,  ﬁrst  remove  the  vertex  v  to  produce  a  graph,  Gn ,  with  n  vertices.  Removing  v

reduces  the  degree  of  all  vertices  adjacent  to  v  by 1.  So in  Gn ,  each  of  these  vertices  has

degree  less  than  k .  Also  the  maximum  degree  of  Gn  remains  at  most  k .  So  Gn  satisﬁes  the

conditions  of  the  induction  hypothesis  P (n).  We  conclude  that Gn  is  k -colorable.

Now  a  k -coloring  of Gn  gives  a  coloring  of  all  the  vertices  of Gn+1 ,  except  for  v .  Since  v  has

degree  less  than  k ,  there will  be  fewer  than  k  colors  assigned  to  the  nodes  adjacent  to  v .  So

among  the  k  possible  colors,  there  will  be  a  color  not  used  to  color  these  adjacent  nodes,

and  this  color  can  be  assigned  to  v  to  form  a  k -coloring  of Gn+1 .


Identify  the  exact  sentence  where  the  proof  goes  wrong.


Problem  5.  [15  points]  Prove  or  disprove  the  following  claim:  for  some  n  ≥  3 (n  boys

and  n  girls,  for  a  total  of  2n  people),  there  exists  a  set  of  boys’  and  girls’  preferences  such

that  every  dating  arrangement  is  stable.


Problem  6.  [20  points] 
Let  (s1 , s2 , ..., sn )  be  an  arbitrarily  distributed  sequence  of  the  number  1, 2, ..., n − 1, n.  For

instance,  for  n = 5,  one  arbitrary  sequence  could  be  (5, 3, 4, 2, 1).

Deﬁne  the  graph G=(V,E)  as  follows:

1.  V  = {v1 , v2 , ..., vn} 
2.  e = (vi , vj ) ∈ E  if  either: 
(a)  j  = i + 1,  for  1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 
(b)  i = sk ,  and  j  = sk+1  for  1 <= k <= n − 1 

(a)  [10 pts]  Prove  that  this  graph  is  4-colorable  for  any  (s1 , s2 , ..., sn ). 
Hint:  First show that a line graph is 2-colorable.  Note that a line graph is deﬁned as follows: 
The  n-node  graph  containing  n − 1  edges  in  sequence  is  known  as  the  line  graph  Ln . 

(b)  [10 pts]  Suppose  (s1 , s2 , ..., sn )  =  (1, a1 , 3, a2 , 5, a3 , ...)  where  a1 , a2....  is  an  arbitrary 
distributed  sequence  of  the  even  numbers  in  1, ..., n − 1.  Prove  that  the  resulting  graph  is 
2-colorable.
