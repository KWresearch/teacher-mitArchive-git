Problem  Set  1 

Problem  1.  [24  points] 
Translate  the  following  sentences  from  English  to  predicate  logic.  The  domain  that  you  are 
working  over  is X ,  the  set  of  people.  You may  use  the  functions  S (x), meaning  that  “x  has 
been  a  student  of  6.042,” A(x), meaning  that  “x has  gotten  an  ‘A’  in  6.042,” T (x), meaning 
that  “x  is  a  TA  of  6.042,”  and  E (x, y), meaning  that  “x  and  y  are  the  same  person.” 

(a)  [6 pts]  There  are  people  who  have  taken  6.042  and  have  gotten  A’s  in  6.042 

(b)  [6 pts]  All  people  who  are  6.042  TA’s  and  have  taken  6.042  got  A’s  in  6.042 

(c)  [6 pts]  There  are  no  people  who  are  6.042  TA’s  who  did  not  get  A’s  in  6.042. 

(d)  [6 pts] There are at least three people who are TA’s in 6.042 and have not taken 6.042 

Problem  2.  [24  points] 
Use  a  truth  table  to  prove  or  disprove  the  following  statements: 

(a)	 [12 pts] 


(b) 	 [12 pts] 


¬(P  ∨ (Q ∧ R)) = (¬P ) ∧ (¬Q ∨ ¬R)


¬(P  ∧ (Q ∨ R)) = ¬P  ∨ (¬Q ∨ ¬R)


Problem  3.  [24  points] 
The  binary  logical  connectives  ∧  (and ),  ∨  (or ), and 
⇒
(implies )  appear  often  in  not  only 
computer  programs,  but  also  everyday  speech.  In  computer  chip  designs,  however,  it  is 
considerably  easier  to  construct  these  out  of  another  operation,  nand,  which  is  simpler  to 
represent  in  a  circuit.  Here  is  the  truth  table  for  nand: 

Q

P
true 
true 
true  false 
false  true 
false  false 

P  nand Q

false 
true 
true 
true

Problem  Set  1 

(a)  [12 pts]  For  each  of  the  following  expressions,  ﬁnd  an  equivalent  expression  using  only 
¬ 
nand and 
(not ), as well as grouping parentheses to specify the order in which the operations 
apply.  You may  use  A,  B ,  and  the  operators  any  number  of  times. 
(i)  A ∧ B 
(ii)  A ∨ B 
B⇒ 
(iii)  A

(b)  [4 pts]  It  is  actually  possible  to  express  each  of  the  above  using  only  nand,  without 
needing  to  use  ¬.  Find  an  equivalent  expression  for  ( A)  using  only  nand  and  grouping 
¬
parentheses. 

(c)  [8 pts]  The  constants  true  and  false  themselves  may  be  expressed  using  only  nand. 
Construct an expression using an arbitrary statement A and nand that evaluates to true re­
gardless of whether A is true or false.  Construct a second expression that always evaluates 
to  false.  Do  not  use  the  constants  true  and  false  themselves  in  your  statements. 

Problem  4.  [10  points]  You  have  12  coins  and  a  balance  scale,  one  of  which  is  fake.  All 
the  real  coins  weigh  the  same,  but  the  fake  coin  weighs  less  than  the  rest.  All  the  coins 
visually  appear  the  same,  and  the  diﬀerence  in weight  is  imperceptible  to  your  senses.  In  at 
most 3 weighings, give a strategy that detects the fake coin.  (Note:  the scale  in this problem 
is a  scale with  two dishes, which  tips  toward  the  side  that  is heavier.  For  clariﬁcation, do an 
image  search  for  “balance  scale”). 

Problem  5.  [6  points]  Prove  the  following  statement by proving  its  contrapositive:  if  r  is 
irrational,  then  r1/5  is  irrational.  (Be  sure  to  state  the  contrapositive  explicitly.) 

Problem  6.  [12  points]  Suppose  that  w2  + x2  + y 2  =  z 2 ,  where  w,  x,  y ,  and  z  always 
denote  positive  integers.  (Hint:  It  may  be  helpful  to  represent  even  integers  as  2i  and  odd 
integers  as  2j + 1,  where  i  and  j  are  integers) 

Prove  the  proposition:  z  is  even  if  and  only  if  w,  x,  and  y  are  even.  Do  this  by  considering 
all  the  cases  of  w, x, y  being  odd  or  even.
