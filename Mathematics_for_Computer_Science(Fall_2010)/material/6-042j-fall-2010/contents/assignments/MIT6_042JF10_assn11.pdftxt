Problem  Set  11 

Problem 1.  [20 points]  You are organizing a neighborhood census and instruct your census 
takers  to knock on doors and note  the  sex of any child  that answers  the knock.  Assume  that 
there are two children in a household and that girls and boys are equally likely to be children 
and  to  open  the  door. 

A sample space for this experiment has outcomes that are triples whose ﬁrst element is either 
B or G for the sex of the elder child, likewise for the second element and the sex of the younger 
child,  and  whose  third  coordinate  is  E  or  Y  indicating  whether  the  e lder  child  or  y ounger 
child  opened  the  door.  For  example,  (B, G, Y)  is  the  outcome  that  the  elder  child  is  a  boy, 
the  younger  child  is  a  girl,  and  the  girl  opened  the  door. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Let T  be  the  event  that  the  household  has  two  girls,  and O  be  the  event  that  a 
girl  opened  the  door.  List  the  outcomes  in  T  and  O. 
(b)  [5 pts] What  is the probability Pr (T  |  O),  that both children are girls, given that a girl 
opened  the  door? 
(c)  [10 pts] Where  is  the mistake  in  the  following  argument  for  computing  Pr (T  |  O)? 

If a girl opens the door, then we know that there is at least one girl in the household. 
The  probability  that  there  is  at  least  one  girl  is 
1 − Pr (both  children  are  boys) = 1 − (1/2 × 1/2) = 3/4. 

So, 

= 

Pr (T	 |  there  is  at  least  one  girl  in  the  household) 
Pr (T  ∩ there  is  at  least  one  girl  in  the  household) 
Pr {there  is  at  least  one  girl  in  the  household}
Pr (T ) 
Pr {there  is  at  least  one  girl  in  the  household} 
=  (1/4)/(3/4) = 1/3. 

= 

Therefore,  given  that  a  girl  opened  the  door,  the  probability  that  there  are  two 
girls  in  the  household  is  1/3.

Problem  2.  [20  points]  Professor  Plum,  Mr.  Green,  and  Miss  Scarlet  are  all  plotting  to 
shoot Colonel Mustard.  If  one  of  these  three has both  an  opportunity  and  the  revolver,  then 
that  person  shoots  Colonel  Mustard.  Otherwise,  Colonel  Mustard  escapes.  Exactly  one  of 
the  three  has  an  opportunity  with  the  following  probabilities: 
Pr {Plum  has  opportunity} = 1/6 
Pr {Green  has  opportunity} = 2/6 
Pr {Scarlet  has  opportunity} = 3/6 

Exactly  one  has  the  revolver  with  the  following  probabilities,  regardless  of  who  has  an 
opportuntity: 

Pr {Plum  has  revolver} = 4/8 
Pr {Green  has  revolver} = 3/8 
Pr {Scarlet  has  revolver} = 1/8 

(a)  [5 pts] Draw  a  tree  diagram  for  this  problem.  Indicate  edge  and  outcome  probabilities. 

(b)  [5 pts] What  is  the  probability  that  Colonel Mustard  is  shot? 

(c)  [5 pts]  What  is  the  probability  that  Colonel  Mustard  is  shot,  given  that  Miss  Scarlet 
does  not  have  the  revolver? 

(d)  [5 pts] What  is  the  probability  that Mr.  Green  had  an  opportunity,  given  that Colonel 
Mustard  was  shot? 

Problem  3.  [15  points]  In  lecture we discussed  the Birthday Paradox.  Namely, we  found 
that  in  a  group  of m  people  with N  possible  birthdays,  if m � N ,  then: 
Pr {all m  birthdays  are  diﬀerent} ∼ e− m(m−1) 
2N
� 
To ﬁnd the number of people, m, necessary for a half chance of a match, we set the probability 
√
to  1/2  to  get: 
(2 ln 2)N  ≈ 1.18
m ∼ 
N 
For N  = 365  days  we  found m  to  be  23. 

We  could  also  run  a  diﬀerent  experiment.  As  we  put  on  the  board  the  birthdays  of  the 
poeple  surveyed, we  could ask  the  class  if anyone has  the  same birthday.  In  this  case, before 
we reached a match amongst the surveyed people, we would already have found other people 
in  the  rest  of  the  class  who  have  the  same  birthday  as  someone  already  surveyed.  Let’s 
investigate  why  this  is. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Consider  a  group  of m  people  with  N  possible  birthdays  amongst  a  larger  class 
of  k  people,  such  that  m  ≤  k .  Deﬁne  Pr {A}  to  be  the  probability  that  m  people  all  have

diﬀerent birthdays and  none of  the other k − m people have  the  same birthday as one of  the 
m. 
Show  that,  if  m � N ,  then  Pr {A} ∼  e 
m(m−2k) 
.  (Notice  that  the  probability  of  no  match  is 
2N
e−  when  k  is m,  and  it  gets  smaller  as  k  gets  larger.)

(b)  [10 pts]  Find  the  approximate  number  of  people  in  the  group,  m,  necessary  for  a  half

chance  of  a  match  (your  answer  will  be  in  the  form  of  a  quadratic).  Then  simplify  your

Problem  4.  [10  points]  We’re  covering  probability  in  6.042  lecture  one  day,  and  you 
volunteer  for  one  of  Professor  Leighton’s  demonstrations.  He  shows  you  a  coin  and  says 
he’ll  bet  you  �1  that  the  coin  will  come  up  heads.  Now,  you’ve  been  to  lecture  before  and 
therefore  suspect  the  coin  is  biased,  such  that  the  probability  of  a  ﬂip  coming  up  heads, 
Pr {H },  is  p  for  1/2 < p ≤ 1. 
You  call  him  out  on  this,  and  Professor  Leighton  oﬀers  you  a  deal.  He’ll  allow  you  to  come 
up with  an  algorithm using  the biased  coin  to  simulate  a  fair  coin,  such  that  the probability 
you win  and he  loses, Pr {W },  is  equal  to  the probability  that he wins  and you  lose, Pr {L}. 
You  come  up  with  the  following  algorithm: 

1.  Flip  the  coin  twice. 

2.  Based  on  the  results: 
⇒ 
you  win  [W ],  and  the  game  terminates. 
�  T H 
⇒ 
Professor  Leighton  wins  [L],  and  the  game  terminates. 
�  H T 
�  (HH ∨ T T ) 
⇒ 
discard  the  result  and  ﬂip  again. 

3.  If at the end of N  rounds  nobody  has  won,  declare  a  tie. 

As  an  example,  for  N  =  3,  an  outcome  of  H T  would  mean  the  game  ends  early  and  you 
lose,  HH T H  would  mean  the  game  ends  early  and  you  win,  and  HH T T T T  would  mean 
you  play  the  full N  rounds  and  result  in  a  tie. 

(a)  [5 pts]  Assume  the  ﬂips  are mutually  independent.  Show  that  Pr {W } = Pr {L}. 

(b)  [5 pts]  Show  that,  if  p < 1,  the  probability  of  a  tie  goes  to  0  as N  goes  to  inﬁnity.

Problem  5.  [20  points] 

Problem  Set  11 

(a)  [5 pts]  Suppose A  and B  are  disjoint  events.  Prove  that A  and B  are  not  independent, 
unless  Pr (A)  or  Pr (B )  is  zero.

(b)  [5 pts]  If  A  and  B  are  independent,  prove  that  A  and  B  are  also  independent. 
Hint:  Pr  A ∩ B  = Pr (A) − Pr (A ∩ B ). 
¯
(c)  [5 pts]  Give  an  example  of  events  A,B ,  C  such  that  A  is  independent  of  B ,  A  is  inde­
pendent  of  C ,  but  A  is  not  independent  of  B ∪ C . 

(d)  [5 pts]  Prove  that  if  C  is  independent  of  A,  and  C  is  independent  of  B ,  and  C  is 
independent  of  A ∩ B ,  then  C  is  independent  of  A ∪ B . 
Hint:  Calculate  Pr (A ∪ B  |  C ). 
Problem  6.  [15  points]  Three  very  rare  DNA  markers  were  found  in  the  DNA  collected 
at  a  crime  scene.  Only  one  in  every  1, 000  people  has  marker  A,  one  in  every  3, 000  people 
has  marker  B ,  and  one  in  every  5, 000  people  has  marker  C .  Joe  the  plumber  was  arrested 
and  accused  of  committing  the  crime,  because he had  all  those markers present  in his DNA. 
The  prosecutor  argues  that  the  chances  of  any  person  having  all  three  DNA markers  is

,  which  is more  than  1  over  the  number  of  people  in  the  world.  This,  plus  the  fact  that  Joe 
the  plumber  lives  only  100  miles  away  from  the  crime  scene  must  clearly  mean  that  he  is 
guilty.  Having  taken  6.042,  you  should  be  suspicious  of  this  reasoning. 

(a)  [2 pts]  What  assumption  has  the  prosecutor  made  (even  though  he  hasn’t  realized  it) 
about  the  presence  of  the  3 markers  in  human  DNA? 

(b)  [4 pts]  What  would  be  the  probability  of  a  person  having  all  three  markers  assuming 
that  the  markers  appear  pairwise  independently?  Under  this  assumption,  can  it  be  stated 
with  such  certainty  that  Joe  the  plumber  commited  the  crime? 

(c)  [4 pts] What  can  you  say  about  the  probability  of  a  person  having  all  three  markers  if 
there  is  no  independence  between  the markers? 

(d)  [5 pts]  In  fact,  it  turns  out  that  neither  of  the  above  assumptions  is  correct.  A  re­
searcher  from  MIT  (who  was  actually  in  your  recitation  section  for  6.042  back  in  the  day) 
has  discovered  that  while markers  B  and  C  appear  independently,  the  probability  of  having 
marker  B  if  you  have  marker  A  is  1
2  and  the  probability  of  having  marker  C  if  you  have 
marker A  is  1
3 .  The defence attorney now argues  that  the probability of a  randomly  selected 
person  having  all  three markers  is 
P r [A ∩ B ∩ C ] = P r [A] · P r [B |A] · P r [C |A] =

Called  as  a witness,  the MIT  researcher  points  out  that  this  is  not  necessarily  true  and  that 
in  fact  he  himself  does  not  know  what  the  probability  is.  What  is  wrong  with  the  defence 
attorney’s  reasoning?  (We  assume  that  the  MIT  researcher  published  correct  information 
and  that,  since  he  took  6.042,  he  knows  what  he  is  talking  about.)
