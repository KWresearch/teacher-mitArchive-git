1  Logic 

How  can  one  discuss mathematics with  logical  precision, when  the English  language  is  itself 
riddled  with  ambiguities?  For  example,  imagine  that  you  ask  a  friend  what  kind  of  dessert 
was  oﬀered  at  the  party  you  couldn’t make  it  to  last  week,  and  your  friend  says, 

You  could  have  cake  or  ice  cream. 

Does  this  mean  that  you  could  have  both  cake  and  ice  cream?  Or  does  it  mean  you  had  to 
choose  either  one  or  the  other? 

To  cope  with  such  ambiguities,  mathematicians  have  deﬁned  precise  meanings  for  some 
key  words  and  phrases.  Furthermore,  they  have  devised  symbols  to  represent  those  words. 
For  example,  if  P  is  a  proposition,  then  “not  P ”  is  a  new  proposition  that  is  true  whenever 
¬
P  is  false  and  vice  versa.  The  symbolic  representation  for  “not  P ”  is  P  or  P .
Two  propositions,  P  and  Q,  can  be  joined  by  “and”,  “or”,  “implies”,  or  “if  and  only  if ” 
to  form  a  new  proposition.  The  truth  of  this  new  proposition  is  determined  by  the  truth  of 
P  and Q  according  to  the  table  below.  Symbolic  equivalents  are  given  in  parentheses.

There  are  a  couple  notable  features  hidden  in  this  table: 

•	 The  phrase  “P  or Q”  is  true  if  P  is  true, Q  is  true,  or  both.  Thus,  you  can  have  your 
cake  and  ice  cream  too. 
•	 The  phrase  “P  implies  Q”  (equivalently,  “if  P ,  then  Q”)  is  true  when  P  is  false  or 
Q  is  true.  Thus,  “if  the  moon  is  made  of  green  cheese,  then  there  will  be  no  ﬁnal  in 
6.042”  is  a  true  statement.

There  are  two  more  important  phrases  in  mathematical  writing:  “for  all”  (symbolized 
by  ∀)  and  “there  exists”  (symbolized  by  ∃).  These  are  called  quantiﬁers .  A  quantiﬁer  is 
always  followed  by  a  variable  (and  perhaps  an  indication  of  the  range  of  that  variable)  and 
then  a  predicate,  which  typically  involves  that  variable.  Here  are  two  examples: 
∀  x ∈ R+  e < (1 + x)1+x 
x
∃  n ∈ N  2n  > (100n)100 

The  ﬁrst  statement  says  that  e is  less  than  (1 + x)1+x  for  every  positive  real  number  x. 
x
The  second  statement  says  that  there  exists  a  natural  number  n  such  that  2n  > (100n)100 . 
The  special  symbols  such  as  ∀,  ∃,  ¬,  and  ∨  are  useful  to  logicians  trying  to  express 
mathematical  ideas  without  resorting  to  English  at  all.  And  other  mathematicians  often 
use  these  symbols  as  a  shorthand.  We  recommend  using  them  sparingly,  however,  because 
decrypting  statements  written  in  this  symbolic  language  can  be  challenging! 

2  Proving  an  Implication 

Let’s  try  to  prove  the  following  theorem. 
� 
� 
� 
� 
Theorem  1.  Let  P (a, b)  be  any  predicate  deﬁned  for  al l  a ∈ A  and  b ∈ B.  Then: 
∃  a ∈ A  ∀  b ∈ B  P (a, b)  ⇒ ∀  b ∈ B  ∃  a ∈ A  P (a, b) 

Yuck!  Now  you  know  you’re  in  a  math  class!  Let’s  impose  a  speciﬁc  interpretation  in 
order  to  give  concrete meaning  to  this  claim.  Deﬁne: 
A = {6.042  students} 
B = {6.042  lectures}
P (a, b) = “student  a  falls  asleep  during  lecture  b” 

Interpreting  the  left  side  in  these  terms  gives: 
∃  a ∈ A  ∀  b ∈ B  P (a, b) = “there  exists  a  student  that  falls  asleep  in  every  lecture” 

So  this  side  asserts  that  some  particular  student  —  let’s  call  him  Snoozer  —  always  falls 
asleep.  Now  on  the  right  side,  we  have: 
∀  b ∈ B  ∃  a ∈ A  P (a, b) = “in  every  lecture,  some  student  falls  asleep” 

This is a slightly diﬀerent assertion, because there might be a diﬀerent sleeper in each lecture. 
Intuitively,  the  left  side  should  imply  the  right;  if  Snoozer  sleeps  in  every  lecture,  then  in 
every  lecture  some  student  is  surely  asleep.

The  implication  in Theorem  1  is  actually  true  for  every  predicate P  and  choice  of  sets A
and  B .  A  universally-true  statement,  like  this  one,  is  called  a  validity .  (Every  tautology 
(cf.  Lecture  Notes  9/4,  p.6)  is  a  validity,  but  validities  may  also  involve  quantiﬁers.)  The 
⇒	
⇒
converse  of  an  implication  P
Q  is  the  reverse  implication  Q
P .  In  this  case,  the 
�	
� 
� 
� 
converse  is: 
∀  b ∈ B  ∃  a ∈ A  P (a, b)  ⇒ ∃  a ∈ A  ∀  b ∈ B  P (a, b) 
Under  our  interpretation,  this  says,  “If  in  every  lecture  some  student  falls  asleep,  then  there 
is  some  student  who  falls  asleep  in  every  lecture.”  This  is  not  necessarily  true,  although  it 
might  be  true  for  certain  choices  of  predicate  and  sets.  But  since  the  truth  of  this  converse 
proposition  depends  on  the  particular  choice  of  predicate  and  sets,  it  is  not  a  validity. 

Anyway,  let’s  prove  the  theorem. 

Proof.  We  consider  two  cases. 
Case  1: 	 Suppose  that  the  left  side  of  the  implication  is  false.  Then  the  claim  as  a 
whole  is  true  by  default. 

Case  2: 

Suppose  that  the  left  side  of  the  implication  is  true.  Then  there 
exists  some  element  a0  ∈ A  such  that  P (a0 , b)  is  true  for  all  b  ∈ B . 
Thus,  for  all  b  ∈ B  there  exists  an  a  ∈ A  (namely,  a0 )  such  that 
P (a, b)  is  true.  Therefore,  the  right  side  of  the  implication  is  also 
true. 

In  both  cases,  the  left  side  implies  the  right  side,  and  so  the  theorem  holds. 
⇒
Broadly speaking, we  just proved that P
Q  for some nasty-looking propositions P  and
Q.  When  P  was  false  (case  1),  the  implication  held  trivially.  When  P  was  true  (case  2), 
we  had  to  do  some  work  to  show  that  Q  was  also  true.  Every  implication  proof  has  this 
same  structure:  all  the  substance  is  in  case  2.  Thus,  ordinarily  no  one  even  bothers  to write 
down  case  1  or  even  to  identify  two  cases!  Instead,  when  proving  an  implication,  you  may 
dispense  with  everything  except  for  the  body  of  case  2;  the  boxed  text  alone  is  considered 
a  valid  proof  of  the  theorem.  In  summary,  in  order  to  prove  that  P  implies  Q,  you  should 
assume  that  P  is  true  and  prove  that  Q  is  also  true  subject  to  that  assumption.

3  Team  Problem:  A  Mystery 

4 

A  certain  cabal  within  the  6.042  course  staﬀ  is  plotting  to make  the  ﬁnal  exam  ridiculously 
hard.  (“Problem  1.  Prove  that  the  axioms  of  mathematics  are  complete  and  consistent. 
Express  your  answer  in  Mayan  hieroglyphics.”)  The  only  way  to  stop  their  evil  plan  is  to 
determine  exactly  who  is  in  the  cabal.  The  course  staﬀ  consists  of  nine  people: 
{Oscar, Stav, Darren, Patrice, David, Nick, Martyna, Marten, Tom} 

The cabal  is a subset of these nine.  A membership roster has been found and appears below, 
but  it  is  deviously  encrypted  in  logic  notation.  The  predicate  incabal  indicates who  is  in  the 
cabal;  that is,  incabal(x) is true if and only if x is a member.  Translate each statement below 
into  English  and  deduce  who  is  in  the  cabal. 

(i)  ∃x  ∃y  ∃z  (x =�

y ∧ x =�

z ∧ y =�

z ∧ incabal(x) ∧ incabal(y) ∧ incabal(z )) 

Solution.  A  direct  English  paraphrase  would  be  “There  exist  people  we’ll  call  x, y , 
and  z ,  who  are  all  diﬀerent,  such  that  x, y  and  z  are  each  in  the  cabal.”  A  better 
version  would  use  the  fact  that  there’s  no  need  in  this  case  to  give  names  to  the 
people.  Namely,  a  better  paraphrase  is,  “There  are  3  diﬀerent  people  in  the  cabal.” 
� 
Perhaps  a  simpler  way  to  say  this  is,  “The  cabal  is  of  size  at  least  3.” 
¬
(incabal(Stav) ∧ incabal(David)) 

(ii) 

Solution.  Stav  and  David  are  not  both  in  the  cabal.  Equivalently:  at  least  one  of 
� 
Stav  and  David  is  not  in  the  cabal. 
(iii)  ((incabalMartyna) ∨ incabal(Patrice)) → ∀x  incabal(x) 

Solution.  If  either Martyna  or  Patrice  is  in  the  cabal,  then  everyone  is. 
→ 

incabal(David) 

(iv)  incabal(Stav) 

Solution.  If  Stav  is  in  the  cabal,  then  David  is  also. 
→ 

incabal(Martyna) 

(v)  incabal(Darren) 

Solution.  If  Darren  is  in  the  cabal,  then Martyna  is  also. 
→ ¬
(vi)  (incabal(Oscar) ∨ incabal(Nick)) 
incabal(Tom) 

� 

� 

� 

Solution.  If  either  of Oscar  or Nick  is  in  the  cabal,  then Tom  is  not.  Equivalently,  if 
� 
Tom  is  in  the  cabal,  then  neither Oscar  nor  Nick  is. 
→ ¬
(vii)  (incabal(Oscar) ∨ incabal(David)) 
incabal(Marten)

Recitation  1

Solution.  If either of Oscar or David is in the cabal, then Marten is not.  Equivalently, 
� 
if Marten  is  in  the  cabal,  then  neither Oscar  nor  David  is. 

So  much  for  the  translations.  We  now  argue  that  the  only  cabal  satisfying  all  seven 
propositions  above  is  one  whose members  are  exactly Oscar,  David,  and  Nick. 

We  ﬁrst  observe  that  by  (ii),  there  must  be  someone  —  either  Stav  or  David  —  who  is 
not  in  the  cabal.  But  if  either Martyna  or  Patrice  were  in  the  cabal,  then  by  (iii),  everyone 
would  be.  So  we  conclude  by  contradiction  that 

Martyna  and  Patrice  are  not  in  the  cabal. 

(1) 

Now  consider  that  (v)  implies  its  contrapositive:  if  Martyna  is  not  in  the  cabal,  then 
neither  is  Darren.  Therefore,  since Martyna  is  not  in  the  cabal, 

Darren  is  not  in  the  cabal. 

(2) 

Next observe that  if Stav were  in the cabal,  then by  (iv), David would be too, contradict­
ing  (ii).  So  by  again  contradiction,  we  conclude  that 

Stav  is  not  in  the  cabal. 

(3) 

Now  suppose  Tom  is  in  the  cabal.  Then  by  (vi),  Oscar  and  Nick  are  not.  We  already 
know Martyna, Patrice, Darren,  and Stav  are not  in  the  cabal,  leaving  only  three who  could 
be —  Tom,  Marten,  and  David.  But  by  (i)  the  cabal  must  have  at  least  three  members,  so 
it  follows  that  the  cabal must  consist  of  exactly  these  three.  This  proves: 

Lemma  2.  If  Tom  is  in  the  cabal,  then  Marten  and  David  are  in  the  cabal. 

But  by  (vii),  if  David  is  the  cabal,  then Marten  is  not.  That  is, 

Lemma  3.  David  and  Marten  cannot  both  be  in  the  cabal. 

Now  from  Lemma  3  we  conclude  that  the  conclusion  of  Lemma  2  is  false.  So  by  contra-
positive,  the  hypothesis  of  Lemma  2 must  also  be  false,  namely, 

Tom  is  not  in  the  cabal. 

(4) 

Finally,  suppose  Marten  is  in  the  cabal.  Then  by  (vii),  Oscar  and  David  are  not,  and 
we  already  know  Martyna,  Patrice,  Darren,  Stav,  and  Tom  are  not.  So  the  cabal  must 
consist  of  at  most  two  people  (Marten  and  Nick).  This  contradicts  (i),  and  we  conclude  by 
contradiction  that 

Marten  is  not  in  the  cabal. 

(5) 

So  the  only  remaining  people  who  could  be  in  the  cabal  are  Oscar,  David,  and  Nick.  Since 
the  cabal must  have  at  least  three members,  we  conclude  that 

Recitation  1

Lemma  4.  The  only  possible  cabal  consists  of  Oscar,  David,  and  Nick. 

But  we’re  not  done  yet:  we  haven’t  shown  that  a  cabal  consisting  of  Oscar,  David,  and 
Nick  actually  does  satisfy  all  seven  conditions.  So  let  A  =  {Oscar, David, Nick},  and  let’s 
quickly  check  that A  satisﬁes  (i)–(vii): 

•	 |A| = 3,  so  A  satisﬁes  (i). 
•	 Stav  is  not  in  A,  so  A  satisﬁes  (ii)  and  (iv). 
•	 Neither  Martyna  nor  Patrice  is  in  A,  so  the  hypothesis  of  (iii)  is  false,  which  means 
that  A  satisﬁes  (iii). 
•	 Darren  is  not  in  A,  so  A  satisﬁes  (v). 
•	 Finally,  Tom  and  Marten  are  not  in  A,  so  the  conclusions  of  both  (vi)  and  (vii)  are 
true,  and  so  A  satisﬁes  (vi)  and  (vii). 

So  now  we  have  proved 
Proposition.  {Oscar, David, Nick}  is  the  unique  cabal  satisfying  conditions  (i)–(vii).
