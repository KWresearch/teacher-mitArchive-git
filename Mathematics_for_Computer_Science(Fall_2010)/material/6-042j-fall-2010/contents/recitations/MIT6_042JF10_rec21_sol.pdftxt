1  Conditional  Expectation  and  Total  Expectation 

There  are  conditional  expectations,  just  as  there  are  conditional  probabilities.  If  R  is  a 
� 
random  variable  and  E  is  an  event,  then  the  conditional  expectation  Ex (R  | E )  is  deﬁned 
by: 
Ex (R  | E ) = 
R(w) · Pr {w  | E }
w∈S 
For  example,  let  R  be  the  number  that  comes  up  on  a  roll  of  a  fair  die,  and  let  E  be  the 
event  that  the  number  is  even.  Let’s  compute  Ex (R  | E ),  the  expected  value  of  a  die  roll, 
� 
given  that  the  result  is  even. 
Ex (R  | E ) = 
R(w) · Pr {w  | E } 
w∈{1,...,6}

It  helps  to  note  that  the  conditional  expectation, Ex (R  | E )  is  simply  the  expectation  of 
R  with  respect  to  the  probability measure  PrE  ()  deﬁned  in  PSet  10.  So  it’s  linear: 
Ex (R1  + R2  | E ) = Ex (R1  | E ) + Ex (R2  | E ) .

Conditional  expectation  is  really  useful  for  breaking  down  the  calculation  of  an  expecta­
tion into cases.  The breakdown is justiﬁed by an analogue to the Total Probability Theorem: 

Theorem  1  (Total  Expectation).  Let  E1 , . . . , En  be  events  that  partition  the  sample  space 
and  al l  have  nonzero  probabilities.  If  R  is  a  random  variable,  then: 
Ex (R) = Ex (R  | E1 ) · Pr {E1} + · · · + Ex (R  | En ) · Pr {En} 

For  example,  let  R  be  the  number  that  comes  up  on  a  fair  die  and  E  be  the  event  that 
� 
�
result is even, as before.  Then E  is the event that the result is odd.  So the Total Expectation

theorem  says: 
Ex (R) = Ex (R E )  Pr {E } + Ex  R E  Pr {E }
= 4 
= 7/2 
= 1/2 
= 1/2

The  only  quantity  here  that we  don’t  already  know  is Ex  R  | E  , which  is  the  expected  die 
� 
� 
roll,  given  that  the  result  is  odd.  Solving  this  equation  for  this  unknown,  we  conclude  that 
Ex  R  | E  = 3. 
To  prove  the  Total  Expectation  Theorem,  we  begin  with  a  Lemma. 

Lemma.  Let  R  be  a  random  variable,  E  be  an  event  with  positive  probability,  and  IE  be  the 
indicator  variable  for  E .  Then

Ex (R E ) =

Proof.  Note  that  for  any  outcome,  s,  in  the  sample  space, 
0 
Pr {s} 

Pr {{s} ∩ E } = 

Ex (R · IE ) 
Pr {E } 

if  IE (s) = 0,
if  IE (s) = 1, 

and  so 

Now, 

Ex (R  | E ) =

Pr {{s} ∩ E } = IE (s) · Pr {s} .

Problem  1.  [  points]  Here’s  yet  another  fun  6.042  game!  You  pick  a  number  between  1 
and  6.  Then  you  roll  three  fair,  independent  dice. 

�  If  your  number  never  comes  up,  then  you  lose  a  dollar. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  once,  then  you  win  a  dollar. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  twice,  then  you  win  two  dollars. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  three  times,  you  win  four  dollars! 

What  is  your  expected  payoﬀ ?  Is  playing  this  game  likely  to  be  proﬁtable  for  you  or  not? 

Solution.  Let  the  random  variable  R  be  the  amount  of  money  won  or  lost  by  the  player 
in  a  round.  We  can  compute  the  expected  value  of  R  as  follows:

Problem  2.  [  points]  The  number  of  squares  that  a  piece  advances  in  one  turn  of  the 
game Monopoly  is  determined  as  follows: 

�  Roll  two  dice,  take  the  sum  of  the  numbers  that  come  up,  and  advance  that  number 
of  squares. 

�  If  you  roll  doubles  (that  is,  the  same  number  comes  up  on  both  dice),  then  you  roll  a 
second  time,  take  the  sum,  and  advance  that  number  of  additional  squares. 

�  If you roll doubles a second time, then you roll a third time, take the sum, and advance 
that  number  of  additional  squares. 

�  However,  as a  special case,  if you  roll doubles a  third  time,  then you go  to  jail.  Regard 
this  as  advancing  zero  squares  overall  for  the  turn. 

(a)  [ pts] What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  the  same  number  comes  up  on 
both? 

Solution.  There  are  six  equally-probable  sums:  2,  4,  6,  8,  10,  and  12.  Therefore,  the 
expected  sum  is:

(b)  [ pts]  What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  diﬀerent  numbers  come  up? 
(Use  your  previous  answer  and  the  Total  Expectation  Theorem.) 
Solution.  Let  the  random  variables  D1  and  D2  be  the  numbers  that  come  up  on  the  two 
�  � 
� 
� 
dice.  Let  E  be  the  event  that  they  are  equal.  The  Total  Expectation  Theorem  says: 
Ex (D1  + D2 ) = Ex (D1  + D2  | E ) · Pr {E } + Ex  D2  + D2  | E  · Pr  E 

Two  dice  are  equal  with  probability  Pr {E }  = 1/6,  the  expected  sum  of  two  independent 
dice  is  7,  and  we  just  showed  that  Ex (D1  + D2  | E ) =  7.  Substituting  in  these  quantities

and  solving  the  equation,  we  ﬁnd:

(c)  [ pts]  To  simplify  the  analysis,  suppose  that  we  always  roll  the  dice  three  times,  but 
may  ignore  the  second  or  third  rolls  if  we  didn’t  previously  get  doubles.  Let  the  random 
variable Xi  be  the  sum  of  the  dice  on  the  i-th  roll,  and  let Ei  be  the  event  that  the  i-th  roll 
is  doubles.  Write  the  expected  number  of  squares  a  piece  advances  in  these  terms.

Solution.  From  the  total  expectation  formula,  we  get:

+ Ex (0 | E1  ∩ E2  ∩ E3 ) · Pr {E1  ∩ E2  ∩ E3} 

Then  using  linearity  of  (conditional)  expectation,  we  reﬁne  this  to

(d)  [ pts] What  is  the  expected  number  of  squares  that  a  piece  advances  in Monopoly? 

Solution.  We  plug  the  values  from  parts  (a)  and  (b)  into  equation  (4):
