Problems  for  Recitation  17 

The  Four-Step  Method 

This  is  a  good  approach  to  questions  of  the  form,  “What  is  the  probability  that  ——?” 
Intuition  wil l  mislead  you,  but  this  formal  approach  gives  the  right  answer  every  time. 

1.  Find  the  sample  space.  (Use  a  tree  diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne  events  of  interest.  (Mark  leaves  corresponding  to  these  events.) 

3.  Determine  outcome  probabilities: 

(a)  Assign  edge  probabilities. 
(b)  Compute  outcome  probabilities.  (Multiply  along  root-to-leaf  paths.) 

4.  Compute  event  probabilities.  (Sum  the  probabilities  of  all  outcomes  in  the  event.)

1  The  Four-Door  Deal 

2 

Suppose  that  Let’s  Make  a  Deal  is  played  according  to  diﬀerent  rules.  Now  there  are  four 
doors,  with  a  prize  hidden  behind  one  of  them.  The  contestant  is  allowed  to  pick  a  door. 
The  host  must  then  reveal  a  diﬀerent  door  that  has  no  prize  behind  it.  The  contestant  is 
allowed  to  stay  with  his  or  her  original  door  or  to  pick  one  of  the  other  two  that  are  still 
closed.  If  the  contestant  chooses  the  door  concealing  the  prize  in  this  second  stage,  then  he 
or  she  wins. 

1.  Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey, stays with his original 
door.  What  is  the  probability  that  he  wins  the  prize? 
The  tree  diagram  is  awkwardly  large.  This  often  happens;  in  fact,  sometimes  you’ll 
encounter  inﬁnite  tree  diagrams!  Try  to  draw  enough  of  the  diagram  so  that  you 
understand  the  structure  of  the  remainder.

2.  Contestant  Zelda,  an  alien  abduction  researcher  from  Helena,  Montana,  switches  to 
one  of  the  remaining  two  doors  with  equal  probability.  What  is  the  probability  that 
she  wins  the  prize?

2  Earliest  Door 

4 

Let’s  consider  another  variation  of  the  four-doors  problem.  Say  the  doors  are  labeled  A,  B, 
C,  and D.  Suppose  that Carol  always  opens  the  earliest  door  possible  (the  door whose  label 
is earliest  in the alphabet) with the restriction that she can neither reveal the prize nor open 
the  door  that  the  player  picked. 

This  gives  contestant  Mergatroid—  an  engineering  student  from  Cambridge,  MA—  just 
a  little  more  information  about  the  location  of  the  prize.  Suppose  that  Mergatroid  always 
switches  to  the  earliest  door,  excluding  his  initial  pick  and  the  one  Carol  opened.  What  is 
the  probability  that  he  wins  the  prize?

3  The  3  doors  version  revisited 

3.1  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door 

5 

Suppose we  are  in  the  original  game  show with  3 doors.  In  our original  analysis we assumed 
Carol  picked  the  door  randomly.  In  this  case  suppose  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door,  while 
still  making  sure  of  both  i)  it  contains  a  goat  and  ii)  it  is  not  the  contestants  ﬁrst  choice. 
The  contestant  follows  the  switching  strategy.  What  is  the  probability  the  contestant wins? 

3.2  Carol  picks  the  smallest  door  with  probability  p 

This  time,  when  Carol  has  a  choice  she  chooses  the  smallest  possible  door  with  probability 
p  and  the  other  remaining  door  with  probability  1 −  p.  The  contestant  still  follows  the 
switching  strategy.  What  is  the  probability  the  contestant  wins,  in  terms  of  p?

3.3  Optimal  strategery 

6 

So  far we assumed the contestant always switches.  We also know  from  lecture another strat­
egy:  the  contestant  always  sticks  to  her  original  choice.  We  determined  that  the  probability 
of  winning  with  the  “always  stay”  strategy  is  simple  to  calculate  from  the  probability  of 
winning  with  the  “always  switch”  strategy,  and  that  switching  was  better. 

What  if  the  contestant  decides  whether  to  switch  or  not  on  a  case  by  case  basis?  That 
is,  suppose  the  contestant  makes  a  decision  of  whether  to  switch  or  to  stay  based  on  1) 
Her  original  choice,  and  2)  Carol’s  choice  of  door.  Suppose  the  doors  are  labelled  A,  B 
and  C.  Show  “always  switching”  is  optimal.  (Hint:  a  strategy  can  be  seen  as  a  mapping 
that  assigns  a  pair  (D1 , D2 )  of  observations  to  a  decision:  switch  to  D3  or  stay  in  D1 .  The 
· · · . 
strategy  needs  to  be  deﬁned  for  all  pairs  (A, B ),  (A, C ) 
You  can  optimize  the  reaction 
for  each  observation  individually.)
