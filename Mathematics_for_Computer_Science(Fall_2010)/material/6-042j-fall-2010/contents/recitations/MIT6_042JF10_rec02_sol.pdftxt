Induction 

Recall  the  principle  of  induction: 

Principle  of  Induction.  Let  P (n)  be  a  predicate.  If 

�  P (0)  is  true,  and 
�  for  all  n ∈ N,  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1), 
then  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ∈ N. 

We’ll  use  induction  to  prove  the  following  conjecture: 

Conjecture.  For  al l  positive  integers,  n: 
·
·
· 
1  2 + 2  3 + 3  4 + . . . + n(n + 1) = 

n(n + 1)(n + 2) 
3 

Remember  that  an  induction  proof  has  ﬁve  parts,  though  the  last  one  is  often  omitted: 

1.  Say  that  the  proof  is  by  induction. 

2.  Deﬁne  the  induction  hypothesis,  a  predicate  P  deﬁned  on  the  natural  numbers. 

3.  Handle  the  base  case:  prove  that  P (0)  is  true. 
4.  Handle  the  inductive  step:  prove  that  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all  integers  n ≥ 0. 
5.  Conclude  that  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ∈ N  by  the  principle  of  induction. 

We noted in Lecture that while the base case is usually n = 0, it could be any nonnegative 
integer,  k ,  in  which  case  the  conclusion  would  simply  be  that  P (n)  holds  for  all  n ≥ k .

Proof.  We  use  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that: 
·
·
· 
1  2 + 2  3 + 3  4 + . . . + n(n + 1) = 

n(n + 1)(n + 2) 
3 
·
Base case n = 1:  P (1) is true, because the left-hand side of  (1) is 1 2 = 2, and the right-hand 
·
· 
side is (1  2  3)/3 = 2. 
Inductive  step:  We  must  show  that  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all  n  ≥  1.  So  assume  that 
P (n)  is  true,  where  n  denotes  a  positive  integer.  Then  we  can  reason  as  follows: 
· 
· 
· · · 
1  2 + 2  3 +  + (n + 1)(n + 2) 
· 
· 
· · · 
= [1  2 + 2  3 +  + n(n + 1)] + (n + 1)(n + 2)

n(n + 1)(n + 2) + 3(n + 1)(n + 2)

(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3)

This  shows  that  P (n + 1)  is  true,  and  so  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all  n ≥ 1. 
By  the  induction  principle,  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ≥ 1,  which  proves  the  claim.

2  Problem:  A  Geometric  Sum

Perhaps  you  encountered  this  classic  formula  in  school: 

1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
First use the well ordering principle, and then induction, to prove that this formula is correct 
for  all  real  values  r = 1.

1 + r + r  + r  + . . . + r  = 

Prepare  a  complete,  careful  solution.  You’l l  be  passing  your  proof  to  another  group  for 
“constructive  criticism”! 

Solution.  Proof  by  Well  Ordering  Principle 

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  contradiction  and  use  of  the  Well  Ordering  Principle.  Assume  that 
the  theorem  is  false.  Then,  some  nonnegative  integers  serve  as  counterexamples  to  it.  Lets 
collect  these  counterexamples  in  a  set:  C  ::= {n ∈ N|1 + r + r2  + r3  + . . . + rn  ̸=  1−
+1 } 
r−n
r 
1
By  our  assumption  that  the  theorem  admits  counterexamples,  C  is  a  nonempty  set  of  non­
negative  integers.  So,  by  the Well  Ordering  Principle,  C  has  a  minimum  element,  call  it  c. 
That  is,  c  is  the  smallest  counterexample  to  the  theorem. 

Since  c  is  the  smallest  counterexample,  we  know  that  formula  is  false  for  n = c  but  true  for 
1−r0+1 
all  nonnegative  integers  n < c.  But  the  formula  is  true  for  n  =  0  since  1  = 
1−r  .  Hence 
c >  0.  This  means  c − 1  is  a  nonnegative  integer,  and  since  it  is  less  than  c,  the  formula  is 
true  for  c − 1.  That  is, 

1 + r + r 2  + r 3  + . . . + r c−1  =

1 − rc 
1 − r 

(2)

c−1 
c

1 + r + r  + r  + . . . + r  + r  =

But  then,  adding  rc  to  both  sides  of  equation  (2)  gives  us 
1 − rc
1 − r 
c
+ r 
1 − rc  + (1 − r)rc 
1 − r 
1 − rc  + rc  − rc+1 
1 − r 
1 − rc+1 
1 − r 

= 

= 

= 

which means  that  the  formula  does  hold  for  c,  after  all!  This  is  a  contradiction,  and  we  are 
done.

Proof  by  Induction

1 + r + r  + r  + . . . + r  = 

Proof.  We  use  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  the  following  equation  holds  for 
all  r = 1: 
1 − r
n+1 
1 − r 
Base  case:  P (0)  is  true,  because  both  sides  of  the  equation  are  equal  to  1. 
Inductive  step:  We  must  show  that  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all  n  ∈  N.  So  assume  that 
P (n)  is  true,  where  n  denotes  an  arbitrary  natural  number.  We  can  reason  as  follows: 
1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
n+1
+ r 
1 − rn+1  + (1 − r) · rn+1 
1 − r 
1 − rn+2 
1 − r 
The  ﬁrst  equation  follows  from  the  assumption  P (n),  and  the  remaining  steps  are  simpliﬁ­
cations.  This  proves  that  P (n + 1)  is  also  true.  Therefore,  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all 
n ∈ N.  By  the  principle  of  induction,  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ∈ N.

Note:  You  may  have  encountered  a  diﬀerent  proof  of  this  formula.  We’ll  write  down  a 
sequence  of  equations  and  then  explain  the  reasoning. 

S  = 1 + r + r 2  + r 3  + . . . + r n 
rS  = r + r 2  + r 3  + . . . + r n+1 
S − rS  = 1 − r n+1 
1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
We deﬁne S  on  the ﬁrst  line, multiply by r  to get  the  second  equation,  subtract  the  second 
equation  from the ﬁrst to get the third, and then solve  for S .  This gives the  formula above! 

S  = 

This  argument  is  great!  It  is  a  derivation  of  the  formula  rather  than  just  a  veriﬁcation. 
But, at some  level, we’ve only hidden the use of  induction,  since the operations we’re doing 
� 
on  n-term  sums  are  justiﬁed  using —  you  guessed  it —  induction.

3  Problem:  Surveyevor 

5 

In  a  new  reality  TV  series  called  Surveyevor,  a  group  of  contestants  is  placed  on  a  small 
island.  Before  the  series  begins,  each  contestant  agrees  to  have  a  small  purple  or  red  tattoo, 
in  the  shape  of  an  eye,  applied  to  the  middle  of  his  or  her  forehead.  In  all,  there  are  p ≥  1 
purple  eyes  and  r  ≥  0  red  eyes.  However,  none  of  the  contestants  knows  the  color  of  his  or 
her  third  eye,  nor  how many  total  purple  and  red  eyes  there  are.  Furthermore,  there  are  no 
mirrors  and  no  one  is  allowed  to  discuss  the  tattoos  ever.  Therefore,  everyone  knows  the 
colors of  everyone  else’s  third  eye, but not  their own.  Good  thing, because a  contestant who 
learns  that he  or  she has  a purple  eye must  leave  the  island  at  the  end  of  the  show  that day, 
and  is  therefore  no  longer  eligible  to  win  the  �1 million  cash  prize  at  the  end  of  the  show! 

The  contestants  live  in  uneasy  ignorance  for  several  weeks.  As  time  goes  on,  however, 
most  of  them  lose  their  fear  of  being  exiled,  adapt  to  island  living,  and  even  make  friends 
with  one  another.  Things  are  going  quite  well  for  the  islanders,  but  as  you  might  suppose, 
the  television  audience  grows  bored,  and  the  show’s  ratings  plummet.  When  the  network 
threatens  to  cancel  the  series,  the  producer  decides  she  needs  to  do  something,  fast:  on  the 
next  show,  to  the  surprise of  the happy  islanders,  the producer herself appears and convenes 
a meeting.  Very  loudly, she proclaims, “I see that at  least one person here has a purple eye.” 
Assuming  that  all  the  contestants  are master  logicians,  what  happens? 
Solution.  All  the purple-tattooed  contestants  leave  the  island  at  the  end of  the pth day.� 

Use  induction  to  prove  that  your  conclusion  is  correct.  We  suggest  a  hypothesis  P (n)  that 
asserts  all  of  the  following  are  true  on  day  n: 

1.  If  p > n,  then 

2.  If  p = n,  then 

3.  If  p < n,  then 

. 

. 

. 

(We  leave  the  task  of  ﬁlling  in  the  blanks  to  you.) 

Solution.  Note that a red-eyed  islander shouldn’t ever conclude that she has a purple eye, 
since  she  doesn’t,  and  we’re  assuming  the  contestants  always  reason  correctly  from  what 
they  know  (and  that  what  they  know  from  the  producer  is  also  true).  So  no  red-eyed 
contestant  should  ever  leave  the  island. 

Theorem  1.  Al l  the  purple-eyed  people  leave  the  island  on  day  p. 

Proof.  We  use  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  all  of  the  following  are  true  on 
day  n: 

1.  If  p > n,  then  all  purple-eyed  people  survive  the  day. 

Recitation  2

2.  If  p = n,  then  all  purple-eyed  people  leave  the  island. 

3.  If  p < n,  then  all  purple-eyed  people  are  already  gone. 

Base  case:  We must  verify  that  the  three  parts  of  P (n)  hold  on  day  n = 1. 

1.  Suppose p > 1.  Consider events on day 1 from the perspective of a purple-eyed islander. 
The  producer  says  that  someone  has  a  purple  eye,  and  she  can  indeed  see  at  least  one 
other  person  with  a  purple  eye.  Therefore,  the  facts  available  to  her  are  consistent 
with  her  having  either  a  purple  or  red  eye.  So  she  survives  the  day. 

2.  Suppose 	 p  =  1.  The  single  purple-eyed  islander  sees  no  one  else  with  a  purple  eye, 
concludes that he must have a purple eye, and  leaves the  island at the end of the show. 
No  one  else  leaves  because  everyone  else  does  see  the  purple-eyed  islander,  and  they 
have  no  reason  at  this  point  to  think  they  too  are  purple-eyed. 

3.  This  statement  is  vacuously  true,  because  the  if-part  (p <  1)  is  false;  the  problem 
statement  says  that  p ≥ 1. 

Therefore,  P (1)  is  true. 
Inductive  step:  Now  suppose  that P (n)  is  true where n ≥ 0.  We must  verify  the  three  parts 
of  P (n + 1). 

1.  Suppose	 p > n +  1.  Then  p > n  so  all  the  purple-eyed  contestants  survived  the 
preceding  day  by  part  1  of  P (n).  Furthermore,  each  purple-eyed  islander  can  see  at 
least  n + 1 > n  other  purple-eyed  people,  so  the  observation  that  everyone  survives  is 
consistent  with  she  herself  having  either  a  purple  or  a  red  eye  by  P (n)  as  well.  Thus, 
each  purple-eyed  islander  survives  the  day. 

2.  Suppose	 p  =  n +  1.  Then  p > n,  so  all  the  purple-eyed  contestants  survived  the 
preceding  day  by  part  1  of  P (n).  Thus,  on  day  n + 1  each  purple-eyed  islander  knows 
p > n , but sees only n other people with a purple eye.  Thus, each purple-eyed islander 
realizes  that  she  has  a  purple  eye  and  leaves  the  island  at  the  end  of  the  show. 

3.  Suppose  p < n + 1.  Then  either  p =  n  (in  which  case  all  the  purple-eyed  contestants 
left  the  island  on  day  n  by part  2  of  P (n))  or  else  p < n  (in which  case  all  the  purple-
eyed  contestants were already gone on day n by part 3 of P (n)).  In  either  case,  all  the 
purple-eyed  people  are  already  out  of  luck. 
Therefore  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1)  for  all  n ≥ 0.

By  the  principle  of  induction,  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ≥ 0,  and  the  theorem  follows.
