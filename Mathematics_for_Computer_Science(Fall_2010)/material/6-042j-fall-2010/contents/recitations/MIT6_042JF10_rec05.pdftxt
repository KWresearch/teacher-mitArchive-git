Problems  for  Recitation  5 

1  RSA:  Let’s  try  it  out! 

You’ll  probably  need  extra  paper.  Check  your  work  careful ly! 

1.  As  a  team,  go  through  the  beforehand  steps. 

(a)  Choose  primes  p  and  q  to  be  relatively  small,  say  in  the  range  5-15.  In  practice, 
p  and  q  might  contain  several  hundred  digits,  but  small  numbers  are  easier  to 
handle  with  pencil  and  paper. 
(b)  Calculate n = pq .  This number will be used to encrypt and decrypt your messages. 
(c)  Find  an  e > 1  such  that  gcd(e, (p − 1)(q − 1)) = 1. 
The  pair  (e, n)  will  be  your  public  key.  This  value  will  be  broadcast  to  other 
groups,  and  they  will  use  it  to  send  you messages. 
(d)  Now  you  will  need  to  ﬁnd  a  d  such  that  de ≡ 1  (mod  (p − 1)(q − 1)). 
�  Explain  how  this  could  be  done  using  the  Pulverizer.  (Do  not  carry  out  the 
computations!) 

�  Find  d  using  Euler’s  Theorem  given  in  yesterday’s  lecture.

The  pair  (d, n)  will  be  your  secret  key.  Do  not  share  this  with  anybody!


When  you’re  done,  write  your  public  key  and  group members’  names  on  the  board. 

2.  Now  ask  your  recitation  instructor  for  a message  to  encrypt  and  send  to  another  team 
using  their  public  key. 
The messages m  correspond  to  statements  from  the  codebook  below: 

2  =  Greetings  and  salutations!

3  = Wassup,  yo?

4  =  You  guys  are  slow!

5  =  All  your  base  are  belong  to  us.

6  =  Someone  on  our  team  thinks  someone  on  your  team  is  kinda  cute.

7  =  You  are  the  weakest  link.  Goodbye.

3.	 Encode  the message  you  were  given  using  another  team’s  public  key. 

4.  Now	 decrypt  the  message  sent  to  you  and  verify  that  you  received  what  the  other 
team  sent! 

5.  Explain  how  you  could  read messages  encrypted  with RSA  if  you  could  quickly  factor 
large  numbers. 

RSA  Public-Key  Encryption 

Beforehand  The  receiver  creates  a  public  key  and  a  secret  key  as  follows. 

1.  Generate  two  distinct  primes,  p  and  q . 
2.  Let  n = pq . 
3.  Select  an  integer  e  such  that  gcd(e, (p − 1)(q − 1)) = 1. 
The  public  key  is  the  pair  (e, n).  This  should  be  distributed  widely. 
4.  Compute  d  such  that  de ≡ 1  (mod  (p − 1)(q − 1)). 
The  secret  key  is  the  pair  (d, n).  This  should  be  kept  hidden! 
Encoding  The  sender  encrypts message m  to  produce m�  using  the  public  key: 

m�  =  rem (m e , n) 
Decoding  The  receiver  decrypts message m�  back  to message m  using  the  secret  key: 
m =  rem ((m� )d , n).
