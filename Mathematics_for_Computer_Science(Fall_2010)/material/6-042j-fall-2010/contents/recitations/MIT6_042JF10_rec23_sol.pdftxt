1  Getting  Dressed

Sometimes  I  forget  a  few  items  when  I  leave  the  house  in  the morning. 

For  example,  here  are  probabilities  that  I  forget  various  pieces  of  footwear: 

left  sock 
right  sock 
left  shoe 
right  shoe 

0.2 
0.1 
0.1 
0.3 

a.	 Let X  be  the  number  of  these  that  I  forget.  What  is  Ex (X )? 

Solution.  By  Theorem  1,  the  expected  number  of  events  that  happen  is  the  sum  of 
the  event  probabilities.  So, 

Ex (X ) = 0.2 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.3 = 0.7 

� 

b.  Upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  one  or  more  items.  Make  no  independence 
assumptions. 

Solution.  By  the  Union  Bound,  the  probability  that  I  forget  something  is  at most: 

0.1 + 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.7 

� 

c.	 Use  the  Markov  Inequality  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  3  or  more 
items. 

Solution. 

Pr {X  ≥ 3} ≤ 

Ex (X )

d.  Now	 suppose  that  I  forget  each  item  of  footwear  independently.  Use  Chebyshev’s 
Inequality  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  two  or more  items. 

Solution.  Let  X1  be  the  event  I  bring  my  left  sock,  X2  my  right  sock,  X3  my  left 
shoe,  and  X4  my  right  shoe.  Then  Ex (X1 ) =  .2,  Ex (X2 ) =  .1,  Ex (X3 ) =  .1,  and 
Ex (X4 ) =  .3.  Moreover,  since  the  Xi  are  Bernoulli  random  variables  (binomial  with 
n  =  1),  we  have  Var [X1 ] =  .2(1 − .2)  =  .16, Var [X2 ] =  .1(1 − .1)  =  .09, Var [X3 ] = 
.1(1 − .1) =  .09,  and  Var [X4 ] =  .3(1 − .3) =  .21.

i=1 Xi .  Then  Ex (X ) = �4 
Let  X  = 
i=1 Ex (Xi ) =  .2 +  .1 +  .1 +  .3 =  .7.  Since 
the  Xi  are  independent,  Var [X ] = 
i=1 Var [Xi ] =  .16 + .09 + .09 + .21 =  .55.  Now 
by  Chebyshev’s  Inequality, 
Pr {X  ≥ 2} ≤ Pr {|X − .7| ≥ 1.3}

e.	 Use  Theorem  5  to  lower  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  one  or more  items. 

Solution.  Plugging  into Theorem  5,  the  probability  that  I  forget  one  or more  items: 
1 − e− Ex(X )  = 1 − e−0.7  = 0.503 . . .

g.  I’m  supposed  to  remember  many  other  items,  of  course:	 clothing,  watch,  backpack, 
notebook,  pencil,  kleenex,  ID,  keys,  etc.  Let  X  be  the  total  number  of  items  I  re­
member.  Suppose  I  remember  items  mutually  independently  and  Ex (X )  =  36.  Use 
Chernoﬀ ’s  Bound  to  give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  I  remember  48  or 
more  items. 

Solution.  By  the  Chernoﬀ  Bound, 
Pr {X  ≥ 48} = Pr {X  ≥ (1 + 1/3) Ex (X )} 
≤ e−(4/3 ln 4/3−4/3+1) 36·
≈  .1638 

h.  Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  I  remember  108  or more  items. 

Solution.  By  the  Chernoﬀ  Bound, 
Pr {X  ≥ 108} = Pr {X  ≥ 3  Ex (X )}

≤ e−(3 ln 3−3+1) 36·
≤ e−46  ≈ 1.05 × 10−20 .

2  A  Financial  Crisis 

4 

There  are  a  lot  of  foreign  words  here,  but  don’t  be  scared!  We  will  be  trying  to  understand 
why  the  subprime mortgage  collapse  happened! 
For  a more  complete  story  of  how  the  crisis  happened,  refer  to  section  19.5.3  of  the  text. 
The  following  is  a  set  of  vocabulary  that  we  will  be  using: 

�  A  loan  is  money  lent  to  a  borrower.  If  the  borrower  does  not  pay  on  the  loan,  the 
loan  is  said  to  be  in  default,  and  collateral  is  seized.  In  the  case  of  mortgage  loans, 
the  borrower’s  home  is  used  as  collateral. 

�  A  bond  is  a  collection  of  loans,  packaged  into  one  entity.  A  bond  can  be  divided  into 
tranches,  in  some  ordering, which  tell  us  how  to  assign  losses  from  defaults.  Suppose 
a  bond  contains  1000  loans,  and  is  divided  into  10  tranches  of  100  bonds  each.  Then, 
all  the  defaults  must  ﬁll  up  the  lowest  tranche  before  the  aﬀect  others.  For  example, 
suppose  150  defaults  happened.  Then,  the  ﬁrst  100  defaults would  occur  in  tranche  1, 
and  the  next  50  defaults  would  happen  in  tranche  2. 

�  The  lowest  tranche  of  a  bond  is  called  the mezzanine  tranche. 

�  We  can  make  a  “super  bond”  of  tranches  called  a  collateralized  debt  obligation 
(CDO)  by  collecting  mezzanine  tranches  from  diﬀerent  bonds.  This  super  bond  can 
then be itself separated into tranches, which are again ordered to indicate how to assign 
losses. 

Armed  with  this  knowledge,  we  can  now  solve  problems  about  the  crisis! 

1.  Suppose  that  1000  loans make  up  a  bond,  and  the  fail  rate  is  5%  in  a  year.  Assuming 
mutual  independence,  give  an  upper  bound  for  the  probability  that  there  are  one  or 
more  failures  in  the  second-worst  tranche.  What  is  the  probability  that  there  are 
failures  in  the  best  Tranche? 

Solution.  If  we  assume  mutual  independence,  we  can  use  Chebyshev’s  Theorem  to 
give  an  upper  bound  to  this.  Because  the  fail  rate  is  5%,  EX [X ]  =  50.  From 
Chebyshev,  we  have  that 

P r(X  ≥ 2  50) ≤ e−(2 ln 2−2+1)·50 
· 
which  evaluates  to  1.759 ∗ 10−6 . 
In  order  for  failure  to  reach  the  best  Tranche,  there  must  have  been  at  least  900 
failures.  This  corresponds  to  c = 18  in  the  Chernoﬀ  bound,  so  the  bound  is 
P r(X  ≥ 18  50) ≤ e−(18 ln 18−18+1)·50 
· 
This  evaluates  to  e−2551.33 ,  which  evaluates  to  less  than  10−1000 .

2.  Now,  do  not  assume  that  the  loans  are  independent.	 Give  an  upper  bound  for  the 
probability  that  there  are  one  or  more  failures  in  the  second  tranche.  What  is  an 
upper  bound  for  the  probability  that  the  entire  bond  defaults?  Show  that  it  is  a  tight 
bound.  (Hint:  Use Markov’s  theorem). 

Solution.  From  the Markov  bound,  we  have  that 

P r(X  ≥ 100) ≤ 

50 
100 

= 1/2 

Applying  Markov’s  theorem  again  in  the  case  of  failures  occuring  in  every  bond,  we 
have 
P r(X  ≥ 1000) ≤ 

= 1/20 

50 
1000 

We  can  see  that  these  bounds  are  tight  by  constructing  situations  where  they  occur. 
In  the  ﬁrst  case,  consider  if  the  bond  consisted  of  100  bonds  that  always  defaulted 
half  the  time,  and  the  other  bonds  never  defaulted.  In  the  second  case,  assume  that 
all  the  bonds  are  completely  correlated  (they  all  default  or  all  do  not  default),  and 
� 
default  5%  of  the  time. 

3.  Given  this  setup  (and  assuming mutual  independence  between  the  loans),  what  is  the 
expected  failure  rate  in  the mezzanine  tranche? 

Solution.  The  expected  number  of  failures  per  bond  is  50.  Because  all  losses  are 
� 
sent  to  the mezzanine,  the  expected  failure  rate  is  50%  (mighty  high!). 

4.  We	 take  the  mezzanine  tranches  from  100  bonds  and  create  a  CDO.  What  is  the 
expected  number  of  underlying  failures  to  hit  the  CDO? 

Solution.  From  the previous part,  each mezzanine  tranche has a 50%  rate of  failure. 
The  CDO  contains  10000  loans,  at  a  50%  rate  of  failure,  and  so  we  expect  5000 
� 
failures  in  the  CDO. 

5.  We  divide  this  CDO  into  10  tranches  of  1000  bonds  each.	 Assuming  mutual  inde­
pendence,  give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  of  one  or  more  failures  in  the  best 
tranche.  The  third  tranche? 

Solution.  We  use  a  50%  failure  rate  to  model  the  loans  in  this  CDO.  If  we  assume 
mutual independence, we use the Chernoﬀ bound to bound this.  One or more failures 
in  the best  tranche  corresponds  to over 9000  failures  in  the CDO. Using  the Chernoﬀ 
bound,  we  ﬁnd  that 

P r(X  ≥ 9/5 ∗ 5000) ≤ e−(9/5 ln(9/5)−9/5+1) 5000
·

which  is  approximately  zero. 

Recitation  23 

6 

For  the  third  tranche,  we  make  a  similar  calculation,  ﬁnding  the  probability  that 
there  are  over  7000  failures  in  the  CDO. 

P r(X  ≥ 7/5 ∗ 5000) ≤ e−(7/5 ln(7/5)−7/5+1) 5000
·
This  is  about  10−155–  that  is,  still  vanishingly  small. 

� 

6.  Repeat  the  previous  question  without  the  assumption  of mutual  independence. 

Solution.  Without a mutual independence assumption, the best we can do is bounds 
from Markov’s  theorem,  like  we  did  in  part  b.  Thus,  the  upper  bound  on  failures  in 
the  top  tranche,  or  over  9000  failures,  is: 

P r(X  ≥ 9000) ≤ 

5000 
9000


= 5/9 

For  failures  in  the  third  trance, Markov’s  theorem  gives  us:


P r(X  ≥ 7000) ≤ 

5000 
7000 

= 5/7 

To  put  it  generously,  these  probabilities  are  not  very  low.
