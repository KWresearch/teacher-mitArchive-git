2  Asymptotic  Equivalence 
Suppose  f , g  : Z+  → Z+  and  f  ∼ g . 
1.  Prove  that  2f  ∼ 2g . 
Solution. 

2f 
= 
2g 
so  they  have  the  same  limit  as  n → inf ty . 
2.  Prove  that  f 2  ∼ g2 .

3.  Give  examples  of  f  and  g  such  that  2f  �∼ 2g . 
Solution. 

f (n) = n + 1 
g(n) = n. 
Then  f  ∼ g  since  lim(n + 1)/n = 1,  but  2f  = 2n+1  = 2  2n  = 2  2g  so

4.  Show  that ∼  is  an  equivalence  relation 
Solution.  (a)  Reﬂexive:  f  ∼  f  since  f (x)/f (x)  =  1  for  all  x  (assuming  f (x) =�
so  limx→∞ f (x)/f (x) = 1 
(b)  Symmetric: 	 f  ∼ g  implies  g ∼ f  since  if  limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) = 1,  then  by  the  laws 
of  limits  limx→∞g(x)/f (x) = 1 
(c)  Transitive:	 f  ∼  g  and  g  ∼  h  implies  f  ∼  h:  if  limx→∞ f (x)/g(x)  =  1,  and 
limx→∞ g(x)/h(x) = 1,  then multiplying  the  limits  we  get

5.  Show  that Θ  is  an  equivalence  relation 
Solution.  (a)  Reﬂexive:  limx→∞ f (x)/f (x) = 1 < ∞,  trivial. 
(b)  Symmetric: 	
If  f  =  Θ(g),  we  wish  to  show  g  =  Θ(f ).  From  the  deﬁniton: 
limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) = c for some non-zero ﬁnite constant c.  Hence limx→∞ g(x)/f (x) = 
1/c.  Also  a  non-zero  ﬁnite  constant,  so  g = Θ(f ). 
(c)  Transitive:  Want to show f  = Θ(g), g = Θ(h) then f  = Θ(h).  Let limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) = 
c1  and  limx→∞ g(x)/h(x) =  c2 .  Then  limx→∞ f (x)/h(x)  =  limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) × 
g(x)/h(x) = c1  × c2 .  Since  both  c1  and  c2  are  non-zero  and  ﬁnite,  so  is  c1  × c2 .
