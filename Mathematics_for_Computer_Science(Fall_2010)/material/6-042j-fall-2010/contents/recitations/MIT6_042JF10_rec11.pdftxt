Problems  for  Recitation  11 

1.  Give	 a  description  of  the  equivalence  classes  associated  with  each  of  the  following 
equivalence  relations. 
(a)  Integers  x  and  y  are  equivalent  if  x ≡ y  (mod  3). 

(b)  Real numbers x and y  are equivalent  if �x� = �y�, where �z � denotes  the  smallest 
integer  greater  than  or  equal  to  z . 

2.  Show  that  neither  of  the  following  relations  is  an  equivalence  relation  by  identifying  a 
missing  property  (reﬂexivity,  symmetry,  or  transitivity). 

(a)  The  “divides”  relation  on  the  positive  integers. 

(b)  The  “implies”  relation  on  propositional  formulas.

(a)  Draw  a  Hasse  diagram  for  the  corresponding  partially-ordered  set.	 (A  Hasse 
diagram  is a way of representing a poset (A, �) as a directed acyclic graph.  The 
v  if  u  �  v .
→
vertices  are  the  element  of  A,  and  there  is  generally  an  edge  u
However,  self-loops  and  edges  implied  by  transitivity  are  omitted.)  You’ll  need 
this  diagram  for  all  the  subsequent  problem  parts,  so  be  neat!

(b)  Identify  a  largest  chain.  (A  chain  in  a  poset  (S, �)  is  a  subset  C  ⊆ S  such  that 
for  all  x, y ∈ C ,  either  x � y  or  y � x.) 

(c)  Suppose  that  you  want  to  take  all  the  courses.	 What  is  the  minimum  number 
of  terms  required  to  graduate,  if  you  can  take  as  many  courses  as  you  want  per 
term? 

(d)  Identify a  largest antichain.  (An antichain  in a poset  (S, �)  is a  subset A ⊆ S 
such  that  for  all  x, y ∈ A  with  x =�
y ,  neither  x � y  nor  y � x.)

(e)  What  is  the maximum  number  of  classes  that  you  could  possibly  take  at  once? 

(f )  Identify  a  topological  sort  of  the  classes.  (A  topological  sort  of  a  poset  (A, �) 
is  a  total  order  of  all  the  elements  such  that  if  ai  �  aj  in  the  partial  order,  then 
ai  precedes  aj  in  the  total  order.) 

(g)  Suppose  that  you  want  to  take  all  of  the  courses,  but  can  handle  only  two  per 
term.  How many  terms  are  required  to  graduate? 

(h)  What  if  you  could  take  three  courses  per  term? 

(i)  Stanford’s  computer  science  department  oﬀers	 n  courses,  limits  students  to  at 
most  k  classes  per  term,  and  has  its  own  complicated  prerequisite  structure.  De­
scribe  two  diﬀerent  lower  bounds  on  the  number  of  terms  required  to  complete 
all  the  courses.  One  should  be  based  on  your  answers  to  parts  (b)  and  (c)  and  a 
second  should  be  based  on  your  answer  to  part  (g).
