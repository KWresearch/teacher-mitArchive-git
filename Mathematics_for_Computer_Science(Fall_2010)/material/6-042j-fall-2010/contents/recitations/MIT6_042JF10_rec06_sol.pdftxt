1  Graph  Basics 

Let G = (V , E )  be  a  graph.  Here  is  a  picture  of  a  graph. 

Recall  that  the  elements  of  V  are  called  vertices,  and  those  of  E  are  called  edges.  In  this 
example  the  vertices  are  {A, B , C, D, E , F, G}  and  the  edges  are 
{A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C, E—F, C—E , E—G} . 

Deleting  some  vertices  or  edges  from  a  graph  leaves  a  subgraph.  Formally,  a  subgraph 
of  G  = (V , E )  is  a  graph  G�  = (V � , E � )  where  V �  is  a  nonempty  subset  of  V  and  E �  is  a 
subset  of  E .  Since  a  subgraph  is  itself  a  graph,  the  endpoints  of  every  edge  in  E �  must 
be  vertices  in  V � .  For  example,  V �  =  {A, B , C, D}  and  E �  =  {A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C }
forms  a  subgraph  of G. 
In  the  special  case  where  we  only  remove  edges  incident  to  removed  nodes,  we  say  that 
G�  is  the  subgraph  induced  on  V �  if  E �  =  {(x—y |x, y  ∈  V �  and  x—y  ∈  E }.  In  other  words, 
we  keep  all  edges  unless  they  are  incident  to  a  node  not  in  V � .  For  instance,  for  a  new 
set  of  vertices  V �  =  {A, B , C, D},  the  induced  subgraph  G�  has  the  set  of  edges  E �  = 
{A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C }. 

2  Problem  1 

An  undirected  graph G  has width  w  if  the  vertices  can  be  arranged  in  a  sequence 

v1 , v2 , v3 ,  . . . ,  vn

such  that  each  vertex  vi  is  joined  by  an  edge  to  at  most  w  preceding  vertices.  (Vertex  vj 
precedes  vi  if  j < i.)  Use  induction  to  prove  that  every  graph  with  width  at  most  w  is 
(w + 1)-colorable. 
(Recall  that  a  graph  is  k-colorable  iﬀ  every  vertex  can be  assigned  one  of  k  colors  so  that 
adjacent  vertices  get  diﬀerent  colors.) 

Solution.  We  use  induction  on  n,  the  number  of  vertices.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition 
that  every  graph  with  width  w  is  (w + 1)  colorable. 
Base case:  Every graph with n = 1 vertex has width 0 and is 0+ 1 = 1 colorable.  Therefore, 
P (1)  is  true. 
Inductive  step:  Now we assume P (n) in order to prove P (n + 1).  Let G be an (n + 1)-vertex 
graph  with  width  w.  This means  that  the  vertices  can  be  arranged  in  a  sequence 

v1 , v2 , v3 , . . . , vn , vn+1 

such  that  each  vertex  vi  is  connected  to  at  most  w  preceding  vertices.  Removing  vertex 
vn+1  and  all  incident  edges  gives  a  graph  G�  with  n  vertices  and  width  at  most  w.  (If 
original  sequence  is  retained,  then  removing  vn+1  does  not  increase  the  number  of  edges 
from  a  vertex  vi  to  a  preceding  vertex.)  Thus,  G�  is  (w + 1)-colorable  by  the  assumption 
P (n).  Now  replace  vertex  vn+1  and  its  incident  edges.  Since  vn+1  is  joined  by  an  edge  to 
at  most  w  preceding  vertices,  we  can  color  vn+1  diﬀerently  from  all  of  these.  Therefore, 
P (n + 1)  is  true. 
The  theorem  follows  by  the  principle  of  induction.

3  Problem  2 

A  planar  graph  is  a  graph  that  can  be  drawn  without  any  edges  crossing. 

1.  First,  show  that  any  subgraph  of  a  planar  graph  is  planar. 

Solution.  The  edge  set  of  any  subgraph  will  be  a  subset  of  the  set  of  edges  in  the 
original planar graph.  This means that since edges in the original graphs do not cross, 
� 
edges  in  a  subset  of  the  original  set  of  edges  also  do  not  cross. 

2.  Also,  any  planar  graph  has  a  node  of  degree  at most  5.  Now,  prove  by  induction  that 
any  graph  can  be  colored  in  at most  6  colors. 

Solution.  We  prove  by  induction.  First,  let  n  be  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  graph. 
Then  deﬁne 

P (n) = Any  planar  graph  with  n  nodes  is  6-colorable. 

Base  case,  P (1):  Every graph with n = 1 vertex  is 6-colorable.  Clearly true since  it’s 
actually  1-colorable.

→
Inductive  step,  P (n) 
P (n + 1):  Take  a  graph  G  with  n + 1  nodes.  Then  take  a 
node  v  with  degree  at  most  5  (which  we  know  exists  because  we  know  any  planar 
graph has a node of degree ≤ 5), and  remove  it.  We know  that  the  induced  subgraph 
G�  formed  in  this  way  has  n  nodes,  so  by  our  inductive  hypothesis, G�  is  6-colorable. 
But  v  is  adjacent  to  at most  5  other  nodes, which  can  have  at most  5  diﬀerent  colors 
between  them.  We  then  choose  v  to  have  an  unused  color  (from  the  6  colors),  and  as 
we  have  constructed  a  6-coloring  for G,  we  are  done  with  the  inductive  step. 
Because  we  have  shown  the  base  case  and  the  inductive  step,  we  have  proved 
∀n ∈ Z+  : P (n) 
(Note:  Z+  refers  to  the  set  of  positive  integers.)
