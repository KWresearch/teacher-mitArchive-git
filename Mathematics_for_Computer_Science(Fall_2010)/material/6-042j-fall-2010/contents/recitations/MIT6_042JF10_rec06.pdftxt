Problems  for  Recitation  6 

1  Graph  Basics 

Let G = (V , E )  be  a  graph.  Here  is  a  picture  of  a  graph. 

Recall  that  the  elements  of  V  are  called  vertices,  and  those  of  E  are  called  edges.  In  this 
example  the  vertices  are  {A, B , C, D, E , F, G}  and  the  edges  are 
{A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C, E—F, C—E , E—G} . 

Deleting  some  vertices  or  edges  from  a  graph  leaves  a  subgraph.  Formally,  a  subgraph 
of  G  = (V , E )  is  a  graph  G�  = (V � , E � )  where  V �  is  a  nonempty  subset  of  V  and  E �  is  a 
subset  of  E .  Since  a  subgraph  is  itself  a  graph,  the  endpoints  of  every  edge  in  E �  must 
be  vertices  in  V � .  For  example,  V �  =  {A, B , C, D}  and  E �  =  {A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C }
forms  a  subgraph  of G. 
In  the  special  case  where  we  only  remove  edges  incident  to  removed  nodes,  we  say  that 
G�  is  the  subgraph  induced  on  V �  if  E �  =  {(x—y |x, y  ∈  V �  and  x—y  ∈  E }.  In  other  words, 
we  keep  all  edges  unless  they  are  incident  to  a  node  not  in  V � .  For  instance,  for  a  new 
set  of  vertices  V �  =  {A, B , C, D},  the  induced  subgraph  G�  has  the  set  of  edges  E �  = 
{A—B , B—D, C—D, A—C }. 

2  Problem  1 

An  undirected  graph G  has width  w  if  the  vertices  can  be  arranged  in  a  sequence 

v1 , v2 , v3 ,  . . . ,  vn

such  that  each  vertex  vi  is  joined  by  an  edge  to  at  most  w  preceding  vertices.  (Vertex  vj 
precedes  vi  if  j < i.)  Use  induction  to  prove  that  every  graph  with  width  at  most  w  is 
(w + 1)-colorable. 

(Recall  that  a  graph  is  k-colorable  iﬀ  every  vertex  can be  assigned  one  of  k  colors  so  that 
adjacent  vertices  get  diﬀerent  colors.) 

3  Problem  2 

A  planar  graph  is  a  graph  that  can  be  drawn  without  any  edges  crossing. 

1.  First,  show  that  any  subgraph  of  a  planar  graph  is  planar. 

2.  Also,  any  planar  graph  has  a  node  of  degree  at most  5.  Now,  prove  by  induction  that 
any  graph  can  be  colored  in  at most  6  colors.
