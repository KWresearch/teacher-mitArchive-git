A  coin  that  comes  up  heads  with  probability  p  is  ﬂipped  n  times.  Find  an  upper  bound  on 
Pr {#  heads ≥ βn} 

where  β > p.  Think  about  the  number  of  tails  and  plug  into  the monster  formula  above.

2  Gallup’s  Folly 

2 

A  Gallup  poll  found  that  45%  of  the  adult  population  of  the  United  States  plan  to  vote 
Republican  in  the  next  election.  Gallup  polled  640  people  and  claims  a margin  of  error  of  3 
percentage  points. 

Let’s check Gallup’s claim.  Suppose that there are m adult Americans, of whom pm plan 
to  vote  Republican  and  (1 − p)m  do  not.  Gallup  polls  n  Americans  selected  uniformly  and 
independently at random.  Of these,  qn plan to vote Republican and (1 − q)n do not.  Gallup 
then  estimates  that  the  fraction  of  Americans  who  plan  to  vote  Republican  is  q . 

Note  that  the  only  randomization  in  this  experiment  is  in  who  Gallup  chooses  to  poll. 
So  the  sample  space  is  all  sequences  of  n  adult  Americans.  The  response  of  the  i-th  person 
polled is “yes” with probability p and “no” with probability 1 − p since the person is selected 
uniformly  at  random.  Furthermore,  the  n  responses  are mutually  independent. 

a.	 Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  the  poll’s  estimate  will  be  0.04  or  more 
too  low.  Just  write  the  expression;  don’t  evaluate  yet! 

b.  Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  the  poll’s  estimate  will  be  0.04  or  more 
too  high.  Again,  just  write  the  expression.

c.	 The  sum  of  these  two  answers  is  the  probability  that  Gallup’s  poll  will  be  oﬀ  by  4 
percentage  points  or  more,  one  way  or  the  other.  Unfortunately,  these  expressions 
both  depend  on  p—  the  unknown  fraction  of  voters  planning  to  vote  Republican  that 
Gallup  is  trying  to  estimate! 
However,  the  sum  of  these  two  expressions  is  maximized  when  p  = 0.5.  So  evaluate 
the  sum  with  p = 0.5  and  n = 640  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that Gallup’s  error 
is  0.04  or  more.  Pollsters  usually  try  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  95%  chance  that  the 
actual  percentage  p  lies  within  the  poll’s  error  range,  which  is  q ± 0.04  in  this  case.  Is 
Gallup’s  poll  properly  designed?

3  Noisy  Channel 

4 

Suppose  we  are  transmitting  packets  of  data  across  a  noisy  channel.  Each  packet  has  prob­
ability  .01  of  being  lost.  Now  suppose  we  are  transmitting  10, 000  packets.  What  is  the 
probability  that  at most  2%  of  the  packets  are  lost?
