2  Asymptotic  Equivalence 
Suppose  f , g  : Z+  → Z+  and  f  ∼ g . 

1.  Prove  that  2f  ∼ 2g . 
2.  Prove  that  f 2  ∼ g 2 . 
3.  Give  examples  of  f  and  g  such  that  2f  �∼ 2g . 
4.  Show  that ∼  is  an  equivalence  relation 

5.  Show  that Θ  is  an  equivalence  relation 

3  More  Asymptotic  Notation 

1.  Show  that 

(an)b/n  ∼ 1.

where a, b are positive constants and ∼ denotes asymptotic equality.  Hint an = a2log2 n .

2.  You  may  assume  that  if  f (n)  ≥  1  and  g(n)  ≥  1  for  all  n,  then  f  ∼  g  ⇒  f  ∼  g
