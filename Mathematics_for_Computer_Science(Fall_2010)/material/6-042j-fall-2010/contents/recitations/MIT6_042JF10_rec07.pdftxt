Problems  for  Recitation  7 

1  A  Protocol  for  College  Admission 

Next, we are going to talk about a generalization of the stable marriage problem.  Recall that 
we have  some horses and we’d  like  to pair  them with  stables  so  that  there  is no  incentive  for 
two  horses  to  swap  stables.  Oh  wait,  that’s  a  diﬀerent  problem. 
�M
The  problem  we’re  going  to  talk  about  is  a  generalization  of  the  one  done  in  lecture. 
In  the  new  problem,  there  are  N  students  s1 , s2 , . . . , sN  and  M  universities  u1 , u2 , . . . , uM .
i=1 ni  = N .  Each student 
University ui  has ni  slots for students, and we’re guaranteed that 
ranks  all  universities  (no  ties)  and  each  university  ranks  all  students  (no  ties). 

Design  an  algorithm  to  assign  students  to  universities  with  the  following  properties 

1.  Every  student  is  assigned  to  one  university. 
2.	 ∀i,  ui  gets  assigned  ni  students. 
3.  There  does  not  exist	 si , sj , uk , u�  where  si  is  assigned  to  uk ,  sj  is  assigned  to  u� ,  sj 
prefers  uk  to  u� ,  and  uk  prefers  sj  to  si . 

4.  It  is  student-optimal.  This  means  that  of  all  possible  assignments  satisfying  the  ﬁrst 
three  properties,  the  students  get  their  top  choice  of  university  amongst  these  assign­
ments. 

The  algorithm  will  be  a  slight  modiﬁcation  of  the  mating  algorithm  given  in  lecture.  For 
your  convenience,  we  have  provided  a  copy  of  the mating  algorithm  on  the  next  page.

Each  Day: 

�  Morning: 

2 

–	 Each  girl  stands  on  her  balcony 
–	 Each boy stands under the balcony of his favorite girl whom he has not yet crossed 
oﬀ  his  list  and  serenades.  If  there  are  no  girls  left  on  his  list,  he  stays  home  and 
does  6.042  homework. 

�	 Afternoon: 

–	 Girls  who  have  at  least  one  suitor  say  to  their  favorite  from  among  the  suitors 
that  day:  “Maybe,  come  back  tomorrow.” 
–	 To  the  others,  they  say  “No,  I  will  never marry  you!” 

�  Evening: 

–	 Any  boy  who  hears  “No”  crosses  that  girl  oﬀ  his  list. 

Termination  Condition:  If  there  is  a  day when  every  girl  has  at most  one  suitor, we  stop 
and  each  girl marries  her  current  suitor  (if  any).

1.  Before  we  can  say  anything  about  our  algorithm,  we  need  to  show  that  it  terminates. 
Show  that  the  algorithm  terminates  after N M  + 1  days. 

2.  Next,  we  will  show  that  the  four  properties  stated  earlier  are  true  of  our  algorithm. 
To  start,  let’s  show  the  following:  if  during  some  day  a  university  uj  has  at  least  nj 
applicants,  then  when  the  algorithm  terminates  it  accepts  exactly  nj  students. 

3.  Next,  show  that  every  student  is  assigned  to  one  university. 

4.  Next,  show  that  for  all  i,  ui  gets  assigned  ni  students. 

5.  Before  continuing,  we  need  to  establish  the  following  property.	 Suppose  that  on  some 
day  a  university  uj  has  at  least  nj  applicants.  Deﬁne  the  rank  of  an  applicant  si  with 
respect  to  a  university  uj  as  si ’s  location  on  uj ’s  preference  list.  So,  for  example,  uj ’s 
favorite  student  has  rank  1.  Show  that  the  rank  of  uj ’s  least  favorite  applicant  that  it 
says  “Maybe,  . . .”  to  cannot  decrease  (e.g.,  going  from  1000  to  1005  is  decreasing)  on 
any  future  day.  Note  that  uj ’s  least  favorite  applicant  might  change  from  one  day  to 
the  next. 

6.  Next,  show	 there  does  not  exist  si , sj , uk ,  and  u�  where  si  is  assigned  to  uk ,  sj  is 
assigned  to  u� ,  sj  prefers  uk  to  u� ,  and  uk  prefers  sj  to  si .  Note  that  this  is  analogous 
to  a  “rogue  couple”  considered  in  lecture. 

7.  Finally,  we  show  in  a  very  precise  sense  that  this  algorithm  is  student-optimal.  As  in 
lecture,  deﬁne  the  realm  of  possibility  of  a  student  to  be  the  set  of  all  universities  u, 
for  which  there  exists  some  assignment  satisfying  the  ﬁrst  three  properties  above,  in 
which  the  student  is  assigned  to  u.  Of  all  universities  in  the  realm  of  possibility  of  a 
student  we  say  that  the  student’s  favorite  is  optimal  for  that  student. 
Show  that  each  student  is  assigned  to  its  optimal  university.
