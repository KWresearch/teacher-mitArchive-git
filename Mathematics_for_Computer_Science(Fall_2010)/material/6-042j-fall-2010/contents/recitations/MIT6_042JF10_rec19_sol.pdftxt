1  Bayes’  Rule 

Bayes’  Rule  says  that  if  A  and  B  are  events  with  nonzero  probabilities,  then: 
Pr {A | B } · Pr {B } = Pr {B  | A} · Pr {A} 

a.	 Prove  Bayes’  Rule.

Solution.  We  reason  as  follows:

Pr {A ∩ B } = Pr {A ∩ B }

Pr {A ∩ B } 
Pr {A ∩ B } 
·

Pr {B } = 
Pr {A}

· 
Pr {B }
Pr {A}
Pr {A | B } · Pr {B } = Pr {B  | A} · Pr {A}

In  the  ﬁrst  step,  we  rewrite  both  sides  using  the  facts  that  Pr {A}  and  Pr {B }  are 
� 
nonzero.  The  second  step  uses  the  deﬁnition  of  conditional  probability. 

b.  A  weatherman  walks  to  work  each  day.	 Some  days  it  rains: 
Pr {rains} = 0.30 
Sometimes  the  weatherman  brings  his  umbrella.  Usually  this  is  because  he  predicts 
rain,  but  he  also  sometimes  carries  it  to  ward  oﬀ  bright  sunshine. 
Pr {carries  umbrella} = 0.40 
As  a  weatherman,  he  usually  doesn’t  get  caught  out  in  a  storm  without  protection: 
Pr {carries  umbrella | rains} = 0.80 
Suppose  you  see  the  weatherman  walking  to  work,  carrying  an  umbrella.  What  is  the 
probability  of  rain?  Use  Bayes’  Rule. 
Solution. 
Pr {rains | carries  umbrella} = Pr {carries  umbrella | rains} · 
0.30 
= 0.80 · 
0.40 
= 0.60 
We’ve  turned  around  cause  and  eﬀect!  Risk  of  rain  has  the  eﬀect  of  making  the 
weatherman  carry  his  umbrella.  Yet we’ve  shown  that  if  he  carries  his  umbrella,  it  is 
� 
pretty  likely  to  rain!

Pr {carries  umbrella}

2  DNA  Proﬁles 

2 

Suppose  that  we  create  a  a  national  database  of  DNA  proﬁles.  Let’s  make  some  (overly) 
simplistic  assumptions: 

�  Each  person  can  be  classiﬁed  into  one  of  20  billion  diﬀerent  “DNA  types”.  (For  ex­
ample,  you might  be  type #13,646,572,661  and  the  person  next  to  you might  be  type 
#2,785,466,098.)  Let  T (x)  denote  the  type  of  person  x. 

�  Each  DNA  type  is  equally  probable. 

�  The  DNA  types  of  Americans  are mutually  independent. 

a.	 A  congressman  argues  that  there  are  only  about  300  million  Americans,  so  even  if  a 
proﬁle  for  every  American  were  stored  in  the  database,  the  probability  of  even  one 
coincidental match  would  be  very  small. 
Recall from lecture that if there are N  days in a year and m people in a room, then the 
probability  that no  two people  in  the  room have  the  same birthday  is about  e−m2 /(2N ) . 
Using  this  fact, what  is  the probability  that  two people’s DNA proﬁles would match  if 
every  person’s  proﬁle  were  stored  in  the  database? 
Solution.  The probability of a match P (match) = 1−P (nonmatch).  By the birthday 
principle,  this  is: 

·
P (match) = 1 − e
− 
(3 108 )2 
· ·
2 2 1010 

= 1 − e− 
·

≈ 1

b.  After  this  database  is  implemented,  some  DNA  is  found  at  a  crime  scene.	 The  DNA 
is  sequenced  and  a  person  with  matching  DNA  is  found  through  the  database  and 
accused  of  the  crime.  At  the  trial  the  defense  attorney  argues  that,  by  the  birthday 
principle,  the  probability  that  there  are  multiple  people  whose  DNA  is  identical  is  a 
virtual  certainty,  and  so  the  jury  cannot  conclude  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  that  the 
defendant  is  the  criminal. 
What  is  the  ﬂaw  in  this  argument?  Under  what  circumstances  could  you  conclude 
based  on  DNA  evidence  alone  that  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  defendant  committed 
the crime?  (assuming no errors  in the DNA tests, a comprehensive database, etc.  etc.) 

Solution.  The  birthday  principle  can  be  used  to  compute  the  probability  that  there 
are  two  people  in  the  database  who  have  the  same  DNA  proﬁle;  this  is  analogous 
to  the  probability  that  there  are  two  people  in  the  room  with  the  same  birthday.  It 
cannot  be  used  directly  to  compute  the  probability  that  there  is  another  person  in 
the  database  with  the  same  DNA  proﬁle  as  the  criminal;  this  is  analogous  to  the 
probability  that  there  is  a  person  in  the  room with  the  same  birthday  as  a  particular 
person.

So  in  this  case,  we  are  interested  in  the  probability  that  the  defendant  is  the  crim­
inal,  given  that  the  defendant  DNA  matches  the  crime  scene  proﬁle.  This  could  be 
computed  if  we  knew  how  many  people  in  the  database  share  that  proﬁle:  If  there 
is  only  one  person  in  the  database with  that  proﬁle,  then  you  have  your  perpetrator. 
If  there  are  n  such  people,  then  the  probability  that  a  person  drawn  at  random  is 
the  perpetrator  is  1/n,  which  is  less  than  1/2  for  any  n >  1  and  thus  not  beyond  a 
reasonable  doubt. 
We  can  also  compute  the  probability  that  the  defendant  is  guilty  even  if  we  didn’t 
know  the  number  of  the  people  in  the  database  who  shared  that  proﬁle  by  summing 
over  all  the  possibilities.  We’ll  look  at  how  to  describe  this  in  a  later  lecture. 
Note:  Bear  in mind  that  this  is  just a 6.042 problem and not a  reasonable model  for 
the way that DNA evidence is actually used in forensics; genomes are not independent, 
� 
just  for  starters. 

3  The  Immortals 

There  were  n  Immortal Warriors  born  into  our  world,  but  in  the  end  there  can  be  only  one. 
The  Immortals’  original  plan  was  to  stalk  the  world  for  centuries,  dueling  one  another  with 
ancient  swords  in  dramatic  landscapes  until  only  one  survivor  remained.  However,  after  a 
thought-provoking  discussion  of  probabilistic  independence,  they  opt  to  give  the  following 
protocol  a  try: 

1.  The  Immortals  forge  a  coin  that  comes  up  heads  with  probability  p. 

2.  Each  Immortal  ﬂips  the  coin  once. 

3.  If  exactly  one  Immortal  ﬂips  heads,  then  he  or  she  is  declared  The  One.  Otherwise, 
the  protocol  is  declared  a  failure,  and  they  all  go  back  to  hacking  each  other  up  with 
swords. 

a.	 One  of  the  Immortals  (the  Kurgan  from  the  Russian  steppe)  argues  that  as  n  grows 
large,  the probability  that  this protocol  succeeds must  tend  to zero.  Another  (McLeod 
from the Scottish highlands) argues that this need not be the case, provided p is chosen 
very  careful ly.  What  does  your  intuition  tell  you? 

Solution.  Your  intuition  tells  you  that  it  is  not  to  be  trusted  and  that  there  can  be 
� 
only  one  way  to  solve  this  problem:  do  the math. 

b.  What  is  the  probability  that  the  experiment  succeeds  as  a  function  of  p  and  n? 

Solution.  The  sample  space  consists  of  all  possible  results  of  n  coin  ﬂips,  which  we 
can represent by the set {H, T }n .  Let E  be the event that the experiment successfully 

Recitation  19

selects The One.  Then E  consists  of  the  n  outcomes which  contain  a  single  head.  In 
general,  the  probability  of  an  outcome  with  h  heads  and  n − h  tails  is: 

p h (1 − p)n−h 

Summing  the  probabilities  of  the  n  outcomes  in  E  gives  the  probability  that  the 
procedure  succeeds: 

Pr {E }  =  np(1 − p)n−1 

� 

c.	 How should p, the bias of the coin, be chosen in order to maximize the probability that 
the  experiment  succeeds?  (You’re  going  to  have  to  compute  a  derivative!) 

Solution.  We  compute  the  derivative  of  the  success  probability: 

np(1 − p)n−1  =  n(1 − p)n−1  − np(n − 1)(1 − p)n−2 

d 
dp 

Now  we  set  the  right  side  equal  to  zero  to  ﬁnd  the  best  probability  p: 

n(1 − p)n−1  =  np(n − 1)(1 − p)n−2 
(1 − p) =  p(n − 1) 
p  = 1/n 

This  answer makes  sense,  since we want  the  coin  to  come  up  heads  exactly  1  time  in 
� 
n.	

d.  What  is  the  probability  of  success  if  p  is  chosen  in  this  way?  What  quantity  does  this 
approach  when  n,  the  number  of  Immortal Warriors,  grows  large? 

Solution.  Setting  p  = 1/n  in  the  formula  for  the  probability  that  the  experiment 
succeeds  gives: 
� 
�
1	
1 − 
n 

Pr {E }  =

n−1 

In  the  limit,  this  tends  to  1/e.  McLeod  is  right.
