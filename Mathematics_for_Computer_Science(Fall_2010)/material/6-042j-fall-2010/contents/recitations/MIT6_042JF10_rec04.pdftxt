Problems  for  Recitation  4 

1  Problem:  The  Pulverizer! 

There  is  a  pond.  Inside  the  pond  there  are  n  pebbles,  arranged  in  a  cycle.  A  frog  is  sitting 
on one of the pebbles.  Whenever he  jumps, he  lands exactly k  pebbles away  in the clockwise 
direction, where  0 < k < n.  The  frog’s meal,  a  delicious worm,  lies  on  the  pebble  right  next 
to  his,  in  the  clockwise  direction. 

(a)  Describe  a  situation  where  the  frog  can’t  reach  the  worm. 

(b)  In  a  situation  where  the  frog  can  actually  reach  the  worm,  explain  how  to  use  the 
Pulverizer  to  ﬁnd  how many  jumps  the  frog  will  need. 

(c) Compute  the number of  jumps  if n = 50 and k = 21.  Anything  strange?  Can you ﬁx  it?

2  Problem:  The  Fibonacci  numbers. 

2 

The  Fibonacci  numbers  are  deﬁned  as  follows: 

F0  = 0 

F1  = 1 

Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2 

(for  n ≥ 2). 

Give an  inductive proof  that  the Fibonacci numbers Fn  and Fn+1  are  relatively prime  for all 
n ≥ 0.

3  Extra  Problem:  The  power  of  3.1 

3 

Let N  be a number whose decimal expansion consists of 3n  identical digits.  Show by induction

that  3n  N .  For  example: 
32  | 777777777
32  = 9  digits 
Recall  that  3  divides  a  number  iﬀ  it  divides  the  sum  of  its  digits.
