1  Team  Problem:  A  Mystery 

A  certain  cabal  within  the  6.042  course  staﬀ  is  plotting  to make  the  ﬁnal  exam  ridiculously 
hard.  (“Problem  1.  Prove  that  the  axioms  of  mathematics  are  complete  and  consistent. 
Express  your  answer  in  Mayan  hieroglyphics.”)  The  only  way  to  stop  their  evil  plan  is  to 
determine  exactly  who  is  in  the  cabal.  The  course  staﬀ  consists  of  nine  people: 
{Oscar, Stav, Darren, Patrice, David, Nick, Martyna, Marten, Tom} 
The cabal  is a subset of these nine.  A membership roster has been found and appears below, 
but  it  is  deviously  encrypted  in  logic  notation.  The  predicate  incabal  indicates who  is  in  the 
cabal;  that is,  incabal(x) is true if and only if x is a member.  Translate each statement below 
into  English  and  deduce  who  is  in  the  cabal. 
z ∧ incabal(x) ∧ incabal(y) ∧ incabal(z )) 
z ∧ y =�
y ∧ x =�
(i)  ∃x  ∃y  ∃z  (x =�

¬
(incabal(Stav) ∧ incabal(David)) 

(ii) 

(iii)  (incabal(Martyna) ∨ incabal(Patrice)) → ∀x  incabal(x) 

(iv)  incabal(Stav) 

→ 

incabal(David) 

(v)  incabal(Darren) 

→ 

incabal(Martyna) 

(vi)  (incabal(Oscar) ∨ incabal(Nick)) 

→ ¬
incabal(Tom) 

(vii)  (incabal(Oscar) ∨ incabal(David)) 

→ ¬
incabal(Marten)
