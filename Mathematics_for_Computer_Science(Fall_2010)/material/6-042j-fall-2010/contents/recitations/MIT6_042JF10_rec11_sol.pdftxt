Notes  for  Recitation  11 

1.  Give	 a  description  of  the  equivalence  classes  associated  with  each  of  the  following 
equivalence  relations. 
(a)  Integers  x  and  y  are  equivalent  if  x ≡ y  (mod  3). 
Solution. 
{. . . , −6, −3, 0, 3, 6, . . .}
{. . . , −5, −2, 1, 4, 7, . . .}
{. . . , −4, −1, 2, 5, 8, . . .} 

� 
(b)  Real numbers x and y  are equivalent  if �x� = �y�, where �z � denotes  the  smallest 
integer  greater  than  or  equal  to  z . 
Solution.  For  each  integer  n,  all  the  real  numbers  r  such  that  n − 1  < r  ≤  n 
� 
form  an  equivalence  class. 

2.  Show  that  neither  of  the  following  relations  is  an  equivalence  relation  by  identifying  a 
missing  property  (reﬂexivity,  symmetry,  or  transitivity). 

(a)  The  “divides”  relation  on  the  positive  integers. 
Solution.  This  relation  is  reﬂexive  (since  a  |  a)  and  transitive  (since  a  |  b  and 
b | c  implies  a | c),  but  not  symmetric  (since  3  | 6,  but  not  6 | 3). 
� 
(b)  The  “implies”  relation  on  propositional  formulas. 
⇒ 
Solution.  This  relation  is  reﬂexive  since  p
p.  It  is  also  transitive,  since  if

(a)  Draw  a  Hasse  diagram  for  the  corresponding  partially-ordered  set.	 (A  Hasse 
diagram  is a way of representing a poset (A, �) as a directed acyclic graph.  The 
v  if  u  �  v .
→
vertices  are  the  element  of  A,  and  there  is  generally  an  edge  u
However,  self-loops  and  edges  implied  by  transitivity  are  omitted.)  You’ll  need 
this  diagram  for  all  the  subsequent  problem  parts,  so  be  neat! 
Solution. 

� 
(b)  Identify  a  largest  chain.  (A  chain  in  a  poset  (S, �)  is  a  subset  C  ⊆ S  such  that 
for  all  x, y ∈ C ,  either  x � y  or  y � x.)

Solution.  There  are  two  largest  chains:

8.01 � 8.02 � 6.02 � 6.004 � 6.033 � 6.857 

and 
18.01 � 18.03 � 6.02 � 6.004 � 6.033 � 6.857 

� 
(c)  Suppose  that  you  want  to  take  all  the  courses.	 What  is  the  minimum  number 
of  terms  required  to  graduate,  if  you  can  take  as  many  courses  as  you  want  per 
term?

Solution.  Six  terms  are  necessary,  because  at  most  one  course  in  the  longest 
chain  can  be  taken  each  term.  Six  terms  are  suﬃcient  by  a  theorem  proved  in 
� 
lecture. 
(d)  Identify a  largest antichain.  (An antichain  in a poset  (S, �)  is a  subset A ⊆ S 
such  that  for  all  x, y ∈ A  with  x =�
y ,  neither  x � y  nor  y � x.) 
Solution.	 There  are  several  ﬁve-element  antichains.  One  is: 
{18.02, 6.042, 18.03, 8.01, 6.01} 

� 
(e)  What  is  the maximum  number  of  classes  that  you  could  possibly  take  at  once? 
Solution.  Classes you are taking simultaneously must form an antichain, so you 
� 
can  take  at most  ﬁve  at  once. 
(f )  Identify  a  topological  sort  of  the  classes.  (A  topological  sort  of  a  poset  (A, �) 
is  a  total  order  of  all  the  elements  such  that  if  ai  �  aj  in  the  partial  order,  then 
ai  precedes  aj  in  the  total  order.) 
Solution.  Many  answers  are  possible.  One  is  18.01,  8.01,  6.01,  18.02,  6.042, 
� 
18.03,  8.02,  6.034,  6.046,  6.02,  6.840,  6.004,  6.003,  6.033,  6.857. 
(g)  Suppose  that  you  want  to  take  all  of  the  courses,  but  can  handle  only  two  per 
term.  How many  terms  are  required  to  graduate? 
Solution.  There are  15  courses,  so at  least 8  terms are necessary.  The  schedule 
below  shows  that  8  terms  are  suﬃcient  as  well: 
8.01 
1:  18.01 
2: 
6.01 
18.02 
3:  6.042  18.03 
4: 
8.02 
6.034 
5:  6.046 
6.02 
6:  6.840  6.004 
7:  6.003  6.033 
8:  6.857 

� 

(h)  What  if  you  could  take  three  courses  per  term? 
Solution.  In  part  (c)  we  argued  that  six  terms  are  required  even  if  there  is  no 
limit  on  the  number  of  courses  per  term.  Six  terms  are  also  suﬃcient,  as  the 
following  schedule  shows: 

6.01 
1:  18.01 
8.01 
8.02 
2:  6.042  18.03 
6.02 
3:  18.02  6.046 
4:  6.004  6.003  6.034 
5:  6.840  6.033 
6:  6.857

(i)  Stanford’s  computer  science  department  oﬀers	 n  courses,  limits  students  to  at 
most  k  classes  per  term,  and  has  its  own  complicated  prerequisite  structure.  De­
scribe  two  diﬀerent  lower  bounds  on  the  number  of  terms  required  to  complete 
all  the  courses.  One  should  be  based  on  your  answers  to  parts  (b)  and  (c)  and  a 
second  should  be  based  on  your  answer  to  part  (g). 
Solution.  One  lower  bound  is  the  length  of  the  longest  chain  and  another  is 
�n/k�.
