Problems  for  Recitation  3 

1  Problem:  Breaking  a  chocolate  bar 
We  are  given  a  chocolate  bar  with  m × n  squares  of  chocolate,  and  our  task  is  to  divide  it 
into  mn  individual  squares.  We  are  only  allowed  to  split  one  piece  of  chocolate  at  a  time 
using  a  vertical  or  a  horizontal  break. 
For  example,  suppose  that  the  chocolate  bar  is  2 × 2.  The  ﬁrst  split  makes  two  pieces, 
both  2 × 1.  Each  of  these  pieces  requires  one more  split  to  form  single  squares.  This  gives  a 
total  of  three  splits. 

Prove  that  the  number  of  times  you  split  the  bar  does  not  depend  on  the  sequence  of 
splits  you make.

2  Problem:  The  Temple  of  Forever 

2 

Each  monk  entering  the  Temple  of  Forever  is  given  a  bowl  with  15  red  beads  and  12  green 
beads.  Each  time  the Gong  of  Time  rings,  a monk must  do  one  of  two  things: 

1.	 Exchange:  If he has at least 3 red beads in his bowl, then he may exchange 3 red beads 
for  2  green  beads. 

2.	 Swap:  He  may  replace  each  green  bead  in  his  bowl  with  a  red  bead  and  replace  each 
red  bead  in  his  bowl  with  a  green  bead.  That  is,  if  he  starts  with  i  red  beads  and 
j  green  beads,  then  after  he  performs  this  operation,  he  will  have  j  red  beads  and  i 
green  beads. 

A monk may  leave  the Temple  of Forever  only when  he  has  exactly  5  red  beads  and  5  green 
beads  in  his  bowl. 

Let’s  look  at  how  we  can  represent  this  problem  as  a  state machine. 

�	 What  do  the  states  of  the machine  look  like? 

�  Use  the  notation  you  developed  above  to  represent  the  allowable  transitions  in  the 
state machine. 

�  Expand the state machine diagram to the ﬁrst three or four levels.  Label the transitions 
according  to  the  operation  type  (E  for  exchange  or  S  for  swap). 

Now  we’ll  show  that  no  monk  can  ever  escape  the  Temple  of  Forever  because  the  state 
(5, 5)  violates  an  invariant  of  the  Temple  of  Forever machine. 

Theorem  1.  No  one  ever  leaves  the  Temple  of  Forever. 

Prove  this  theorem  by  induction.  Begin  by  searching  for  an  invariant  that  holds  initially 
and  is  maintained  by  each  operation,  but  would  be  violated  by  the  condition  required  for 
departure. 

Now  let’s  take  a  look  at  a  diﬀerent  property  of  the  Temple  of  Forever machine. 

Theorem  2.  There  is  a  ﬁnite  number  of  reachable  states  in  the Temple  of  Forever machine. 

Prove  this  theorem.  (Hint:  First  ﬁnd  an  invariant  that  suggests  an  upper  bound  on  the 
number  of  reachable  states.  Be  sure  to  prove  the  invariant.) 

Inside  the  Temple  of  Forever,  the  Gong  of  Time  rings  on.  As  you  may  well  imagine, 
the monks  begin  to  recognize  that  no matter  how many  ways  they  try  to  exchange  or  swap 
their  beads,  they  always  seem  to  end  up  in  some  state  they’ve  already  been  in  before!  For 
one  or  two  monks,  this  realization  is  all  they  need  to  propel  them  instantly  into  a  state  of

enlightenment.  For  the  overwhelming  ma jority,  however,  this  knowledge  does  nothing  but 
weaken their resolve.  They just get depressed.  Taking note of the mental state of this second 
group,  the  Keeper  of  the  Temple  makes  an  unannounced  appearance  and  proclaims  to  the 
group, “From now on, any monk who is able to visit 108 (108 being the mystical number that 
encompasses all  of  existence1 ) unique  states will be allowed  to  leave  the Temple of Forever.” 

Do  the monks  have  any  chance  of  leaving  the  Temple  of  Forever? 

Theorem  3.  It  is  not  possible  to  visit  108  unique  states  in  the  Temple  of  Forever  machine. 

Prove  this  theorem.  (Hint:  Consider  a  proof  by  contradiction.) 

What  is  the  true  maximal  number  of  unique  states  a  monk  can  visit  in  any  execution  of 
the  Temple  of  Forever machine?  How  can  this  number  be  achieved?
