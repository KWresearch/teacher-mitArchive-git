1  Nerditosis 

There  is  a  rare  and  deadly  disease  called  Nerditosis  which  aﬄicts  about  1  person  in  1000. 
One  symptom  is  a  compulsion  to  refer  to  everything—  ﬁelds  of  study,  classes,  buildings, 
etc.—  using  numbers.  It’s  horrible.  As  victims  enter  their  ﬁnal,  downward  spiral,  they’re 
awarded  a  degree  from MIT.  Two  doctors  claim  that  they  can  diagnose  Nerditosis. 

1.  Doctor	 X  received  his  degree  from  Harvard  Medical  School.  He  practices  at  Mas­
sachusetts  General  Hospital  and  has  access  to  the  latest  scanners,  lab  tests,  and  re­
search.  Suppose  you  ask  Doctor X  whether  you  have  the  disease. 

�	 If  you  have  Nerditosis,  he  says  “yes”  with  probability  0.99. 
�	 If  you  don’t  have  it,  he  says  “no”  with  probability  0.97. 

Let D be the event that you have the disease, and let E  be the event that the diagnosis 
is  erroneous.  Use  the  Total  Probability  Law  to  compute  Pr {E },  the  probability  that 
Doctor X  makes  a mistake. 

2.  “Doctor”	 Y  received  his  genuine  degree  from  a  fully-accredited  university  for  �49.95 
via  a  special  internet  oﬀer.  He  knows  that Nerditosis  strikes  1  person  in  1000,  but  is  a 
little  shaky  on  how  to  interpret  this.  So  if  you  ask  him  whether  you  have  the  disease, 
he’ll  helpfully  say  “yes”  with  probability  1  in  1000  regardless  of  whether  you  actually 
do  or  not. 
Let D be the event that you have the disease, and let F  be the event that the diagnosis is 
faulty.  Use  the Total Probability Law  to  compute Pr {F },  the probability  that Doctor 
Y  made  a mistake. 

3.  Which  doctor  is more  reliable?

2  Barglesnort 

A  Barglesnort makes  its  lair  in  one  of  three  caves: 

2 

The  Barglesnort  inhabits  cave  1  with  probability
 1 
2 ,
 cave  2  with  probability
 1 
4 ,
 and  cave

3  with  probability
 1 
4 .  A  rabbit  subsequently  moves  into  one  of  the  two  unoccupied  caves,

selected with  equal  probability.  With  probability
 1 
3 ,  the  rabbit  leaves  tracks  at  the  entrance

to  its  cave.  (Barglesnorts  are much  too  clever  to  leave  tracks.)  What  is  the  probability  that 
the  Barglesnort  lives  in  cave  3,  given  that  there  are  no  tracks  in  front  of  cave  2? 

Use  a  tree  diagram  and  the  four-step method.

3  Prisoners 

3 

There are three prisoners in a maximum-security prison for ﬁctional villains:  the Evil Wizard 
Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo-Foo.  The parole board has declared 
that  it  will  release  two  of  the  three,  chosen  uniformly  at  random,  but  has  not  yet  released 
their names.  Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures that he will be released to his home  in Mordor, where 
the  shadows  lie,  with  probability
 2 
3 .

A  guard  oﬀers  to  tell  Sauron  the  name  of  one  of  the  other  prisoners who will  be  released 
(either  Voldemort  or  Foo-Foo).  However,  Sauron  declines  this  oﬀer.  He  reasons  that  if  the 
guard  says,  for  example,  “Little  Bunny  Foo-Foo  will  be  released”,  then  his  own  probability 
of  release will  drop  to
 1 
2 .  This  is  because  he will  then  know  that  either  he  or Voldemort will 

also  be  released,  and  these  two  events  are  equally  likely. 

Using  a  tree  diagram  and  the  four-step method,  either  prove  that  the Dark  Lord  Sauron 
has  reasoned  correctly  or  prove  that  he  is  wrong.  Assume  that  if  the  guard  has  a  choice  of 
naming  either  Voldemort  or  Foo-Foo  (because  both  are  to  be  released),  then  he  names  one 
of  the  two  uniformly  at  random.
