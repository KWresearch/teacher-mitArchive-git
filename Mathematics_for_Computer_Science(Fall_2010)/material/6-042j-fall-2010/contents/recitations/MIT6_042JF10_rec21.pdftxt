Problems  for  Recitation  21 

Problem  1.  [  points]  Here’s  yet  another  fun  6.042  game!  You  pick  a  number  between  1 
and  6.  Then  you  roll  three  fair,  independent  dice. 

�  If  your  number  never  comes  up,  then  you  lose  a  dollar. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  once,  then  you  win  a  dollar. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  twice,  then  you  win  two  dollars. 

�  If  your  number  comes  up  three  times,  you  win  four  dollars! 

What  is  your  expected  payoﬀ ?  Is  playing  this  game  likely  to  be  proﬁtable  for  you  or  not?

Problem  2.  [  points]  The  number  of  squares  that  a  piece  advances  in  one  turn  of  the 
game Monopoly  is  determined  as  follows: 

�  Roll  two  dice,  take  the  sum  of  the  numbers  that  come  up,  and  advance  that  number 
of  squares. 

�  If  you  roll  doubles  (that  is,  the  same  number  comes  up  on  both  dice),  then  you  roll  a 
second  time,  take  the  sum,  and  advance  that  number  of  additional  squares. 

�  If you roll doubles a second time, then you roll a third time, take the sum, and advance 
that  number  of  additional  squares. 

�  However,  as a  special case,  if you  roll doubles a  third  time,  then you go  to  jail.  Regard 
this  as  advancing  zero  squares  overall  for  the  turn. 

(a)  [ pts] What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  the  same  number  comes  up  on 
both? 

(b)  [ pts]  What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  diﬀerent  numbers  come  up? 
(Use  your  previous  answer  and  the  Total  Expectation  Theorem.)

(c)  [ pts]  To  simplify  the  analysis,  suppose  that  we  always  roll  the  dice  three  times,  but 
may  ignore  the  second  or  third  rolls  if  we  didn’t  previously  get  doubles.  Let  the  random 
variable Xi  be  the  sum  of  the  dice  on  the  i-th  roll,  and  let Ei  be  the  event  that  the  i-th  roll 
is  doubles.  Write  the  expected  number  of  squares  a  piece  advances  in  these  terms. 

(d)  [ pts] What  is  the  expected  number  of  squares  that  a  piece  advances  in Monopoly?
