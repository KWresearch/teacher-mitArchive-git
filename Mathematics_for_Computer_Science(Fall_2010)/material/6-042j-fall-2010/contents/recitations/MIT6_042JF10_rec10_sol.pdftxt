Analysis  of  Two  Networks 

Two  communication  networks  are  shown  below.  Complete  the  table  of  properties  and  be 
prepared  to  justify  your  answers.

Recall  that  the  diameter  of  a  communication  network  is  the  number  of  edges  on  the 
shortest  path  between  the  input  and  output  that  are  farthest  apart.  The max  congestion 
of  a  network  is  the  largest  number  of  packets  that  pass  through  any  switch  in  the  best 
solution  to  the  hardest  permutation  routing  problem.  You  might  imagine  that  your  enemy 
picks  a  permutation  and  then  you  pick  the  path  taken  by  each  packet.  (Her  goal  is  to 
cause  congestion,  and  yours  is  to  eliminate  it.)  Assuming  you  both  do  your  best,  the  max 
congestion  is  then  equal  to  the  largest  number  of  packets  passing  through  a  single  switch. 

Solution.  The  congestion  of  the  5-path  is  at  least  5,  because  every  path must  contain  the 
central  switch  when  π(i) = 4 − i.  The  congestion  is  at  most  5,  because  there  are  only  5 
paths  in  total. 
The  congestion  of  the  4-cycle  is  at  least  3.  Consider  the  permutation  routing  problem  in 
which  each  input  sends  a  packet  to  the  diagonally  opposite  output:  π(0)  = 2,  π(1) =  3,

π(2) = 0,  π(3) = 1.  Packets  0  and  2 must  pass  through  the  switches  on  the  upper  left  and 
lower  right  in  order  to  access  the  appropriate  input  and  output  terminals.  Packet  1  must 
pass through one of  these switches as well,  so at  least  three packets pass through either the 
upper-left  switch  or  the  lower-left  switch. 
The  congestion  of  the  4-cycle  is  at  most  3.  Suppose  we  route  each  packet  by  the  shortest 
path  and  break  ties  by  routing  clockwise  around  the  cycle.  Now  consider  any  particular 
switch,  say  the  one  in  the  upper  right.  At  worst,  this  switch  sees  three  packets:  the  one 
from input 1, the one destined for output 1, and one passing through from input 0 to output 
� 
2.  By  symmetry,  every  switch  sees  at most  3  packets. 

Routing  in  a  Bene˘s  Network 

In  lecture,  we  saw  that  the  Bene˘s  network  has  a max  congestion  of  1;  that  is,  every  permu­
tation  can  be  routed  in  such  a  way  that  a  single  packet  passes  through  each  switch.  Let’s 
work  through  an  example.  A  Bene˘s  network  of  size N  = 8  is  attached. 

1.  Within the Bene˘s network of size N  = 8, there are two subnetworks of size N  = 4.  Put 
boxes around these.  Hereafter, we’ll refer to these as the upper  and lower  subnetworks. 

Solution.

2.  Now  consider  the  following  permutation  routing  problem: 

π(0) = 3 
π(1) = 1 
π(2) = 6 
π(3) = 5 

π(4) = 2 
π(5) = 0 
π(6) = 7 
π(7) = 4 

Each packet must be  routed  through either  the upper  subnetwork or  the  lower  subnet­
work.  Construct  a  graph  with  vertices  0,  1,  . . . ,  7  and  draw  a  dashed  edge  between 
each  pair  of  packets  that  can  not  go  through  the  same  subnetwork  because  a  collision 
would  occur  in  the  second  column  of  switches.

3.  Add a  solid  edge  in  your  graph  between  each  pair  of  packets  that  can  not  go  through 
the  same  subnetwork  because  a  collision  would  occur  in  the  next-to-last  column  of 
switches. 

Solution.

4.  Color  (i.e.,  label)  the  vertices  of  your  graph  red  and  blue  so  that  adjacent  vertices  get 
diﬀerent  colors.  Why must  this  be  possible,  regardless  of  the  permutation  π? 

Solution.  This must be possible, because the dashed edges  form a matching and the 
solid  edges  form  another  matching.  Because  of  the  result  you  proved  in  homework, 
when you combine the edges, the result is a bipartite graph, which must be 2-colorable.

5.  Suppose  that  red vertices  correspond  to packets  routed  through  the upper  subnetwork 
and  blue  vertices  correspond  to  packets  routed  through  the  lower  subnetwork.  On  the 
attached copy of  the Bene˘s network, highlight  the ﬁrst and  last edge  traversed by each 
packet. 

Solution. 

� 

6.  All that remains is to route packets through the upper and lower subnetworks.  One way 
to do this is by applying the procedure described above recursively on each subnetwork. 
However,  since  the  remaining problems are  small,  see  if you can complete all  the paths 
on  your  own.
