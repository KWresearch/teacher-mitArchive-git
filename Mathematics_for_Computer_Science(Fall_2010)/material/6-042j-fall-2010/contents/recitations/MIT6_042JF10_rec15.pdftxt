Problems  for  Recitation  15 

1  The  Tao  of  BOOKKEEPER 

In this problem, we seek enlightenment through contemplation of the word BOOKKEEP ER. 

1.  In  how many  ways  can  you  arrange  the  letters  in  the  word  P OKE ? 

2.  In  how  many  ways  can  you  arrange  the  letters  in  the  word  BO1O2K ?  Observe  that 
we  have  subscripted  the  O’s  to make  them  distinct  symbols. 

3.  Suppose we map arrangements of the letters in BO1O2K  to arrangements of the letters 
in  BOOK  by  erasing  the  subscripts.  Indicate  with  arrows  how  the  arrangements  on 
the  left  are mapped  to  the  arrangements  on  the  right.

5.  In  light  of  the  Division  Rule,  how many  arrangements  are  there  of BOOK ?

6.  Very good, young master!  How many arrangements are there of the letters in KE1E2P E3R? 

7.  Suppose  we map  each  arrangement  of KE1E2P E3R  to  an  arrangement  of KEEP ER 
by  erasing  subscripts.  List  all  the  diﬀerent  arrangements  of  KE1E2P E3R  that  are 
mapped  to  REP EEK  in  this  way. 

8.  What  kind  of mapping  is  this? 

9.  So  how many  arrangements  are  there  of  the  letters  in KEEP ER? 

10.	 Now  you  are  ready  to  face  the  BOOKKEEPER! 
How many  arrangements  of  BO1O2K1K2E1E2P E3R  are  there? 

11.  How many  arrangements  of  BOOK1K2E1E2P E3R  are  there? 

12.  How many  arrangements  of  BOOKKE1E2P E3R  are  there? 

13.  How many  arrangements  of  BOOKKEEP ER  are  there? 

14.  How many  arrangements  of  V OODOODOLL  are  there?

15.  (IMPORTANT)  How many  n-bit  sequences  contain  k  zeros  and  (n − k)  ones?

�  � 
This  quantity  is  denoted  n
k  and  read  “n  choose  k”.  You  will  see  it  almost  every  day 
in  6.042  from  now  until  the  end  of  the  term. 

Remember  wel l  what  you  have  learned:  subscripts  on,  subscripts  oﬀ. 

This  is  the  Tao  of  Bookkeeper.

2  Pigeonhole  Principle 

4 

Solve the following problems using the pigeonhole principle.  For each problem, try to identify 
the  pigeons,  the  pigeonholes,  and  a  rule  assigning  each  pigeon  to  a  pigeonhole. 

1.  In  a  room  of  500  people,  there  exist  two  who  share  a  birthday. 

2.  Suppose  that  each  of  the  115  students  in  6.042  sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID 
number.  Must  two  people  arrive  at  the  same  sum? 

3.  In  every  set  of  100  integers,  there  exist  two  whose  diﬀerence  is  a multiple  of  37.

3  More  Counting  Problems 

5 

Solve  the  following  counting  problems.  Deﬁne  an  appropriate  mapping  (bijective  or  k -to-1) 
between  a  set  whose  size  you  know  and  the  set  in  question. 

1.	 (IMPORTANT)  In  how  many  ways  can  k  elements  be  chosen  from  an  n-element 
set  {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}? 

2.  How many diﬀerent ways are there to select a dozen donuts if ﬁve varieties are available? 
(We  discussed  a  bijection  for  this  set  in  Recitation  15.  Now  use  that  bijection  to  give 
a  count.) 

3.  An independent living group is hosting eight pre-frosh, aﬀectionately known as P1 , . . . , P8 
by  the  permanent  residents.  Each  pre-frosh  is  assigned  a  task:  2  must  wash  pots,  2 
must  clean  the  kitchen,  1  must  clean  the  bathrooms,  1  must  clean  the  common  area, 
and  2 must  serve  dinner.  In  how many  ways  can  P1 , . . . , P8  be  put  to  productive  use? 

4.  Suppose  that  two  identical  52-card  decks  of  are  mixed  together.	 In  how  many  ways 
can  the  cards  in  this  double-size  deck  be  arranged?

4  Fun  with  Phonology:  Hawaiian 

6 

The Hawaiian language is rich in vowels:  it contains 8 consonants and 25 vowels1 !  In addition, 
every word  in Hawaiian must  end  in  a  vowel  and must  not  contain  two  consonants  in  a  row. 
Let’s  assume  that  all  combinations  of  vowels  and  consonants  that  satisfy  these  constraints 
are  valid. 

We’d  like  to  know  how  many  n-phoneme  words  there  are  in  Hawaiian.  (A  phoneme  is 
either  a  single  vowel  or  a  single  consonant.  Assume  no  phoneme  can  be  both  a  vowel  and  a 
consonant.)  For  simplicity,  let’s  assume  n  is  even. 

1.  Before tackling the general problem, work out how many diﬀerent words there are with 
exactly  4  phonemes.  (Which  distributions  of  vowels  and  consonants  are  possible?) 

2.  Now  for  the  general  case.  Let  A  be  the  set  of  all  n-phoneme  words,  and  let  Ak  be  the 
set of all n-phoneme words with  exactly k  consonants.  Express  |A|  in  terms of  |Ak |  for 
all  possible  k . 

3.  Now  let’s ﬁnd  |Ak |  for an arbitrary k .  For  simplicity’s  sake,  assume Hawaiian has only 
one  consonant  and  only  one  vowel.  Find  a  bijection  between Ak  and  a  set  of  arbitrary 
sequences  of  0  and  1  of  length  p.  What  is  p? 

4.  Using  this  bijection,  compute  |Ak |. 

5.  How would you change your expression for |Ak | to allow for 8 consonants and 25 vowels, 
not  just  one  of  each? 

1Counting  long  vowels  and  diphthongs.  For  this  problem,  treat  each  of  the  25  vowels  as  a  unique  single 
vowel.

6.  How  many  n-phoneme  words  are  there  in  Hawaiian?  (You  don’t  have  to  ﬁnd  a  closed 
form  for  your  expression.)

Appendix:  Basic  Counting  Notions 
Rule  1  (Bijection  Rule).  If  there  exists  a  bijection  f  : A → B ,  then  |A| = |B |. 
Rule 2  (Generalized Pigeonhole Principle).  If  |X | > k · |Y |,  then  for every  function f  : X  →
Y  there  exist  k + 1  diﬀerent  elements  of  X  that  are  mapped  to  the  same  element  of  Y .

“If more than n pigeons are assigned to n holes, then there must exist two pigeons 
assigned  to  the  same  hole.” 

A k-to-1  function  maps exactly k elements of the domain to every element of the range. 
For  example,  the  function mapping  each  ear  to  its  owner  is  2-to-1: 

�  person  A 
ear  1 
�� �

ear  2 
����

ear  3 �

ear  4

ear  5

ear  6 � 

person  C 

person  B 

Rule  3  (Division  Rule).  If  f  : A → B  is  k-to-1,  then  |A| = k · |B |. 

Rule  4  (Product  Rule).  If  P1 , P2 , . . . Pn  are  sets,  then: 
|P1  × P2  × · · · × Pn | =  |P1 | · |P2 | · · · |Pn | 

Rule  5  (Generalized  Product  Rule).  Let  S  be  a  set  of  length-k  sequences.  If  there  are: 

�  n1  possible  ﬁrst  entries, 

�  n2  possible  second  entries  for  each  ﬁrst  entry, 

�  n3  possible  third  entries  for  each  combination  of  ﬁrst  and  second  entries,  etc. 

then: 

|S | = n1  · n2  · n3  · · · nk 
� 
Rule  6  (Sum  Rule).  If  A1 , . . . , An  are  disjoint  sets,  then: 
n
|Ak |
k=1 

|A1  ∪ · · · ∪ An | =
