1  The  Tao  of  BOOKKEEPER 

In this problem, we seek enlightenment through contemplation of the word BOOKKEEP ER. 

1.  In  how many  ways  can  you  arrange  the  letters  in  the  word  P OKE ? 

Solution.  There are 4! arrangements corresponding to the 4! permutations of the set 
{P, O, K, E }.

2.  In  how  many  ways  can  you  arrange  the  letters  in  the  word  BO1O2K ?  Observe  that 
we  have  subscripted  the  O’s  to make  them  distinct  symbols. 

Solution.  There are 4! arrangements corresponding to the 4! permutations of the set 
{B , O1 , O2 , K }. 
� 

3.  Suppose we map arrangements of the letters in BO1O2K  to arrangements of the letters 
in  BOOK  by  erasing  the  subscripts.  Indicate  with  arrows  how  the  arrangements  on 
the  left  are mapped  to  the  arrangements  on  the  right.

2  Pigeonhole  Principle 

3 

Solve the following problems using the pigeonhole principle.  For each problem, try to identify 
the  pigeons,  the  pigeonholes,  and  a  rule  assigning  each  pigeon  to  a  pigeonhole. 

1.  In  a  room  of  500  people,  there  exist  two  who  share  a  birthday. 

Solution.  The  pigeons  are  the  500  people.  The  pigeonholes  are  366  possible  birth­
days.  Map  each  person  to  his  or  her  own  birthday.  Since  there  500  people  and  366 
birthdays, some two people must have the same birthday by the Pigeonhole Principle. 
� 

2.  Suppose  that  each  of  the  115  students  in  6.042  sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID 
number.  Must  two  people  arrive  at  the  same  sum? 

Solution.  Yes.  The  students  are  the  pigeons,  the  possible  sums  are  the  pigeonholes, 
and we map each student to the sum of the digits in his or her MIT ID number.  Every 
· 
sum  is  in  the  range  from  0  to  9  9 = 81,  which  means  that  there  are  82  pigeonholes. 
Since there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, there must be two pigeons in the same 
� 
pigeonhole;  in  other  words,  there must  be  two  students  with  the  same  sum. 

3.  In  every  set  of  100  integers,  there  exist  two  whose  diﬀerence  is  a multiple  of  37. 

Solution.  The  pigeons  are  the  100  integers.  The  pigeonholes  are  the  numbers  0  to 
36.  Map  integer  k  to  k  rem  37.  Since  there  are  100  pigeons  and  only  37  pigeonholes, 
two  pigeons  must  go  in  the  same  pigeonhole.  This  means  k1  rem 37  =  k2  rem  37, 
which  implies  that  k1  − k2  is  a multiple  of  37.

3  More  Counting  Problems 

4 

Solve  the  following  counting  problems.  Deﬁne  an  appropriate  mapping  (bijective  or  k -to-1) 
between  a  set  whose  size  you  know  and  the  set  in  question. 

1.	 (IMPORTANT)  In  how  many  ways  can  k  elements  be  chosen  from  an  n-element 
set  {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}? 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  n-bit  sequences  with  k  ones  and  n − k  zeros. 
�  � 
The  sequence  (b1 , . . . , bn )  maps  to  the  subset  that  contains  xi  if  and  only  if  bi  =  1. 
� 
n
Therefore,  the  number  of  such  subsets  is  k  .	
2.  How many diﬀerent ways are there to select a dozen donuts if ﬁve varieties are available? 
(We  discussed  a  bijection  for  this  set  in  Recitation  15.  Now  use  that  bijection  to  give 
a  count.) 

Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  selections  of  a  dozen  donuts  to  16-bit  sequences 
with  exactly  4  ones.  In  particular,  suppose  that  the  varieties  are  glazed,  chocolate, 
lemon,  sugar,  and  Boston  creme.  Then  a  selection  of  g  glazed,  c  chocolate,  l  lemon, 
s  sugar,  and  b  Boston  creme maps  to  the  sequence: 
(g  0�s) 1 (c  0�s) 1 (l  0�s) 1 (s  0�s) 1 (b  0�s) 
� � 
Therefore,  the  number  of  selections  is  equal  to  the  number  of  16-bit  sequences  with 
exactly  4  ones,  which  is:

3.  An independent living group is hosting eight pre-frosh, aﬀectionately known as P1 , . . . , P8 
by  the  permanent  residents.  Each  pre-frosh  is  assigned  a  task:  2  must  wash  pots,  2 
must  clean  the  kitchen,  1  must  clean  the  bathrooms,  1  must  clean  the  common  area, 
and  2 must  serve  dinner.  In  how many  ways  can  P1 , . . . , P8  be  put  to  productive  use? 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  sequences  containing  two  P ’s,  two  K ’s,  a  B , a 
C , and two D’s.  In particular, the sequence (t1 , . . . , t8 ) corresponds to assigning Pi  to 
washing  pots  if  ti  = P ,  to  cleaning  the  kitchen  if  ti  = K ,  to  cleaning  the  bathrooms 
if  ti  = B ,  etc.  Therefore,  the  number  of  possible  assignments  is: 
8!

can  the  cards  in  this  double-size  deck  be  arranged? 

Solution.  The  number  of  sequences  of  the  104  cards  containing  2  of  each  card  is

104!/(2!)52 .

4  Fun  with  Phonology:  Hawaiian 

5 

The Hawaiian language is rich in vowels:  it contains 8 consonants and 25 vowels1 !  In addition, 
every word  in Hawaiian must  end  in  a  vowel  and must  not  contain  two  consonants  in  a  row. 
Let’s  assume  that  all  combinations  of  vowels  and  consonants  that  satisfy  these  constraints 
are  valid. 

We’d  like  to  know  how  many  n-phoneme  words  there  are  in  Hawaiian.  (A  phoneme  is 
either  a  single  vowel  or  a  single  consonant.  Assume  no  phoneme  can  be  both  a  vowel  and  a 
consonant.)  For  simplicity,  let’s  assume  n  is  even. 

1.  Before tackling the general problem, work out how many diﬀerent words there are with 
exactly  4  phonemes.  (Which  distributions  of  vowels  and  consonants  are  possible?) 

Solution.  Since  a  consonant  cannot  go  at  the  end  of  a  word  and  no  consonant  can 
directly follow another (or equivalently, each consonant must be followed by a vowel), 
we  have  these  possibilities  for  vowel/consonant  distributions: 

VVVV  VVCV  VCVV  CVVV  CVCV 

Since  these  are  mutually  exclusive,  we  can  ﬁnd  the  number  of  words  for  each  of  the 
ﬁve  types and  sum  them  together.  Using  the product  rule  for  each  type, we ﬁnd  that 
the  total  number  of  n-phoneme  words  is

254  + 252  8  25 + 25  8  252  + 8  253  + 8  25  8  25 = 254  + 3  253  8 + 82  252 
= 805625 

� 

2.  Now  for  the  general  case.  Let  A  be  the  set  of  all  n-phoneme  words,  and  let  Ak  be  the 
set of all n-phoneme words with  exactly k  consonants.  Express  |A|  in  terms of  |Ak |  for 
all  possible  k . 

Solution.  k  can  range  from  0  to  n/2  since  every  consonant  is  followed  by  a  vowel. 
Since  the  set  of  words  with  k  consonants  and  the  set  of  words  with  j  consonants 
k  are  disjoint,  we  can  use  the  sum  rule  to  compute  |A|:

1Counting  long  vowels  and  diphthongs.  For  this  problem,  treat  each  of  the  25  vowels  as  a  unique  single 
vowel.

3.  Now  let’s ﬁnd  |Ak |  for an arbitrary k .  For  simplicity’s  sake,  assume Hawaiian has only 
one  consonant  and  only  one  vowel.  Find  a  bijection  between Ak  and  a  set  of  arbitrary 
sequences  of  0  and  1  of  length  p.  What  is  p? 

Solution.  Since  every  consonant  must  be  followed  by  a  vowel,  we  can  group  each 
consonant  and  the  vowel  after  it  into  a  cluster.  If  there  are  k  consonants,  then  there 
are  k  clusters.  Since  there  are  no  further  constraints  on  the  distribution  of  these 
clusters,  we  can  map  each  cluster  to  0  and  each  remaining  vowel  to  1.  Since  the 
clustering  removes  k  vowels  from  consideration,  and  the  number  of  consonants  is 
equal  to  the number of clusters,  the  resulting  sequences of  0 and 1 have  length n − k . 
� 
4.  Using  this  bijection,  compute  |Ak |.

Solution.  The  number  of  sequences  of  k  0’s  and  n − 2k  1’s  is

5.  How would you change your expression for |Ak | to allow for 8 consonants and 25 vowels, 
not  just  one  of  each? 
� 
� 
Solution.  Each word  in Ak  is a sequence of V ’s and C ’s, where each V  can represent 
any  vowel  and  each  C  can  represent  any  consonant.  The  total  number  of  these

“If more than n pigeons are assigned to n holes, then there must exist two pigeons 
assigned  to  the  same  hole.” 

A k-to-1  function  maps exactly k elements of the domain to every element of the range.
