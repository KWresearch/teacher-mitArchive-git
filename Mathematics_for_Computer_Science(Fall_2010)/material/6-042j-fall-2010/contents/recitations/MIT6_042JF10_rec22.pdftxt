1  Properties  of  Variance 

In  this  problem we will  study  some  properties  of  the  variance  and  the  standard  deviation  of 
random  variables. 

a.	 Show  that  for  any  random  variable  R,  Var [R] = E [R2 ] − E2  [R]. 
b.  Show that for any random variable R and constants a and b, Var [aR + b] = a2 Var [R] . 
Conclude that the standard deviation of aR + b  is a times the standard deviation of R. 

c.	 Show  that  if  R1  and  R2  are  independent  random  variables,  then 

Var [R1  + R2 ] = Var [R1 ] + Var [R2 ] . 

d.  Give  an  example  of  random  variables  R1  and  R2  for  which 

Var [R1  + R2 ] = Var [R1 ] + Var [R2 ] . 
e.	 Compute  the  variance  and  standard  deviation  of  the  Binomial  distribution  Hn,p  with 
� 
parameters  n  and  p. 
n 
f.  Let’s say we have a random variable T  such that T  = 
=1 Tj , where all of the Tj ’s are 
mutually  independent  and  take  values  in  the  range  [0, 1].  Prove  that  Var(T)≤Ex(T).

We’ll  use  this  result  in  lecture  tomorrow.  Hint:  Upper  bound  Var [Tj ]  with  E [Tj ]  using 
the  deﬁnition  of  variance  in  part  (a)  and  the  rule  for  computing  the  expectation  of  a 
function  of  a  random  variable.
