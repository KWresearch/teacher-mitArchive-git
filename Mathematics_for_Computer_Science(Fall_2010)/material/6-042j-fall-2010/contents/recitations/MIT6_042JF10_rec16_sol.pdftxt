1  Combinatorial  Proof 

A  combinatorial  proof  is  an  argument  that  establishes  an  algebraic  fact  by  relying  on 
counting  principles.  Many  such  proofs  follow  the  same  basic  outline: 

1.  Deﬁne  a  set  S . 
2.  Show  that  |S | = n  by  counting  one  way. 
3.  Show  that  |S | = m  by  counting  another  way. 

4.  Conclude  that  n = m. 

Theorem. 

Consider  the  following  theorem: 
� � 
n �
�
�  k + i
k + n + 1 
= 
k + 1 
k
i=0 

We  can  prove  it  with  a  combinatorial  approach: 

Proof.  We  give  a  combinatorial  proof.  Let  S  be  the  set  of  all  binary  sequences with  exactly 
�
� 
n  zeroes  and  k + 1  ones. 
On  the  one  hand, we  know  from  a  previous  recitation  that  the  number  of  such  sequences 
n+1  . 
� 
�
is  equal  to  k+
k
�
� 
� 
On  the  other  hand,  the  number  of  zeroes  i  to  the  left  of  the  rightmost  one  ranges  from  0 
to  n.  For  a  ﬁxed  value  of  i,  there  are  k+i  possible  choices  for  the  sequence  of  bits  before 
k 
the  rightmost  one.  If  we  sum  over  all  possible  i,  we  ﬁnd  that  |S | = 
n
k+i
. 
i=0 
k 
Equating  these  two  expressions  for  |S |  proves  the  theorem.

2  Triangles 
Let T  = {X1 , . . . , Xt}  be  a  set whose  elements Xi  are  themselves  sets  such  that  each Xi  has 
size  3  and  is  ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n}.  We  call  the  elements  of  T  “triangles”.  Suppose  that  for  all 
“edges”  E  ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n}  with  |E | = 2  there  are  exactly  λ  triangles X  ∈ T  with  E  ⊆ X . 
For  example,  if we might  have  the  triangles  depicted  in  the  following  diagram, which  has 
λ = 2,  n = 4,  and  t = 4:

In  this  example,  each  edge  appears  in  exactly  two  of  the  following  triangles: 

{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}

Equating  these  two  expressions  for  |C |  proves  the  theorem.

3  Counting,  counting,  counting 

Learning  to  count  takes  practice!  Brieﬂy  justify  your  answers  to  the  following  questions. 
Not  every  problem  can  be  solved  with  a  cute  formula;  you  may  have  to  fall  back  on  case 
analysis,  explicit  enumeration,  or  ad  hoc  methods.  Do  as  many  problems  as  you  can  and 
save  the  rest  to  study  for Quiz  II. You may  leave  factorials  and  binomial  coeﬃcients  in  your 
answers.

1.  How many  diﬀerent  arrangements  are  there  of  the  letters  in  BAN AN A? 

Solution.  By  the  Bookkeeper  Rule,  there  are:

2.  How  many  diﬀerent  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0, 0)  to  point  (10, 20, 30)  if  every 
step  increments  one  coordinate  and  leaves  the  other  two  unchanged? 

Solution.  There  is a bijection between the set of all such paths and the set of strings 
containing  10  X’s,  20  Y’s,  and  30  Z’s.  In  particular,  we  obtain  a  path  by  working 
through  a  string  from  left  to  right.  An  X  corresponds  to  a  step  that  increments  the 
ﬁrst coordinate, a Y  increments the second coordinate, and a Z  increments the third. 
The  number  of  such  strings  is: 

60! 
10!  20!  30!

Therefore,  this  is  also  the  number  of  paths.

there are 4 ways to choose the doubly represented suit,  2  ways to choose two values 
from  this  suit,  and  133  ways  to  choose  values  for  cards  in  the  three  remaining  suits.

5.  There are 15 sidewalk squares  in a row.  Suppose that a ball  is thrown down the row so 
that  it  bounces  on  0,  1,  2,  or  3  distinct  sidewalk  squares.  How  many  diﬀerent  throws 
are  possible?  Two  throws  are  considered  to  be  equivalent  if  they  bounce  on  the  same 
squares  in  a  diﬀerent  order.

6.  In  how  many  diﬀerent  ways  can  the  numbers  shown  on  a  red  die,  a  green  die,  and  a 
blue  die  total  up  to  15?  Assume  that  these  are  ordinary,  6-sided  dice. 

Solution.  We  fall  back  on  explicit  enumeration.  Let  R,  G,  and  B  be  the  values 
shown  on  the  three  dice. 
R  = 1, B + G  = 14 
R  = 2, B + G  = 13 
R  = 3, B + G  = 12 
R  = 4, B + G  = 11 
R  = 5, B + G  = 10 
R  = 6, B + G  = 9

A  total  of  10  ways. 
Another approach (suggested by a student in recitation) begins by observing that the 
number  of ways  the  dice  can  sum  to  15  is  the  same  as  the  number  of  positive  integer 
solutions  to  the  equation 

x1  + x2  + x3  = 15 
such  that  xi  ≤  6.  In  general,  counting  solutions  with  inequality  constraints  on  the 
variables  involves  a  tedious  case  analysis,  but  in  this  case  there’s  a  trick  to  remove 
the  constraints:  let  yi  = 6 − xi .  Now  the  number  of  desired  xi  solutions  is  the  same 
as  the  number  of  nonnegative  integer  solutions  to 

(1) 
y1  + y2  + y3  = 3 
such  that  yi  ≤  5.  But  since  the  sum  of  the  yi ’s  must  be  three,  the  constraint  that 
yi  ≤  5  will  be  met  by  every  nonnegative  integer  solution  to  (1).  So  we  need  only 
� 
� 
count  the  number  of  nonnegative  integer  solutions  to  (1),  which  we  already  know  is 
the  same  as  the  number  of  binary  sequences  of  two  zeros  and  three  ones,  namely 
2 + 3

7.  In  how many ways  can  20  indistinguishable  pre-frosh  be  stored  in  four  diﬀerent  crates 
if  each  crate must  contain  an  even  number  of  pre-frosh? 

Solution.  There  is  a bijection  from  13-bit  strings with  exactly  3  ones.  In particular, 
the  string  0a10b10c10d  corresponds  to  to  storing  2a  prefrosh  in  the  ﬁrst  crate,  2b  in 
� � 
the  second,  2c  in  the  third,  and  2d  in  the  fourth.  Therefore,  the  number  of  ways  to 
store  the pre-frosh  is equal  to  the number of 13-bit strings with exactly 3 ones, which 
�
is  13  .

8.  How  many  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0)  to  (50, 50)  if  every  step  increments  one

coordinate  and  leaves  the  other  unchanged  and  there  are  impassable  boulders  sitting 
� �  � � 
at  points  (10, 10)  and  (20, 20)? 
� �
� � 
100
Solution.  We  use  inclusion-exclusion.  The  total  number  of  paths  is 
50  ,  but  we 
· 
� �  � � 
20 
80
must  subtract  oﬀ  the  obstructed  paths.  There  are  10 
40  paths  through  the  ﬁrst 
20

boulder,  since  there  are  10  paths  from  the  start  to  the  boulder  and  40  paths  from

60
the  boulder  to  the  ﬁnish.  Similarly,  there  are  20 
30  paths  through  the  second 
boulder.  However,  we  must  add  back  in  paths  going  through  both  boulders,  and

9.  In  how many  ways  can  the  180  students  in  6.042  be  divided  into  36  groups  of  5? 

Solution.  We  can  group  the  students  using  the  following  procedure:  line  up  the 
students in some order.  Group the ﬁrst ﬁve students, the sixth through tenth students, 
the  eleventh  through  ﬁfteenth  students,  and  so  on.  The  students  can  be  lined  up  in 
180!  ways.  However,  this  overcounts  by  a  factor  of  (5!)36 ,  since  the  students  within 
each  of  the  36  groups  can  be  ordered  in  5!  ways.  We  are  also  overcounting  by  an 
additional  factor  of  36!,  since  the  36  groups  can  be  ordered  in  36!  ways.  Thus,  the 
number  of  groupings  is

10.  In how many diﬀerent ways can 10 indistinguishable balls be placed in four distinguish­
able  boxes,  such  that  every  box  gets  1,  2,  3,  or  4  balls? 

Solution.  First,  we  might  as  well  put  1  ball  in  every  box.  Now  the  problem  is  to 
put  the  remaining  6  balls  into  4  boxes  so  that  no  box  gets  more  than  3  balls.  Now 
we  turn  to  case  analysis.  For  example,  we  could  put  3  balls  in  two  boxes  and  0  balls 
in  the  other  two  boxes.  There  are  4!/(2!  2!) = 6  ways  to  do  this.  All  cases  are  listed

the  remaining  steps  are  algebraic  simpliﬁcations. 

It  is  always  good  to  have more  than  one  way  to  solve  a  problem!
