Problems  for  Recitation  16 

1  Combinatorial  Proof 

A  combinatorial  proof  is  an  argument  that  establishes  an  algebraic  fact  by  relying  on 
counting  principles.  Many  such  proofs  follow  the  same  basic  outline: 

1.  Deﬁne  a  set  S . 
2.  Show  that  |S | = n  by  counting  one  way. 
3.  Show  that  |S | = m  by  counting  another  way. 

4.  Conclude  that  n = m. 

2  Triangles 
Let T  = {X1 , . . . , Xt}  be  a  set whose  elements Xi  are  themselves  sets  such  that  each Xi  has 
size  3  and  is  ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n}.  We  call  the  elements  of  T  “triangles”.  Suppose  that  for  all 
“edges”  E  ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n}  with  |E | = 2  there  are  exactly  λ  triangles X  ∈ T  with  E  ⊆ X . 
For  example,  if we might  have  the  triangles  depicted  in  the  following  diagram, which  has 
λ = 2,  n = 4,  and  t = 4: 

In  this  example,  each  edge  appears  in  exactly  two  of  the  following  triangles: 

{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 4}

3  Counting,  counting,  counting 

Learning  to  count  takes  practice!  Brieﬂy  justify  your  answers  to  the  following  questions. 
Not  every  problem  can  be  solved  with  a  cute  formula;  you  may  have  to  fall  back  on  case 
analysis,  explicit  enumeration,  or  ad  hoc  methods.  Do  as  many  problems  as  you  can  and 
save  the  rest  to  study  for Quiz  II. You may  leave  factorials  and  binomial  coeﬃcients  in  your 
answers. 

1.  How many  diﬀerent  arrangements  are  there  of  the  letters  in  BAN AN A? 

2.  How  many  diﬀerent  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0, 0)  to  point  (10, 20, 30)  if  every 
step  increments  one  coordinate  and  leaves  the  other  two  unchanged? 

3.  Find  the  number  of  5-card  hands  with  exactly  three  aces.

4.  Find  the  number  of  5-card  hands  in  which  every  suit  appears  at most  twice. 

5.  There are 15 sidewalk squares  in a row.  Suppose that a ball  is thrown down the row so 
that  it  bounces  on  0,  1,  2,  or  3  distinct  sidewalk  squares.  How  many  diﬀerent  throws 
are  possible?  Two  throws  are  considered  to  be  equivalent  if  they  bounce  on  the  same 
squares  in  a  diﬀerent  order. 

6.  In  how  many  diﬀerent  ways  can  the  numbers  shown  on  a  red  die,  a  green  die,  and  a 
blue  die  total  up  to  15?  Assume  that  these  are  ordinary,  6-sided  dice. 

7.  In  how many ways  can  20  indistinguishable  pre-frosh  be  stored  in  four  diﬀerent  crates 
if  each  crate must  contain  an  even  number  of  pre-frosh? 

8.  How  many  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0)  to  (50, 50)  if  every  step  increments  one 
coordinate  and  leaves  the  other  unchanged  and  there  are  impassable  boulders  sitting 
at  points  (10, 10)  and  (20, 20)? 

9.  In  how many  ways  can  the  180  students  in  6.042  be  divided  into  36  groups  of  5?

10.  In how many diﬀerent ways can 10 indistinguishable balls be placed in four distinguish­
able  boxes,  such  that  every  box  gets  1,  2,  3,  or  4  balls? 

11.  In  how  many  diﬀerent  ways  can  Blockbuster  arrange  64  copies  of  Cat  in  the  Hat,  96 
copies  of Matrix  Revolutions,  and  1  copy  of  Amelie  on  5  shelves? 

4  There’s  more  than  one  way... 
In the beginning of today’s recitation, we gave a combinatorial proof of the following theorem: 
� � 
n �
�
�  k + i
k + n + 1 
= 
k + 1 
k
i=0 

Theorem. 

We  can  also  prove  this  theorem  using  induction.  Give  such  a  proof.
