Problems  for  Recitation  12 

1  The  L-tower  problem 

Observe  the  structures  shown  in  Figure  1.  One  has  2  L-shapes,  the  other  5  L-shapes.  Con­
sider  a  tower with  k  L-shapes.  Assume  that  the  blocks  are  all  of  size  x × 1 where  x > 1.  As 
the  picture  indicates,  if  k  is  too  small  then  the  tower  falls  to  the  left.  On  the  other  hand,  if 
k  is  too  large  the  tower  would  fall  to  the  right.  Will  the  tower  be  stable  for  some  k?  Prove 
there  is  at  least  one  value  of  k  for  which  the  L-tower  is  stable.  Assume  that  a  structure  is 
stable  if  and  only  if  its  center  of  gravity  is  not  hanging  in  the  air  horizontally.  The  L-tower 
is  stable  if  and  only  if  each  of  its  subparts  is  stable.

2  Double  Sums 

2 

Sometimes  we  have  to  evaluate  sums  of  sums,  otherwise  known  as  double  summations.  It’s 
� � 
good  to  know  how  to  tame  these  beasts!  Here’s  an  example  of  a  double  summation: 
n
i
j 
i=1  j=1 

It  looks  ferocious...all those sharp teeth!  But actually,  this double summation  is  just a sheep 
in wolf ’s clothing:  to evaluate  it, we can  just evaluate the  inner sum,  replace  it with a closed 
form  we  already  know,  and  then  evaluate  the  outer  sum  which  no  longer  has  a  summation 
�  � 
� 
inside  it. 
(a + b) = 
a + 
b.) 

�  Evaluate  the  summation.  (Hint: 

Unfortunately,  not  all  summations  are  so  docile.  Fortunately,  we  have  ways  to  deal  with 
this.  There’s  a  special  trick  that  is  often  extremely  useful  for  sums,  and  that  is  to  exchange 
the  order  of  summation.  We’ll  go  through  an  example  here. 
� 
For  the  remainder  of  the  problem  we’ll  wrestle  with  the  sum  of  the  harmonic  numbers: 
n
Hk 
k=1 

At  ﬁrst  glance,  it  looks  like  just  a  single  summation,  but  do  not  be  deceived. 

�  First,  write  it  as  a  double  summation.

�  Now  try  to  gain  some  intuition  for  exactly  what  you’re  up  against  by  integrating  the 
summation  in  its  less  threatening  single-summation  form.  You may  use Hk  ≈  ln k . 

�  Finally,  we’ll  look  for  an  exact  answer.  If  we  think  about  the  pairs  (k , j )  over  which 
we are  summing,  they  form a  triangle  in  the  table below.  The values  in  the cells of  the 
table  correspond  to  the  terms  in  the  double  summation.  The  ﬁrst  two  rows  have  been 
ﬁlled  in  for  you.  Complete  the  remaining  three  rows  to  see  the  pattern.

�	 The  summation  above  is  summing  each  row  and  then  adding  the  row  sums.  But  we 
can  tame  this  beast  if,  instead,  we  ﬁrst  sum  the  columns  and  then  add  the  column 
sums.  Use  the  table  to  rewrite  the  double  summation.  The  inner  summation  should 
sum  over  k ,  and  the  outer  summation  should  sum  over  j . 

�  Now  simplify  the  summation  to  derive  a  closed  form  in  terms  of  n  and Hn .
