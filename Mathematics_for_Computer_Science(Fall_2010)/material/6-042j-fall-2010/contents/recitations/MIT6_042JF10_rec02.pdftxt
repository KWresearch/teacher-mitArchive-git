Problems  for  Recitation  2 

1  Problem:  A  Geometric  Sum 

Perhaps  you  encountered  this  classic  formula  in  school: 

1 − rn+1 
1 − r 
First use the well ordering principle, and then induction, to prove that this formula is correct 
for  all  real  values  r = 1.

1 + r + r  + r  + . . . + r  = 

Prepare  a  complete,  careful  solution.  You’l l  be  passing  your  proof  to  another  group  for 
“constructive  criticism”!

2  Problem:  Surveyevor 

2 

In  a  new  reality  TV  series  called  Surveyevor,  a  group  of  contestants  is  placed  on  a  small 
island.  Before  the  series  begins,  each  contestant  agrees  to  have  a  small  purple  or  red  tattoo, 
in  the  shape  of  an  eye,  applied  to  the  middle  of  his  or  her  forehead.  In  all,  there  are  p ≥  1 
purple  eyes  and  r  ≥  0  red  eyes.  However,  none  of  the  contestants  knows  the  color  of  his  or 
her  third  eye,  nor  how many  total  purple  and  red  eyes  there  are.  Furthermore,  there  are  no 
mirrors  and  no  one  is  allowed  to  discuss  the  tattoos  ever.  Therefore,  everyone  knows  the 
colors of  everyone  else’s  third  eye, but not  their own.  Good  thing, because a  contestant who 
learns  that he  or  she has  a purple  eye must  leave  the  island  at  the  end  of  the  show  that day, 
and  is  therefore  no  longer  eligible  to  win  the  �1 million  cash  prize  at  the  end  of  the  show! 

The  contestants  live  in  uneasy  ignorance  for  several  weeks.  As  time  goes  on,  however, 
most  of  them  lose  their  fear  of  being  exiled,  adapt  to  island  living,  and  even  make  friends 
with  one  another.  Things  are  going  quite  well  for  the  islanders,  but  as  you  might  suppose, 
the  television  audience  grows  bored,  and  the  show’s  ratings  plummet.  When  the  network 
threatens  to  cancel  the  series,  the  producer  decides  she  needs  to  do  something,  fast:  on  the 
next  show,  to  the  surprise of  the happy  islanders,  the producer herself appears and convenes 
a meeting.  Very  loudly, she proclaims, “I see that at  least one person here has a purple eye.” 
Assuming  that  all  the  contestants  are master  logicians,  what  happens? 

Use  induction  to  prove  that  your  conclusion  is  correct.  We  suggest  a  hypothesis  P (n)  that 
asserts  all  of  the  following  are  true  on  day  n: 

1.  If  p > n,  then 

2.  If  p = n,  then 

3.  If  p < n,  then 

(We  leave  the  task  of  ﬁlling  in  the  blanks  to  you.)
