The  Total  Probability  Law  is  a  handy  tool  for  breaking  down  the  computation  of  a 
probability  into  distinct  cases. 
� 
�  � 
� 
Theorem  1  (Total  Probability  Law).  Let  E  and  X  be  events.  Then 
Pr {E } = Pr {E  | X } · Pr {X } + Pr  E  | X 
· Pr  X 
provided  0 < Pr {X } < 1. 

� 
�  � 
� 
Proof.  Let’s  simplify  the  right  side. 
� 
· Pr  X  �
Pr {E  | X } · Pr {X } + Pr  E  | X 
Pr  E �∩ � 
Pr {E ∩ X } 
X 
� 
� 
Pr {X } + 
· 
= 
Pr {X }
Pr  X 
= Pr {E ∩ X } + Pr  E ∩ X 
= Pr {E } 

Pr � 
X � 
· 

The  ﬁrst  step  uses  the  deﬁnition  of  conditional  probability.  On  the  next-to-last  line,  we’re 
adding  the  probabilities  of  all  outcomes  in  E  and  X  to  the  probabilities  of  all  outcomes  in 
E  and not  in X .  Since  every  outcome  in E  is  either  in X  or not  in X ,  this  is  the  sum  of  the 
probabilities  of  all  outcomes  in  E ,  which  equals  Pr {E }  by  the  deﬁnition  of  the  probability 
of  an  event. 

The  theorem  generalizes  as  follows: 
Theorem  2.  Let  E  be  an  event  and  let  X1 , . . . , Xn  be  disjoint  events  whose  union  is  the 
� 
entire  sample  space.  Then

1  Nerditosis 

2 

There  is  a  rare  and  deadly  disease  called  Nerditosis  which  aﬄicts  about  1  person  in  1000. 
One  symptom  is  a  compulsion  to  refer  to  everything—  ﬁelds  of  study,  classes,  buildings, 
etc.—  using  numbers.  It’s  horrible.  As  victims  enter  their  ﬁnal,  downward  spiral,  they’re 
awarded  a  degree  from MIT.  Two  doctors  claim  that  they  can  diagnose  Nerditosis. 

1.  Doctor	 X  received  his  degree  from  Harvard  Medical  School.  He  practices  at  Mas­
sachusetts  General  Hospital  and  has  access  to  the  latest  scanners,  lab  tests,  and  re­
search.  Suppose  you  ask  Doctor X  whether  you  have  the  disease. 

�	 If  you  have  Nerditosis,  he  says  “yes”  with  probability  0.99. 
�	 If  you  don’t  have  it,  he  says  “no”  with  probability  0.97. 

Let D be the event that you have the disease, and let E  be the event that the diagnosis 
is  erroneous.  Use  the  Total  Probability  Law  to  compute  Pr {E },  the  probability  that 
Doctor X  makes  a mistake. 
� 
�  � 
� 
Solution.  By  the  Total  Probability  Law: 
Pr {E } = Pr {E  | D} · Pr {D} + Pr  E  | D 
· Pr  D 
·
· 
= 0.01  0.001 + 0.03  0.999
= 0.02998 

� 

2.  “Doctor”	 Y  received  his  genuine  degree  from  a  fully-accredited  university  for  �49.95 
via  a  special  internet  oﬀer.  He  knows  that Nerditosis  strikes  1  person  in  1000,  but  is  a 
little  shaky  on  how  to  interpret  this.  So  if  you  ask  him  whether  you  have  the  disease, 
he’ll  helpfully  say  “yes”  with  probability  1  in  1000  regardless  of  whether  you  actually 
do  or  not. 
Let D be the event that you have the disease, and let F  be the event that the diagnosis is 
faulty.  Use  the Total Probability Law  to  compute Pr {F },  the probability  that Doctor 
Y  made  a mistake. 
� 
�  � 
� 
Solution.  By  the  Total  Probability  Law: 
Pr {F } = Pr {F  | D} · Pr {D} + Pr  F  | D 
· Pr  D 
·	
· 
= 0.999  0.001 + 0.001  0.999
= 0.001998 

3.  Which  doctor  is more  reliable? 

Solution.  Doctor X  makes more  than  15  times  as many  errors  as  Doctor  Y .

2  Barglesnort 

A  Barglesnort makes  its  lair  in  one  of  three  caves:

1 ,  cave  2  with  probability  4
1 ,  and  cave 
The  Barglesnort  inhabits  cave  1  with  probability  2
3  with  probability  1
4 .  A  rabbit  subsequently  moves  into  one  of  the  two  unoccupied  caves, 
selected with  equal  probability.  With  probability  1
3 ,  the  rabbit  leaves  tracks  at  the  entrance 
to  its  cave.  (Barglesnorts  are much  too  clever  to  leave  tracks.)  What  is  the  probability  that 
the  Barglesnort  lives  in  cave  3,  given  that  there  are  no  tracks  in  front  of  cave  2? 
Use  a  tree  diagram  and  the  four-step method. 
Solution.  A tree diagram is given below.  Let B3  be the event that the Barglesnort inhabits 
� 
� 
cave  3,  and  let  T2  be  the  event  that  there  are  tracks  in  front  of  cave  2.  Taking  data  from 
�  Pr  B3  ∩ T2 
�
the  tree  diagram,  we  can  compute  the  desired  probability  as  follows:

3  Prisoners 

4 

There are three prisoners in a maximum-security prison for ﬁctional villains:  the Evil Wizard 
Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo-Foo.  The parole board has declared 
that  it  will  release  two  of  the  three,  chosen  uniformly  at  random,  but  has  not  yet  released 
their names.  Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures that he will be released to his home  in Mordor, where 
the  shadows  lie,  with  probability  2
3 . 
A  guard  oﬀers  to  tell  Sauron  the  name  of  one  of  the  other  prisoners who will  be  released 
(either  Voldemort  or  Foo-Foo).  However,  Sauron  declines  this  oﬀer.  He  reasons  that  if  the 
guard  says,  for  example,  “Little  Bunny  Foo-Foo  will  be  released”,  then  his  own  probability 
of  release will  drop  to  1
2 .  This  is  because  he will  then  know  that  either  he  or Voldemort will 
also  be  released,  and  these  two  events  are  equally  likely. 

Using  a  tree  diagram  and  the  four-step method,  either  prove  that  the Dark  Lord  Sauron 
has  reasoned  correctly  or  prove  that  he  is  wrong.  Assume  that  if  the  guard  has  a  choice  of 
naming  either  Voldemort  or  Foo-Foo  (because  both  are  to  be  released),  then  he  names  one 
of  the  two  uniformly  at  random. 

Solution.  Sauron  has  reasoned  incorrectly. 

We  can  explain  the  issue  in  terms  of  conditional  probability.  Let  S, F ,  and  ”F ”  be  the 
events: 

S  = Sauron  is  released, 
F  = Foo-Foo  is  released, 
”F ” = Guard  says  Foo-Foo  is  released. 

We  can  use  the  tree  diagram  below  to  analyze  the  outcomes  and  probabilities  we  should 
consider.  The  ﬁrst  split  in  the  tree  is  based  on  which  two  of  the  three  prisoners  are  to  be 
released,  and  the  second  is  based  on  what  the  guard  tells  Sauron.

From  the  diagram  we  can  see  that  Sauron  has  correctly  observed  that

Pr {S } = + =

And  Sauron  is  correct  in  reasoning  that  if  event  ”F ”  happens,  then  event  F  has  also 
happened.  And  he’s  correct  that  the  probability  of  his  release  given  F  shrinks  to  1/2. 
Namely,  from  the  diagram  we  have: 
1 
Pr {F } = + + =

So  he  worries  that  if  he  lets  ”F ”  happen,  then  his  probability  of  release  will  shrink  from 
2/3  to  Pr {S  | F } = 1/2. 
Sauron’s  confusion  is  not  realizing  that  the  events  F  and  ”F ”  are  diﬀerent,  as  the  tree 
makes  clear.  These  events  even  have  diﬀerent  probabilities: 
Pr {”F ”} =
=�
= Pr {F } .

Now  in  determining  his  probability  of  release,  Sauron  should  use  al l  the  information  avail­
able.  He  should  be  concerned  about  his  chances  given  that  the  Guard  says  Foo-Foo  is 
released, not merely given the weaker  fact that Foo-Foo  is released.  That  is, Sauron should 
care  about  Pr {S  | ”F ”},  not  Pr {S  | F }. 
We  can  see  from  the  diagram  that 
Pr {S ∩ ”F ”} 
Pr {”F ”} 

Pr {S  ”F ”} = 
| 

= Pr {S } .

1/3

So  Sauron’s  probability  of  release  is  not  changed  by  hearing  from  the  guard.
