1  The  Pulverizer 

We  saw  in  lecture  that  the  greatest  common  divisor  (GCD)  of  two  numbers  can  be  written 
as  a  linear  combination  of  them.1  That  is,  no  matter  which  pair  of  integers  a  and  b  we  are 
given,  there  is  always  a  pair  of  integer  coeﬃcients  s  and  t  such  that 

gcd(a, b) = sa + tb. 

However,  the  proof  was  nonconstructive :  it  didn’t  suggest  a  way  for  ﬁnding  such  s  and  t. 

That  job  is  tackled  by  a  mathematical  tool  that  dates  to  sixth-century  India,  where  it  was 
called  kuttak,  which  means  “The  Pulverizer”.  Today,  the  Pulverizer  is  more  commonly 
known  as  “the  extended  Euclidean  GCD  algorithm”,  but  that’s  lame.  We’re  sticking  with 
“Pulverizer”. 

Euclid’s  algorithm  for ﬁnding  the GCD  of  two numbers  relies  on  repeated  application  of  the 
equation: 

gcd(a, b) = gcd(b,  rem (a, b)) 

which was proved in lecture (see the notes “Number Theory I”). For example, we can compute 
the GCD  of  259  and  70  as  follows: 

gcd(259, 70)  =  gcd(70, 49) 
=  gcd(49, 21) 
=  gcd(21, 7) 
=  gcd(7, 0) 
= 7. 

since  rem (259, 70) = 49 
since  rem (70, 49) = 21 
since  rem (49, 21) = 7 
since  rem (21, 7) = 0 

The Pulverizer  goes  through  the  same  steps,  but  requires  some  extra bookkeeping  along  the 
way:  as  we  compute  gcd(a, b),  we  keep  track  of  how  to  write  each  of  the  remainders  (49, 
21,  and  7,  in  the  example)  as  a  linear  combination  of  a  and  b  (this  is  worthwhile,  because 
our  ob jective  is  to  write  the  last  nonzero  remainder,  which  is  the  GCD,  as  such  a  linear 

1 In fact, we proved that among all positive linear combinations of the numbers their GCD is the smallest.

49  =  259 − 3 · 70

=  −1 · 259 + 4 · 70 
7  =  49 − 2 · 21 
=  (259 − 3 · 70) − 2 · (−1 · 259 + 4 · 70)

We  began  by  initializing  two  variables,  x = a  and  y = b.  In  the  ﬁrst  two  columns  above, we 
carried  out Euclid’s  algorithm.  At  each  step, we  computed  rem (x, y), which  can  be written 
in  the  form  x − q y .  (Remember  that  the  Division  Algorithm  says  x = q y + r,  where  r  is
·
· 
the  remainder.  We get r = x − q y  by  rearranging  terms.)  Then we  replaced x and y  in  this 
· 
equation  with  equivalent  linear  combinations  of  a  and  b,  which  we  already  had  computed. 
After  simplifying,  we  were  left  with  a  linear  combination  of  a  and  b  that  was  equal  to  the 
remainder  as  desired.  The  ﬁnal  solution  is  boxed.

2  Problem:  The  Pulverizer! 

3 

There  is  a  pond.  Inside  the  pond  there  are  n  pebbles,  arranged  in  a  cycle.  A  frog  is  sitting 
on one of the pebbles.  Whenever he  jumps, he  lands exactly k  pebbles away  in the clockwise 
direction, where  0 < k < n.  The  frog’s meal,  a  delicious worm,  lies  on  the  pebble  right  next 
to  his,  in  the  clockwise  direction. 

(a)  Describe  a  situation  where  the  frog  can’t  reach  the  worm. 
Solution.  If  k  |  n  (say  k  =  3  and  n  =  6),  then  no  number  of  jumps  will  lead  the  frog  to 
� 
the  worm,  as  the  frog  will  be  returning  to  his  original  pebble  ad  inﬁnitum. 

(b)  In  a  situation  where  the  frog  can  actually  reach  the  worm,  explain  how  to  use  the 
Pulverizer  to  ﬁnd  how many  jumps  the  frog  will  need. 

Solution.  Suppose  the  frog  can  reach  the  worm.  When  he  actually  reaches  it,  he  has 
jumped a number of  times,  say  j ,  and he has  travelled around  the  cycle a number of  times, 
·
· 
call  it  c.  Then,  the  distance  that  the  frog  has  covered  is  both  j k  and  c n + 1,  so  that 

j k = cn + 1. 

But  this means  that  1  can  be  written  as  a  linear  combination  of  n  and  k : 
(−c)n + j k = 1. 

Since  1  is  positive,  we  conclude  that  it  is  a  positive  linear  combination  of  n  and  k .  And 
since  it  is  the  smallest  positive  integer,  we  also  conclude  that  it  is  the  smal lest  positive 
linear  combination  of  n  and  k .  But  we  have  proved  in  lecture  that  the  smallest  positive 
linear  combination  of  two  integers  is  their GCD.  So,  the GCD  of  n  and  k  is  1: 

gcd(n, k) = 1 
and  we  can  use  the  Pulverizer  to  ﬁnd −c  and  j . 

� 

(c) Compute  the number of  jumps  if n = 50 and k = 21.  Anything  strange?  Can you ﬁx  it? 

Solution.  We  go  through  the  steps  as  described  in  Section  1  (see  the  table  below)  to  get 
that 1 = 8  50 − 19  21, or 1 = −(−8)  50 + (−19)  21.  Hence,  c = −8  and  j  = −19, which 
·
· 
·
· 
makes  little  sense.  What  does  it mean  for  the  frog  to make −19  jumps? 
The  point  is  that  the  Pulverizer  is  guaranteed  to  give  us  the  integer  coeﬃcients  of  a  linear 
combination  that  equals  the GCD,  but  it  promises  nothing  about  the  signs  of  those  coeﬃ­
cients  (in  this  case we wanted  them  to be − and +).  To get  coeﬃcients of  the desired  sign, 
we  have  to  think more. 
One way  to ﬁx  it  is as explained  in  lecture.  That  is,  subtract 21  from 8 and add 50  to −19. 
Here  is  another  way:  We  know  1 = 8  50 − 19  21.  Or,  to  obtain  meaningful  signs  for  the 
·
· 
numbers,  19  21 =  8  50 − 1.  That  is,  after  19  jumps  the  frog  will  land  1  pebble  short  of 
·
·

8  full  cycles.  So,  he  will  be  right  next  to  his  original  pebble,  but  in  the  counter-clockwise 
direction.  Given  this,  how  can  he  reach  the  pebble  he  is  after?

Well,  if  he makes  19 more  jumps,  he  will  land  2  pebbles  away  from  his  original  position  in 
the counter-clockwise direction.  Another 19 jumps will lead him 3 pebbles away, and so on. 
After a  total of 49  sets of 19  jumps, he will be 49 pebbles away  from  its original position  in 
the  counter-clockwise  direction,  which  is  of  course  the  worm’s  pebble.  Then,  the  frog  will 
have made  49 ∗ 19 = 931  jumps. 
Here  is  the  table  produced  by  the  Pulverizer:

=  3 · 50 − 7 · 21

=  (−2 · 50 + 5 · 21) − 1 · (3 · 50 − 7 · 21) 
=  −5 · 50 + 12 · 21

3  Problem:  The  Fibonacci  numbers. 

5 

The  Fibonacci  numbers  are  deﬁned  as  follows: 

F0  = 0 

F1  = 1 

Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2 

(for  n ≥ 2). 

Give an  inductive proof  that  the Fibonacci numbers Fn  and Fn+1  are  relatively prime  for all 
n ≥ 0. 

Solution.  We  use  induction  on  n.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  Fn  and  Fn+1  are 
relatively  prime. 
Base  case:  P (0)  is  true  because  F0  = 0  and  F1  = 1  are  relatively  prime. 
Inductive  step:  We  show  that,  for  all  n  ≥  0,  P (n)  implies  P (n + 1).  So,  ﬁx  some  n  ≥  0 
and assume  that P (n)  is  true,  that  is, Fn  and Fn+1  are  relatively prime.  We will  show  that 
Fn+1  and  Fn+2  are  relatively  prime  as  well.  We  will  do  this  by  contradiction. 
Suppose Fn+1  and  Fn+2  are  not  relatively  prime.  Then  they  have  a  common  divisor  d > 1. 
But  then  d  also  divides  the  linear  combination  Fn+2  − Fn+1 ,  which  actually  equals  Fn . 
Hence,  d >  1  divides  both  Fn  and  Fn+1 .  Which  implies  Fn ,  Fn+1  are  not  relatively  prime, 
a  contradiction  to  the  inductive  hypothesis. 
Therefore,  Fn+1  and  Fn+2  are  relatively  prime.  That  is,  P (n + 1)  is  true. 
The  theorem  follows  by  induction.

Let N  be a number whose decimal expansion consists of 3n  identical digits.  Show by induction 
� 
� 
�� 
that  3n  | N .  For  example: 
32  | 777777777
32  = 9  digits 
Recall  that  3  divides  a  number  iﬀ  it  divides  the  sum  of  its  digits. 
Solution.  We  proceed  by  induction  on  n.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  3n  | N , where 
the  decimal  expansion  of N  consists  of  3n  identical  digits. 
Base  case.  P (0)  is  true  because  30  = 1  divides  every  number. 
Inductive  step.  Now we show that,  for all n ≥ 0, P (n)  implies P (n + 1).  Fix any n ≥ 0 and 
assume  P (n)  is  true.  Consider  a  number  whose  decimal  expansion  consists  of  3n+1  copies 
of  the  digit  a: 
� 
��

· 
1 000 . . . 001 000 . . . 001
= aaa . . . aaa
3n  digits 
3n  digits 
3n  digits 

Now 3n  divides  the ﬁrst  term by  the assumption P (n),  and 3 divides  the  second  term  since 
the  digits  sum  to  3.  Therefore,  the  whole  expression  is  divisible  by  3n+1 .  This  proves 
P (n + 1). 
By  the  principle  of  induction  P (n)  is  true  for  all  n ≥ 0.
