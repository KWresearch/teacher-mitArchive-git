Problems  for  Recitation  23 

Theorem  1.  Let  E1 , . . . , En  be  events,  and  let  X  be  the  number  of  these  events  that  occur. 
Then: 
Ex (X ) = Pr {E1} + Pr {E2} + . . . + Pr {En} 
Theorem  2  (Markov’s Inequality).  Let X  be  a nonnegative  random  variable.  If  c > 0,  then: 

Pr {X  ≥ c} ≤ 

Ex (X )
c 

Theorem  3  (Chebyshev’s  Inequality).  For  al l  x > 0  and  any  random  variable  R, 

Pr {|R − Ex (R) | ≥ x} ≤ 

Var [R]
x2 

Theorem  4  (Union  Bound).  For  events  E1 , . . . , En : 
Pr {E1  ∪ . . . ∪ En} ≤ Pr {E1} + . . . + Pr {En} 

Theorem  5  (“Murphy’s Law”).  If  events  E1 , . . . En  are  mutual ly  independent  and  X  is  the 
number  of  these  events  that  occur,  then: 
Pr {E1  ∪ . . . ∪ En} ≥ 1 − e− Ex(X ) 

Theorem  6  (Chernoﬀ  Bounds).  Let  E1 , . . . , En  be  a  col lection  of  mutual ly  independent 
events,  and  let  X  be  the  number  of  these  events  that  occur.  Then: 
Pr {X  ≥ c Ex (X )} ≤ e−(c ln c − c + 1) Ex (X )

1  Getting  Dressed

Sometimes  I  forget  a  few  items  when  I  leave  the  house  in  the morning. 
For  example,  here  are  probabilities  that  I  forget  various  pieces  of  footwear: 

left  sock 
right  sock 
left  shoe 
right  shoe 

0.2 
0.1 
0.1 
0.3 

a.	 Let X  be  the  number  of  these  that  I  forget.  What  is  Ex (X )? 

b.  Upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  one  or  more  items.  Make  no  independence 
assumptions. 

c.	 Use  the  Markov  Inequality  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  3  or  more 
items. 

d.  Now  suppose  that  I  forget  each  item  of  footwear  independently.  Use  Chebyshev’s 
Inequality  to  upper  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  two  or more  items.

e.	 Use  Theorem  5  to  lower  bound  the  probability  that  I  forget  one  or more  items. 

g.  I’m  supposed  to  remember  many  other  items,  of  course:	 clothing,  watch,  backpack, 
notebook,  pencil,  kleenex,  ID,  keys,  etc.  Let  X  be  the  total  number  of  items  I  re­
member.  Suppose  I  remember  items  mutually  independently  and  Ex (X )  =  36.  Use 
Chernoﬀ ’s  Bound  to  give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  I  remember  48  or 
more  items. 

h.  Give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  I  remember  108  or more  items.

2  A  Financial  Crisis 

4 

There  are  a  lot  of  foreign  words  here,  but  don’t  be  scared!  We  will  be  trying  to  understand 
why  the  subprime mortgage  collapse  happened! 
For  a more  complete  story  of  how  the  crisis  happened,  refer  to  section  19.5.3  of  the  text. 
The  following  is  a  set  of  vocabulary  that  we  will  be  using: 

�  A  loan  is  money  lent  to  a  borrower.  If  the  borrower  does  not  pay  on  the  loan,  the 
loan  is  said  to  be  in  default,  and  collateral  is  seized.  In  the  case  of  mortgage  loans, 
the  borrower’s  home  is  used  as  collateral. 

�  A  bond  is  a  collection  of  loans,  packaged  into  one  entity.  A  bond  can  be  divided  into 
tranches,  in  some  ordering, which  tell  us  how  to  assign  losses  from  defaults.  Suppose 
a  bond  contains  1000  loans,  and  is  divided  into  10  tranches  of  100  bonds  each.  Then, 
all  the  defaults  must  ﬁll  up  the  lowest  tranche  before  the  aﬀect  others.  For  example, 
suppose  150  defaults  happened.  Then,  the  ﬁrst  100  defaults would  occur  in  tranche  1, 
and  the  next  50  defaults  would  happen  in  tranche  2. 

�	 The  lowest  tranche  of  a  bond  is  called  the mezzanine  tranche. 

�  We  can  make  a  “super  bond”  of  tranches  called  a  collateralized  debt  obligation 
(CDO)  by  collecting  mezzanine  tranches  from  diﬀerent  bonds.  This  super  bond  can 
then be itself separated into tranches, which are again ordered to indicate how to assign 
losses. 

Armed  with  this  knowledge,  we  can  now  solve  problems  about  the  crisis! 

1.  Suppose  that  1000  loans make  up  a  bond,  and  the  fail  rate  is  5%  in  a  year.  Assuming 
mutual  independence,  give  an  upper  bound  for  the  probability  that  there  are  one  or 
more  failures  in  the  second-worst  tranche.  What  is  the  probability  that  there  are 
failures  in  the  best  Tranche? 

2.  Now,  do  not  assume  that  the  loans  are  independent.	 Give  an  upper  bound  for  the 
probability  that  there  are  one  or  more  failures  in  the  second  tranche.  What  is  an 
upper  bound  for  the  probability  that  the  entire  bond  defaults?  Show  that  it  is  a  tight 
bound.  (Hint:  Use Markov’s  theorem). 

3.  Given  this  setup  (and  assuming mutual  independence  between  the  loans),  what  is  the 
expected  failure  rate  in  the mezzanine  tranche? 

4.  We	 take  the  mezzanine  tranches  from  100  bonds  and  create  a  CDO.  What  is  the 
expected  number  of  underlying  failures  to  hit  the  CDO? 

5.  We  divide  this  CDO  into  10  tranches  of  1000  bonds  each.	 Assuming  mutual  inde­
pendence,  give  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  of  one  or  more  failures  in  the  best 
tranche.  The  third  tranche? 

6.  Repeat  the  previous  question  without  the  assumption  of mutual  independence.
