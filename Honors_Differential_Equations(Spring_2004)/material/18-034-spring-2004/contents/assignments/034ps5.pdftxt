18.034  PROBLEM  SET  5 

Due  date:  Friday,  April  2  in  lecture.  Late   work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding.

(1)(10   points)  Read  Spotlight  on   Approximating  Functions  on  pp  616–630.   Everybody  will  receive 
full  credit  for  this  problem.  
If  you  have  any  questions  about  the  material,  want   to  discuss  the  
material  further,  etc.,   please   come  and  talk  with   me  or   Edward   during  oﬃce  hours.  There  is  a 
serious  mistake   in  the  proof  of  Theorem  9,  p.  626  (which  is  easily  corrected  by  using  Theorem  13). 
Can  you  see  what  the   mistake  is?

(In  fact   the  Riemann  zeta   function   can  be  deﬁned  as  an   analytic  function  for  every  complex  number 
s  except  1,  but  certainly  not  by  the  series  above.)  The  values  of   ζ (s) are  of  importance   throughout 
mathematics,  and  one  of  the  most  famous  open  problems  in   mathematics  is  to  prove   that   every   root  
of  ζ (s) is  of  the   form  2  +  bi  for  some  real  number  b.

(c)(5   points  extra  credit)  Consider  the  Taylor  expansion  of  both  sides  of  the  equation  above.  Use 
this  to  ﬁnd  an   expression,  for  each   even  integer  2n  >  0,   of   the  value  ζ (2n)  in  terms  of   a  sequence 
of  numbers  that  satisﬁes  a   recursion  relation  you  can  write  down.  Compute   the  values  of  ζ (2),  ζ (4) 
and  ζ (6).  (Remark:  Of  course  there  is  great  freedom   in  the  sequence   of   numbers   to  use.  The  most
