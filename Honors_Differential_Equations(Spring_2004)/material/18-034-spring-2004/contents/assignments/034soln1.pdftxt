Problem  1(20   points)  The   logistic  model   for  a   ﬁsh  population  with   harvesting   (p.  17)   leads  to 
the  following  IVP: 
y �  =  ay  − cy2  − H, 
y(0)  =  y0 
Here  a  and  y0  are  positive  and  c  and  H  are   nonnegative.  The  IVP  is  deﬁned  on   the   interval  (0,  ∞). 
Also,  the  model  is   only  valid  as  long   as   y(t) ≥  0:   If  at  any  instant  t1  (greater   than  0)  y(t1 )  equals 
0,  then  the  population  is  extinct,  and   the  population   will  remain  extinct  for   all  t  ≥ t1 . 

(a)(10  points) The  equilibrium  solutions   are   the  solutions  of  the  ODE  (without  the  initial  condi­
tion)  for  which  y � (t) = 0  for  all  t.  Find  inequalities  among  a,  c,  and  H  that  determine  when  there 
will  be  2  equilibrium  solutions,  1  equilibrium  solution,  or  no  equilibrium  solutions. 
Solution:  The   equilibrium  solutions   are   the   constants   y  such  that  ay − cy −H  = 0;   the  normal  form  
2
is  −cy2  + ay  − H  =  0.  The  discriminant  of  this   quadratic   equation  is  (a)2  − 4(−c)(−H ) =  a2  − 4cH . 
⎧ ⎨  2,  both  c  = 0  and  a2  − 4cH  >  0

By  the  quadratic   formula,  the   number  of  solutions  is,

c  = 0  and  a2  − 4cH  = 0

1, 
either 
0, a2  − 4cH  <  0.  
(b)(10  points)  Suppose  that  both  a  and  c  are   positive.  What  is   the   maximum   value  of  H  for 
which  there  is  an  equilibrium  solution?   If  H  is   larger   than  this   value,  what  is  the   long­term  behavior 
of  any  solution  of  the  ODE? 
Solution:  By  part  (a),  the  maximum  value  of  H  is   H0  =  4c  .  If   H  >  H0 ,  then  y �  =  ay  − cy2  − H  is 
2a
negative  for  all   values  of  y .  Therefore   the   solution  is   everywhere   decreasing.

Therefore,  y �  is  at  most  −(H  −  2  ).  Denote  z (t) =  −(H  −  4c  )t  +  y0 .  Then  y �  − z �  is   at  most  0,

i.e.,  y  − z  is  nonincreasing.   Also   y(0)  − z (0)  =  0.  Therefore  y  − z  is   nonpositive.   So  y(t)  ≤  z (t). 
4c 
Therefore,  the   population  becomes  extinct  at  a  time,

t  ≤

In  fact  this  understates  the   truth  –  if   you  solve   the   separable  diﬀerential  equation  exactly  you 
will  ﬁnd  there  is   a  time  τ (a,  c,  H )  >  0  so  that,  independent  of  the  initial  value  y0 ,  the  population  
becomes  extinct  at  a  time   t  ≤ τ .

Problem  2(20  points)  After  a  change  of   variables,  the   logistic   equation  with  harvesting  reduces 
� 
to   the  following  IVP  (neglecting   the  extinction  issue), 
x�  =  −x2  +  K, 
x(0)  =  x0  >  0 
where  x  =  x(t) and  where   K  is  a  constant.  Suppose   that  K  =  b2  for  some   b >  0.  

(a)(10  points)  Formally  rewrite  the  ODE  as   f (x)dx  =  g(t)dt  and  integrate  to   ﬁnd  an  exact 
solution.  Express  your  answer  in  the  form  b  − x  =  h(t)  for  some  expresion  h(t).  Don’t  forget  the 
special  case  x0  =  b.

If  x0  =�

(b)(10  points) At  some  instant  t1 ,  the  value  of   x(t1 ) is  very  close  to  b.  At  that  instant,   the  value 
of  b  in  the  diﬀerential  equation  is  abruptly  increased  to  a  larger  value  b1 ,  and  x(t) gradually  moves  
from  the  value  b  to  the   value  b1 .  Assuming  b1  − b  is   small  compared  to   b,  approximately  how  much  
time  τ  elapses  before  the   diﬀerence  b1  − x(t1  +  τ ) is   one  half  of  the  initial  diﬀerence  b1  − b? 
Solution:  To  simplify  the  problem,   change   coordinates  in  t  so   that  t1  =  0.  Because  the   ODE  is 
autonomous,  this   doesn’t  change  the   ODE  (this   will  be   the  key  to  analyzing  solutions  of  autonomous 
� 
� 
ODEs  later  on).  Let  x0  =  x(t1 ).  Then  the   solution  of  the  IVP  with  b1  has   the  form,  
1
(b1  − x(t))  = (b1  − x0 )e−2b1 t 
(1  − α1 ) +  α1e−2b1 t

where  α1  =

By  hypothesis,  α  ≈  0.  Therefore  the  third   factor   in   the  solution  is  approximately  1,  and  the 
solution  of  the   IVP  is   approximately  a  decreasing  exponential, 
(b1  − x(t))  ≈ (b1  − x0 )e−2b1 t  . 

So  the  half­life  is

(c)(0   points  –   not  to  be   written  up/handed   in).  Critical  ecosystem   double   whammy.  Interpret 
your  answer  from  (b).  In  particular,  if  the  parameters  a,  c  and  H  are   near   the  critical   value  for 
extinction,  does  the  system   respond  more  quickly  or  less  quickly  to  a  decrease   in  H  than  if  the 
parameters  are   far   from  the   critical  value?

Solution:  This  part  was  not  to  be   handed  in.  The  “solution”  is  only  given  for   fun.  The   change  of 
� y  −  2 
variables  necessary  to  put  the   ODE  in   standard  form  is, 
x  =  c
a 
,
2  − cH .  
b  = 
a

So  if  a,  c  and  H  are  near  the  critical  value,  then  b  is   near   0.   Decreasing  H  while  holding  a  and  c 
ﬁxed  increases  b  to  a  new   value  b1 .  By  (b),   the  half­life,  or  “reaction  time”,  of   the   system  to  this 
change  is  proportional  to 

1

≈ 
b 
b1 
So  when  b  is  small,  the  reaction  time  is  large.   This  is  the  “double   whammy”:  not  only  is  the 
population  close   to  the   critical   value   of   extinction  (so   a   natural  disaster,  etc.  could  easily  drive  the 
population  to   extinction),  but  also   a  positive  change   in  the  environment  (for   instance,  a   government 
ban  on  ﬁshing  in  a  certain  area)  takes  a  long   time  to   have  a   positive  impact  on  the   population.

Problem  3(5  points)  Exercise   14,  p.  49. 
Solution:  It  is  easier  to  spot  the  integrating  factor  without  putting  the  ODE  in  normal  form. For 
any  ODE  of  the   form,  
ty �  +  ay  =  q(t),   t  ≥ 0, 
an  integrating  factor  is  clearly   u(t) =  ta−1  , 
(ta y)�  =  ta−1  q(t).

The  qualitative  behavior  as  t  → ∞  is  the  same  for   all  solutions:  the  graph  of   y(t) converges  to 
the  graph  of  the   steady­state  solution,   1 t2 .  In   particular   it  diverges  to  ∞  as   t2  .

As  above,  the   integrating  factor  is  easier  to  “eyeball”  than   to  deduce  formally.  Multiplying  both 
sides  of  the  equation   by   sin  t  gives, 
(sin  t)y �  +  (cos  t)y  = 2(sin  t)(cos  t), y(3π/4)  = 2. 

This  is  the   same  as, 

(sin(t)y)�  = (sin(t)2 )� , y(3π/4)  = 2. 
Antidiﬀerentiating,   the   general  solution  is,  
sin(t)y  =  sin(t)2  +  C.  
Solving  the  initial   condition,  C  =  −3.  So  the   solution  of  the  IVP  is, 
y(t) =  sin(t) − 3 csc(t). 

Because  sin(t) → 0  like  t  as  t  → 0+  ,  y(t) diverges  to  −∞  like  −1  as   t
