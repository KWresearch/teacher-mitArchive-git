Due  date:  Friday,  April  2  in  lecture.  Late   work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal  
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding. 
(1)(10  points)  Read  Spotlight  on   Approximating  Functions  on  pp  616–630.   Everybody  will  receive 
full  credit  for  this  problem.  
If  you  have  any  questions  about  the  material,  want   to  discuss  the 
material  further,  etc.,   please   come  and  talk  with   me  or   Edward   during  oﬃce  hours.  There   is   a 
serious  mistake   in  the  proof  of  Theorem  9,  p.  626  (which  is  easily  corrected  by  using  Theorem   13). 
Can  you  see  what  the   mistake  is? 
Remark:  This  was  not  to  be  turned  in.   There  is  a  typo   in  Theorem  9  –  all  instances  of  C0  should  be 
C1 .  A  more  serious  mistake  is   that  it  is  only  proved  that  the  Fourier  series  of   f  converges  uniformly 
to   a   continuous   function,  but  it  is  not  proved  that  this  continuous  function  is  f .  In  Theorem  13  it 
is  proved  that  the   Fourier  series  converges  pointwise  to  f ,  which  ﬁnishes  the  proof  that  the  Fourier 
series  converges  uniformly   to  f .

(In  fact   the  Riemann  zeta   function   can  be  deﬁned  as  an   analytic  function  for  every  complex  number 
s  except  1,  but  certainly  not  by  the  series  above.)  The  values  of   ζ (s) are  of  importance   throughout 
mathematics,  and  one  of  the  most  famous  open  problems  in   mathematics  is  to  prove   that   every  root 
of  ζ (s) is  of  the   form  +  bi  for  some   real   number  b.

It   is  worth  remarking  that  the  series  above  converges  uniformly  for   all  u.  Indeed  the   tail   of  the 
series  is  less  than  or  equal  to   the  tail  of  the  series   for   u  =  0,   which  is  the  tail  of   the   convergent  series  
∞ 1/n2  .  The   right­hand­side,  however,  is  only  deﬁned   for   u  =�
0.  However,   the  singularity  at 
n=1 
u  = 0   is  a  removable  singularity.  The   continuous  extension  of   the  right­hand­side  is  a  function  that  
is  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable   for  all   u. 
(c)(5  points  extra  credit)  Consider  the  Taylor  expansion  of  both  sides  of  the  equation  above.  Use 
this  to  ﬁnd  an  expression,  for  each   even  integer  2n   >  0,   of   the  value  ζ (2n)  in  terms  of   a  sequence 
of  numbers  that  satisﬁes  a   recursion  relation  you  can  write  down.  Compute   the  values  of  ζ (2),  ζ (4) 
and  ζ (6).  (Remark:  Of  course  there  is  great  freedom  in  the  sequence  of   numbers   to  use.  The  most  
common  choice  is  to  express   ζ (2n) in  terms  of   the  Bernoulli  numbers,   Bn ,  which  are  deﬁned  by  the

Solution:  The   basic   idea  is  to  compute   the  Taylor  expansion  of   the  continuous  extension  of  the

We  would  like   to  interchange  the   sums  in  this  last  series.  This   is justiﬁed  if  the   series   is  absolutely 
convergent,  i.e.,  if  the   series   of   absolute  values  is   convergent.  Let  |u| < 1.  Then  the  series  of  absolute

Solution:  The  solution   is  more   readable  if   we  use   variable  names  for  the  constants.  Denote  by   m 
the  mass  of  the  spring,  m  = 1   kg.   Denote  by  k  the  spring  constant,  k  = 1.01  N  . Denote   by  b  the 
m 
damping  constant,   b  = 0.2  s
2  .  And  denote   by  F0  the  amplitude  of  the  square  wave  driving  force, 
N 
i.e.,  F0  = 1   N. 
Denote  by  x(t) the   position  of  the  spring  at  time   t.  The  diﬀerential   equation  describing   the  motion 
is, 
mx�� (t) +  bx� (t) +  kx(t) =  f (t).  
Because  f (t) is  periodic   of  period   2π ,  in  the   steady  state  x(t) will   be  a  twice  diﬀerentiable,   periodic 
function  of  period  2π .  Therefore  the   Fourier  exponential  series  of  x(t)  will  converge   to  x(t)  (with 
respect  to   the  interval [−π , π ]). 
The  normalized  Fourier  exponential  functions  on [−π , π ] are  φn (t) =  √

The  near  resonant  term  will  be   either  n  = 0  or  the  value   of  n  such that  un  is   nearest  to  uc . 
For  the  constants  in  our  particular   problem,

So  the  near  resonant  term  will  be  the   one  for  which   un  is  closest  to  1,  i.e.   n  =  0.   The  near   resonant
