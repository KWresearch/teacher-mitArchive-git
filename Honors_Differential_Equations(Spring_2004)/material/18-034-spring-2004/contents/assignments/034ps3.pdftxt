18.034  PROBLEM  SET  3 

Due  date:  Friday,  March  5  in  lecture.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only with  a   medical  note   or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding. 
Each  of  the  following  problems  is  from  the  textbook.  The  point  value  of   the   problem  is   next  to  the 
problem.  In  Problem  36  from  p.  175,   please   give  an  accurate  plot.  If   you  choose  to  do  this  by  hand, 
that  is  ﬁne,  but  plot  the   whole   interval [−2,   0]   with  a   step size  of  0.1.  If  you  choose  to  use  Matlab, 
there  will  be  a  handout  online   giving  step­by­step   instructions  how  to   plot  functions.
