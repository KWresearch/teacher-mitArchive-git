Solution:  The   characteristic  polynomial   is,  
z  2  +  2z   +  65.  
The  discriminant  of  this   quadratic   polynomial  is, 
22  − 4 × 65  =  −4 × 64  =  −(16)2  . 
Therefore  the   roots  are   the   complex   conjugates,

(2)(5  points)  p.   185,  Problem  32

Solution:  By  deﬁnition  of   the   derivative  of  a  complex­valued   function,

y � (t) =  u� (t) +  iv � (t), 
y �� (t)  =  u�� (t) +  iv �� (t) 
Since  a  and  b  are  real  numbers,   the  expression  y ��  +  ay �  +  by  equals,  
(u�� (t) +  iv �� (t))  +  (au� (t) +  iav � (t))  +  (bu(t) +  ibv(t))  = 
(u�� (t) +  au� (t) +  bu(t))  +  i(v �� (t) +  av � (t) +  bv(t)).  
A  complex­valued  function  equals  0  iﬀ   both   the  real  part  and  the  imaginary  part   equal  0.  Therefore 
y(t) is  a  solution  of  the   ODE  iﬀ   both  u(t) and  v(t) are  solutions   of  the  ODE.  In  particular,  e(α+iβ )t 
is  a  solution  of  the   ODE  iﬀ  both  u(t) =  eαt  cos(β t) and  v(t) =  eαt  sin(β t) are   solutions   of  the  ODE. 
If  e(α+iβ )t  is  a  solution  of  the  ODE,   then  eαt  cos(β t)  and  eαt  sin(β t)  are  solutions  of  the   ODE.  By 
linearity,  also 
e(α−iβ )t  = 1 × (e αt  cos(β t))  +  (−i)(e αt  sin(β t)),  

is  a   solution  of  the  ODE.

Solution:  The   characteristic  polynomial  equals, 
2 z  − 3z  +  2  = (z  − 2)(z  − 1). 
Therefore  the  general  solution  of  the  homogeneous  ODE  is, 
yh (t) =  C1e t  +  C2e . 
2t 
Also,  neither   0  nor   −1  are  roots  of  the  characteristic   polynomial.  Therefore  we  are  in  “Case  I”  of

the  method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients.

First  consider  a  particular  solution  of  the  ODE, 

a  − 3ya  +  2ya  = 8t .

By  the  method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  we  guess  that  the  solution  is  a  quadratic   polynomial 
with  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  i.e.,  

ya (t) =  a2 t2  +  a1 t  +  a0 . 

This  leads  to  the  table,

Next  consider   a  particular  solution  of  the  ODE,

� +  2yb  =  12e−t  . 
yb
By  the  method  of   undetermined  coeﬃcients,  we  guess  that  the  solution  is  of  the   form, 
yb (t) =  b0e−t  . 

Substituting  this   in  gives,  

b0 (−1)2 e−t  − 3b0 (−1)e−t  +  2b0e−t  = 12e−t  , 
i.e.  6b0  =  12.  The   solution  is  b0  = 2,  i.e.,  

The  derivative   is,  

yb (t) = 2e−t  . 
So  the  general   solution  of  the  inhomogeneous  ODE  is,

Solution:  The  characteristic   polynomial  is, 
p(z ) =  z  2  +  2z   +  1  = (z  +  1)2  .

Therefore  there  is   1   real  repeated  root  z  =  −1.  The  general  solution  of   the   homogeneous  ODE  is,

yg (t) =  C0e−t  +  C1 te−t  .

The  diﬀerential  equation  is  p(D)y  =  e−t  .  We  guess  that  the   particular  solution  is  of   the  form  
yd (t) =  e−tg(t) where  g(t)  is  a   polynomial.  By  the  exponential  shift  rule,  
p(D)[e−t g(t)]  =  e−t p(D   − 1)g(t) =  e−tD2 g(t). 
Thus  yd (t)  is  a  solution  iﬀ   D2g(t) =  1.  We  guess   that  g(t) =  a2 t2  for  some  constant  a2  and  plug  in 
to  get  2a2  =  1.  The  solution  is  a2  =  2 .  Therefore  the   general  real­valued  solution   of   the   ODE  is,

Since  0  is  not  a  root  of  the   characteristic  polynomial,  we  guess  that  the  particular   solution  is  a  linear 
polynomial  with  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  i.e.,  
ya (t) =  a1 t  +  a0 .

The  derivative  of  yg (t) is   given  by,

Solution:  Of  course  the   interval   of  deﬁnition   of  this  ODE  is  (0,  +∞).  Let  λ  be   a  complex  number 
and  consider  the   function, 

y(t) =  tλ  :=  e

Plugging  into  the  Euler  ODE  gives, 
λ(λ − 1)e λ ln(t)  +  pλeλ ln(t)  +  qe λ ln(t)  = (λ2  +  (p − 1)λ +  q)e
λ ln(t)
. 
Therefore  y(t) is  a   solution  of   the  ODE  iﬀ  λ  is   a  root  of  the  quadratic  polynomial, 
Q(z ) =  z  2  +  (p − 1)z  +  q .

If  Q(z ) has  2  distinct  real  roots  r1  and  r2 ,  then  2  solutions  of  the   ODE  are  y1 (t) =  tr1  and  y2 (t) =  tr2 . 
The  Wronskian  of  this  solution  pair  is, 
W [y1 , y2 ](t) =  tr1 (r2 tr2−1 ) − (r1 tr1−1 )tr2  = (r2  − r1 )tr1+r2−1  = (r2  − r1 )t−p 
Because  r2  − r1  = 0  and  because  t−p  = 0  for  t  >  0,   the   Wronskian  is  everywhere  nonzero.  Therefore 
(y1 (t), y2 (t))  is  a  basic  solution  set. 
Next  suppose  that  Q(z ) has  two  complex  conjugate  roots,  
λ =  α ± iβ .  
± 
By  Exercise  32,  p.  185,  the   real   and  imaginary  parts  of  the  complex­valued  solution  eλ+  ln(t)  give 
real­valued  solutions  of  the   ODE.  These  are,  
u(t)  =  eα ln(t)  cos(β ln(t))  = 
eα ln(t)  sin(β ln(t))  = 
v(t)  = 

tα  cos(β ln(t)) 
tα  sin(β ln(t)). 

The  derivatives   are, 
u� (t)  =  αtα−1  cos(β ln(t))  +  tα (− sin(β ln(t))β 1 )  = 
v � (t)  =  αtα−1  sin(β ln(t))  +   tα (+ cos(β ln(t))β 1 
t 
t  )  = 
The  Wronskian  of  this  solution  pair  is, 
tα  cos(β ln(t))tα−1 (α sin(β ln(t))  + β cos(β ln(t)))  − tα−1 (α cos(β ln(t))  − β sin(β ln(t)))tα  sin(β ln(t)). 
Simplifying, 

tα−1 (α cos(β ln(t))  − β sin(β ln(t)))
tα−1 (α sin(β ln(t))  +  β cos(β ln(t))) 

W [u,  v ](t) =  β t2α−1 (cos2 (β ln(t))  +  sin2 (β ln(t)))  =  β t2α−1  =  β t−p 
By  hypothesis,   β  =�
0.  And  for  t  >   0,  t−p  =  0.  So  the  Wronskian  is   everywhere  nonzero.  Therefore 
(u(t), v(t))  is  a  basic  solution  set.

Solution,  (a):  Let  L  denote  the  2nd  order  linear  diﬀerential   operator,

L[y ] = (D2  +  a(t)D +  b(t))y .

For  any solution  of  the   homogeneous  ODE, 
−y �� (t) =  a(t)y � (t) +  b(t)y(t).  

Therefore,

Observe  that  this   is  everywhere  nonzero.   Let  u(t)  is  a  solution  of  L[u]   =  0.   Thus  u(t)  and   w(t) 
are  functions  that  have   already  been  speciﬁed  (the  following  equation  is   not  an  equation  for   u(t)  or 
w(t)).  Let   v(t) be  a  solution  of   the  ﬁrst­order,  linear  inhomogeneous  equation, 
u(t)y �  − u(t)y  =  w(t).  
Assume  that  v �� (t) exists   and  is   continuous.  
By  hypothesis,  the  Wronskian  W [u,  v ](t) equals  w(t).  In  particular,  W [u,  v ](t) satisﬁes  the  ﬁrst­order 
ODE, 
W [u,  v ]� (t) =  w � (t) =  −a(t)w(t) =  −a(t)W [u,   v ](t). 
Reversing  the   computations  of  (a),  this   leads  to   the  equation, 
u(t)v �� (t) +  (−u�� (t))v(t) =  W � (t) =  −a(t)W (t) =  −a(t)u(t)v � (t) +  a(t)u� (t)v(t).  
By  hypothesis, 

−u�� (t) =  a(t)u� (t) +  b(t)u(t). 
Substituting  this   into  the  equation   above  gives, 
u(t)v �� (t) +  a(t)u� (t)v(t) +  b(t)u(t)v(t) =  −a(t)u(t)v � (t) +  a(t)u� (t)v(t).  
Canceling   a(t)u� (t)v(t)  from  each  side   of   the  equation  and  bringing  all   terms  to  the   left  side   of  the 
equation, 
u(t)(v �� (t) +  a(t)v � (t) +  b(t)v(t))  = 0. 
Because  u(t)  is  not  identically  zero,  on  an  open  dense  subset  of  the  interval, 
v �� (t) +  a(t)v � (t) +  b(t)v(t) = 0. 
A  continuous  function  that  is  0  on  an  open   dense  subset  of  an  interval  is  0  on  the   entire  interval.  
Therefore  v(t)  is  a  solution  of  L[v ]  =  0.  Moreover  the  Wronskian  W [u,  v ](t) =  w(t)  is  everywhere 
nonzero.  Therefore  (u(t),  v(t))  is  a  basic  solution  pair  of  the  2nd   order  linear  ODE  L[y ] = 0.

By  the  method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  the  solution  has  the  form  v(t) =  a2 t2  +  a1 t  +  a0  for 
some  choice  of  a2 ,  a1 ,  a0 .  Plugging  in  gives  the  equation,  
(−a2 )t2  +  (2a2  − a1 )t  +  (a1  − a0 ) =  −t . 
2
The  solution  is  a2  = 1,  a1  = 2,  a0  = 2,  i.e., 
v(t) =  t2  +  2t  +  2. 
Therefore  a  basic  solution  set  is  (e ,   t2  +  2t  +  2)  with  Wronskian  W (t) =  −t2e .

It  turns  out   that  for  any  constant  coeﬃcient  linear  diﬀerential  operator,   the   Green’s  kernel   is, 
K (t,  s) =  k(t  − s) 
for  some  continuously  diﬀerentiable  function   k(u).  In  particular,  for   D2  +  1,   a   basic  solution  set  is 
(y1 ,  y2 ) =   (cos(t),  sin(t)).  The  Wronskian   is  W [y1 ,  y2 ](t) = 1.  So  the  Green’s   kernel  is,  
K (t,  s) =  cos(s) sin(t) − cos(t) sin(s) =  sin(t  − s).

So  a  particular  solution  of  (D2  +  1)y  =  f (t) is,  
t 
t0 
This  formula  will  reappear  in  the   unit  on  the  Laplace  transform. 
The  equation  (D2  − t2  )y  = 0  is  an  Euler   ODE  for  p  = 0,   q  =  −2.   The  associated  quadratic   equation

is, 
Q(z ) =  z  − z  − 2  = (z  − 2)(z  +  1).

By  Exercise  6,  p.  221,  a  basic  solution   set  is  (t−1 ,  t2 ).  The  Wronskian  is  3.  So  the  Green’s  kernel  is,

(t3  − s 3 ).
(s−1 t − t−1 s 2 ) =
K (t,  s) =

Observe   that  this  is  not  of  the   form  k(t  − s)  for  any  function  k(u).
