Due  date:  Friday,  February  13  in  lecture.   Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note 
or  for  another  Institute­approved  reason.   You  are   strongly  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but   the 
ﬁnal  write­up  should  be   entirely  your  own  and  based   on  your  own  understanding.

Problem  1(20   points)  The   logistic  model   for  a   ﬁsh  population  with   harvesting   (p.  17)   leads  to 
the  following  IVP: 
y �  =  ay  − cy2  − H, 
y(0)  =  y0 
Here  a  and  y0  are  positive  and  c  and  H  are   nonnegative.  The  IVP  is  deﬁned  on   the   interval  (0,  ∞). 
Also,  the  model  is   only  valid  as  long   as   y(t) ≥  0:   If  at  any  instant  t1  (greater   than  0)  y(t1 )  equals 
0,  then  the  population  is  extinct,  and   the  population   will  remain  extinct  for   all  t  ≥ t1 . 

(a)(10  points) The  equilibrium  solutions   are   the  solutions  of  the  ODE  (without  the  initial  condi­
tion)  for  which  y � (t) = 0  for  all  t.  Find  inequalities  among  a,  c,  and  H  that  determine  when  there 
will  be  2  equilibrium  solutions,  1  equilibrium  solution,  or  no  equilibrium  solutions. 

(b)(10  points)  Suppose  that  both  a  and  c  are   positive.  What  is   the   maximum   value  of  H  for 
which  there  is  an  equilibrium  solution?   If  H  is   larger   than  this   value,  what  is  the   long­term  behavior 
of  any  solution  of  the  ODE?

Problem  2(20  points)  After  a  change  of   variables,  the  logistic  equation  with  harvesting  reduces 
to  the  following  IVP  (neglecting  the  extinction  issue), 
x�  =  −x2  +  K,  
x(0)  =  x0  >  0 
where  x  =  x(t) and  where  K  is  a  constant.  Suppose   that  K  =  b2  for  some  b >  0. 

(a)(10  points)  Formally  rewrite   the  ODE  as  f (x)dx  =  g(t)dt  and  integrate  to  ﬁnd  an  exact 
solution.  Express  your  answer  in  the  form   b  − x  =  h(t)  for  some  expresion   h(t).   Don’t  forget  the 
special  case  x0  =  b. 

(b)(10  points) At  some   instant  t1 ,  the  value  of  x(t1 ) is  very  close   to  b.   At  that  instant,  the  value 
of  b  in  the  diﬀerential  equation  is  abruptly  increased   to  a  larger  value   b1 ,  and  x(t) gradually  moves 
from  the  value  b  to  the   value  b1 .  Assuming   b1  − b  is  small  compared  to  b,  approximately  how  much 
time  τ  elapses  before  the  diﬀerence  b1  − x(t1  +  τ ) is   one  half   of  the  initial  diﬀerence  b1  − b? 

(c)(0   points  –   not  to  be   written  up/handed   in).  Critical  ecosystem   double   whammy.  Interpret 
your  answer  from  (b).  In  particular,  if   the  parameters  a,  c  and  H  are   near   the  critical   value  for 
extinction,  does  the   system  respond  more  quickly  or   less  quickly  to  a  decrease  in  H  than  if  the 
parameters  are  far  from  the  critical  value?
