Due  date:  Friday,  February  20  in   lecture.   Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with   a  medical  note  or 
for  another  Institute­approved  reason.  You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the 
ﬁnal  write­up  should  be   entirely  your  own  and  based   on  your  own  understanding. 
Problem  1(25  points) The  Implicit  Function  Theorem,  Part   1.  In  this  problem   you  will  apply  the 
Contraction  Mapping  Fixed  Point  Theorem  to  prove  the  following  theorem.  
Theorem  1.  Let  (x1 , ..., xn , y)  denote   coordinates   on  Rn+1 .  Let  U  be  an  open  region  in  Rn+1 .  Let 
∂ f 
f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  be  a  continuous  function  on  U  such  that  the  partial  derivative  ∂ y  is  deﬁned  and  
=�
continuous on   U .  Let  p = (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  be  a  point   in   U  such  that   ∂ f 
∂ y (p)
0.
There  exist   numbers  a1  > 0, . . . , an  > 0,  b > 0  such  that   the  multi­interval, 
I = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ]
× · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ] × 
[y − b, y +  b],
is  contained  in   U ,  and  there  exists  a  continuous  function  y(x1 , . . . , xn )  deﬁned  on   the  closed  multi­
interval, 
J  = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ],  
whose  graph  lies  in  I  such  that  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn ))  = 0,  i.e.,  the  function  f  is  0  on  the   graph 
of  y(x1 , . . . , xn ). 

f (x1 , . . . , xn , y). 

∂ f  
Denote  m =  ∂ y (p).  The  trick   is   to  consider   the   function,

g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) =  y − 
m 
For  a  continuous  function  y(x1 , . . . , xn ),  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  = 0  iﬀ  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) =  y .  This  suggest 
trying  to  ﬁnd  y as  a  ﬁxed  point  of  the   mapping, 
T (y) =  z ,  z (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn )). 
But  ﬁrst  we  need  to   know  on  what  complete  metric   space  this  mapping  is  deﬁned,  and  we   have  to 
guarantee  that  T  is  a  u­contraction  mapping  for  some  0   < u < 1. 
To   ease  notation,  for  each   sequence   of   numbers  a1  >  0, . . . , an  >  0,  denote  by  J (a1 , . . . , an )  the 
multi­interval, 
J (a1 , . . . , an ) = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ].  
Similarly,  for  each  sequence   of  numbers  a1  >  0, . . . , an  >  0,  b  >  0,  denote  by  I (a1 , . . . , an , b)  the 
multi­interval, 
× · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ] × 
[y − b, y +  b].
I (a1 , . . . , an , b) = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ]

maps  I (a1 , . . . , an , b) back into   itself.   Therefore,   if  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) is  a   continuous  function  on  J (a1 , . . . , an ) 
whose  graph  lies  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b),  then  also  the  graph  of

(c)(5   points)  Deﬁne   B  to  be  the   metric  space  of  continuous  functions  y  on  J (a1 , . . . , an )  whose 
graph  lies  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b) that  satisfy  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) =  y .  The  metric  is  deﬁned  by, 
d(y1 , y2 ) =  max  y1 (t) − y2 (t) .

Use  the  natural   multi­dimensional  generalization   of   the  Cauchy  Test  to  prove  that  this   is   a  complete 
metric  space.   You  need  not  prove  the  multi­dimensional   generalization!  Simply  write  down   a   careful 
statement  of  what  you  believe  the  generalization   says,  and  apply  this  appropriately  to  deduce   that 
B  is  a  complete  metric   space. 
(d)(5  points)  Prove   that  for  each continuous   function  y in   B ,  the  following  function  z  is   also  in   B , 
z (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn )). 
Therefore  the   mapping  T (y) =  z  is  a  mapping  from  B  into  itself. 
(e)(5   points)  Prove  that  T  is  a   u­contraction  mapping.  Use  the  Contraction  Mapping   Fixed  Point 
Theorem  to  deduce  that  there   exists  a  continuous   function  y in   B  such  that  T (y) =  y .  Deduce  that 
f  is  0   on  the  graph  of  y .  (Hint:  Use   the  mean  value  theorem.) 
Problem  2(5   points)  The  Implicit  Function  Theorem,  Part  II.  The  notation  is  from  Problem  1. 
Let  (x1 , . . . , xn , y) be   a  point  in   I  such  that  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  =  0.   Prove  that  y  =  y(x1 , . . . , xn ). 
Therefore  the  points   in  I  where   f  is  0  are  exactly  the  points   on  the   graph  of   y(x1 , . . . , xn ).  (Hint: 
If  y =�
y(x1 , . . . , xn ),  use  the  mean  value  theorem   to  ﬁnd a  number  y1  between  y  and  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) 
where  the  derivative   ∂ g  
∂ y (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 )  gives  a  contradiction.)
