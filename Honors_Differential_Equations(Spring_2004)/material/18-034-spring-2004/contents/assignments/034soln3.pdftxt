18.034  PROBLEM  SET  3 

Due  date:  Friday,  March  5  in  lecture.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only with  a   medical  note   or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding. 
Each  of  the  following  problems  is  from  the  textbook.  The  point  value  of   the   problem  is   next  to  the 
problem.  In  Problem  36  from  p.  175,  please  give  an  accurate  plot.  If   you  choose   to  do  this   by  hand, 
that   is  ﬁne,  but  plot  the  whole   interval [−2,   0]   with  a   step size  of  0.1.  If  you  choose  to  use  Matlab, 
there  will  be  a  handout  online   giving  step­by­step   instructions  how  to   plot  functions.

Solution:  First  there   is  a  preliminary  estimate  that  is  useful.  Let  �  be   a  real   number  such  that 
0  <  � <  1.  Deﬁne   η  = 1 − �.  If  u ≤ η ,  then  1 + u 2  ≥ �2  and  1/ 1 + u 2  ≤ 1/�2 .  Applying  the  Mean

Because  the  exponential  function  is   monotone,  this  gives  the  following  estimate, 
1 − exp(n u /�2 ) ≤ exp(0)  − exp(n  log(1  +  u) − nu) ≤ 1 − exp(−n u /�2 ),  if   |u| <  η .

Simplifying   this  expression  and  multiplying   both  sides  by  enu  gives  the  estimate, 
e nu (1  − e n|u|2 /�2 ) ≤ (1  +  u)n  − e  ≤ e nu (1  − e−n|u|2 /�2 ),  if   u <  η .

Now  consider   the  Euler’s  Method  approximation  for  the  linear,  ﬁrst­order,  constant  coeﬃcient   IVP, 
y �  =  ay , 
y(t0 ) =  y0 
with  step  size  h.  Consider  only  h  such  that  |a|h  <  η .  Denote  yn  =  y(t0  +  nh) for   n  any  integer. 
Euler’s  Method  gives  the   following  recursion  relation, 
yn+1  =  yn  +  hayn  = (1 +  ah)yn . 
The  solution  of   this   recursion   relation  is, 
yn  = (1 +  ah)n y0 , 
and  the  piecewise  linear  Euler  Solution  is, 
yh (t) = (1  +  ah)n y0 (1  +  ah(t  − nh)), 
for  t  ∈ [t0  +  nh,  t0  +  (n  +  1)h].  The  true   solution  is  readily  computed   as 
y�(t) =  y0e
a(t−t0 )
. 
yh (t) − yh (tn ) +  yh (tn ) − y�(tn ) +  y�(tn ) − y�(t)
yh (t) − y�(t)
Let  t  be  any  real  number,   and  let  n  be  the  largest  integer  such  that  t0  +  nh  ≤ t.  Then,

The  ﬁrst  and  third  terms  clearly  become  arbitrarily  small   as  h  →  0  (so  that  also  tn  − t  →  0).   For 
the  middle  term,   setting  u  =  ah,  the  preliminary  estimate  gives,

As  h →  0,  the  quantity  nh  coverges  to  t − t0 .  But  the   quantity  nh2  converges  to  0.  Therefore,  as 
h → 0.  Therefore,  as   h → 0,  the  Euler  Solutions   yh (t) converge  to  the  true   solution  y�(t). 
h →  0,  both  bounds  converge   to  0.   By  the  Squeezing   Lemma,  the  middle  term  converges  to  0  as

Solution:  Let [a, b] be  an  interval   with  b  >  a.  Let  n  >  0  be  an  integer.   For  k  = 0, . . . 2n,  deﬁne 
tk  =  a +  b−a  k .  The   subintervals [tk , tk+1 ] give  a  partition  of [a, b] into  2n equally­spaced  subintervals

f (t)dt ≈  b−a  f (t0 ) +

+  2f (t2n−2 ) +  4f (t2n−1 ) +  f (t2n )] .

Observe  that  for  each  k = 0, . . . , n − 1,  Simpson’s   Rule  applied  to  the  subinterval [t2k , t2k+2 ] broken 
� 
into   2   equally  spaced  subintervals  gives, 
b − a [f (t2k ) +  4f (t2k+1 ) +  f (t2k+2 )] .

f (t)dt ≈

Forming  the  sum  of  each  of  these  approximations  for  k = 0, . . . , n − 1  gives  the  usual  Simpson’s  rule.

Apply  RK4   to  the   ODE, 
y �  =  f (t), 
y(t0 ) =  y0 
with [a, b]  broken  into  n  equal   subintervals   of  length  b−a  ,  i.e.  
n 
[t0 , t2 ], [t2 , t4 ], . . . , [t2k , t2k+2 ], . . . , [t2n−2 , t2n ]. 
The  claim  is  the   RK4  approximation  for  y(b)  equals   the   Simpson’s   Rule  approximation.  By  the 
last   paragraph,  the  Simpson’s  Rule  approximation   is  the  sum  of  the  Simpson’s  Rule   approximation 
for  each  subinterval [t2k , t2k+2 ].  So  it  suﬃces  to  prove  for  each  k  = 0, . . . , n − 1,  that  the  RK4 
approximation  for  yk+1  − yk  equals  the  Simpson’s  Rule   approximation  for [t2k , t2k+2 ]  broken  into  2 
equal  subintervals. 
By  deﬁnition,  the   RK4  approximation  gives, 
yn+1  − yn  =  b − a (f (t2n ) +  2f (t2n+1 ) +  2f (t2n+1 ) +  f (t2n+2 )).

Simplifying,  this  is  precisely  the   Simpson’s  Rule  approximation, 
b − a (f (t2n ) +  4f (t2n+1 ) +  f (t2n+2 )).

Solution:  One  solution   is   clearly  the  constant  function   y(t)  =  0.  By  the  uniqueness  theorem, 
Theorem  3.1.1,   this   is   the  unique   solution.

Solution:  The  characteristic  polynomial  is  r2  +  r − 2.  Every  root  that  is   a  rational  number   is  ±  a 
fraction  whose  numerator  is  a   divisor  of   the  constant  coeﬃcient,  and  whose  denominator   is   a  divisor 
of  the  leading  coeﬃcient.  In  this  case,  ±1  or  ±2.   Plugging  in,  r  = 1  and  r  =  −2  are  roots   (this  also 
follows  from  the   quadratic   formula).  Therefore,  by  Theorem  3.2.1,  the  general  solution  is, 
C1e−2t  +  C2e .

Solution:  The   characteristic   polynomial  of   the  normal  form  is  r2  +  6r .  By  the  same  method  as  
9
above,  −3  is  a  repeated  root  of  the   characteristic  polynomial.  Therefore,  by  Theorem  3.2.1,  the 
general  solution  is,  
C1e−3t  +  C2 te−3t  .

Solution:  The  characteristic   polynomial  is  r2  −  4r  +  4.  By  the  same  method   as   above,  2  is   a 
repeated  root.   Therefore,  by  Theorem  3.2.1,  the  general  solution  is, 
C1e 2t  +  C2 te .

It  is  equivalent,  but  slightly  more  useful,  to  write  this  as, 
� 
D1e2(t+1)  +  D2 (t  +  1)e
2(t+1)
=  2 
D1 
2D1  +  D2  =  0 
So  D1  = 2   and  D2  =  −4.  The  solution  of   the  IVP  is, 
y(t) = 2e2(t+1)  − 4(t  +  1)e2(t+1) 
=  −2e2e2t  − 4e2 te2t  . 

The  initial  conditions  give,

Solution:  Of  course  Abel’s  Theorem  proves  this.  Most  likely  the  exercise   is  asking  for   the   formula 
for  the  Wronskian  of  each  solution  pair.  In   the  ﬁrst  case,  
y2 (t)  =  e
y1 (t)  =  e
r2 t
r1 t
, 
�
�
r1er1 t  , y2 (t)  = 
y1 (t)  = 
r2 t
r2e

. 

So  the  Wronskian  is, 

W [y1 , y2 ](t) = (r2  − r1 )e
(r1+r2 )t
. 
Because  r2  =�
r1 ,  the  coeﬃcient  is  nonzero.  And   the   exponential  function   is   always  nonzero.  So 
W [y1 , y2 ](t) is  always  nonzero.  
In  the  second  case, 

. 

So  the  Wronskian  is, 

y1 (t)  =  e
y2 (t)  = 
ter1 t 
r1 t
,

y1 (t)  = 
r1er1 t  , y2 (t)  = (r1 t  +  1)e
r1 t
W [y1 , y2 ](t) = (r1 t  +  1)e 2r1 t  − r1 te2r1 t  =  e
2r1 t
. 
Because  the  exponential  is  always  nonzero,  W [y1 , y2 ](t) is   always  nonzero.  
In  the  ﬁnal  case, 
y1 (t)  =  eαt  cos(β t),
y2 (t)  =  eαt  sin(β t) 
y1 (t)  =  αeαt  cos(β t) − β eαt  sin(β t), y2 (t)  =  αeαt  sin(β t) +  β eαt  cos(β t) 
�
�
So  the  Wronskian  is, 
W [y1 , y2 ](t) =  e2αt (α sin(β t) cos(β t) +  β cos(β t)2 ) − e2αt (α cos(β t) sin(β t) − β sin(β t)2 ) 
=  β e2αt (cos(β t)2  +  sin(β t)2 ) =  β e2αt  . 
0.  And  the  exponential   is  always  nonzero.  Therefore  W [y1 , y2 ](t)  is  always


By  hypothesis,  β  =�
nonzero.

Solution:  The  characteristic  polynomial  is  r2  − r  − 2.  The  roots   are   −1  and  2.  Therefore,   by 
Theroem  3.2.1,   the   general  solution  is, 

C1e−t  +  C2e .  
2t

Therefore,  two  solutions  are,  

The  derivatives  are,  

y1 (t)  =  e−t  +  e ,  
2t
y2 (t)  =  e−t  − e .

y1 (t)  =  −e−t  +  2e ,  
�
2t
y2 (t)  =  −e−t  − 2e .

2t

Therefore  the  Wronskian   is, 
W [y1 , y2 ](t) =  −(e−2t  +  3e t  +  2e 4t ) − (−e−2t  +  3e  − 2e 4t ) =  −6e .

Because  the  exponential   is  always  nonzero,  W [y1 , y2 ](t)  is  always   nonzero.  Therefore   (y1 , y2 )  is   a 
basic  solution  pair  (one   of  inﬁnitely   many!). 
(9)(10   points)  p.  176,   Problem  48 
Solution,  (a):   By  Theorem  3.2.1,  the  general  solution   is,  
� 
C1e αt  cos(β t) +  C2e αt  sin(β t). 
2  .  Deﬁne   φ  to  be  the  unique  angle,  −π <  φ   ≤  π  such  that  tan(φ) =  C2/C1 .
Deﬁne  A  =  C 2  +  C2
1 
Then, 

C1  =  A cos(φ), 
C2  =  A sin(φ). 

By  the  angle   addition  formulas, 

y(t) =  C1eαt  cos(β t) +  C2eαt  sin(β t) 
=  Aeαt (cos(β t) cos(φ) +  sin(β t) sin(φ)) 
=  Aeαt  cos(β t  − φ).  
Of  course  every  nonzero  solution  occurs  for   a   unique  A  >  0  and  a  unique  −π <  φ  ≤ π .  On  the  other 
hand,  it  is  straightforward  to  check  for  every  real  number  A  (positive,  negative  or  zero)  and  every 
angle  φ,  Aeαt  cos(β t  − φ) is  a  solution. 
(b).  Deﬁne  the  period  to  be  T  =  β  .  Then  for  the  general   solution   y(t) above  and  for  every  integer 
2π
n, 
y(t  +  nT ) =  Aeα(t+nT   )  cos(β t  +  2nπ  − φ) =  e
αnT 
Similarly,  for  every  integer  n, 
y(t  +  (n  +  1/2)T ) =  Aeα(t+(n+1/2)T )  cos(β t  +  2nπ  +  π  − φ) =  −e 
α(n+1/2)T   y(t).
Therefore  if  y1 (t)  and  y2 (t)  are   two  particular  solutions  such   that  y1 (t0 ) =  y2 (t0 ),  then  for  every 
integer  n, 

y(t).  

y1 (t0  +  nT ) =  y2 (t0  +  nT ), y1 (t0  +  (n  +  1/2)T ) =  y2 (t0  +  (n  +  1/2)T ). 
Therefore  the  nodes  are  equally   spaced  at  intervals  of  1 T  = .
