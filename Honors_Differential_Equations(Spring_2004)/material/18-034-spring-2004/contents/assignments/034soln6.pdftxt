18.034  SOLUTIONS  TO   PROBLEM  SET   6 

Due  date:  Friday,  April  9  in  lecture.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or   for  
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the   ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and  based   on   your   own  understanding. 
Each  of  the  following  problems  is  from  the  textbook.  The  point  value  of   the   problem  is   next  to  the 
problem.

Solution:  The  problem  is  to  solve   the   IVP, ⎧⎨ ⎩

y ��  − 2y �  +  2y  = 0, 
y(0)  = 0, 
y � (0)  = 1, 
Denote  Y  (s) =  L[y(t)].  Then  L[y � (t)]  =  sY  (s) − y(0)  =  sY  (s).   And  L[y �� (t)]   =  s2Y  (s) − (y � (0)  + 
sy(0))  =  s2Y  (s) − 1.  This  leads  to  the  equation, 
2(s  − 2s  +  2)Y  (s) − 1  = [y ��  − 2y �  +  2y ] = 0.

By  Item  (11)  on  the   Laplace   transform  table  of   the  back cover,  
L−1 [1/(s 2  +  1)]  =  sin(t).

By  Item  (26)  on  the  table, 

L−1 [F (s  − a)]  =  e 
atf (t).

Therefore, 

L−1 [1/((s  − 1)2  +  1)]  =  e t  sin(t).  
So  the  solution  of   the  IVP  is  y(t) =  et  sin(t).

Solution:  The  inverse  Laplace   transform  of  1/s2  is  t.  The   inverse   Laplace   transform  of   1/(s  +  1)

is  e−t .  Therefore   the   inverse   Laplace   transform  is,

the  anti­derivative   above,   and  it  also  gives  e−t  +  t  − 1.

⎧⎨ y ��  +  2y �  +  y  =  δ(t  − u),

We  want   to   ﬁnd  the   solution  yδ (t,  u) of  the  IVP, 
⎩

y(0)  = 0,

y � (0)  = 0

⎧⎨ ⎩

There  are  two  ways  to   make   sense  of  this.  The  ﬁrst  way  is  to  follow  the  derivation  from  Lecture  22.

This  says  that,  yδ (t,  u) = 0  for  t  <  u,  and  for   t  > u,  it  is  the  solution  of  the   IVP, 

y ��  +  2y �  +  y  = 0, 
y(u) = 0, 
y � (u) = 1 
The  characteristic  polynomial   is  z 2  + 2z  + 1  = (z  + 1)2 .  Therefore  the  general  solution  is  e−(t−u) ,  (t − 
u)e−(t−u) ,  i.e., 
y(t) =  Ae−(t−u)  +  B (t  − u)e−(t−u) , 
� 
for  some  choice   of  the   constants  A  and  B .  The  initial  conditions  give   the   linear   relations, 
+  0 · B  =  0,  
1 · A 
−1 · A  +  1 · B  =  1,  
�

In  other  words,  A  =  0  an  B  =  1.  So  the  solution  is, 
t  ≥ u, 
yδ (t,  u) = (t  − u)e−(t−u) ,
0,  
t  < u 
The  other  method  is  to  apply  the   Laplace  operator.  Denote  Yu (s) =  L[yδ (t,  u)].   Then  L[y � ] =  sYu (s)
and  L[y �� ] =  s2Yu (s).  On  the  other  hand,   L[δ(t  − u)]   =  e−su .  This  gives  the  relation,

The  inverse  Laplace   transform  of   1/(s   + 1)2  is  k(t) =  te−t .  Therefore  by  Item  (28)  from  the  Laplace

(s  − 1)2  e−su  =  S (t  − u)k(t  − u) =  S (t  − u)(t  − u)e−(t−u) .

This  agrees  with  the  computation  above.

Solution:  By  the  last exercise,  for  this  ODE  the   function  yδ (t,  u) is  k(t − u),  where   k(t) =  S (t)te−t  .

Of  course  this   is   correct,  but  it  is  much   less  direct  than   simply  computing  the   Laplace   transform.

Denote  Y  (s) =  L[y(t)].  Then  L[y � (t)]  =  sY  (s) −  y0 ,  and  L[y �� (t)]  =  s2Y  (s) −  v0  −  sy0 .  Also, 
L[sin(t)]  = 1/(s2  +  1).  This   gives   the   equation,

(s 2  + 2s  + 1)Y  (s) − (y0s  + (v0  + 2y0 ))  =

In  particular,  if  y0  =  v0  =  0,   this  agrees   with  the   computation  of   the  convolution  above.  (Moral: 
Whenever  possible,  use   the   Laplace   transform  to  avoid  explicitly  computing  the  convolution).

Solution:  Of  course  any  such  function  really  should  be  interpreted   as  “do   some  manipulation   which 
is  rigorous  if  δ  is  a  usual  function,  and  which   leads  to  the  formal  expression  given”.  In   this  vein,  let  
f (t) be  a  locally  bounded,  piecewise  continuous  function  on  (−∞,  ∞),  and  let  g(t) be  a  continuous

function  of  compact  support.  Let  a  >  0  be   a  real  number.  Then,   using  the  change  of   variables

Therefore,  as  generalized  functions,  δ(at) = (1/|a|)δ(t).  (This   can  be  made  completely  rigorous   by 
expressing   δ(t)  as  a  limit  of  honest  functions   fh  as   h  → 0  and  the  applying  the   equations  above  to 
fh .  However,  this  requires  a  topology   on  the  space   of  generalized   functions,   which  I  don’t  want  to 
describe.) 
Another  derivation  involves  the   Laplace  transform.   First  of   all,  clearly  δ(t) is  an  even  function.  So 
for  a  <  0,  δ(at) =   δ(|a|t).  So   it  suﬃces  to   consider  the   case  that  a  >  0. 
For  any  function  y(t)  of  exponential   order,  denoting   Y  (s) =  L[y(t)],  we  have  the  identity,  
1 
L[y(at)]  =  Y  (s/a).

This  was  one  of   the   identities  from  lecture. For  the   Dirac   delta  function,  L[δ(t)]   =  1.  Therefore,

This  again  gives  the   identity,  δ(at) = (1/|a|)δ(t).
