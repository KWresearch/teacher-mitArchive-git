Due  date:  Friday,  February  20  in   lecture.   Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with   a  medical  note  or 
for  another  Institute­approved  reason.  You  are  strongly  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the 
ﬁnal  write­up  should  be   entirely  your  own  and  based   on  your  own  understanding. 
Problem  1(25  points) The  Implicit  Function  Theorem,  Part  1.   In   this   problem  you  will  apply  the  
Contraction  Mapping   Fixed  Point  Theorem  to  prove  the  following  theorem.  
Theorem   1.   Let  (x1 , ..., xn , y)  denote   coordinates   on  Rn+1 .  Let  U  be  an  open  region   in  Rn+1 .  Let 
∂ f 
f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  be  a  continuous  function  on  U  such  that  the  partial  derivative  ∂ y  is  deﬁned  and  
=�
continuous  on   U .  Let  p = (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  be  a  point  in  U  such  that   ∂ f 
∂ y (p) 
0.  Correction:  Also 
assume  that   f (p) = 0  (or  else  the  theorem  is  wrong!).  
There  exist  numbers  a1  > 0, . . . , an  > 0,  b > 0  such  that  the  multi­interval, 
I = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ] × [y − b, y +  b], 
is  contained  in   U ,  and  there  exists  a  continuous   function  y(x1 , . . . , xn )  deﬁned  on   the  closed  multi­
interval, 
J  = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ], 
whose  graph  lies  in  I  such  that  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn ))  = 0,  i.e.,  the  function  f  is  0  on  the  graph  
of  y(x1 , . . . , xn ). 

∂ f  
Denote  m =  ∂ y (p).  The   trick  is  to  consider   the  function, 
1 
g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) =  y − 
f (x1 , . . . , xn , y). 
m 
For  a  function   y(x1 , . . . , xn ),  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  = 0  iﬀ  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) =  y .  This  suggests   trying  to 
ﬁnd  y as  a  ﬁxed  point  of  the   mapping, 
T (y) =  z ,  z (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn )). 
But  ﬁrst  we  need  to   know  on  what  complete  metric   space  this  mapping  is  deﬁned,  and  we   have  to

guarantee  that  T  is  a  u­contraction  mapping  for   some   0  < u < 1. 

To   ease  notation,  for  each  sequence   of   numbers  a1  >  0, . . . , an  >  0,   denote  by  J (a1 , . . . , an )  the

multi­interval,

J (a1 , . . . , an ) = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ]. 
Similarly,  for  each  sequence   of  numbers  a1  >  0, . . . , an  >  0,   b  >  0,   denote  by  I (a1 , . . . , an , b)  the 
multi­interval, 
I (a1 , . . . , an , b) = [x1  − a1 , x1  +  a1 ] × · · · × [xn  − an , xn  +  an ] × [y − b, y +  b].

Solution:  The  region  U  is  open,   hence   there  exists   a  radius   r  > 0  such  that  the  open  ball   of  radius

Because  g is  continuous,  h is  continuous.   Because  f (p) = 0, 
h(p� ) =  g(p) =  y . 
Because  h  is  continuous,  for  ��  =  (1  −  u)b,  there  exists  a   radius  0  <  δ �  <  a  such  that  for  all 
q �  ∈ J (a1

As  in  part  (a),   for  all  q �  ∈ J (a1 , . . . , an ),   d(q � , p� ) < δ  holds.  Hence,  
g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) − y < (1  − u)b.

Let  q = (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  be   a   point  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b).  Then,

By  the  last  paragraph,  the  second  term  is  less  than  (1  − u)b.   By  the  mean   value   theorem,  there 
exists  c  between  y and  y such that,  
g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) − g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) =  ∂ g  (x1 , . . . , xn , c)(y − y).

y − y ≤ ub.

Putting   both  inequalities  together,  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y) − y < (1  − u)b +  ub  =  b.   So  the  mapping, 
|
| 
(x1 , . . . , xn , y) �→ (x1 , . . . , xn , g(x1 , . . . , xn )), 
sends  I (a1 , . . . , an , b) into   itself.  In  particular,   if  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) is  a   continuous  function  on  J (a1 , . . . , an ) 
whose  graph  lies  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b),  then  also, 
z (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn )), 
is  a   continuous  function  on  J (a1 , . . . , an ) whose  graph  lies  in   I (a1 , . . . , an , b). 
(c)(5   points)  Deﬁne   B  to  be  the  metric   space  of   continuous   functions  y  on  J (a1 , . . . , an )  whose 
graph  lies  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b)  that  satisfy  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) =  y .  The  uniform  metric  (often  also  called  
the  L∞  metric,  or  the  sup  metric  )  is  deﬁned  by, 
d(y1 , y2 ) =  max  y1 (t) − y2 (t) .

Use  the  natural  multi­dimensional  generalization   of   the   Cauchy  Test  to  prove  that  this   is   a  complete  
metric  space.  You  need  not  prove  the   multi­dimensional  generalization!   Simply  write  down   a  careful 
statement  of   what  you  believe  the  generalization   says,  and   apply  this  appropriately  to   deduce  that 
B  is  a  complete  metric  space.  
Solution:  The  multi­variable  version   of   the  Cauchy  Test  says  the  same  thing   as  the   one­variable 
version. 
Theorem   2   (Cauchy  Test).  Let  R ⊂ Rn  be  a  closed,  bounded  region,  and  let   (yi )  be  a  sequence  of 
continuous  functions  on  R  that  is  Cauchy  with  respect  to  the  uniform  metric.  Then  there  exists  a 
continuous  function   y  on  R  such  that  (yi )  converges  to  y  with  respect   to  this  metric. 
The  theorem  also  holds  if  B  is  not  a  closed,  bounded  region,   but  one   has  to  change  the  deﬁnition 
of  d(y1 , y2 )  because   continuous  functions   do  not  necessarily  attain  their  maximum.  The   proof  is 
identical  to  the  proof  of  the   one­variable  version.  Because [y −  b, y +  b]   is   a  closed  interval,  it 
contains  all  of  its  limits.  Thus  if  the  graph  of   each  function  yi  is  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b),  then  for  every 
q �  = (x1 , . . . , xn ) in  J (a1 , . . . , an ),  the   limit  y(q � ) of  the  sequence   (yi (q � ))  is  in [y − b, y + b].  Therefore 
the  graph  of  y is  contained  in  I (a1 , . . . , an , b).  So  a  Cauchy   sequence  in  B converges  to  a  limit   in  B , 
i.e.  B  is  a   complete  metric   space.  
(d)(5  points)  Prove  that  for  each continuous   function   y in   B ,  the  following  function  z  is   also  in  B , 
z (x1 , . . . , xn ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y(x1 , . . . , xn )). 
Therefore  the  mapping  T (y) =  z  is  a  mapping  from  B  into  itself. 
Solution:  This  is   really  just  the  last  part  of   (b).  
(e)(5   points)  Prove   that  T  is  a  u­contraction   mapping.  Use  the   Contraction  Mapping  Fixed  Point  
Theorem  to  deduce  that  there   exists  a  continuous   function   y in   B  such  that  T (y) =  y .  Deduce  that 
f  is  0   on  the  graph  of  y .  (Hint:  Use  the  mean   value   theorem.) 
Solution:  Let  y1  and  y2  be  functions  in  B ,  and  denote  D :=  d(y1 , y2 ).  Denote  zi (x1 , . . . , xn , yi (x1 , . . . , xn )) 
for  i = 1, 2.  Let  q �  = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be  an  element  of   J (a1 , . . . , an ).  By  the  mean  value  theorem,   there 
exists  a  number  c  between  y1 (q � ) and  y2 (q � ) such  that, 
z1 (q � ) − z2 (q � ) =  g(x1 , . . . , xn , y1 (q � ))  − g(x1 , . . . , xn , y2 (q � ))  =

(x1 , . . . , xn , c)(y1 (q � ) − y2 (q � )).

Therefore,

Therefore  T (y) =  z  is  a  u­contraction  mapping  theorem. 
Because  B is  a  complete   metric   space  and  T  is  a  u­contraction   mapping,  by the  Contraction   Mapping 
Fixed  Point   Theorem  there   exists  a  unique  ﬁxed  point  y  of   T .  Because   T (y) =  y ,  for   every  q �  ∈
J (a1 , . . . , an ), 

Since  | ∂ y | < u  on  I (a1 , . . . , an , b),

Therefore  f (q � , y(q � ))  = 0  for  every  q �  ∈ J (a1 , . . . , an ),  i.e.,  f  is  zero  on  the  graph  of  y . 
Problem  2(5  points)  The  Implicit  Function  Theorem,  Part   II.  The   notation  is  from  Problem  1. 
Let  (x1 , . . . , xn , y) be   a  point  in  I  such  that  f (x1 , . . . , xn , y)  =  0.  Prove  that  y  =  y(x1 , . . . , xn ). 
Therefore  the   points  in   I  where   f  is  0  are  exactly   the  points  on   the  graph  of  y(x1 , . . . , xn ).  (Hint: 
If  y =�
y(x1 , . . . , xn ),  use  the  mean  value  theorem   to  ﬁnd a  number   y1  between  y  and  y(x1 , . . . , xn ) 
where  the  derivative   ∂ g  
∂ y (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 )  gives   a  contradiction.) 
Solution:  I  apologize  for  the   poor  notation  of   this  problem:  using  y both  to  denote   a  function,   and 
the  coordinate  of   a   supposedly   diﬀerent  point.  Denote  the  point  by  (x1 , . . . , xn , w) instead.  Denote 
q �  = (x1 , . . . , xn ).  By  the   mean  value  theorem,  there   is   a   number  y1  between  w  and  y(q � ) such  that, 
(q � , y1 )(w − y(q � )). 
f (q � , w) − f (q � , y(q � ))  = 
∂ f 
∂ y 
Since  f (q � , w) =  f (q � , y(q � ))  =  0,  either  w  =  y(q � ) or  ∂ f

Problem  3(10  points)  Appendix  A.1,  Problem  1,  p.  677. 
Solution,  (a):  The   function  |y |  is  not  diﬀerentiable  on  any  interval  containing  0,  because   the  slope 
of  the  graph  as  y →  0−  is  −1,  and  the  slope   of  the  graph   as  y →  0+  is  +1.  So,  on  any  region  that 
∂ f 
intersects  the  t­axis,  it  is  not  true  that  ∂ y  is   everywhere  deﬁned. 
(b):  One  solution  of   the   IVP  is  y(t) = 0  for   all  t.  Let  z (t) be   any  solution  of   the   IVP.  Suppose  that 
there  exists  t > t0  such  that  z (t) =  0.  There  exists   a  largest  t1  with  t0  ≤  t1  < t  such  that  z (t) = 0 
for  all  t ∈ [t0 , t1 ].  Let  t2  be  a  number  with  t1  < t2  < t  such that  t2  − t1  < 1.   Denote  by  M , 
M  =  max  z (t)|.

Because  there  exists  t ∈ [t1 , t2 ] with  z (t) = 0,  M  > 0.   On  the   other   hand,   for  all  t ∈ [t1 , t2 ],

Therefore  maxt  |z (t) <  M ,  i.e.  M <  M .  This  is  absurd.  Therefore  the  original  hypothesis  is  false,

i.e.  z (t) = 0   for   all   t  >  t0 .  A   very  similar  argument  proves  that  z (t) = 0  for  all  t  <  t0 . 
No  contradiction  exists.  The  uniqueness   theorem  is  not  an  “if and only  if ”  theorem.  If  the  hypotheses 
are  satisﬁed,  the  conclusion  of   the  theorem  holds.  But,  as  this  example  illustrates,   the   conclusion 
of  the  theorem  may  hold   even  if  the  hypotheses  are  not  satisﬁed. 
(c):  In  fact  the   proof  on  p.  676  exactly  proves  this,  so   there   is  no   need   to  repeat  the   proof.   The 
function  |y |  satisﬁes  a  Lipschitz  condition  with   constant  L  = 
1:  ||a| − |b||  ≤ |

a  solution  to  the  IVP  exists   (which  it  clearly  does  because  y(t)  =  0  is  a  solution),  the   solution  is

unique.

Problem  5(5  points)  Section  2.4,  Problem  17,  p.  67  (as  above,  just  draw  a   rough   sketch). 
Solution:  There  is  more  than  one  way  to   solve  this  problem.  One  method  is  to   apply  Theorem  
2.2.1,  p.  50  with  the  given   piecewise  continuous  input.  This   does  give   a   generalized  solution   to 
the  IVP,  despite  the   fact  that  q(t)  does  not  satisfy  the   hypotheses  of  the  theorem  (yet  another 
illustration  that  many   of  our  theorems/algorithms  are  more   robust  than   the   “clean   formulation” 
implies).  Another   solution,  the   one   I  will  follow,  is  to   apply  the   same   reasoning   as  in   the  last 
problem.  I  personally  prefer  this  approach  whenever   it  is  reasonable,  because   it   applies  to  a   broader 
class  of  ODEs  than  ﬁrst­order  linear  ODEs. 
On  the  interval  (−∞, 1),  the  ODE  is  y �  +  2y =  1.  An  integrating   factor  is  e2t ,  leading  to  the   ODE 
(e y)�  =  e .

y  =  Ae−2t  .
