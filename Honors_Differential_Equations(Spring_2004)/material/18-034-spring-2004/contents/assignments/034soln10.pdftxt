18.034  SOLUTIONS  TO   PROBLEM  SET   10  

Due  date:  Friday,  May  7  in  lecture.  Late  work  will   be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note   or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding. 
Each  of  the  following  problems  is  from  the   textbook.  The  point  value  of   the   problem  is   next  to  the 
problem.

The  maximally  extended  solution  is  deﬁned  on  an  interval  I  = (a, b)  where  a  and  b  are   solutions   of 
the  equation,

(3)(10   points)  p.   463,  Problem  33 
Solution:  In  fact,  the  hint  is  the  solution  of   the  problem. 
It  should  be   mentioned,  due  to  the 
theorem  about  maximally  extended  solutions,  the   maximally  extended  solution  is  deﬁned  on  an 
interval  [0, T � ) where  T �  > T :  in  fact  if  T �  is  ﬁnite,  then 
lim  x(t) ∈ ∂S,  
t T �→
in  the  sense  that  the   limit  exists   and  is  a  boundary  point  of  S .  Because  p is   not  a  boundary  point 
of  S ,  it  follows  that  T �  > T . 
(4)(10  points)  p.  472,  Problem  15 
Solution:  This  is  a   cooperation  model   with  overcrowding.  A  JPEG  of  the  direction  ﬁeld  is 

given below.

(5)(10   points)  p.   472,  Problem  17 
Solution:  This  is  a  competition   model  with   overcrowding.  For  almost  all   initial  points,  Species  x 
becomes  extinct  and  Species  y  approaches  the  equilibrium  value  y  =  5.  A  JPEG  of   the   direction 
ﬁeld  is 
given below.
