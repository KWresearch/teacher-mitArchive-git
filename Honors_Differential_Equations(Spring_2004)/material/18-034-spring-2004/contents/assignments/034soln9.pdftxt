18.034  SOLUTIONS  TO  PROBLEM   SET  9  

Due  date:  Friday,  April  30  in  lecture.   Late  work  will  be   accepted  only  with   a   medical  note   or  for 
another  Institute­approved reason. You  are  strongly  encouraged to  work  with  others,  but   the  ﬁnal 
write­up  should  be  entirely  your  own  and   based  on  your   own  understanding. 
Each  of  the  following  problems  is  from  the   textbook.  The  point  value  of   the   problem  is   next  to  the 
problem. 
(1)(5  points)  p.  403,   Problem  5  
Solution:  The   trace  is  Trace(A) =   6,  and  the   determinant  is  det(A) = 2 ·4− (−1)1  =  9.   Therefore 
the  characteristic   polynomial  is, 
pA (λ) =  λ2  − Trace(A)λ   +  det(A) =  λ2  − 6λ  +  9  = (λ   − 3)2  . 
� 
� 
Therefore  there  is   one  eigenvalue  λ  = 3  with  multiplicity  2.  Because   the   matrix  is  not  diagonal,  the 
eigenspace  is  deﬁcient.   Therefore   there  is  a  generalized  eigenvector.  The  matrix  A  − 3I  is, 
−1  1 
A  − 3I  =  −1  1

(3)(10   points)  p.  403,  Problem  15 
Solution:  The   trace  is  Trace(A)  =   0,   and  the  determinant  is  det(A)  = 2(−2)  −  (−1)3  =  −1. 
Therefore  the   characteristic   polynomial  is, 
pA (λ) =  λ2  − Trace(A)λ   +  det(A) =  λ2  − 1  = (λ  +  1)(λ  − 1).

Therefore  the  eigenvalues   are  λ1  =  −1  and  λ2  =  1,   each  with  multiplicity  1.  For  λ1  =  −1,  the

Solution:  The   goal  is  to  prove   Theorem  6.8.5   (which,  incidentally,  is  essentially  equivalent   to  our

Green’s  kernel   solution).  Let  c(t) be  a  continuously  diﬀerentiable   vector­valued  function.  Consider 
the  continuously   diﬀerentiable  vector­value  function, 
x(t) = Φ(t, t0 )c(t).

This  is  a  solution  of  the   IVP  iﬀ 
Φ� (t, t0 )c(t) +  Φ(t, t0 )c� (t) =  A(t)Φ(t, t0 )c(t) +  F(t),  
Φ(t0 , t0 )c(t0 ) = 0 
� 
By  hypothesis,   Φ� (t, t0 ) =  A(t)Φ(t, t0 ) and  Φ(t0 , t0 ) =  In .  Therefore  x(t) is  a  solution  of  the  IVP  iﬀ,  
Φ(t, t0 )c� (t) =  F(t),  
c(t0 ) = 0 
� 
By  the  last  part  of  Theorem   6.8.4,  Φ(t0 , t)Φ(t, t0 ) =  In .  Therefore  x(t)  is   a  solution  of  the  IVP  iﬀ, 
c� (t) = Φ(t0 , t)F(t), 
c(t0 ) = 0 
� 
By  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus,  there  is  a  unique  solution  of   this  IVP,  and  it  is   given  by, 
t 
t0 
Therefore,  the   unique  solution   of  the   IVP  is  given   by,
