***** Description *****
This course emphasizesÂ the theory of the following topics that are covered in
18.03 in less detail.
    * Study of ODE's, including modeling physical systems.
    * Solution of first-order ODE's by analytical, graphical and numerical
      methods.
    * Linear ODE's, especially second order with constant coefficients.
    * Undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters.
    * Sinusoidal and exponential signals: oscillations, damping, resonance.
    * Complex numbers and exponentials.
    * Fourier series, periodic solutions, Delta functions, convolution, and
      Laplace transform methods.
    * Matrix and first order linear systems: eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
    * Non-linear autonomous systems: critical point analysis and phase plane
      diagrams.
The pace for 18.034 is faster than inÂ 18.03, many theorems will be proved, and
some topics not covered in 18.03 will be presented.
***** Prerequisites *****
Calculus (18.02) or Calculus with Theory (18.014).
***** Text *****
[Amazon_logo] Borrelli, R.,Â and C. Coleman. Differential Equations: A Modeling
Perspective. Wiley Text Books,Â 2nd ed., New York,Â 2003. ISBN: 0471433322.
***** Problem Sets *****
Problem sets will be due approximately every week, on Friday in lecture. Late
homeworks are accepted only if there is a valid medical excuse, or in very
special circumstances only with my prior consent. You are encouraged to work
with other students in the class, but your final write-up should be in your own
words and based on your own understanding.
***** In-class Exams *****
There will be 3 in-class exams. They are closed book, closed notes and
calculators are not allowed.
Missing an exam is allowed only with a valid medical excuse or for other
Institute-sanctioned reasons. For example, an away game in a team sport will
typically be allowed, but you must let me know as soon as possible about the
conflict. On the other hand, schedule conflict with an airline flight will
typically not be allowed, oversleeping will not be allowed, etc.
***** Grading *****
ACTIVITIES                         POINTS
10 Problem Sets                    500 (50 points each)
3 In-class Exams (50 minutes each) 300 (100 points each)
Final Exam (3 hour)                200
Total                              1000
