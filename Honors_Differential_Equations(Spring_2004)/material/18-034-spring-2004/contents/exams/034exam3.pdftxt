Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at   the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is   closed 
book,  closed  notes,  and  calculators  are  not  allowed.  You  will  have  approximately  50  minutes  for 
this  exam.  The  point  value   of  each  problem  is  written  next  to   the  problem   –  use   your   time   wisely. 
Please  show  all  work,   unless  instructed   otherwise.  Partial  credit  will  be   given   only  for   work  shown. 
You  may  use   either  pencil  or  ink.  If  you  have  a  question,  need   extra  paper,  need  to  use   the   restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.
