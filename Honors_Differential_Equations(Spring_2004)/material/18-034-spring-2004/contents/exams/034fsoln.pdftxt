Problem  4: 
Name: 
Problem 4(15  points)  Using  the   method   of   undetermined  coeﬃcients  and  the  exponential  shift  
rule,  ﬁnd  a  particular  solution  of  the  inhomogeneous  linear  2nd   order  ODE, 
y ��  +  5y �  +  6y  =  −4te−3t  . 

/15 

Solution:  In  operator  form,  this   is,  
(D2  +  5D  +  6)y(t) =  −4te−3t  .

The  guess  is  that  a  particular  solution  is  of   the   form  y(t) =  e−3tg(t).  By  the  exponential  shift  rule,

(D2  +  5D  +  6)e−3t g(t) =  e−3t ((D  − 3)2  +  5(D  − 3)  +  6)g(t) = (D2  − D)g(t).


Therefore, 

(D2  − D)g(t) =  −4t. 
By  the  method  of   undetermined  coeﬃcients,  g(t)  is  a  general  degree  2   polynomial, 
g(t) =  a2 t2  +  a1 t  +  a0 . 

Plugging  in,  

(D2  − D)g(t) = (−2a2 )t  +  (2a2  − a1 ). 
Therefore  a  solution  is,  a2  =  2,  a1  =  4,  and  a0  =  0  (or  any  constant  actually).  So  a   particular 
solution  is, 
yp (t) = (2t2  +  4t)e−3t  .

Question:(Not  to  be  answered)  Is  there  a  simpler   solution   than  using  the   Laplace   transform?  If 
so,  you  can  use  this   to  double­check  your  answer. 
Solution:  This  question  was   not  to  be   answered.  The  point  is  that,  after   substituting  τ  =  t  − 1 
⎧ ⎨  z �� (τ ) +  5z � (τ ) +  6z (τ ) =  e−3τ  , 
and  z (τ ) =  y(τ  +  1),  the   original   IVP  is  equivalent  to  the  IVP, 
⎩ 
z (0)  = 0,
z � (0)  = 0 
Denoting  Z (s) =  L[z (τ )],  the  equation  for   Z (s) is, 
(s 2  +  5s  +  6)Z (s) = 

The  solution  is,   as  before,

Solution:  A  sketch  of  the   orbital  portrait  with  the   nullclines  is   on  the  course  webpage.  The  x­

Name: 
Problem  10,  Extra  Credit  Problem(10  points)  Let  a(t)  and  b(t)  be  continous  functions   on  an 
interval  (c, d).  Let  {y1 , y2}  be  a  basic  solution  pair   on   this  interval  of   the  ODE, 
y ��  +  a(t)y �  +  b(t)y = 0.  
Prove  that  between  every   two  zeroes  of   y1  there  is  a  zero  of  y2  (and  vice  versa). 
Solution:  Consider  the   zeroes  of  y1  on  (c, d).  Let  t  be   a  zero   of  y1 .  Note  that  y1  is  not  an 
�
accumulation  point  of  the  zeroes  of  y1 :  if   t  is  an  accumulation  point,  then   y1 (t) =  y1 (t) =  0,  which 
implies  that  W [y1 , y2 ](t) = 0 contrary  to   Abel’s  theorem/the   deﬁnition  of  a  basic  solution  pair.  In 
particular,  if   there  is   a  zero  t�  < t  of  y1 ,  then  there  is  a   maximal   zero  less  than  t.  And  if   there  is   a 
zero   t�  > t of   y1 ,  then  there  is  a  minimal   zero  greater  than   t.  Thus  to   prove  that  between  every  two 
zeroes  of  y1  there  is  a  zero  of  y2 ,  it  suﬃces  to  prove  this   for   every   pair   of   zeroes  t < t�  such  that  t� 
is  the  minimal  zero  greater  than  t. 
By  hypothesis,   y1  is  nonzero  on  (t, t� ).  Without  loss  of   generality,   assume  that  y1  is   positive  on 
(t, t� );  up  to   replacing   y1  by  −y1 ,  this  is   true.   Then   y1 (t)  >  0  and  y1 (t� )  <  0.  By  Abel’s  theorem, 
�
�
W [y1 , y2 ](t)   is  nonzero  on [t, t� ].  Up  to  replacing   y2  by  −y2 ,  assume  that  W [y1 , y2 ](t)  is   positive  on 
[t, t� ].  Then, 
W [y1 , y2 ](t) =  −y1 (t)y2 (t) > 0, 
�
which  implies  that  y2 (t) < 0.  And, 
W [y1 , y2 ](t� ) =  −y �
1 (t� )y2 (t� ) > 0,  
which  implies  that  y2 (t� )  >  0.  Therefore,  by  the  intermediate  value  theorem,  there  exists  t��  with 
t < t��  < t�  such   that  y2 (t�� ) =  0.  So   between  any  two   zeroes   of  y1 ,  there   is  a  zero  of  y2 .  By  the  same 
argument,  between  any   two  zeroes  of  y2 ,  there  is   a  zero  of  y1 .
