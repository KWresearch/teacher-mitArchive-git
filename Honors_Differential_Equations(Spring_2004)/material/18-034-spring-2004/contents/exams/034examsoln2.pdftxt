Problem  1: 
Name: 
Problem  1(30  points)  A  driven,  damped  harmonic   oscillator   satisﬁes   the   following  ODE, 
y ��  +  2by �  +  ω2 y  =  F  cos(ωt), 
where  b,  ω  and  F  are  positive  real  numbers. 
(a)(10  points)  Using  the   method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  ﬁnd  a  solution  of  the   form  y(t) = 
C1  cos(ωt) +  C2  sin(ωt). 
+  ω2y� = 
�
y ��  +  2by�
Solution  A  particular  solution  is  the   real  part  of   the  complex­valued  solution  of, 
� 
F e iωt  
. 
�
The  complex  number  iω  is  not  a   root  of  the  characteristic   polynomial.  Therefore,  we  guess   that 

=  eiωtA,  for  some  complex  number   A.   Substituting  in   gives, 
y 
e iωt (−ω2  +  2ibω  +  ω2 )A  =  e 
iωtF .  
Therefore  A  =  −iF /2bω .  This  gives, 
�

So  a  particular  solution   is   the   real  part, 

sin(ωt) − i


cos(ωt).

yd (t) = 
sin(ωt).
2bω 
(b)(10  points)  Let  R  be  a  positive  real   number,  R  ≤  F /(2bω)  (this   guarantees  that  yd (t) =  R  for 
some  t  >  0).  There  is   a  multi­valued  function   T  =  T (ω)  for  the  set  of  positive  numbers  where 
y(T ) =  R.  This  can  be  made   into  a   single­valued   function   Tn  by  specifying  that  Tn  is   the  n
th
smallest   positive   number  such  that  y(T ) =  R.  So  T1  is   the  smallest  positive  number  such  that 
y(T1 ) =   R,  T2  is  the   smallest  positive  number   greater   than  T1  such  that  y(T2 ) =  R,  etc. 
For  at  least  one  choice  of  n  >  0,  ﬁnd a   formula  for  Tn (ω). 
Solution  The   solution  below  is  only   valid  if   ω  is   strictly  less  than  F /(2bR).  The  functions   Tn ,

n  ≥ 2,  are  discontinuous   at  ω  =  F /(2bR).  Therefore,  assume  that  0  <  ω <  F /(2bR).

The  positive   number  T  equals  Tn  for  some  n  if 

F 
2bω 

sin(ωT ) =  R. 

Solving  for  T  gives, 

1 
sin−1 (2bωR/F ). 
T (ω) = 
ω 
The  diﬀerent  values  T1 ,  T2 ,  etc.  correspond  to   the  diﬀerent  positive  branches  of  sin−1 (2bωR/F ).  In 
particular,  deﬁning   sin−1 (θ)  to  be  the   usual   branch,

the  formula  for   Tn  is,

(c)(10   points)  Suppose   that  b,  F  and  R  are   ﬁxed,  but  ω  is   allowed  to  vary, 
0  <  ω  ≤ 
F
2bR
Write  T  =  Tn  for  some  positive  integer   n.   Let  ω  be   a  critical  point  of   T (ω).  Prove  there  is   an 
equation, 

. 

sin(ωT ) = 

gives  the  following,  

Equivalently,  this   is, 

ωT (ω) =  α, 
where  α  is  a  real  number  independent  of  b,  F  and  R.  Moreover,  ﬁnd   an  equation   that  α  satisﬁes. 
(Remark  You  will  see  there   are   many choices   for  α.  You  are  not  responsible  for   “matching”  choices 
of  α  to   choices  of   n;  just  write  down  an  equation   that  α  satisﬁes). 
Solution  Implicitly  diﬀerentiating  the   following  relation   with  respect  to  ω ,

ω2  (ω cos(ωT )(T  +  ωT � ) − sin(ωT ))  = 0.

T  +  ωT �  = 
ω 
At a   critical  point,  T � (ω) =  0,  giving   the  equation, 
ωT  = tan(ωT ). 
So  ωT (ω) =   α,  where   α  is  a  positive   solution  of   the  equation, 
α  = tan(α). 
Observe   that  the  corresponding  values  of   ω  and  T  are,

Therefore,  to  be   perfectly   accurate,  ωT  =  α  only  gives  a  critical   point  of  Tn  if   n  = 2m  +  1  is  odd,  
in  which  case  the  corresponding  value  of  α  is   the  unique  solution,

(But  this  is  more   detail  than  you  were  asked   to  give). 
Remark  I was  asked  why  the   functions  Tn  do  not  have  a   critical   point  if   n  is   even. The   answer  is 
related   to   the  discontinuity  of  Tn  at  F /(2bR).  For   n  even,   the  function  Tn  does   have  a  continuous 
extension  to  the  interval  (0,   2bR ]  (although  it  does  not  agree  with  the   deﬁnition  given  above).  The 
F
only extremal  point  of  Tn  is  the   global  minimum  of   Tn ,  which occurs   at  ω  =  F /(2bR). 
Extra   credit(5  points) Prove  the  solutions   of   your   equation  for  α  give  local  minima  of   T (ω). 
Solution  The   implicit  diﬀerentiation  above  gives,

T  +  ωT �  = 
ω 
Implicitly  diﬀerentiating  once  again  gives,

ω2  (ω sec2 (ωT )(T  +  ωT � ) − tan(ωT ))  =

Plugging  in  ωT  =  α  and  T �  = 0  gives,

Because  α  = tan(α),  sin(α) cos(α) =  α cos2 (α).  So   the  equation  simpliﬁes   to,

In  particular,  this  is  positive.  So  ω  gives   a  local  minimum  of  T (ω).

Problem  2: 
Name: 
Problem 2(20  points)  In  each  case   below,  y1 (t),  y2 (t)  is  a  pair  of  solutions  of   a  real,  constant 
coeﬃcient,  linear  homogeneous  ODE  in  normal  form.  Determine  the  least  degree  of  this  ODE,  and 
write  down  the  ODE  of  this  degree  that  the  pair  satisﬁes.  (Hint:  In  each  case,  write  down   each 
nonzero   solution  as  the  real   or  imaginary  part  of   eλtg(t)  where  g(t)  is   a  polynomial.  What  does 
the  degree  of  g(t),  and  the   vanishing/nonvanishing  of  the   imaginary  part  of   λ  tell  you  about  the 
characteristic  equation  of  the   ODE?  Remember,  the  ODE  is  a  real  ODE.) 
(a)(5  points) y1 (t) = 0,  y2 (t) =  e . 
t
Solution  The   ﬁrst  equation,  0,   is  a  solution  of  ANY  homogeneous  linear  ODE.  So  this  imposes  no 
condition.  The  second  condition  imposes  that  1   is  a  root  of   the  characteristic   polynomial.  Therefore 
the  minimal   degree   is   1,   and  the  corresponding  ODE  is, 
y �  − y  = 0. 

(b)(5  points)  y1 (t) =  e−t  ,  y2 (t) =  e−2t  . 
Solution  From  the  two  equations,  both  −1  and  −2  are  roots   of   the  characteristic  polynomial. 
Therefore  the  characteristic   polynomial  is  divisible  by  (z  + 1)(z   + 2)  =  z 2  + 3z  + 2.  So  the  minimal  
degree  is  2,  and  the   corresponding  ODE  is, 
y ��  +  3y �  +  2y  = 0. 

(c)(5  points)  y1 (t) =  t,  y2 (t) =  e . 
t
Solution  From  the   ﬁrst  solution,  0  is  a  double  root  of   the  characteristic  polynomial.  From  the 
second  solution,  1  is   a  root  of  the  characteristic  polynomial.  Therefore  the  characteristic   polynomial 
is  divisible  by  z 2 (z  − 1)  =  z 3  − z 2 .  So   the  minimal  degree   is   3,   and  the  corresponding  ODE  is, 
y ���  − y ��  = 0. 
(d)(5  points)  y1 (t) =  sin(2t),  y2 (t) =  cos(3t). 
Solution  From  the   ﬁrst  solution,  2i  is  a  root  of  the  characteristic   polynomial.  Therefore  the 
complex   conjugate,  −2i  is  also  a  root. From  the   second   solution,  3i  and  −3i  are   roots.  Therefore 
the  characteristic  polynomial  is  divisible   by  (z 2  +  4)(z 2  +  9).  So  the  minimal   degree  is   4,  and  the 
corresponding   ODE  is, 
y ����  +  13y ��  +  36y  = 0. 

Problem  3: 
Name: 
Problem  3(25  points)  For  a  certain  linear  ODE  in   normal  form  Ly  a  basic   solution  set  of  Ly  = 0 
is  given  by, 

y2 (t) = 2t2  +  2t  +  1. 
y1 (t) =  e ,

(a)(10  points)  Compute  the  Wronskian  of   this  basic  solution  pair.  Is  your   answer   consistent  with 
Abel’s  theorem?

2t  =

For  t  >   0,  the  Wronskian  is   nonzero.  Therefore  the   computation   of   the  Wronskian  is  consistent  with 
Abel’s  theorem.

Multiplying   the  Green’s  kernel  by  s2e2s  gives, 
1 
K (s,  t)f (s) =  −

is  the  equation  y1 (t) =  e . 
2t
(a)(10  points) Let  y2 (t) be  a  second solution.  Deﬁne   W (t) to  be  the  Wronskian  of  y1 (t),   y2 (t).  This 
satisﬁes  the  diﬀerential  equation  W �  =  −a(t)W .  Find  a  solution   W (t) of   this   diﬀerential  equation.

Solution  The   diﬀerential  equation  is  separable,

So, 

ln(W ) = 2t  +  2 ln(t) +  C, 

or  equivalently, 
Taking  A  =  −4  gives,  

W (t) =  At2 e . 
2t
W (t) =  −4t e 
2 2t
. 
(b)(15  points)  For  your  solution   W (t),  solve  the   ﬁrst­order  linear  ODE,  
y1 (t)v �  − y1 (t)v   =  W (t). 
�
Plug  in  y2 (t) =  v  to  ﬁnd  a   basic   solution  pair   of  the   ODE,  Ly  = 0. 
Solution  The   ODE  is, 

Simplifying,  this  is,  

e v �  − 2e v  =  −4t e 
2t 
2 2t 
2t 
v �  − 2v  =  −4t . 
2 
Because  0  is  not  a  root  of  the  characteristic  polynomial,  by  the   method   of   undetermined  coeﬃcients 
we  guess, 

. 

Substituting  in  gives,  

v(t) =  a2 t2  +  a1 t  +  a0 . 
−2a2 t2  +  (2a2  − 2a1 )t2  +  (a1  − 2a0 ) =  −4t . 
2
Therefore  a2  = 2,  a1  =  a2  = 2,  and  a0  =  a1/2  =  1.   So  the  solution  is,  
v(t) = 2t2  +  2t  +  1.  
So,  by  Wronskian  reduction  of  order,  a   basic   solution   pair  of   the  ODE  is, 
y1 (t) =  e ,
y2 (t) = 2t2  +  2t  +  1.  
2t 

This  is  the  same  solution  pair  as   in  the  previous  problem!  In  particular,  now  that  we   know  the 
operator  Ly ,  it  is  straightforward  to  check  that  the  particular  solution   yd (t)  of   Ly  =  t2e2t  actually 
does  give   a   solution.
