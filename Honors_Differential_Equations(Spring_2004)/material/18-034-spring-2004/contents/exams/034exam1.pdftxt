Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at   the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is   closed 
book,  closed  notes,  and  calculators  are  not  allowed.  You  will  have  approximately  50  minutes  for 
this  exam.  The  point  value   of  each  problem  is  written  next  to   the  problem   –  use   your   time   wisely. 
Please  show  all  work,   unless  instructed   otherwise.  Partial  credit  will  be   given   only  for   work  shown. 
You  may  use   either  pencil  or  ink.  If  you  have  a  question,  need   extra  paper,  need  to  use   the   restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1: 
Name: 
Problem  1(25  points)  Contaminated  ﬂuid  ﬂows  into   a  large  container  with  volume   V  at  a  rate  of 
a  liters/sec.  The   concentration  of   the  contaminant  is  a  constant  q .  Denote  by  y(t)  the  total  mass  
of  contaminant  in  the   container  at  time   t.  Chemical  reactions   neutralize  the  contaminant  in  the 
container  at   a  rate   by(t),  where  b  is  a  constant.  Treated  ﬂuid  ﬂows   out  of  the  container  at  the  rate 
of  a  liters/sec.   The   constants  a,  q  and  V  are   positive,   and  b  is  nonnegative. 
(a)(10  points)  Find   a  ﬁrst­order  linear  ODE  in   normal   form  that  y(t) satisﬁes. 

/25 

(b)(10  points) At  time   t  = 0,  the  amount  of   contaminant  in   the   container  is  y0 .  Using  an  integrating 
factor,  ﬁnd  y(t) for  t  >  0. 

(c)(5  points) In  the   steady­state,   what  is   the  concentration  of  contaminant   in  the  outﬂowing  ﬂuid, 
i.e.  what  is  y(t)/V  ?  How   does  the   steady­state  concentration   for  b >  0  compare  to  the  steady­state 
concentration  for   b  = 0?

where  y  =  y(t).  This  ODE  is  exact.  
(a)(10  points) Find  a  non­constant  function  H (t,  y)  that  is  constant  on  all  solution  curves. 

(b)(10  points)  Write  down   the   equation  of   a  general  integral  curve  of  this  system.  What  part  or 
parts  of  this  integral  curve  are  solution  curves? 

(c)(5   points) If  the  initial   value   y(0)  =  y0  is   positive,  how  much   time   elapses  before   the  solution  of 
the  IVP  is  undeﬁned? 

Problem  3:

To   simplify this  ODE,  substitute  u  = 1/y ,  u�  =  −y �/y2  . 
(a)(15  points)  Rewrite   the   ODE  in  terms   of  t  and  u,  solve  the  resulting  ODE,  and  back­substitute 
to   ﬁnd  y(t).

(b)(5  points)  Were  any  solutions  lost  by  making  the  substitution?   If   so,  say  what  they  are. 

Problem  4:

y(0)  = 1 

/20 

(a)(5  points)  For   the  ﬁrst­approximation  function,  take  y0 (t)  =  1.  Compute   the   ﬁrst  2   Picard  
iterates,  y1 (t) and  y2 (t). 

(b)(10  points)  Find  a  formula  for  the  nth   Picard  iterate,   yn (t).   Justify  your   answer.

(a)(10  points)  Find  all   equilibrium  solutions,  sketch   the  state  line,   and  sketch  several  solutions
