Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at   the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is   closed 
book,  closed  notes,  and  calculators  are  not  allowed.  You  will  have  approximately  50  minutes  for 
this  exam.  The  point  value   of  each  problem  is  written  next  to   the  problem   –  use   your   time   wisely. 
Please  show  all  work,   unless  instructed   otherwise.  Partial  credit  will  be   given   only  for   work  shown. 
You  may  use   either  pencil  or  ink.  If  you  have  a  question,  need   extra  paper,  need  to  use   the   restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1: 
Name: 
Problem  1(30  points)  A  driven,  damped   harmonic  oscillator  satisﬁes   the   following  ODE, 
y ��  +  2by �  +  ω2 y  =  F  cos(ωt), 
where  b,  ω  and  F  are  positive   real  numbers.  
(a)(10  points)  Using  the  method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  ﬁnd  a  solution  of  the   form  y(t) = 
C1  cos(ωt) +  C2  sin(ωt). 

/30 

(b)(10  points)  Let  R  be  a  positive  real   number,  R  ≤  F /(2bω)  (this   guarantees  that  yd (t) =  R  for 
some  t  >  0).  There  is  a  multi­valued  function  T  =  T (ω)  for   the   set  of   positive  numbers  where 
y(T ) =  R.  This  can  be   made   into  a   single­valued  function  Tn  by  specifying  that  Tn  is  the  n
th
smallest   positive  number  such  that  y(T ) =  R.  So  T1  is  the  smallest  positive   number  such  that 
y(T1 ) =  R,  T2  is  the   smallest  positive   number   greater  than  T1  such that  y(T2 ) =  R,  etc. 
For  at   least   one  choice  of  n  >  0,  ﬁnd a  formula  for  Tn (ω). 

(c)(10   points)  Suppose  that  b,  F  and  R  are   ﬁxed,  but  ω  is   allowed  to  vary, 
0  <  ω  ≤ 
F
2bR  
Write  T  =  Tn  for  some   positive   integer  n.   Let  ω  be   a  critical  point  of   T (ω).  Prove  there  is   an 
equation, 

ωT (ω) =  α, 
where  α  is  a  real  number  independent  of  b,  F  and  R.  Moreover,  ﬁnd  an   equation  that  α  satisﬁes. 
(Remark  You  will  see   there  are  many choices  for  α.  You  are  not  responsible  for   “matching”  choices 
of  α  to   choices  of  n;  just  write  down  an  equation  that  α  satisﬁes). 

.

Extra   credit(5  points) Prove  the  solutions   of   your  equation  for  α  give  local  minima  of   T (ω). 

Problem  2: 
Name: 
Problem 2(20  points)  In  each  case   below,  y1 (t),  y2 (t)  is  a  pair  of  solutions  of   a  real,  constant 
coeﬃcient,  linear  homogeneous  ODE  in  normal  form.  Determine  the  least  degree  of  this  ODE,  and 
write  down  the  ODE  of  this  degree  that  the  pair  satisﬁes.  (Hint:  In  each  case,  write  down   each 
nonzero   solution  as  the  real   or  imaginary  part  of   eλtg(t)  where  g(t)  is   a  polynomial.  What  does 
the  degree  of  g(t),  and  the   vanishing/nonvanishing  of  the   imaginary  part  of   λ  tell  you  about  the 
characteristic  equation  of  the   ODE?  Remember,  the  ODE  is  a  real  ODE.)

Problem  3: 
Name: 
Problem  3(25  points)  For  a  certain  linear  ODE  in   normal  form  Ly  a  basic  solution  set  of   Ly  = 0 
is  given  by, 

y2 (t) = 2t2  +  2t  +  1.

Abel’s  theorem?

(a)(10  points) Let  y2 (t) be  a  second solution.  Deﬁne  W (t) to  be   the  Wronskian  of   y1 (t),  y2 (t).  This 
satisﬁes  the  diﬀerential  equation  W �  =  −a(t)W .  Find  a   solution  W (t) of   this  diﬀerential   equation.
