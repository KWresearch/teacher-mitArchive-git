Problem  1  Let  A  be  a  2 × 2 real  matrix  and  consider   the  linear  system  of  ﬁrst  order  diﬀerential 
equations, 
y1 (t) 
y� (t) =  Ay(t),   y(t) = 
. 
y2 (t) 
Let  α  be  a  real  number,   let  β  be  a  nonzero   real  number,  and  let  M1 ,  M2  be   2 × 2  matrices  with  real

entries.  Suppose   that  the  general  solution  of  the  linear  system  is, 
eαt  cos(β t) 
, 
eαt  sin(β t) 
� 
. 

where  k1 , k2  are  arbitrary  real  numbers.

Therefore,  for  each  real  number  t, 
eαt  cos(β t) 
(AMi  − MiD) 
eαt  sin(β t)  = 0. 
But  for  t  = 0  and  t  =  π/(2β ),  the  vectors   give  a  basis   for  R2 .  Therefore  AMi  − MiD  = 0.

(b)  Consider  the  linear  system  of  diﬀerential  equations,

Use  (a)  to  show  that  for  every  pair  of  real  numbers  k1 , k2 ,  the   following  function   is   a  solution   of  the

(a)   Find  an  expression  for  Y  (s)  as  a  sum  of  ratios  of  polynomials  in  s. 
Solution:  By  rules  of  the  Laplace   transform,  L[y � (t)]   =  sY  (s) − y0  and  L[y �� (t)]   =  s2Y  (s) − sy0  − v0 . 
Therefore,

Problem  3   The   general  skew­symmetric  real  2 × 2 matrix  is,

A = 
−b  0 
,
where  b is  a   real  number. Prove   that  the  eigenvalues  of  A of   the  form  λ =  ±iµ for  some   real   number 
µ.  Determine   µ and  ﬁnd  all  values   of  b such that  there  is   a  single  repeated   eigenvalue.  
Solution:  The   trace  is  Trace(A) =   0,  and   the   determinant  is   det(A) = 0 − (−b2 ) =  b2  . Therefore 
the  characteristic   polynomial  is 
pA (λ) =  λ2  − Trace(A)λ +  det(A) =  λ2  +  b2  . 
Therefore  the   eigenvalues  of  A are  ±ib.  There  is  a  repeated  eigenvalue   iﬀ   b = 0.  
There  is  a   more  involved  proof  that  for  every  positive   integer   n,   for  every  skew­symmetric  real   n × n 
matrix  A,  every  eigenvalue   of  A  is  purely  imaginary.  The  idea  is  that  on   Cn  there  is   a  Hermitian

�z, λw� =  λ�z, w�,

�w, z� =  �z, w�,

�z, z� = 0,  
if   z  = 0. 

Because  A  is  a  real  skew­symmetric   matrix,  for  every  pair   of   vectors  z, w  the  following  equation 
holds, 
�Az, w� =  −�z, Aw�. 
Suppose  that  λ ∈ C  is  an  eigenvalue  and  let  z  be   a  (nonzero)  λ­eigenvalue.  Then,  
λ�z, z� =  �λz, z� =  �Az, z� =  −�z, Az� =  −�z, λz� =  −λ�z, z�. 
Because  z  is  nonzero,  �z, z�  is  nonzero.  Therefore  λ =  −λ,  which  implies   that  λ is   a  pure  imaginary 
number.
