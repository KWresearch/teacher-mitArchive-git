Problem  1(25  points)  Contaminated  ﬂuid  ﬂows  into  a  large  container  with  volume  V  at  a  rate  of 
a  liters/sec.  The  concentration  of  the  contaminant  is  a  constant  q .  Denote  by  y(t)  the  total  mass 
of  contaminant  in  the  container  at  time  t.  Chemical  reactions  neutralize  the  contaminant  in  the 
container  at  a  rate  by(t),  where  b  is  a  constant.  Treated  ﬂuid  ﬂows  out  of  the  container  at  the  rate 
of  a  liters/sec.  The  constants  a,  q  and  V  are  positive,  and  b  is  nonnegative. 
(a)(10  points)  Find  a  ﬁrst-order  linear  ODE  in  normal  form  that  y(t)  satisﬁes. 
Solution The rate of ﬂow of contaminant  into the container  is aq .  There are 2 contributions to ﬂow 
out  of  the  container.  Fluid  ﬂow  out  of  the  container  removes  contaminant  at  a  rate  −a y  .  And  the 
chemical  reaction  removes  contaminant  at  a  rate  −by(t).  By  the  balance  law  the  ODE  is, 
V 
(cid:1) (t) = aq − by(t) −

(b)(10 points) At time t = 0, the amount of contaminant in the container is y0 .  Using an integrating 
factor,  ﬁnd  y(t) for  t > 0. 
Solution  Denote  λ = b +  a  .  An  integrating  factor  is  eλt ,  which  gives  the  ODE,

(c)(5  points)  In  the  steady-state,  what  is  the  concentration  of  contaminant  in  the  outﬂowing  ﬂuid, 
i.e.  what  is  y(t)/V ?  How  does  the  steady-state  concentration  for  b > 0  compare  to  the  steady-state 
concentration  for  b = 0? 
Solution  The  steady-state  solution  for  y(t) is, 

Antidiﬀerentiating  both  sides, 

y(t) = qV

The  steady-state  concentration  for  b = 0  is  q ,  the  same  as  the  concentration  in  the  inﬂowing  ﬂuid. 
So  when  b >  0,  the  concentration  of  chemical  in  the  outﬂowing  ﬂuid  as  compared  to  the  inﬂowing

ﬂuid  is  decreased  by  a  factor  1+ bV  .

where  y = y(t).  This  ODE  is  exact. 
(a)(10  points)  Find  a  non-constant  function H (t, y)  that  is  constant  on  all  solution  curves.

From  the  ﬁrst  equation,  H (t, y) =  t2  − ty + h(y)  for  some  diﬀerentiable  function  h(t).  From  the 
second  equation,  −t + h(cid:1) (y) =  y − t. So  h(y) =  2

y2  + C  for  some  constant  C .  Setting  C  = 0,  the

(b)(10  points)  Write  down  the  equation  of  a  general  integral  curve  of  this  system.  What  part  or 
parts  of  this  integral  curve  are  solution  curves? 
Solution  The  implicit  equation  of  a  general  integral  curve  is, 
(y − t)2  + t  = C,  C  ≥ 0.

For  C  =  0  this  is  simply  the  point  (0, 0)  (we  ignore  this  case).  For  C >  0,  the  curve  is  an  ellipse. 
� 
There  are  two  solution  curves  on  this  integral  curve, 
√ 
y+ (t) = t + √C − t2 ,  −C  ≤ t ≤ C 
y− (t) = t −  C − t2 ,  −C  ≤ t ≤ C 

(c)(5  points)  If  the  initial  value  y(0) = y0  is  positive,  how much  time  elapses  before  the  solution  of 
the  IVP  is  undeﬁned? 
Solution  The  point  (0, y0 )  lies  on  the  graph  of  the  solution  curve  y+ (t)  for  the  constant  C  =  y0 .

The  solution  becomes  undeﬁned  when  t2  = C  = y0 ,  i.e.  the  elapsed  time  is  y0 .

(b)(5  points) Were  any  solutions  lost  by  making  the  substitution?  If  so,  say  what  they  are. 
Solution  The  solution  is  only  valid  if  y(t) = 0.  The  constant  function  y(t) ≡ 0  is  a  solution  that  is

(b)(10  points)  Find  a  formula  for  the  nth  Picard  iterate,  yn (t).  Justify  your  answer. 
Solution  The  ﬁrst  2  Picard  iterates  suggest  that  yn (t)  is  a  polynomial  of  degree  n, 
yn (t) = an,0  + an,1 t + · · · + an,k tk  + · · · + an,n tn .

Problem  5: 
Name: 
Problem  5(15  points)  Consider  the  ﬁrst-order,  autonomous  ODE, 
y  = y 3  − y . 
(cid:1) 
(a)(10  points)  Find  all  equilibrium  solutions,  sketch  the  state  line,  and  sketch  several  solutions 
including  all  equilibrium  solutions,  and  at  least  one  solution  between  any  2  equilibrium  solutions. 
Solution The  equilibrium  solutions  are  the  zeros  of  the  rate  function.  The  rate  function  factors  as, 
y  − y = y(y  − 1) = y(y − 1)(y + 1).

Thus  there  are  three  equilibrium  solutions  y1 (t) = 1,  y2 (t) = 0  and  y3 (t)  =  0.  For  t > 1,  say  for 
t =  2,  (2)3  − 2 = 6  is  positive.  For  0 < t < 1,  say  t =  2 ,  23  −  1  = − 3  is  negative.  For  −1 < t < 1,
