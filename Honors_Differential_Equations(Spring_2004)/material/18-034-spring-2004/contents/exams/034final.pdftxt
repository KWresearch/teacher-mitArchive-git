book,  closed  notes,  and  calculators  are  not  allowed.  You   will  have  approximately  3   hours  for  this 
exam.  The  point value  of  each  problem  is  written  next  to  the   problem  – use   your   time   wisely.  Please 
show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial  credit  will  be  given   only  for   work  shown. 
You  may  use   either  pencil  or  ink.  If  you  have  a  question,  need   extra  paper,  need  to  use   the   restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.
