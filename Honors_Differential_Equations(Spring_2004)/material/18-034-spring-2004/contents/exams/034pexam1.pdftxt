18.034  PRACTICE  EXAM  1,  SPRING  2004  

Problem  1  A  holding  tank  for  a  chemical   solution   is  run   on  a  2­hour   cycle.  During  the   ﬁrst   hour  
of  the  cycle,  solution  ﬂows  in  at  a  rate  of   a  liters/hour  and  no  solution   ﬂows  out  of   the  tank.  The 
concentration  of   chemical   of  the   inﬂow  is  a  constant  q .  During  the   second  hour   of   the  cycle,  the 
thoroughly  mixed  solution   ﬂows   out  at  a  rate  of   a  liters/hour   and  no  solution  ﬂows   into  the  tank. 
The  volume  of  the  tank  V 
is  so  large  that  it  can  be  considered  as  roughly  constant  through  the 
whole  process.  The  constants  a  and  q  are   positive.  
(a)   Denote  by  y(t)  the  quantity  of  chemical  in  the   tank  after   t  seconds  (t  = 0   corresponds   to  the 
beginning  of  the   cycle).  Find  a  ﬁrst­order  linear  ODE  in   normal   form  that   y(t) satisﬁes. 
(b)  The  quantity  at  time  t  = 0  is  y0 .  Solve  the  corresponding  IVP  for  y(t). 
(c)  In  the  steady   state,  the  quantity   at  time  t  = 2  equals   the  quantity   at  time  t  =  0.  Using  this  
constraint,  ﬁnd  the  steady   state  solution  of  the  IVP. 
Problem  2   The   following  ﬁrst­order  ODE  is   exact,  
2tyy �  +  (y  − 3t2 ) = 0.

(a)   Determine  a   non­constant  function  H (t,  y) that  is  constant  along  all  solution  curves  of   the  ODE. 
(b)  The  region  R  where   the  ODE  is  deﬁned  is  t  >  0,   y >  0.  Find  the  formula  for  the  general  solution  
in  this  region. 
(c)  For  which choices   of  y(1)  >  1  is  it  true  that  the  solution  of   the   corresponding  IVP  is  deﬁned  for 
all  t  >   0? 
Problem  3   The   following  ﬁrst­order  ODE  in  normal  form  is  “homogeneous”, 
3t2  − y

y �  =

(a)  Make  the   substitution,  y(t) =  tu(t),  y �  =  tu�  +  u,  to  change   the  ODE  into   a  separable  ODE  for 
u(t). 
(b)   Solve  the  separable   ODE  for  u(t).  Then  back­substitute  to   ﬁnd  the  solution  for  y(t).  How  does 
this  compare   to  your  solution   in  the  last  problem?

Problem  4  Consider  the  following  IVP, 
y �  =  y2 
, 
y(0)  = 1 
deﬁned   on  the   interval  (−1,  1).  Using  the  ﬁrst­approximation  function  y0 (t)  =  1,   ﬁnd  the  ﬁrst  2 
Picard  iterates,  y1 (t)  and  y2 (t). 
Problem  5   Consider  the  following  ﬁrst­order  autonomous  ODE, 
y �  =  sin(πy).

(a)   Determine   all   equilibrium  solutions. 
(b)  Sketch  the   portion  of  the  state  line  where  −2 − � <  y <  2 + �  (�  a  positive  number   less  than  1).

(c)  Give  a  rough  sketch  of  the  solution  curves  in   the  region   −2 − � < y < 2 + �.  Label  all  equilibrium 
solutions  in  this  region.  Between   every  pair  of   equilibrium  solutions,  sketch  several  solution  curves. 
(d)   For  all  the  equilibrium  solutions  of   the  ODE,  say  which  are  stable,  which   are  unstable,  and 
which  are  neither.

y =  0.  Show   that  for  all  t > t1 ,  the   solution   is  trapped   between  these  curves.
