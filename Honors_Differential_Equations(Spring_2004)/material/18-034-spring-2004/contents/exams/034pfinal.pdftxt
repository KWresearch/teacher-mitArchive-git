18.034  PRACTICE  FINAL  EXAM,   SPRING  2004 

The  ﬁnal  exam  will   be   held  on  Thursday,  May  20,  9:00AM–12:00NOON.  The  ﬁnal  
exam  will  be  closed  notes,  closed  book,  and calculators   will  not  be  permitted.  Scratch  paper   and  a 
stapler  will   be  available.   A  short  list  of  Laplace   transforms  will  be  provided  (the   same   as  the   list  on 
Exam  3).  The  following  problems  are  representative  of  the  problems  on  the  exam. 
Problem  1  Two  diﬀerent  chemical   solutions   are  pumped   into  a  container  of   volume  100  L,  each   at 
the  rate  of  5  L/s,  and  thoroughly  mixed  solution  is   pumped  out  at  the  rate  of   10  L/s.  The  inﬂow 
concentration  of  Chemical  1  is  q1  and  the   inﬂow  concentration  of  Chemical  2  is  q2 .  Denote  the  mass 
of  Chemical  1  by  x1  and  the  mass  of  Chemical  2  by  x2 .  A  catalyst  in  the   container  transforms  
Chemical  1   into  Chemical  2  at  a  rate  0.4x1  per   second.
