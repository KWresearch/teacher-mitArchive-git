Solution:  First  of  all,  L[y � (t)]  =  sY  (s)  and  L[y �� (t)]   =  s2Y  (s)  because  y(0)  =  y � (0)  =  0.   Secondly,

Problem  2: 
Name: 
Problem  2(20  points)  A  real   n  × n  matrix  is   symmetric  if  it  is  equal  to  its   transpose,   i.e.  A  =  AT  .

(a)(10  points)  Let  A  be  the  real  symmetric  2  × 2  matrix  above.  Compute  the  trace,  determinant 
and  characteristic  polynomial  of  A. 
Solution:  The   trace   is  Trace(A) =  a + d,   the  determinant  is  det(A) =  ad − b2 ,  and  the  characteristic 
polynomial  is, 

A  = 

pA (λ) =  λ2  − Trace(A)λ   +  det(A) =  λ2  − (a  +  d)λ  +  (ad  − b2 ). 
(b)(10  points)  Prove   that  every  eigenvalue  of   the  real  symmetric  2 × 2 matrix  A  is  real. 

Solution:  By  the   quadratic  formula,  the  roots  of  pA (λ) are  real   iﬀ  the  discriminant  is   nonnegative,

i.e. 
(−(a  +  d))2  − 4(ad  − b2 ) ≥ 0.  

Simplifying,  this   is, 
a 2  +  2ad  +  d2  − 4ad  +  4b2  =  a  − 2ad  +  d2  +  4b2  = (a  − d)2  +  (2b)2  .

Since  this  is  a   sum  of  squares,   it  is  nonnegative.  So   the   eigenvalues  of   A  are   real.  Moreover,  it  is  
clear  that   the   eigenvalues  are  distinct  unless  b  = 0   and  a  =  d,  i.e.  unless   A  is   a  multiple  of  the 
identity  matrix  (but  none   of  this  was  asked  for  in   the  problem).

Extra   credit(15  points)  Let  A be  a  real   symmetric  n × n  matrix,  where   n  is  arbitrary.   Prove  that

Because  A is  a  real  symmetric   matrix,  for   every   pair  z,  w, 
�Az, w� =  �z, Aw�. 
Let  λ be  an  eigenvalue  of  A,  and  let  z  be  a  (nonzero)  eigenvector   for  λ.  Then, 
λ�z, z� =  �λz, z� =  �Az, z� =  �z, Az� =  �z, λz� =  λ�z, z�. 
Because  z  is  nonzero,  �z, z�  is  nonzero.   Therefore  λ =  λ,  i.e.,   λ is   a  real  number.

Problem  3(25  points)  For  each  of  the  following  matrices  A,  compute  the  following,

A  =  −4  −6 
. 
Solution:  First  of  all,   Trace(A) =   −5  and  det(A) = 1(−6)  − (−4)3  =  −6 +  12  =  6.  Therefore  the 
characteristic  polynomial  is, 
pA (λ) =  λ2  − Trace(A)λ  +  det(A) =  λ2  +  5λ   +  6  = (λ   +  3)(λ  +  2). 
Therefore  the   eigenvalues  are,  

Therefore,  a  basis  for  the   nullvectors   is,  

λ1  =  −3, λ2  =  −3.

For  λ1  =  −3,  the   eigenvectors  are  the  (nonzero)  nullvectors  of  A  +  3I ,  i.e.,

0  0  1 
Solution:  Because  this   is  an  upper  triangular  matrix,  the  trace,  determinant  and   characteristic 
polynomial  are  easy   to  compute:  Trace(A) =  4,   det(A) =  2,  and  the  characteristic   polynomial  is, 
pA (λ) = (λ  − 1)2 (λ  − 2). 
So  the  eigenvalues  are,   λ1  = 1  (with  multiplicity  2)  and   λ2  = 2. 
⎡

For  λ1  = 1,  the  eigenvectors  are   the  (nonzero)  nullvectors  of   A  − I ,  i.e.,
