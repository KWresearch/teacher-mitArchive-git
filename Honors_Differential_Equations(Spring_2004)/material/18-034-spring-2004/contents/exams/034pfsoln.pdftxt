18.034  SOLUTIONS  TO  PRACTICE  FINAL  EXAM,  SPRING  2004 

The  ﬁnal  exam  will   be   held  on  Thursday,  May  20,  9:00AM–12:00NOON.  The  ﬁnal  
exam  will  be  closed  notes,  closed  book,  and calculators   will  not  be  permitted.  Scratch  paper   and  a 
stapler  will   be  available.   A  short  list  of  Laplace   transforms  will  be  provided  (the   same   as  the   list  on 
Exam  3).  The  following  problems  are  representative  of  the  problems  on  the  exam. 
Problem  1  Two  diﬀerent  chemical   solutions   are  pumped   into  a  container  of   volume  100  L,  each  at 
the  rate  of  5  L/s,  and  thoroughly  mixed  solution  is   pumped  out  at  the  rate  of   10  L/s.  The  inﬂow 
concentration  of  Chemical  1  is  q1  and  the   inﬂow  concentration  of  Chemical  2  is  q2 .  Denote  the  mass 
of  Chemical  1  by  x1  and  the  mass  of  Chemical  2  by  x2 .  A  catalyst  in  the  container   transforms 
Chemical  1   into  Chemical  2  at  a  rate  0.4x1  per   second. 
(a)  Determine  the  2 × 2  linear  system  of  1st  order  ODEs  that  x1  and  x2  satisfy. 
Solution:  For  x1  there  are   three  contributions  to   x�
1 .  Chemical   ﬂows   in   at  a  rate  5q1 .  Chemical 
ﬂows  out   at   a  rate   −10  × (x1/100),  i.e.   −0.1x1 .  And  chemical  is  catalyzed   at  a  rate  −0.4x1 .  For  x1 , 
chemical  ﬂows  in  at  a  rate   5q1 ,  chemical  ﬂows   out  at  a  rate   −10  × (x2/100)  =  −0.1x2 ,  and  Chemical  
� 
1  is  catalyzed  into  Chemical  2  at  a   rate  +0.4x1 .  Therefore  the  diﬀerential   equations  are,

(b)   Without  ﬁnding  the  general  solution,  determine  the   steady­state  solution  for   x1  and  x2 . 
Solution:  In  the   steady­state,  x� = 0  and  x� =  0.  Solving  the  equations   gives,   0.5x1  = 5q1  and

Problem  4  Using  the  method  of  undetermined  coeﬃcients,  ﬁnd  a  particular   solution  of  the  inho­

y ��  +  4y �  +  5y  = 5e−2t  cos(t).

Solution:  The   function  5e−2t  cos(t) is  the  real  part  of  5e−2teit .  Therefore  a  particular   solution  yp (t) 
y���  +  4y��  +  5y� = 5e−2t e . 
We  guess  that  a  particular  solution  is  of  the  form  y�(t) =

e(−2+i)t (D2  +  2iD)g(t)

Therefore  y�(t) is  a   particular  solution  iﬀ  g(t) is  a  particular  solution  of  the  diﬀerential  equation, 
(D2  +  2iD)g(t) = 5. 
We  guess  that  g(t) is  a  linear  polynomial  with  undetermined  coeﬃcients  and substitute   in   to  deter­
mine  the  coeﬃcients.  This  gives,

(a)  Find  all  equilibrium  points.

� 
Solution:  The   equilibrium  points  are  the  simultaneous  solutions  of,

(x  +  y)(x  − 1)  = 0, 
(x  − y)(x  +  1)  = 0  
These  are  p1  = (0,  0),  p2  = (1,  1)  and  p3  = (−1,  1). 
(b)  Determine  the  linearization   at  each  equilibrium  point. 
� 
� 
� 
Solution:  The  Jacobian  of  the  system  is, 
x  − 1 
2x  +  y  − 1 
J (x,  y) =  ∂Fi  = 2x  − y  +  1  −x  − 1

(c)  For  each  linearization,  determine   the  eigenvalues.  If  the   eigenvalues  are   complex  conjugates, 
determine  the  rotation  (clockwise   in/out,   counterclockwise  in/out). 
If   the   eigenvalues  are  real,  
determine  roughly   the   eigenvectors  and   the  type  of   the  local  phase  portrait. 
Solution:  For  p1 ,  Trace(A1 ) =  −2  and  det(A1 )  = 2.  So  pA1 (λ) =  λ2  +  2λ  +  2  = (λ  +  1)2  +  1. 
Therefore  the  eigenvalues  are   λ =  −1  ±  i.  So   the  type  is   a  stable  spiral.  Checking  at  a  few 
±
representative  points,  the   rotation  is  counterclockwise  in.

An  eigenvector  for  λ2  =  −2  is, 

For  p2 ,  Trace(A2 )  =   0  and  det(A2 ) =  −4.  So  pA2 (λ) =  λ2  − 4  = (λ − 2)(λ +  2).   Therefore  the 
� 
� 
eigenvalues  are  λ1  = 2  and  λ2  =  −2.  So  the  type  is   a  saddle.   An  eigenvector   for   λ1  = 2  is,

(d)  Using  a  dashed  line,  sketch   the   x­nullcline  and  y ­nullcline.  Draw  a   few  representative   arrows 
indicating  the  direction  of  the   orbits  on  the  nullcline  on  each  side  of   each  equilibrium  point. 
Solution:  The   x­nullcline  consists  of  the   vertical  line  x = 1  and  the   “antidiagonal”   line   y =  −x. 
On  the  line  x = 1,  y �  is  negative  for   y > 1  and  y �  is  positive  for  y < 1.  On  the   line  y =  −x,  y �  is 
positive  for  x > 0,  y �  is  negative  for  −1  < x < 0,  and  y �  is   positive   for   x < −1.  Notice   in  particular 
that  the  line  x = 1  is  a  union  of  orbits. 
The  y ­nullcline  consists  ofthe   vertical   line  x =  −1  and  the  diagonal   line  y =  x.  On  the  line  x =  −1, 
x�  is  negative   for  y > 1  and  x�  is  positive  for  y < 1.  On  the  line  y =  x,  x�  is  positive  for   x > 1,  x�  is 
negative  for  0   < x < 1,  and  x�  is  positive   for  x < 0.  
It   is  also  worth  noting  that  on  the  horizontal  line  y =  1,   the  vector   ﬁeld  is   (x2  − 1, x2  − 1).   In 
particular,  the   direction  is  the  same   as  (−1, −1)  on  the  line   segment  y = 1,  x < 1.  Therefore  any 
|
|
� 
orbit  that  enters  the   strip  bounded  by  the  following  line  segments  is  in  the  basin  of  attraction  of  p1 , 
x =  −1 
� 
y < 1 
� 

y = 1 
−1  < x < 1 

x = 1 
y < 1 

(e)  Sketch  the  phase  portrait.  Use  bold  lines   to  indicate  each  (rough)  separatrix.  Label  the   basins 
of  attraction  (with  the   numbers  1,   2,  3,  etc.  placed  at  some  point  in  the  basin  of  attraction).  Your  
sketch should just  be   a  rough  sketch,  but  it  should   be  qualitatively  correct.  
Solution:  The   orbital  portrait  is   on  the  webpage.  There   is  only  a  single   basin  of   attraction  –  the 
one  associated  to  p1 .  On  the   right  it  is  bounded  by  the  vertical  line   x =  1.   On   the   left  it  is  bounded  
by  the  curve  made   up  of  two  orbits  whose  forward  limit  set  is  p3 ,  each  of   which  is   asymptotic  as 
t → ∞  to   p
3  +  C v4eλ4 t ,  for  C > 0  and  for  C < 0.   The  left  separatrix  is   solid  blue  in  the  image 
given below.
