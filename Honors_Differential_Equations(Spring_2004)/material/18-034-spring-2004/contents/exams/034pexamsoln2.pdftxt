Problem  2  An  undamped  harmonic   oscillator  satisﬁes  the   ODE, 
y ��  +  ω2 y  = 0. 
�

Let  y(t) be  a   solution  of  this   ODE  for  t  <  τ .  At  some  time  τ  >  0,  the  oscillator   is   given  an  impulse 
of  size  v  >  0.  In  other  words,  if

limt
τ −  y(t) =  y0 , 
→
τ −  y � (t)  =  v0

then  for  t  >   τ ,  y(t)  is  a   solution  of   the  IVP, ⎧⎨ y ��  +  ω2y  = 0,

(a)   Write  y(t) in   normal  form  A cos(ωt  − φ) for   t  <  τ ,  and  in  normal  form  y(t) =  B cos(ωt  − ψ) for 
t  >   τ .  Find  an  equation  expressing   B 2  in  terms  of  A2  ,  v0  and  v . 
Solution  For  a  function  z (t)  in  the   form   C  cos(ωt  − θ),  the   derivative   is  z � (t) =  −ωC  sin(ωt  − θ). 
In  particular, 
(ωz )2  +  (z � )2  =  ω2C 2  cos2 (ωt  − θ) +  ω2C 2  sin2 (ωt  − θ) =  ω2C 2  .

(b)   If  the  goal  of  the   impulse   is  to  maximize  the  amplitude  B ,  at  what  moment  τ  in   the  cycle  of  the 
oscillator  should  the   impulse  be   applied?   If   the  goal  is  minimize  the  amplitude   B ,  at  what  moment 
τ  should  the  impulse  be   applied?  
Solution  Maximizing   B  is  the  same   as   maximizing  B 2 .  In  the  equation  above,  A2  ,  ω  and  v  are  the 
same  for  all   values  of   τ .  The  only  quantity   that  varies   is  v0 .  To  maximize  B 2 ,  the  impulse  should   be 
applied  when  v0  is  as  large   as  possible,  at  the   moment  when  y0  = 0  and  y � (t) >  0.   In  other  words, 
when 
1 
τ   = (φ +  (2n   − 1/2)π). 
ωτ  − φ  = (2n  − 1/2)π , 
ω
Similarly,  to  minimize  B ,  the  impulse  should  be  applied  when  v0  is  as  negative  as  possible,   at  the 
moment   when  y0  = 0  and  y � (t) <  0.  In  other  words,  when 
1 
ωτ  − φ  = (2n  +  1/2)π , 
τ   = (φ +  (2n   +  1/2)π).

Solution  The   characteristic   polynomial  is, 
p(z ) =  z  3  +  1.  
One  evident  root  is  z  =  −1.  Factoring  this  out  gives, 
z  3  +  1  = (z  +  1)(z  − z  +  1).

Problem  4  The   linear  ODE,  

y ��  +  (t  − 3/t)y �  − 2y  = 0, 
has  a  basic  solution   pair   y1 (t) =  e−t2 /2  ,  y2 (t) =  t2  − 2.  
(a)   Find  the  Wronskian  W [y1 ,  y2 ](t).

2t. 

So  the  Wronskian  is, 

2te−t2 /2  − (−t)(t − 2)e−t2 /2  =  t3 e−t2 /2  .

(b)  Use  variation  of  parameters   to  ﬁnd  a  particular  solution  of   the  driven  ODE, 
y ��  +  (t  − 3/t)y �  − 2y  =  t .

K (t,  s) = (y1 (s)y2 (t) − y1 (t)y2 (s))/W  [y1 ,  y2 ](s).

By  (a),   W (s) =  s
K (t,  s) = (e−s2 /2 (t2  − 2)  − e−t2 /2 (s 2  − 2))/(s 3 e−s2 /2 ).
