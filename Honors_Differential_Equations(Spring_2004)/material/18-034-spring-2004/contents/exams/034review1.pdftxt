18.034 REVIEW  SHEET  FOR   EXAM  1 

Instructions:  You  will  have   approximately  50  minutes  for  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed  book, 
closed  notes  and  calculators  are   not  permitted.  You  will  not  need  a  blue  book,  there   will  be   lots  of 
scratch  paper  provided,   as  well   as  a  stapler  and  paper  clips  in  case  you   have   to  attach  pages  to  the 
exam  packet. 
The  test  will  consist  of  5  problems,  many  with  several  parts.  The  point  value   of  each  problem  and 
each  part   of  a  problem  will   be  given.  The  test  will   cover  the  material  from  Unit  I.  As  in  all  tests,  
you  should  ﬁrst  read  through  all   the  problems  and  then  manage  your   time  accordingly.  The   test   is  
mostly  computational,  but  the   computations  are  simple  (not  much  multiplying   or   dividing),   if  done 
properly.  What  follows  are  a  list  of  suggestions  to  help   you  in  studying  for   the   exam. 
1:  Know  the  homework.  There   will  be  at  least  one  problem   on   the  exam  which   is  very  similar 
to   a  problem  or  problems  from  the  ﬁrst  two  problem  sets  (but  not  Problem  1  from  Problem  Set  2). 
2:  Know  how  to  model   a  simple   system:  given  a  real­world   problem,  how  to  ﬁnd  an  ODE  that  the 
state  variable  satisﬁes. 
3:  Know  how  to   use  the  method  of   integrating  factors  to  ﬁnd   the  general   solution  of  a  ﬁrst­order 
linear  ODE.  
4:  Given  a  particular  solution  to  a   ﬁrst­order   linear  ODE,  know  how  to   ﬁnd   the  general  solution. 
Know  how  to  identify  the   steady­state  solution,  and  the  half­life  if  applicable. 
5:  Given  a   ﬁrst­order  ODE  in  normal  form,  an  initial  value,  and   a   ﬁrst­approximation  y0 (t)  to  the 
solution,  know  how   to   compute  the  ﬁrst  few  Picard   iterates. 
6:  Given  a  ﬁrst­order  ODE,   know  how  to  ﬁnd  the  isoclines  and  give  a  rough  sketch  of  the  slope 
ﬁeld.  If  asked,  know  how   to  prove  that  given  curves  are  envelopes/fences  (you  will   not  be   asked  to 
ﬁnd  the  curves   yourself ).  
7:  Know  how  to  solve  a  ﬁrst­order  separable  ODE.  Know  how  to  solve  a  ﬁrst­order   exact  ODE. 
Know  how  to  determine   if  any   solutions   are  lost  by  this  process. 
8:  Know  the  diﬀerence between  integral   curves  and  solution   curves.  Know  how  to   say  what  parts 
of  an  integral  curve   are   solution   curves. 
9:  Given  a  ﬁrst­order  autonomous  ODE,  know  how  to  determine  all  equilibrium  solutions,  how  to 
sketch  the  state  line,  how  to  give  a   rough  sketch  of   the  slope  ﬁeld  and  solution  curves,   and  how  to 
determine  whether  an  equilibrium  solution  is  stable,  unstable  or   neither. 
10:  You  will  not  be  asked  to  quote  theorems.  You  will  not  be   asked  to  prove   theorems.   You  will  
not  be  asked  to  numerically  approximate  solutions  of   an   ODE.   You   will  be   asked  to justify  your 
answers,  but  your  arguments  need  only  be  convincing,  not  100%  rigorous.  Also,  if  you  refer  to  a 
theorem,  it  is  just  as  good  –  in   fact  better   –  to  state  what  the  theorem  asserts  with  all  necessary 
hypotheses.  

Obviously  you  won’t  be   tested  on  all  the  concepts just  listed,   but  if  you  are   comfortable  with 
these  concepts,  you  should  do  well   on  the  test.  Focus  especially  on  the  computational  concepts 
above.
