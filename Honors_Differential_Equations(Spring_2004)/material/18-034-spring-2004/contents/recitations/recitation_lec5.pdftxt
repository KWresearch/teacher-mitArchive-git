1.  There are several topics about the general existence/ uniqueness thm that I would have 
liked to discuss if there were time. If you would like to discuss them, that would be 
great. 

 
A.  Bounds on the growth of y(t) and y’(t). If f(t,y) is bounded by M, then y(t) satisfies a 
Lipschitz constant M. In particular, “pathological” behaviors like vertical asymptotes or 
wild oscillation always occur because f(t,y) becomes unbounded. 

 
B.  Numerical approximation of a sol’n. We can find “piece-wise linear envelopes” for the 
graph of y(t) as follows: On a small box [t0-a,t0-a]x[y0-b,y0-b] suppose

repeat with those as our initial values to get larger large piece-wise linear envelopes.

by using 
smaller 
boxes 

Then we can improve these envelopes 
to get better bounds on the true sol’n. 
The same steps as in our proof of 
existence/ uniqueness can be used to 
prove these envelopes do converse to 
a sol’n. 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

 
C.  (Non)- existence/ uniqueness if some hypothesis fail: 
They have a homework exercise about this.
