I talked with one student, and I believe the methodical approach of the last 2 lectures has 
helped students catch-up. Unfortunately it has left us behind schedule. We’ve already done 
most of §3.7, but there is a bit more to go. And inhomog. systems of the 
form p(D)[y] =  eαt  cos βt • h(t) ,  h  a poly., will be easy with our setup. But we probably 
won’t get to §3.8. And §4.1, §4.3 might need to be done in Wed. rec. 

1.	 Examples of homog. const. coeff. linear systems w/ complex roots/ eigenvalues, no 
repeated roots.  

(D2  + ω2 )y  =  0


y  = C1 cos  (ωt ) + C2 sin  (ωt ) =  A cos  (ωt ) .

4.	 Phase  p ∝ traits  for overdamped, underdamped, crit. damped SHO? (probably not crash 
time)
