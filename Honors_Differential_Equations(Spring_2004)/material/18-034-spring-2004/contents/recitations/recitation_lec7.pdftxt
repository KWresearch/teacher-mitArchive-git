Rec. Suggestion. 

Review. 
There will be no numerical approximation on the exam, so it is not vital to discuss 
this in recitation. Of course autonomous ODE’s, separable ODE’s and exact ODE’s will be on the 
exam and were covered on Wed. so it is probably better to discuss this in recitation. In lecture I 
will begin reviewing for Exam 1, and on Wed. there can be “last-minute review”. 

Also, if there is confusion/ frustration about Exercise 1 from last week’s PS, please talk about 
this and reassure the students this is not a typical problem and most problems will be much less 
abstract (and no exam problems will be so abstract). 

There seems to be concern among students about our grades. Please try to get a sense of this 
and let me know what’s going on.
