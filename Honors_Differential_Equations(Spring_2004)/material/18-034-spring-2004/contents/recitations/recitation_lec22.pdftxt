1.	 Green’s kernel: I don’t know how important this is in applications. We have seen the 
Green’s kernel for 2nd order operators, we will see more about that in Monday’s lecture, 
and we will see Green’s kernels again for constant coeff. linear systems in the next unit. 
(So there is “over kill” w/ Green’s kernels). 

There are a few other fun things to do, like Example A in§3 of the handout. Also, given 
linear differential operators L and M, what is the relationship b/w the Green’s kernels for 
L and M and for L◦M say KL(s,t), KM(s,t) and KL◦M(s,t).
