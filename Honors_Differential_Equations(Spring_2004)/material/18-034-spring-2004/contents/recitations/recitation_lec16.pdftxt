1.	 We didn’t do any variation of param’s problem in lecture. There will be a variation of 
param’s problems on the exam. Emphasize that they should know the formula 
t

even if they don’t know how to derive it. May be see this says for a linear, const. coeff. 
(K(s,t) =  k(t-s)) .

2.	 Fourier coeff. problem. We haven’t yet computed any Fourier coeffs. of an actual funct. 
By even/odd,  An =  0  all n. 
f(t) =  t . 
E.g. 
(− 1)  2L
t  = ∑ (− 1)  2L

3.	 We haven’t talked about how even/odd determines some coeffs are O. 

4.	 We haven’t discussed (and we are not going to prove) that the Fourier series converges 
uniformly/ pointwise to f(t) if f(t) is cts. 

5.	 Most important: Begin reviewing for Exam 2.
