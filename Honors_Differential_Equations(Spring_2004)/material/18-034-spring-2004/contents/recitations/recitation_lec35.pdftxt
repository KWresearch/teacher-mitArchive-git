I gave the students a criterion for “structural stability” of a linear system: The system is 
structurally stable iff  
(1) every eigenvalue has mult. 1, 
(2) every eigenvalue has nonzero real part.  
I did this with the caveat that this is actually meaningless, it only makes sense to talk 
about a property of a system being structurally stable. Nonetheless, it led to questions 
which, honestly, I am not able to answer: e.g. is the property of a saddle that there 
exists 4 orbits whose 
 or 
 equals 0 a structurally stable property?

Anything you want to add will be much appreciated. Next time I will probably define the 
winding number of a vector field about a circle and the index of a nondegenerate 
equilibrium point. 
 
I wanted to sketch the orbital portrait for a damped pendulum:

Unfortunately, I didn’t have time. If you want to do this, it would be great.
