Eq. pts = (0, 0) and (-1, 2). 
At (0, 0), get a stable spiral, spiraling clockwise in. 
At (-1, 2), get a node W/ eigenvector, eigenvalue pairs:

These portraits were originally given in Lecture 16. Next time we will discuss stability 
& structural stability and generalize to arbitrary 2D linear systems.
