1.  Began by defining (again) equilibrium solution, nondegenerate equilibrium and 
degenerate equilibrium. Then I defined stable, asymptotically stable, neutrally stable, 
unstable, attractor, repeller and basin of attraction. If for every initial value x0, the

2.  Proved basic thms about equilibrium points of a linear system. 

 

x' =
Rmk:  The equilibrium points of 
 are precisely nullvectors of A. Up to a 
Ax
translation, each nullvector is equivalent to the origin. 
 
x' =
Thm 8.1.3:  The system 
 is stable at the origin iff  
Ax
(1) every eigenvalue has nonpositive real part 
(2)  for each eigenvalue 
βλ i=
0=β ), the eigenspace is not 
 (possibly 
deficient. 
(B) The system is asymptotically stable at the origin iff every eigenvalue has negative 
real part. 
 
 
3.  For a 2x2 linear system, went through most of the case (depending on whether det(A) is 
>0, =0, <0, trace(A) is >0, =0, <0 and whether 4det(A)-trace(A)2 is >0, =0, <0).
