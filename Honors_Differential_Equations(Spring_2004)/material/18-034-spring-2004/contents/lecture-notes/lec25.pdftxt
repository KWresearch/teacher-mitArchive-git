1.  Discussed the approach to the Green’s Kernel via the Laplace operator. Let p(D) be a 
constant coeff. linear differential operator of order n+1 and let f(t) be a function of 
 be the solution of the IVP 
exponential type. Let y(t), 
t ≥
0
p(D)y =
p(D)y =
  Let yn(t) be the sol’n of 
f(t)

y(0) =

Then we have p(s)

Q(s)
for some poly. Q(s) of degree ≤ n and 

F(s)

 

F(s) =

And saw it involved more computation than the usual Laplace operator method (which 
we did in lecture on Monday). 
 
3.  Very quickly reviewed what a system of linear ODE’s is , introduced matrix notation for 
such a system,
