Gave the example of the number of equilibrium points. 
 
Prop: Let R C IRn be a bounded closed region. If  
(1)  these are no equilibrium points or  R∂  
(2)  these are only finitely many equilibrium points in Int (R),

3. Defined orbits + orbital portrait for a system (obviously closely related to the 
orbital portraits from Ch.3) 
 
Defined nullclines. Worked through the example

4. Gave algorithm for sketching an orbital portrait for an autonomous 2D system. 
 
Step 1 : Find all equilibrium points. 
 
Step 2 : For each equilibrium point, draw the “local picture” (if it is nondegenerate + 
structurally stable) 
 
Step 3 : Draw the nullclines and other “fences” (i.e. curves that help to determine 
basins of attraction). 
 
Step 4 : Interpolate between the local pictures to give a rough sketch.
