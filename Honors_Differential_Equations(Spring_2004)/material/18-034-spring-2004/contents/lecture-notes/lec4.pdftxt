1. Cauchy sequences and complete metric spaces. 
 
A metric space is complete if it “has no holes”. What does this mean? A metric space “has a 
hole” if there is a sequence that “should converse”, but such that there is no limit. The 
sequences which “should converse” are Cauchy sequences.

Pf: Suppose (yi) is Cauchy. Then for every t in [a,b], the sequence of real numbers (yi,(t)) i=0,1,… 
, is a Cauchy sequence. Because IR  is complete, (yi,(t)) converges to some real number. Call 
this number y(t).

If we knew that y(t) is continuous, it would follow that (yi) converses to y. So let’s prove y(t) is 
continuous. Let t be any element in [a,b]. By the claim, there exists N ≥ 0 such that for all n ≥ N,

So y(t) is continuous. Therefore y(t) is an element of C([a,b], IR ), and the sequence (yi(t)) 
converges to y(t). 
 
Variation: The metric space 
 
Proof: The only new step is to prove that the limit y(t) has graph contained in
