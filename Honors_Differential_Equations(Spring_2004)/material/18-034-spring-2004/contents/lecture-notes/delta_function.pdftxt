An application of the Dirac delta function

1.  A result from multivariable calculus 
Let (s,t) be coordinates on IR 2. Let U  ⊂  IR 2 be an open region and let a1<b1, 
a2<b2 be real numbers such that the multi-interval [a1, b1] × [a2, b2] is contained 
in U. Let y (s, t) be a continuously differentiable function on U. Define the 
function y(t) on [ a2, b2] by,

Therefore yd (t) is the solution of the IVP. 
 
Remark 9: Even if f(t) isn’t continuous, the Green’s operator G[f] is often defined 
and is the best candidate for a solution of the IVP. For linear PDE’s, a Green’s 
operator is also defined and plays a central role in the study of linear PDE’s.

Why should K(s, t) satisfy the initial value problem that it does? 
 
The most direct answer to both questions uses the Direct delta function R. The main 
observation is the following.

s

Then y(t)= ∫

s

Ly(t)= ∫
s
0
 
This is not difficult to prove. Since the proof is not directly relevant, it is omitted. 
t
1
∫
t
0
Of course f(s, t) is a fictional function that is certainly not continuous. But the 
observation motivates us to hope we can make sense of the ODE Ly(s, t)=f(s)R (t-s) 
t
1
and that y(t)=  ∫
t
0
There is one straight forward reduction. Suppose we can make sense of Ly= R (t-s) 
and let K(s, t) be a solution. Then, by linearity of L, L(f(s)K(s,t))= f(s)L K(s,t) = 
f(s)R (t-s). So we can take y(s,t)= f(s)K(s,t) leading to the equation

Now the continuous function is of the form 

 will be a solution of Ly(t)=f(t).

We need to impose some conditions that are less easy to justify. We consider the IVP  
Ly= f(t) 
 
 
y(t0)=0 
    : 
 
 
y(n) (t0)=0 
 
 

We know that if fa and fb are 2 functions s.t. fa(t)= fb(t) 
for t0 ≤ t ≤ t2 , then ya(t)= yb(t) for t0 ≤ t ≤ t2, i.e. the 
solution of the IVP on [t0, t2] depends only on the value 
of f on [t0, t2].

 K(s, t) is a solution 
So for t < s, K(s, t)=0. Since R(t-s)=0 for t > s, also for t > s 
of the homog. equation, L K(s, t)=0. If K(s, t) were n-times differentiable in t, it

the solution of the IVP  LK(s, t)=0, K(s, s)=…..=K(n+1) (s, s)=0, namely K(s, t)=0. 
 
This choice certainly does not lead to a solution of Ly=f(t)!  Therefore, we should not 
expect K(s, t) to be (n+1)- times diff. It turns out the best we can hope for is that 
K(s, t) is (n-1)- times continuously differentiable and (n+1)- times piecewise 
continuously differentiable. 
 
It may occur to the reader that we need not assume even this. The best response is 
that this is the assumption that leads to a true theorem. Another justification is 
nature: real-world systems that are modeled by linear differential operators do 
exhibit this behavior: If you kick a soccer ball, it does not instantaneously move 10 
meters away. Rather the position of the ball is continuous and the velocity of the ball 
is piecewise continuous. 
 
Since K,…., K(n-1) are continuous, for t > s this leads to the conditions,

So u(s) = 1. 
 
This leads to the definition that Ks(t) for t ≥ s is the unique solution of the IVP,
