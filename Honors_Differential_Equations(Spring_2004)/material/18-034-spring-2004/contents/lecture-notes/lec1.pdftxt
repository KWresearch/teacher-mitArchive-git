1.  Discussed general idea of modeling a real-world problem with a D.E. 
(i) 
Set-up the model: decide on relevant independent variables, 
relevant dependent variables or state variables, relevant constants/ 
parameters, and use real-world lens to find a diff. equations the 
dependent variables satisfy. 
Analyze the D.E.: Find a closed form solution, prove existence and 
uniqueness, determine long-time behavior, determine dependence 
of solution on the parameters, etc. 
Interpret the mathematical analysis in terms of the original 
problem: Does a population become extinct? Does feedback cause 
a spring to break? Will increasing harvesting of a predator in a 
predator-prey system increase/ decrease the equil. pop. of the 
prey.

2.  Terminology: PDE, independent variable, dependent variable, solution, ODE, 
interval, initial time, initial value, initial condition, IVP, order, linear ODE, 
nonlinear ODE, normal form, autonomous.

Exactly solved and observed existence doesn’t rerr. hold, and uniqueness doesn’t 
hold.
