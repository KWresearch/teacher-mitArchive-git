0.  Handed back exams w/ brief discussion. 
 
1.  Introduced 2nd order ODE’s w/ spring model 
mx”  = Net force = Force of spring + Force of dashpot

Discussed existence/ uniqueness/ maximal extension thm (follows from our earlier 
general thm + exponential bound on y(t)).

Defined the characteristic poly P(r) assoc’d to a constant coeff., linear homog. ODE.
