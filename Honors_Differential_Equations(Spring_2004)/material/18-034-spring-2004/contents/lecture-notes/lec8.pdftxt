2.  Quickly talked about the “piecewise linear envelope” interpretation of existence/ uniqueness 
thm. Talked about difficulty w/ carrying out Picard iterates algorithm. Sequel to trying to 
find piecewise linear approx. of true solution.

error En decreases w/ h. 

 
4.  Defined order of a discretization scheme. Defined 1-step and multi-step methods. 
 
5.  Gave Heun’s method and explained geometrically what it does (interpolates secant slope 
from 2 tgt slopes). 
Gave Runge-Kutta 4.  
 
6.  Someone asked about “reduction of order” to 1st-order systems, so I quickly explained this 
(but will return in greater detail later)
