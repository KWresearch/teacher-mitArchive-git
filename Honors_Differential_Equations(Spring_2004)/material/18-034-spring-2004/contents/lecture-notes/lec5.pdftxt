1.  Quickly reviewed the proof of existence/uniqueness on a small interval, [t0, t0+C] 
 
2.  Explained how to do the same for [t0-c, t0], and then patch the 2 solutions. Checked the 
solution is diff. at to. 

3.  Explained how uniqueness on small open intervals implies uniqueness on all open 
intervals. 

 
4.  Defined what a “solution in D” is. We did this before in lecture, but I thought it was best 
to review it. 

 
5.  Used uniqueness on arbitrary intervals to prove that there is an interval (a,b) and a
