1.  Plotting   functions 
In  this  section,   the   basics  of  plotting   functions   in  MATLAB  are  described.  Throughout  we  work 
with  the  example  of  two  functions,  f (t) = (2t  +  1)e−t  sin(t),  and  g(t) = (t  − 1)e−t  cos(t). 
Step   1,  Specify  the  domain:  Functions  are  deﬁned   on   an  interval  called  the   domain.  To  plot 
the  function  in  MATLAB,  you  need   to  specify  the  domain.  Every  domain  has   a  left  endpoint,  a, 
and  a   right  endpoint,  b.  Of  course  MATLAB   does   not  plot  the  value  of   the  function  at  every  point  
between  the  a  and  b,  only  ﬁnitely  many  points   with  a  regular   spacing  h.  The  syntax  to   specify  the 
domain  is, 
>> t  =  a  :  h  :  b 
For  example,   to  plot  our  function  on  the  interval [−1, 1]  with  step  size  0.05,  the  syntax  is, 
>>  t  =  ­1:0.05:1 
just  the  ordered  list  of  the 
One  word  about  this.   Technically  x  is  a  data  type  called  an   array : 
numbers  a,  a + h, a + 2h, .  .  .  .  The  syntax  for   arithmetic  with  an  array  in  MATLAB  is  diﬀerent  than 
the  syntax   for   arithmetic   with   a  number.  
Step  2,  Specify  the  function:  Here  is  a   list  of   common  operations  used  to  deﬁne  functions,  and  
the  corresponding  syntax  in  MATLAB.   In  the  list,  y(t)  and  z (t)  are  names  for  functions   or  pieces 
of  functions  that  are   already  speciﬁed. 

Operation 
MATLAB  Syntax 
y(t) +  z (t) 
y  +  z 
y(t)z (t) 
y.*  z 
y(t)n 
y.^n  
y(t)/z (t) 
y./z  
sin(y(t)) 
sin(y)  
cos(y(t)) 
cos(y)  
ey(t) 
exp(y)  
ln(y(t)) 
log(y)  
log10 (y(t)) 
log10(y)  
For  example,  if  the   range  t  has  already  been  deﬁned,   the  function   (2t  +  1)e−t  sin(t) is  speciﬁed  by, 
>> y  = ( 2  .*   t   +  1  ).*   exp(  ­1.* t  ).*   sin( t  ) 
Similarly,  the   function   (t  − 1)e−t  cos(t)  is  speciﬁed  by,  
>> z  = ( t  ­ 1  ).*  exp(   ­1.* t  ).*  cos( t  ) 

Step   3,  Plot  the   function:  The  syntax  to   produce   a   2D­plot  whose  domain  is  t  and  whose   function 
is  y  is, 
>>  h  =  plot(t,y) 
Note,  you  do  not  need  to  say  “h   =”,  but  this  can  be  useful   if   you  want  to   manipulate   the  plot  later. 
MATLAB  will  produce   the   plot  in   a  new  window. 
Step   4,  Plotting   a   parametrized  curve;  Several  plots  at  once:  MATLAB  can  plot  a 
parametrized  ﬁgure.  For  instance,  for  the  parametrized  curve   (y , z ) where   y(t) = (2t  +  1)e−t  sin(t), 
z (t) = (t   − 1)e−t  cos(t),  the   syntax  is,

>>  i  =  plot(y,z) 
where  y  and   z  are  speciﬁed  as  above.  Note  that  when  plotting  parametrized  curves,  it   is  still 
necessary to   specify  the   t­domain.  But  t  doesn’t  explicitly  appear  in  the   syntax  of   the  plot. 
Also,  MATLAB  can   plot  several  graphs  (or   parametrized  curves)  simultaneously.  For  simplicity, 
think  of  a  graph  as   a  parametrized  curve  (t, y(t)).   For   a  number   of  parametrized  curves,  say 
(y1 (t), z1 (t)),  (y2 (t), z2 (t)),  the  syntax  to  plot  both   of   these  curves  in  a   single  ﬁgure   is, 
>>  j  =  plot(y1,z1,y2,z2) 
Any  number  of  curves  can   be   plotted  in  a  single  ﬁgure:  just  write  plot(y1, z1, . . . , yn, zn),  where 
the  functions  y1, . . . , yn  and  z1, . . . , zn   have  already  been  speciﬁed.  To  simultaneously  graph  the 
functions  y and  z  above  over  the   interval  t,  the  syntax  is, 
>>  k  =  plot(t,y,t,z) 

Step  5,  Print  or  export  your  plot:  To  either  print  your  plot  or  to  export  it  as  a  JPEG   ﬁle,   click 
on  the  “File”  button  of  the  new   window  and  then  click  on  “Print”   or  “Export”   in  the   pop­up  menu. 
There  are  other  extras   that  you   can  ﬁnd  out  by  experimenting  (such  as  adding   labels  to   your   axes).
