1. Terminology: Let S be a subset of the plane IR 2. An interior point of S is a point (t0,y0)
for which there exits a, b>0 (depending on S and (t0,y0)) such that

 is contained in S. The notation

The interior of S is the collection of all interior points of S. The closure of S is the set of 
all limit points of S. According to your textbook, a region is a set that is equal to its
interior. This is different than the def’n I gave in lecture (and which many
mathematicians use), that a region is a set R that is contained in the closure of its
interior. According to this terminology, an “open region” is a set that is equal to its
interior, and a “closed region” is a set that is equal to the closure of its interior.
However, I will follow the notation in the book from here on.

Let R be a region (= “open region”) in IR 2 and let
other words,  (1) D is a subset of R; 
(cid:141)D
(2) there exists N>0 such that D
(3) D is the closure of its interior.

Also, since it doesn’t follow automatically from the above, we usually also demand that D
is not empty.

1(t)=y(t)

(3) Maximal extendability: A formal consequence of (1) & (2) is that there exists 
a solution where (a,b) is the largest possible interval on which any solution is 
defined.
(4) Endpoints of y: The endpoints of the graph of y(t) lie on the boundary of D.

The proof of the theorem proceeds in several stages. Most of the proof is carried out after 
replacing D by a small rectangle containing (t0,y0) (at the end, it will be shown how to deduce
the theorem from this case).

4. Metric spaces; Contraction mappings. 

There is a useful language, sometimes not introduced until 18.100, of metric spaces. The idea is 
to identify and make abstract all properties of Euclidean space that can be stated and proved
using only the distance function.

Def’n: A metric space is a pair (X,

) consisting of a set X and a real-valued function 

(cid:119)
defined for all pairs p,q of elements of X, and that satisfies: 
(cid:116)
(cid:119)
(0) for all p,q , 
0

(p,
(cid:119)
(cid:32)
 iff (= “if and only if”) p=q

q)

 (i.e. (cid:119)  is “symmetric”)
(2) for all p,q, 
(q,
q)
(p,
p)
(cid:119)(cid:14)
(cid:119)
(cid:119)(cid:100)
 (this is called the “triangle inequality”).

2 very interesting examples.
(1) Let [a,b] be any interval in IR . Let C([a,b], IR ) denote the set of all real-valued continuous
(cid:119)
(cid:32)
 maximum value of 
functions y(t) defined on [a,b]. The distance is defined to be

Exercise (not to be handed in): Check that (cid:119) (y1,y2) satisfies the triangle inequality.

Given a mapping T defined on X and taking values in X, a fixed point is an element p in X such
T(p) (cid:32)
fixed by T. Many important theorems in mathematics are descriptions of 
, i.e. p is
that
p
fixed points of certain mappings. One of the simplest theorems is the “contraction mapping
fixed point thm”. 

Thm [Contraction mapping fixed point thm, part I]: Let T be a contraction mapping on

(X,(cid:119) .
)

There is at most 1 fixed point of T.

Pf: If T has no fixed points, the theorem is vacuously true. Thus suppose there exists a fixed
p (cid:32)

(cid:119)
)
  (b/c 
point p. Let q be any point other than p. Then

The second half of this theorem will assert that there exists a fixed point of T if T is an (cid:304)-
