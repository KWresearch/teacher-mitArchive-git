Behind_the_Scenes_at_MIT is a collection of short videos that feature MIT
researchers explaining how a textbook chemistry topic is essential to their
research and to an inspiring real-world application. The videos were produced
by the Drennan_Research_and_Education_Laboratory as part of an Howard_Hughes
Medical_Institute (HHMI) Professors grant to Professor Cathy Drennan at MIT.
The videos were created for MITâs general chemistry course, 5.111 Principles
of Chemical Science, and for other educators to bring the why and the who of
chemistry research into introductory classes.
The science videos can be searched by chemistry topic (i.e. atomic theory,
bonding, acid-base equilibrium) or by research application. A set of
accompanying personal videos, one for each scientist featured, illustrates the
journeys to becoming a scientist. Some of these videos highlight challenges
that have been overcome, such as dealing with learning disabilities, growing up
gay and intellectual in a conservative small town, and having to learn English
in order to understand science class.
The goals in creating these videos were to bring the excitement of MIT research
into the chemistry classroom and to illuminate both the why and the who of
chemistry. These videos are intended to help motivate students to learn
chemistry, inspire students to tackle important scientific problems in their
future careers, and expose students to the many faces of chemistry.
The videos can be viewed online or downloaded for use in the classroom. Each
science video is under three minutes, and the personal videos are three to five
minutes in length. Teachers are welcome to use any or all of these videos in
their classrooms. Video creation was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute (HHMI) through an HHMI Professors Grant to Professor Cathy Drennan
and is licensed under a Creative_Commons_Attribution_2.0_Unported_License.
