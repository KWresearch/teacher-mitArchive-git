Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
***** Textbooks *****

for Insight. 4th ed. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2007. ISBN:
9781429209656.

***** Lecture Notes *****
Lecture notes (with blanks) are provided for each lecture. Students are
expected to follow along during the lecture in order to fill in the blanks in
the notes.
***** Grading *****
Grades will be based on a total of 750 points.
             Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                            POINTS
Three one-hour exams (3 x 100 points) 300
Three-hour final exam                 300
Problem sets                          100
Attendance and in-class "quizzes"     50
***** Homework *****
There will be 10 problem sets assigned during the semester. Assignments will be
graded, and will be worth a total of 100 points of your final grade. The
problem sets are not included in these course materials.
***** Exams *****
There will be three hour-long exams during the semester and a three-hour-long
final exam. All exams are closed-book and closed-notes. Most required equations
and a periodic table will be provided.
***** Biology Topics *****
In an effort to illuminate connections between chemistry and biology and spark
students'Â excitement for chemistry, we incorporate frequent biology-related
examples into the lectures. These in-class examples range from two to ten
minutes, designed to succinctly introduce biological connections without
sacrificing any chemistry content in the curriculum.
AÂ list of the biology-, medicine-, and MIT research-related examples used in
5.111 is provided inÂ  Biology-Related_Examples.
***** Significant Figures *****
Rules for scientific notation and significant figures are available in the back
of the textbook in Appendix 1, pages A5-A6. You are also responsible for
knowing the following SI prefixes: n (nano, 10-9), Âµ (micro, 10-6), m (milli,
10-3), c (centi, 10-2), and k (kilo, 103)
***** Clicker Questions *****
We will use classroom response devices during lectures to take attendance,
enable feedback, and facilitate occasional in-class quizzes. We have outlined
the following points to help clarify the class policies regarding clicker use.
Why are we using clickers?
   1. Clickers give us additional feedback on whether the class as a whole
      understands a given concept or when our explanations need to be expanded
      or clarified. This enables us to gauge the understanding of the entire
      class and adjust our lessons accordingly.
   2. Clickers also provide you as a student feedback on how well you
      understand the material and how fast you are able to solve problems. For
      example, if you are able to solve the homework problems but run out of
      time on in-class slicker questions, it is a good indication that you will
      be pinched for time on the exam and may need to work through more
      practice problems to increase your speed.
   3. We feel it is appropriate to reward the many students that consistently
      come to class and participate. In addition, because we take attendance we
      feel more comfortable posting lecture notes online.
Answering in-class clicker questions
   1. Apart from announced in-class quiz questions, you will not be graded on
      whether you answer clicker questions correctly.
   2. For routine clicker questions, you are encouraged to attempt the question
      on your own, but you are certainly allowed to quietly discuss the problem
      with your neighbor. For announced quiz questions, any talking or sharing
      answers in considered cheating.
