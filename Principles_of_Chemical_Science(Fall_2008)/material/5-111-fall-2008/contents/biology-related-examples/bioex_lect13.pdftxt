Polar Covalent Bonds/Polar Molecules 
See lecture 13 for an discussion of polar covalent bonds and polar versus non-polar 
molecules. 

A  polar  covalent  bond  is  an  unequal  sharing  of  electrons  between  two  atoms  with 
different  electronegativities  (χ).  In  general,  a  bond  between  two  atoms  with  an  χ 
difference of 0.4 to 1.7 (on the Pauling scale) is considered polar covalent. 

Polar molecules have a non-zero net dipole moment. 

non-polar

polar

Both CO2  and H2O have two polar bonds.  However the dipoles in the linear CO2 
molecule cancel each other out, meaning that the CO2  molecule is non-polar.  The polar 
bonds in the bent H2O molecule result in a net dipole moment, so H2O is polar. 

In large organic molecules, such as drugs and vitamins, and in biomolecules, such as 
proteins, we often consider the number of polar groups within the molecule to determine 
the extent to which the overall molecule is polar. 

Example 1) from page 1 of Lecture 13 notes: The significance of polarity in vitamins 

For example, let’s compare vitamin A to vitamin B9 
Which vitamin contains a higher number of polar bonds?  vitamin ________ 

Vitamin A 
________________ soluble 

Vitamin B9 (folic acid) 
________________ soluble

polar  and water  is polar, vitamin A  is water soluble  and vitamin B9  is  fat  soluble (like 
dissolves like). 

Polar bonds in vitamin A: 

Polar bonds in folic acid (vitamin B9): 

Let’s think about what this means in terms of our daily multivitamins. 
•	 Folic  acid  (vitamin  B9)  is  water  soluble,  which  means  it  is  excreted  in  our  urine 
comparatively quickly from our bodies. 
•	 Since folic acid and other water soluble vitamins,  such as vitamin C, are  excreted 
in  our  urine,  it  is  important  to  get  a  regular  supply  of  those  vitamins.  Also,  we 
don’t  need  to  worry  about  overdosing.  Any  excess  vitamin  will  end  up  in  our 
urine. 
•	 Vitamin A  is not water  soluble,  so  it can be  stored  in fat cells and build up  in our 
bodies. 
It  is  possible  to  get  too  much  of  a  good  thing  with  fat-soluble  vitamins  (such  as 
vitamin A  and vitamin E). Recent  studies  looking  for  health benefits  from mega-
doses of vitamin E have instead shown  that excesses of vitamin E can  lead health 
problems.

Example 2) from lectures slides associated with page 2 of Lecture 13 notes: 
molecular shape in enzyme-substrate complexes 

The  shape  (geometry)  of  molecules  influences  physical  and  chemical  properties, 
including melting point, boiling point, and reactivity. 

Shape  is  particularly  important  in  biological  systems  where,  for  example,  a  molecule 
must fit precisely into the active site of an enzyme. 

sucrose 

Shown  above  is  the  hydrolysis  of  the  sugar  molecule  sucrose  into  fructose  and  glucose. 
This  reaction  is  catalyzed  by  an  enzyme  called  sucrase,  and  the  catalysis depends on  the 
sucrose molecule fitting into the active site of the sucrase enzyme. 

For examples of other enzyme-substrate pairs, see Lecture 35 notes.
