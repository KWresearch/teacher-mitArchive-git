Solutions to selected biology-related questions from problem sets for lectures 10-20 

 
Electron configurations
A.   
A class of enzymes called the cytochromes P450 are found in the liver. These important 
enzymes catalyze the oxidation of small molecules (such as drugs) to enable excretion from 
the body. Person-to-person variations in the amounts of certain cytochrome P450 enzymes 
can account for drastic differences in the way individuals respond to the same dosage of a 
drug. 
 
Like many enzymes, cytochrome P450 enzymes require association with metal atoms for 
activity.  Specifically, the oxidation of target molecules by cytochromes P450 requires iron.  
 
(a) Give the electron configuration of neutral iron. 
 
Provide the electron configuration for the following iron ions.  Iron in its +2, +3, and +4 
oxidation state are all involved in cytochrome P450 catalysis. 
 
(b) Fe2+ 
 
(a) [Ar]3d64s2

Lewis structures
 
B.  
The following molecules, which form as a byproduct of naturals metabolic processes in the 
body, are highly reactive and can cause oxidative damage to DNA. Write the Lewis 
structure for each molecule and indicate whether or not it is a radical. Calculate the formal 
charge on every atom.

C.  
Proteins  are  macromolecules  that  play  an  enormous  variety  of  roles  in  our  body, 
including  catalyzing  reactions  such  as  metabolism  and  DNA  synthesis.  All  proteins  are 
made  up  of  building  blocks  called  amino  acids. Proteins  typically  consist  of  hundreds  of 
amino acids linked together in a chain. The skeleton structures of two amino acids, serine 
and tyrosine, are drawn below.  
 
Provide the most important Lewis structure(s) for these molecules, drawing all single and 
multiple bonds, lone pairs and formal charges.  If there are equivalent resonance forms, 
include them. 
 
(a)   
1) skeletal structure given 
2) valence electrons:   N + C + O + H 
 
 
 
5 + 3(4) + 3(6) + 7(1) = 42 
3) electrons needed for full octets:  7(8) + 7(2)  = 70 
4) bonding electrons:  70 – 42 = 28 
5) assign two electrons to each bond 
6) 2 extra bonding electrons 
7) 14 extra lone pair electrons 
8) FC = 0 for every atom 
 
(b) 
 
 
 
1) skeletal structure given 
2) valence electrons:  N + C + O + H:  5 + 9(4) + 3(6) + 11(1) = 70 
3) e-s needed for full octets: 13(8) + 11(2) = 126 
4) 126 – 70 = 56 bonding electrons 
 
5)  Assign 2 electrons to each bond (48 total).   6)  56-48 = 8 extra bonding electrons 
7)  70- 56 = 14 extra lone pair electrons            8)  FC = 0 for every atom

Valence bond theory and hybridization
 
D.  
The genetic code includes four different DNA bases.  The structures of two of these bases, 
cytosine and adenine, are shown below. (Note that lone pairs are not pictured, but may 
be present in the structures.) Assign the hybridization and geometry to: 
 
(a)  the nitrogen atoms in cytosine.  
Na: sp3, trigonal pyramidal,  Nb: sp2, bent, Nc :sp3, trigonal pyramidal 
(b)  the carbon atoms in adenine.   
All of the carbon atoms are sp2, trigonal planar.

Pi-bonds between atoms prevent rotation around the bond axis, which makes double and 
triple bonds rigid. In contrast, single bonds can freely rotate around the bond axis. In 
many drugs, rigidity helps lower the barrier to binding a target enzyme in the body by 
pre-organizing the drug into the exact shape necessary to bind the enzyme. 
 
The  structure  of  acetylsalicyclic  acid  (aspirin)  is  shown  below.    (a) How many  pi-bonds 
are  present  in  aspirin?    How  many  sigma-bonds?    (b)  Name  one  other  factor  that 
restricts bond rotation in part of aspirin.

(a) 5 π-bonds,  21 σ-bonds 
(b) Either one of the following answers is acceptable: the ring structure increases 
rigidity within the ring. Resonance increases rigidity across 3 atoms instead of two.

Acetyl phosphate  is a molecule  that plays a role  in  the  formation of certain  fatty acids  in 
the body.  For the formation of acetyl phosphate from acetic acid under conditions in the 
body, ΔG  =  +41  kJ/mol.    If  acetyl  phosphate  formation  is  driven  by  coupling  it  to  the 
hydrolysis of ATP (to ADP), what is the minimum amount of ATP (in moles) that must be 
hydrolyzed to form 6.0 mol of acetyl phosphate? See Lecture #18 notes for the ΔG of ATP 
hydrolysis and assume 100% coupling efficiency. 
 
ΔG of ATP hydrolysis is -31 kJ/mol 
 
6.0 mol x (41 kJ/mol) / (31 kJ/mol) = 7.9 mol of ATP 
 
Hydrogen bonds

Gleevec® (Novartis) is cancer drug that was first approved in 2001 to treat patients with 
a specific type of leukemia. Gleevec works by selectively binding to a cancer-causing 
mutant protein, essentially turning the cancerous protein “off” by stabilizing an inactive 
form of the protein. Gleevec binds the protein through several types of intermolecular 
interactions, including hydrogen bonding. 
 
Consider the Gleevec molecule below and put a triangle around all atoms that could be 
hydrogen bond donors. Circle the atoms that could be hydrogen bond acceptors.

There  are  7  possible H-bond  acceptors  and  2  possible H-bond  donors. Note  that 
H-bonding  requires  the  proper  orientation  and  distance  between  interacting 
molecules,  so  not  all  potential  atoms  will  form  H-bonds.  For  Gleevec,  there  are 
five hydrogen bonds believed to form between Gleevec and the target protein.
