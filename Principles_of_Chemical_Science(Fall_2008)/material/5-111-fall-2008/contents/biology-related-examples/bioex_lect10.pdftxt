Periodic Trends: Atomic Size  
See lecture 9 for an introduction to periodic trends and lecture 10 for a discussion of 
atomic size. 
 
Example from page 1 of Lecture 10 notes: The significance of atomic size in the 
selectivity of ion channels in neurons 
 
Ion  channels  are  protein  “gates”  that  regulate  the movement  of  ions  (such  as Na+  or K+) 
across  cell  membranes.    Ion  channels  can  be  found  in  all  cell  types,  but  are  particularly 
prevalent  in  nerve  cells  (neurons)  and  muscle  cells.  Specifically,  ion  channels  underlie 
the nerve impulses (electrical signals) in neutrons. Ion channels help establish and control 
a voltage gradient in neurons by regulating the influx of sodium ions (Na+) and potassium 
ions (K+).

Ion  channels  are SPECIFIC  for  a  certain  type  of  ion. Thus,  sodium  ion  channels will 
allow ONLY sodium ions to pass through. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The differences in ionic radius between sodium and potassium ions may seem 
insignificant: 1.02 x 10-10 for Na+ versus 1.38 x 10-10 m for K+.  
 
However, the pore (or opening) in sodium channels is just wide enough to accommodate 
a sodium ion and one associated water molecule.  The pore is too small for a water-
complexed potassium ion! 
 
Interestingly, potassium channels also use size for ion selectivity. In potassium channels, 
the larger size of potassium ions enables stabilizing interactions with multiple oxygen 
atoms (from carbonyl, C=O, groups) within the channel’s pore. The stabilizing oxygen 
atoms are spaced too far apart to simultaneously interact with the smaller sodium ions. 

Crystal structure of an ion channel  
Below are two representations of the molecular structure of a potassium ion channel 
looking down the open pore (Protein Data Base (PDB) accession number 1BL8). A K+ 
ion passing through the pore is highlighted in purple.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is a ribbon diagram, showing the protein 
backbone with  the  potassium  ion  as  a  purple 
sphere. 
 

 

This  is  a  stick  diagram,  showing  all  of  the 
atoms  in  both  the  backbone  and  side  chains  of 
the  protein.  Carbon  atoms  are  grey,  nitrogen 
atoms  are  blue,  oxygen  atoms  are  red,  sulfur 
atoms  are  yellow,  and  potassium  ions  are 
purple.  The  oxygen  atoms  (each  with  a  partial 
negative  charge)  lining  the  inside  of  the  pore 
stabilize  the  positively-charged  potassium  ions 
passing through.

The role of atomic radius in ion channel selectivity : 

 
Ion channels 
 
* regulate the influx of ions into cells. 
* enable rapid electrical signaling in neurons. 
 
Regulation and selectivity are essential.   
 

Sodium  ion  channels  are  selective  for Na+  in  the  presence  of  other  ions,  including  K+. 
Sodium  channels  include  a  tiny  pore  (~0.4  nm  wide)  that  is  just  wide  enough  to 
accommodate a sodium ion and associated water molecule.  Too small for potassium!
