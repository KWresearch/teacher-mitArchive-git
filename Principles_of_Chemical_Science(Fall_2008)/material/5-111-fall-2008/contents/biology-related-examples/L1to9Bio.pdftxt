Review of fundamentals   
 
A. 
Lisinopril, sold under the brand names of Prinivil® (Merck) or Zestril® (AstraZeneca), is a 
small molecule drug used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.  It works by 
inhibiting the production of angiotensin, a signaling molecule found in the blood that causes 
vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and increased blood pressure.  Lisinopril has a 
mass percentage composition of 62.2% carbon, 7.7% hydrogen, and 10.4% nitrogen, with 
the balance being oxygen.  What is the empirical formula of lisinopril?   
 
B. 
Through  a process  called  cellular  respiration  (or oxidative metabolism), your body  converts 
energy  stored  in  the molecular  bonds  of  sugars  (such  as  glucose)  into  a  form  of  energy  that 
can be used directly by your cells.  The reaction for the oxidative metabolism of glucose is 
 
 
 
In order for your body to oxidize 350. g of glucose, what mass of molecular oxygen (O2) is 
required in the reaction?   
 
 
The Quantum World 
 
C.  
Research  in  the  Bawendi  lab  at  MIT  focuses  on  the  synthesis  and  application  of  quantum 
dots,  fluorescent  semiconductor  crystals.  The  green  quantum  dot  depicted  in  the  lecture  #3 
notes  emits  photons  with  a  wavelength  of  535  nm.  Calculate  the  frequency  of  the  photons 
emitted. 
 
D.   
Carotenoids are a class of molecules found in organisms that undergo photosynthesis.  These 
organic  molecules  facilitate  increased  energy  production  by  enabling  absorption  of  blue 
light.  Calculate the energy in 1 mole of 455 nm (blue) light. 
 
E.  
Fluorescent molecules  (known  as  fluorophores)  are widely  used  by  chemists  and  biologists 
to  study  sub-cellular  molecules,  including  proteins,  DNA,  and  RNA.    In  the  most 
straightforward  applications,  fluorophores  are  appended  to  a  bio-molecule  of  interest  and 
used  to  image  the  bio-molecule’s  cellular  location.    The  fluorescence  imaging  process 
involves  the  excitation  of  a  fluorophore  with  a  photon  of  energy,  resulting  in  a  brief  (1-10 
ns) excited state that is followed by the release of a photon with a second, lower energy.

Imagine  that  you  are  studying  a  protein  involved  in  tumor metastasis  (spreading). Based 
on  previous  studies,  you  hypothesize  that  the  protein  localizes  to  the  nucleus  in  tumor 
cells.  To  determine  the  sub-cellular  location  of  your  protein,  you  label  it  with  a 
fluorophore that can be excited by light in the range of 620. to 674 nm. 
 
The  lab’s  fluorescent  microscope  is  currently  set  up  with  a  He-Ne  laser  for  excitation. 
The  laser  produces  a  beam  of  light  with  a  per-photon  energy  of  3.14  x  10-19  J  and  an 
intensity of 13 W (J/s). 
 
(a) Calculate the wavelength of the light emitted by the He-Ne laser. 
(b) Does  the He-Ne  laser beam have an appropriate energy  to excite your  fluorophore  (does 
it fall within the excitation range)? 
(c) Calculate the number of photons emitted by the laser per second.   
 
 
F.  
Proton  therapy  is  a  form  of  radiation  therapy  used  to  shrink  tumors  by  aiming  high-energy 
protons (H+ atoms) at cancerous cells and thereby damaging DNA and promoting cell death.  
The  large  relative  mass  of  hydrogen  ions  in  comparison  to  x-rays  results  in  minimal 
scattering in the tissue, meaning less damage to healthy tissue surrounding a target tumor.  If 
a proton accelerator produces a beam of protons  (mw = 1.008 g/mol) with an average speed 
of 2.11 x 107 m/s, what is the wavelength of the protons?
