Electron configurations
A.   
A  class  of  enzymes  called  the  cytochromes  P450  are  found  in  the  liver.  These  important 
enzymes catalyze  the oxidation of  small molecules  (such as drugs)  to enable excretion  from 
the  body.  Person-to-person  variations  in  the  amounts  of  certain  cytochrome  P450  enzymes 
can  account  for  drastic  differences  in  the  way  individuals  respond  to  the  same  dosage  of  a 
drug. 
 
Like  many  enzymes,  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  require  association  with  metal  atoms  for 
activity.  Specifically, the oxidation of target molecules by cytochromes P450 requires iron.  
 
(a) Give the electron configuration of neutral iron. 
 
Provide the electron configuration for the following iron ions.  Iron in its +2, +3, and +4 
oxidation state are all involved in cytochrome P450 catalysis.

Lewis structures
 
B.  
The  following molecules, which  form  as  a  byproduct  of  naturals metabolic  processes  in  the 
body,  are  highly  reactive  and  can  cause  oxidative  damage  to  DNA.  Write  the  Lewis 
structure  for  each molecule  and  indicate whether  or  not  it  is  a  radical. Calculate  the  formal 
charge on every atom. 
(a)  the superoxide ion, O2
 
 
 
 
(b)  OH 
 
C.  
Proteins  are  macromolecules  that  play  an  enormous  variety  of  roles  in  our  body,  including 
catalyzing  reactions  such  as  metabolism  and  DNA  synthesis.  All  proteins  are  made  up  of 
building  blocks  called  amino  acids.  Proteins  typically  consist  of  hundreds  of  amino  acids 
linked  together  in  a  chain. The  skeleton  structures of  two  amino  acids,  serine  and  tyrosine, 
are drawn below.  
 
Provide  the  most  important  Lewis  structure(s)  for  these  molecules,  drawing  all  single  and 
multiple  bonds,  lone  pairs  and  formal  charges.    If  there  are  equivalent  resonance  forms, 
include them.

Valence bond theory and hybridization
 
D.  
The  genetic  code  includes  four  different  DNA  bases.    The  structures  of  two  of  these 
bases,  cytosine  and  adenine,  are  shown below.  (Note  that  lone pairs  are not pictured, but 
may be present in the structures.) Assign the hybridization and geometry to: 
 
(a)  the nitrogen atoms in cytosine.  
(b)  the carbon atoms in adenine.

Pi-bonds between  atoms prevent  rotation  around  the bond  axis, which makes double  and 
triple  bonds  rigid.  In  contrast,  single  bonds  can  freely  rotate  around  the  bond  axis.  In 
many  drugs,  rigidity  helps  lower  the  barrier  to  binding  a  target  enzyme  in  the  body  by 
pre-organizing the drug into the exact shape necessary to bind the enzyme. 
 
The  structure  of  acetylsalicyclic  acid  (aspirin)  is  shown  below.    (a) How many  pi-bonds 
are present  in aspirin?   How many sigma-bonds?   (b) Name one other factor that restricts 
bond rotation in part of aspirin.

Acetyl phosphate  is  a molecule  that plays  a  role  in  the  formation of certain  fatty  acids  in 
the body.   For  the  formation of acetyl phosphate  from acetic acid under conditions  in  the 
body,  ΔG  =  +41  kJ/mol.    If  acetyl  phosphate  formation  is  driven  by  coupling  it  to  the 
hydrolysis  of ATP  (to ADP), what  is  the minimum  amount  of ATP  (in moles)  that must

be hydrolyzed  to  form 6.0 mol of acetyl phosphate? See Lecture #18 notes  for  the ΔG of 
ATP hydrolysis and assume 100% coupling efficiency. 
 
 
Hydrogen bonds
 
G.  
Gleevec® (Novartis) is cancer drug that was first approved in 2001 to treat patients with 
a specific type of leukemia. Gleevec works by selectively binding to a cancer-causing 
mutant protein, essentially turning the cancerous protein “off” by stabilizing an inactive 
form of the protein. Gleevec binds the protein through several types of intermolecular 
interactions, including hydrogen bonding. 
 
Consider the Gleevec molecule below and put a triangle around all atoms that could be 
hydrogen bond donors. Circle the atoms that could be hydrogen bond acceptors.
