A.  
Cisplatinum [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] is a potent anticancer drug. (a) Draw the structure of this square 
planar molecule and the structure of its isomer transplatinum. (b) What are the angles for a 
square planar molecule? (c) What is the CN? (d) Draw the crystal field energy-level 
diagram for cisplatinum, labeling the d-orbitals. (e) Predict whether cisplatinum is 
diamagnetic or paramagnetic? Explain your answer.

Octahedral platinum(IV) complexes are used in protein crystallography to help 
determine three-dimensional protein structures.  If the octahedral crystal field splitting 
energy (Δo) is large for these complexes, (a) predict whether they are diamagnetic or 
paramagnetic, and (b) write the expected dn electron configuration.  
 
The d-count for Pt4+ complexes is 10 (group number) – 4 = d6.  To figure out whether the 
complexes are diamagnetic or paramagnetic, fill the 6 d electrons into a strong (low spin) 
octahedral field diagram.

C. 
The element techneticum has never been found in nature.  It can be obtained readily as a 
product of uranium fission in nuclear power plants, however, and is produced in quantities 
of many kilograms per year.  MIT Chemistry Professor Alan Davison pioneered the use of 
Techneticum in the diagnosis of heart disease.  Calculate the total activity (in 
disintegrations per second) caused by the decay of 0.5 microgram of 99mTc (an excited 
nuclear state of 99Tc), which has a half-life of 6.0 hours. 
 
To calculate the activity of a sample of 1.0 mg of 99mTc, we can use the following 
equation: A=kN. We need to first determine the decay constant, k and the number of 
nuclei.  
To calculate the number of nuclei:

Consider the formation of a DNA double helix from strands A and B to form an unstable 
helix (UH) and a stable helix (SH).

Step 2:
 
(a) What is the molecularity of each step? 
Step 1 is bimolecular and step 2 is unimolecular. 

 

SH

 
(b) Write the rate law for the formation of the stable helix (SH) using the steady-state 
approximation.  Be sure to eliminate intermediates from the rate expression. 
 
We can make no assumptions as to the speed of each of the steps.  First, let’s write the 
expression for step 2; rate = k2[UH].  Since UH is an intermediate, we need to find a way 
to remove it. 
Rate of formation of UH = k1[A][B] 
 
 
 
 
Rate of removal of UH = k -1[UH]+k2[UH] 
Using the Steady-State Approximation: 
 
Rate of formation of UH = Rate of removal of UH 
 
 
k1[A][B] = k -1[UH]+k2[UH] 
 
 
 
k1[A][B] = [UH](k -1 + k2) 
 
 
 
[UH] =  k1[A][B]
 
 
 
 
(k −1 + k 2 )
