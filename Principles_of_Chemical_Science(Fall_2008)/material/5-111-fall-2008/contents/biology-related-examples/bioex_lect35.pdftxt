Catalysts of Life: Enzymes 
See lecture 35 notes for an introduction to enzyme catalysis. 

An enzyme is a large protein molecule (typically 20,000 g/mol or more) that is capable of

carrying out a specific reaction or series of reactions.


Enzyme catalysis

Reactant molecules are called substrates.


Example from Lecture 35 video: Enzyme Catalysis 
An  iron-containing  enzyme  catalyzes  the  final  step  in  the  biosynthesis  of  the  antibiotic 
fosfomycin.  The  structure  (shown  below)  of  this  enzyme  step  was  reported  by  the 
Drennan laboratory at MIT in 2005.

Enzyme (E) 
With  the  emergence  of  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria,  the  development  of  new  antibiotics 
will be an important problem for future chemists to tackle. 

Substrates bind to an active site on the enzyme.

Enzyme Inhibition

If an inhibitor is bound in the active site, then substrate can't bind.

Many pharmaceutical  drugs work by blocking  the  action of  enzymes.  Enzymes catalyze 
reactions by stabilizing the "transition state" of the reaction. 

Compounds that resemble the transition state should bind more tightly to the enzyme than 
reactants  or  products.  These  compounds  can  therefore  serve  as  enzyme  inhibitors 
(drugs). 

Example from page 7 of Lecture 35 notes: HIV Protease Inhibitors 
. 
Proteases inhibitors are used in treatment of HIV.  Enzymes that cleave peptide bonds are 
called  proteases.  The  overall  mechanism  of  peptide  bond  cleavage  - a  type  of 
displacement reaction- is shown below:

Molecules with a stable tetrahedral atom at cleavage site will resemble the transition state 
and could bind more tightly to the enzyme than substrate does. 

Example of a molecule with a tetrahedral center: 
Approved drug for HIV, indinavir sulfate (The New England J. Med. 338, 1285 (1998)). 
Knowledge of reaction mechanism can lead to design of new therapeutic treatments.

Interesting  and  important  question  - why  doesn't  this  compound  block  all  proteases?  A 
second consideration is specificity. 
Tight binding is just one facet of drug design. Also must consider specificity and delivery.
