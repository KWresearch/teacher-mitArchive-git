Exceptions to Lewis Structure Rules: Free Radicals 
See lecture 10 (starting on page 3 of the notes) and lecture 11 for Lewis structures. 
See lecture 12 for exceptions to Lewis structure rules. 
 
Free radicals (or radicals) are molecules that have one or more unpaired electron. Due to 
the unpaired electron(s), most radicals are unstable and highly reactive.

* The hydroxyl radical  (OH) and  superoxide  (O2
that are byproducts of oxygen metabolism in the body.  These molecules are essential for 
life  due  to  their  role  in  cell  signaling  processes.    However,  because  they  are  highly 
reactive,  the  radicals  also  react  with  DNA,  resulting  in  DNA  mutations  that  can 
ultimately  lead  to  cancer. We  have  enzymes  in our body  that  can  repair DNA damage  to 
some  extent,  and  antioxidants,  including  vitamins  A,  C,  and  E,  “trap”  radicals  to  help 
minimize unwanted radical reactions, such as with DNA.

Nitric oxide 
•  NO  is  an  important  cell-signaling  molecule  in  humans.    It  is  produced  in  the  inner  lining  of 
blood  vessels  and  signals  for  the  surrounding  smooth  muscle  to  relax,  resulting  in  increased 
blood flow and thus increased transport of oxygen to cells in the body. 
•  NO is a gas, which is extremely unusual for a signaling molecule. 
 
•  NO  diffuses  freely  across  cell  membranes.  The
 
illustration  shows  NO  molecules  signaling  for  the 
smooth  muscle  surrounding  blood  vessels  to  relax, 
resulting  in  vasodilation  (increasing  the  diameter  of 
blood vessels) and increased blood flow. 

 
•  As  a  radical  species,  NO  has  a  short  lifetime  in  the 
body,  which  makes  it  an  ideal  messenger  molecule 
between adjacent cells.

You  may  be  familiar  with  a  drug  that  inhibits  the  breakdown  of  a  downstream  signaling 
molecule in the NO pathway… 
 
 
Viagra  inhibits  the  enzyme  PDE5.  PDE5  is  responsible  for  breaking  down  the  signaling 
molecule  cGMP  in  the  corpus  cavernosum  of  the  penis. When PDE5  is  inhibited,  higher  levels 
of  cGMP  result  in  increased  vasodilation  (as  shown  in  the  schemes  below)  and  thus  increased 
blood flow to the penis.
