Hybridization (review of material from lectures 15 and 16) 
See lecture 15 and lecture 16 (pages 1-2) for hybridization. 
 
Example from page 1 of Lecture 17 notes: Identifying molecules that follow the 
“morphine rule”  
 
Morphine, a potent and addictive analgesic (“painkiller”), and related molecules share a 
characteristic set of four features called the morphine rule: 
 
H
C
 
1) a phenyl ring 
2) an sp3 hybridized carbon atom 
3) a CH2-CH2 sequence 
4) an sp3 hybridized nitrogen atom 
 
 
These structural elements are responsible for the bioactivity of morphine and other molecules 
that are pharmacologically similar to morphine.  Examples are shown below with the “morphine 
rule” features highlighted in purple.

These molecules fit into a pain receptor in the brain, mimicking the action of endorphins, which 
are natural pain relievers produced by the body.  Endorphins do not have all of the elements of 
the morphine rule, but do have significant structural similarities.

•  Pure morphine was  first  isolated  in 1803. The  chemical  structure was determined 
in  1925.  Two  hundred  years  later,  morphine  and  related  compounds  remain  the 
most potent painkillers known.  Unfortunately, morphine is also highly addictive. 
•  Codeine  is  less  addictive,  but  also  less  effective.    It  is  approximately  a  tenth  as 
strong as morphine. 
•  Diacylmorphine was  synthesized  in  1898  by Bayer  (the  company  best  known  for 
Bayer’s  aspirin).    Diacylmorphine  is  much  more  potent  than  morphine,  and  this 
potency initially masked some major side effects. Bayer marketed this as a “hero” 
drug.  We  now  know  it  as  the  “hero”  derived  name  heroin,  and  few  people 
associate it with the company Bayer. 
•  Until  the  1980’s,  Demerol  was  thought  to  be  a  safer  alternative  to  morphine. 
While  Demerol  is  less  addictive  than  morphine,  it  can  have  dangerous  side 
effects, including seizures, and has become much less widely used. 

This example is based on Chapter 13 of Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History by Penny 
LeCouteur and Jay Burreson. The morphine rule can be used as a VSEPR or as a hybridization example.
