Determining Hybridization in Complex Molecules:  
See lecture 15 notes for a detailed discussion of hybrid orbitals. See page 1 of lecture 
16 notes for a general rule to predict the hybridization of atoms with s and p electrons. 
 
To determine the hybridization of a given atom in a molecule,  
 
 
 
2 hybrid orbitals- sp ,         3 hybrid orbitals – sp2,   
 
Exception: single-bonded, terminal atoms. For the purposes of this course, do NOT 
hybridize single, bonded, terminal atoms.

Some interesting facts about vitamin C: 
•  Vitamin C is active in the body as the a
antioxidant.  
also an enzyme cofactor, meaning it that vitamin C binding is required for 
Vitamin C is 
certain enzymes to function. Specifically, vitamin C is a required co-factor for enzymes 
that  add  hydroxyl  groups  to  collagen,  allowing  the  formation  of  the  collagen  triple 

scorbate ion.  Like vitamin E, vitamin C is an

helix  (pictured  below).  Since  collagen  is  the  main  component  of  connective  tissue, 
bones,  cartilage,  tendons,  teeth,  etc,  it  is  clear  that  vitamin  C  is  a  very  important 
molecule.

st to describe the symptoms 

Vitamin  C  deficiency  is  the  cause  of  scurvy.  Most  people  associate  scurvy  with  boat 
travel  in  the  1500s  to  1700s.  Symptoms  include  irritated  gums,  tooth  loss,  bleeding 
from mucous membranes  and  eventual  death  (which makes  sense  considering  the  role 
of vitamin C in collagen formation). 
Some history of scurvy:  
•  Hippocrates was the fir
of scurvy in 400 BC. 
Incidence  rapidly  grew
  in  the  14th  and  15th  c.  as 
improved  boat  technology  allowed  for  longer 
voyages.    Entire  crews  were  sometimes  lost  to 
scurvy  with  empty  boats  floating  in  the  sea.  For 
example,  Magellan’s  fleet  circled  the  world  in 
1519-1522  and  lost  90%  (!)  of  the  crew  to  scurvy 
(this  detail  is  often  excluded  from  grade  school 
lessons on explorers!).  
ical  study  recorded  was 
for  scurvy  treatment.  In  1747, 
The  first  controlled  clin
James  Lind  treated  men  on  his  ship  suffering  from  scurvy  with  either  lemon 
juice,  ale,  seawater,  vinegar,  or  dilute  sulfuric  acid.  The  men  treated  with  the 
vitamin-C-rich lemon juice quickly recovered.  
here  is  no  need  to  worry  about 
Most  animals  can  biosynthesize  vitamin  C,  so  t
dogs  or  cats  with  vitamin  C  deficiencies.  Only  a  few  species  lack  the  required 
gene for biosynthesis, all primates (including humans) and guinea pigs.
