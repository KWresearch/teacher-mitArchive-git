Kinetics of Elementary Reactions: Radioactive Decay 
See  lecture  31  for  an  introduction  to  kinetics  and  lecture  32  for  the  kinetics  of 
radioactive decay. 

Radioactive Decay. The decay of a nucleus is independent of the number of surrounding 
nuclei that have decayed.  We can apply first order integrated rate laws: 
 t1/2  = 0.6931 
[A] = [A]0 e-k t 
and
k 
However, instead of concentration, the first order integrated rate law is expressed in 
terms of N (number of nuclei): 

N = Noe-k t 

k ≡ decay constant 
t ≡time 
N0  ≡ number of nuclei originally present 

Nuclear kinetics – monitor rate of occurrence of decay events with a Geiger counter 
(radiation detector). Decay rate is also called Activity (A) 

N = Noe-k t 

can be expressed as  A = Aoe-k t 

A ≡ Activity 

Ao≡ initial Activity 

Example from pg 3 of Lecture 32 notes: Medical Applications of Radioactive Decay. 

Technetium(Tc)-99 is the most widely used radioactive nuclide in medicine. It is used for 
diagnostic organ imaging and bone scans, with over 7 million uses annually in the US. 
One  of  the  patent  holders  for  the  technetium-based  imaging  agent  cardioliteTM  is  MIT 
Professor of Chemistry Alan Davison.

CardioliteTM  is  a  coordination  complex,  and  Prof.  Davison  figured  out  which  ligands  to 
use  (CN-)  to  obtain  the  desired  properties  of  solubility  and  stability  to  be  applied  to 
medical imaging. Cardiolite has saved many lives in diagnosing coronary artery disease. 

In  a  Cardiolite  stress  test,  the  molecule  is  administered  by  IV  and  travels  through  the 
blood  into  the  heart.  Since  the  drug  cannot  access  areas  of  the  heart  with  insufficient 
blood supply, a subsequent scan reveals any blocked arteries. 

Recitation or homework example: 
Calculate the total activity (in disintegrations per second) caused by the decay of 0.5 
microgram of 99mTc (an excited nuclear state of 99Tc), which has a half-life of 6.0 hours. 

To calculate the activity of a sample of 1.0 mg of 99mTc, we can use the following 

equation: A=kN. We need to first determine the decay constant, k and the number of

nuclei.

To calculate the number of nuclei:

We can now substitute those values into the equation A=kN; 
A = kN 
= ( 3.2088 x 10-5  s -1)( 3.0414 x 1015  nuclei) 
=  9.759 x 1010 
= 1 x 1011  disintegrations per second 
A sample of 0.5 µg of 99mTc has the activity of 1 x 1011 disintegrations s-1
