Oxidation/Reduction Reactions 
See page 1 of  lecture 25 notes for an introduction  to oxidation/reduction and page 2 of 
lecture 26 notes for a discussion of a standard reduction potential (E°). 

Meaning of standard reduction potential (E°):

A large positive E° means the element or compound is easy to reduce.


ex. F2  (g) + 2e- ⇒ 2F-

E° = +2.87 volts (easy to add electrons to F2) 
F2  is a strong oxidation agent (easy to reduce) 

A large negative E° means the element or compound is hard to reduce 

ex. Li+1  + e - ⇒ Li (s) 

E°=-3.045 volts (hard to add electrons to Li+1) 

Example from the TA-led recitation associated with Lectures 25 and 26: Oxidative 
Metabolism of Drugs in the Body 
Drugs are metabolized by  a  class of  proteins  in  the  liver  called  cytochrome P450 or Cyp 
(pronounced  “sip”)  enzymes.  Cyp  enzymes  function  by  oxidizing  small  molecules, 
including  drugs  and  environmental  toxins,  and  this  oxidation  increases  a  molecule’s 
polarity  and  leads  to  excretion  from  the  body.  In  general,  if  a  drug  is  easily  oxidized,  it 
may  be  more  quickly  excreted  from  the  body  compared  to  a  drug  that  is  difficult  to 
oxidize. 

Cyp  enzymes  in  the  liver  oxidize 
drugs  for  excretion  from  the  body.

warfarin (green). PDB file: 1OG5. 

Different  people  express  different  levels  of  Cyp  enzymes  in  their  bodies,  which  means 
that  some  people  oxidize  drugs  more  readily  than  others.  Individual  differences  in  Cyp 
enzyme levels account for one challenge in determining drug doses; the right amount of a 
pharmaceutical agent for one person might be too much or too little for someone else. 

Fluorine atoms in drugs 
Although  carbon-fluorine  (C-F)  bonds  are  very  uncommon  in  natural  products,  C-F 
bonds are incorporated into a number of drugs.  One reason for this is that fluorine, due to 
its  extreme  electronegativity,  can  make  a  molecule  electron  poor,  particularly  if  the 
fluorine is positioned on an aromatic ring. 

Question: Why might it be desirable to make a drug more electron-poor? 

Answer: Since oxidation involves losing an electron, a drug that is already electron-poor 
will  be  harder  to  oxidize.  Fluorination  can  increase  a  drug’s  metabolic  stability  by 
making it less susceptible to oxidation by Cyp enzymes in the liver. 

Question:  Based  on  the  information  above,  do  C-F  bonds  increase  or  decrease  the 
reduction potential of a drug? 

Answer:  C-F  bonds  increase  the  reduction  potential  by making  the  drug  more  electron-
poor. This means the drug is harder to oxidize (and thereby easier to reduce).

Question: What might be another benefit of replacing C-H bonds with C-F bonds in 
a drug candidate? (Hint: think back to lecture 18.) 

Answer: F atoms are hydrogen bond acceptors, which may lead to tighter binding of the 
drug in the active site of its target enzyme by increasing the number of hydrogen bonding 
interactions between the drug and the drug target.

Note: F2, which must be used to make C-F bonds in drugs, is the most powerful oxidation 
agent known. A current challenge in organic chemistry (and under investigation in labs at 
MIT) is to develop safer sources of F2  and the F- anion for the synthesis of C-F bonds.
