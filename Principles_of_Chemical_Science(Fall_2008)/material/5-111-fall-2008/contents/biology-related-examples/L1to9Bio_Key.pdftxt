Review of fundamentals   
 
A. 
Lisinopril, sold under the brand names of Prinivil® (Merck) or Zestril® (AstraZeneca), is a 
small molecule drug used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure.  It works by 
inhibiting the production of angiotensin, a signaling molecule found in the blood that causes 
vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and increased blood pressure.  Lisinopril has 
a mass percentage composition of 62.2% carbon, 7.7% hydrogen, and 10.4% nitrogen, with 
the balance being oxygen.  What is the empirical formula of lisinopril?   
 
Molecular weight of C6H12O6 = 180.16 
        =  2.220 mol of C6H12O6

        2.220 mol of C6H12O6   x     6 mol O2 
 
 
 
         1 mol C6H12O6 
    13.32 mol O2   x  (32.00 g / mol)     =   426.2 g 
 
 
  amount of O in Lisinopril = 100.0 g – 62.2 g – 7.7 g – 10.4 g 
 
 
 
        = 19.7 g of O 
 
  We can now fill in the table to calculate the molar ratios: 
 

          =  13.32 mol O2

 
B. 
Through a process called cellular respiration (or oxidative metabolism), your body converts 
energy  stored  in  the molecular bonds of  sugars  (such as glucose)  into a  form of energy  that 
can be used directly by your cells.  The reaction for the oxidative metabolism of glucose is 
 
 
 
In order for your body to oxidize 350. g of glucose, what mass of molecular oxygen (O2) is 
required in the reaction?   
 

C6H12O6 + 6O2 ⇒ 6CO2 + 6H2O (+ energy).

     First, convert grams of C6H12O6  (glucose) to moles of glucose.   
     MW of C6H12O6 = 180.16 g/mol 
 
  350. g  x      mol      =  1.943 mol of glucose 
 
 
    180.16 g  
  1 mole of glucose reacts with 6 moles of O2.  We can now convert moles of glucose to 
grams of O2 using this 1:6 ratio and the mw of O2.  MW of O2 = 32.00 g/mol. 
 
 1.943 mol glucose    x          6 mol O2    x   32.00 g O2     =  373.056 g O2

The Quantum World 
 
C.  
Research in  the Bawendi lab at MIT focuses on  the synthesis and application of quantum 
dots,  fluorescent  semiconductor  crystals.  The  green  quantum  dot  depicted  in  the  lecture 
#3  notes  emits  photons  with  a  wavelength  of  535  nm.  Calculate  the  frequency  of  the 
photons emitted. 

 

 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 

λν = c 
ν = c/ λ 
ν = (2.998 x 108 m•s-1)/ (535 x 10-9 m) 
ν = 5.60 x 1014 s-1 
 
 

 
D.   
Carotenoids are a class of molecules found in organisms that undergo photosynthesis.  
These organic molecules facilitate increased energy production by enabling absorption 
of blue light.  Calculate the energy in 1 mole of 455 nm (blue) light. 
 

E = hc/λ =  (6.626 x 10-34 J•s) (2.998 x 108 m•s-1)
455 x 10-9 m 
 
 
 
Ei = 4.366 x 10-19 J  (This is the energy per photon) 
 
 4.366 x 10-19 J    x   6.022 x 1023 (photons)   =  2.63 x 105 J of energy in 1 mol

E.  
Fluorescent  molecules  (known  as  fluorophores)  are  widely  used  by  chemists  and 
biologists  to  study  sub-cellular  molecules,  including  proteins,  DNA,  and  RNA.    In  the 
most  straightforward  applications,  fluorophores  are  appended  to  a  bio-molecule  of

interest  and  used  to  image  the  bio-molecule’s  cellular  location.    The  fluorescence 
imaging  process  involves  the  excitation  of  a  fluorophore  with  a  photon  of  energy, 
resulting in a brief (1-10 ns) excited state that is followed by the release of a photon with 
a second, lower energy.  
 
Imagine  that you are  studying a protein  involved  in  tumor metastasis  (spreading). Based 
on  previous  studies,  you  hypothesize  that  the  protein  localizes  to  the  nucleus  in  tumor 
cells.  To  determine  the  sub-cellular  location  of  your  protein,  you  label  it  with  a 
fluorophore that can be excited by light in the range of 620. to 674 nm. 
 
The  lab’s  fluorescent  microscope  is  currently  set  up  with  a  He-Ne  laser  for  excitation. 
The  laser  produces  a  beam  of  light  with  a  per-photon  energy  of  3.14  x  10-19  J  and  an 
intensity of 13 W (J/s). 
 
(a) Calculate the wavelength of the light emitted by the He-Ne laser. 
(b) Does the He-Ne laser beam have an appropriate energy to excite your fluorophore (does 
it fall within the excitation range)? 
(c) Calculate the number of photons emitted by the laser per second.   

(a)  We know the energy of the laser = 3.14 x 10-19 J. 
Ephoton = hν = hc/λ 
λ = hc/Ephoton
λ =    (6.626 x 10-34 J•s) (3.00 x 108 ms-1)    = 6.331 x 10-7 m 
        3.14 x 10-19 J 
 
λ = 633 nm 

(b)  Yes.  The wavelength (633 nm) falls within the excitation range of 620 to 674 nm 
 
(c)  I = 13 W  or  13 J/s 
 

13 J    x      photon           =  4.14 x 1019  photons/s 
  s           3.14 x 10-19 J 
 
4.1 x 1019 photons 

 
 
F.  
Proton therapy is a form of radiation therapy used to shrink tumors by aiming high-
energy protons (H+ atoms) at cancerous cells and thereby damaging DNA and promoting 
cell death.  The large relative mass of hydrogen ions in comparison to x-rays results in 
minimal scattering in the tissue, meaning less damage to healthy tissue surrounding a 
target tumor.  If a proton accelerator produces a beam of protons (mw = 1.008 g/mol) 
with an average speed of 2.11 x 107 m/s, what is the wavelength of the protons? 
 
We can use the DeBroglie equation for the calculation of the wavelength, but first we 
need to calculate the mass of the H+ ion in kg:

mass of one hydrogen ion =   1.008 x 10-3 kg/mol  = 1.6738 x 10-27 kg 
6.0221 x 1023 mol-1
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
We can now calculate the DeBroglie wavelength: 
 
 
 
 
 

λ = h/p = h/(mv)  =              6.626 x 10-34 kg•m2
•s-1 
(1.6738 x 10-27 kg)(2.11 x 107 m/s) 
 
 
 
λ = 1.88 x 10-14 m
