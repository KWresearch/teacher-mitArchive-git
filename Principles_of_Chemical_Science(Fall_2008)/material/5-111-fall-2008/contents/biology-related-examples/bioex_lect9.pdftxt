Periodic Trends (or Organization of the Periodic Table) 
See lectures 9 and 10 for an introduction to periodic trends. 
 
Elements  within  the  same  group  of  the  periodic  table  have  related  valence  electron 
configurations and many similar properties. For example: 
 

• Li,  Na,  and  K  (group  1A)  all  have 
one  valence  electron  and  are  all 
soft, reactive metals. 

 

• He, Ne, and Ar (group 8A) all have 
filled valence shells and are inert. 

 
In  the  late  1800s,  the  similar  chemical 
properties  of 
related  atoms  were 
believed to an extreme.

Today,  in  contrast,  we  understand  that  the  differences  between  elements  within  a  given 
group  (many  of  which  may  be  predicted  by  periodic  trends)  are  as  significant  as  the 
similarities.  
 
Example from Lecture 9 (not included in notes): Alkali earth metals in the body: Na 
and K versus Li 
 
Consider sodium, potassium, and lithium ions, all from group 1 of the periodic table.   
• Na+  and  K+  are  both  found  in  high  concentrations  in  the  body  and  are  essential  for 
diverse  biological  processes.  For  instance,  Na+,  the  most  abundant  cation  in  blood 
plasma,  and  potassium,  the  most  common  cation  inside  cells,  are  both  involved  in 
heart  function  regulation  and  in  signal  transduction  in  neurons.  (For  an  example  of 
the  body’s  ability  to  differentiate  between  sodium  and  potassium  ions,  see  the  ion 
channel example in lecture 10.) 
• Li+, on the other hand, has no known natural biological function. 

 
Sodium  citrate  and  potassium  citrate  are  both  found  as  soda  additives.  In  the  early 
1920’s  a  new  lime  soda,  7up,  instead  included  lithium  citrate  and  advertised  many 
benefits of “lithiated  soda”. Lithium has a molecular weight of 7 g/mol, which may have 
led to the name 7up.

7up  advertisements  claimed  that  the  lithiated  soda  was  “Slenderizing”  and  “Dispels 
hangovers…takes the ‘ouch’ out of grouch.” 
 
The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  banned  the  lithium  component  in  1950, 
shortly  after  the  introduction  of  lithium  carbonate  as  a  possible  psychiatric  drug  and  the 
discovery  of  dangerous  or  deadly  effects  from  lithium  overdose.  Lithium  drugs  are  still 
used today to treat biopolar disorder and manic depressive illnesses in some patients. 
 
Lithium treatments are administered as lithium salts, typically lithium citrate (as in 7up 
above!) or lithium carbonate, with the lithium ion as the active component.
