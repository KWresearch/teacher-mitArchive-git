Le Châtelier’s Principle 
See lectures 19 and  20 for a  discussion of chemical equilibrium. 

Principle of Le Châtelier: A system in equilibrium that is subjected to stress will react in 
a way that tends to minimize the effect of the stress. 
Le Châtelier's principle provides a way to predict qualitatively the direction of change of 
a system under an external perturbation. 

Example from pg. 4 of Lecture 20 notes: Maximizing the Yield of Nitrogen Fixation 

Haber-Bosch Process 
The  Haber-Bosch  process  is  a  nitrogen 
fixation reaction in which ammonia (NH3) is 
produced  from  inert  nitrogen  gas  reacting 
with hydrogen gas.

Over  1.6  x  1010  kg  of  ammonia  are  produced  by  this  process  per  year  in  the  US. 
Ammonia  is  used  to  produce  fertilizer,  and  prior  to  the  Haber-Bosch  process,  it  was 
extremely difficult to obtain ammonia on an industrial scale. 

exothermic reaction 

As  an  exothermic  reaction,  low  temperature  favors  products,  but  low  temperature  also 
slows rate. The compromise temperature used  is 500°C. What are other ways to drive the 
reaction toward products? 
Answers: decrease the volume of the container, remove product (NH3), use an enzyme 

Problems  with  industrial  production  of  NH3:  high  temperature,  pressure,  and  expense. 
Bacteria can catalyze the same reaction using an enzyme called nitrogenase! 

Nitrogenase is made up of two proteins 
that use metal centers to catalyze nitrogen 
fixation. The molybdenum-iron (MoFe) 
protein is depicted in magenta, and the iron 
(Fe) protein is shown in blue. 

Inspired by Nature’s approach, the Schrock lab at 
MIT has reported the first catalytic reduction of 
molecular nitrogen to ammonia at a well-defined 
molybdenum (Mo) metal center.

Example from page 4 of Lecture 20 notes: Le Châtelier’s Principle and Application 
to Blood-Oxygen Levels 

Hemoglobin (Hb) is an oxygen transport protein, and there are approximately 300 million 
hemoglobin molecules  per  red  blood  cell.  The  combination  of  oxygen with  hemoglobin, 
can be represented by 

Hb (aq) + O2  (aq) 

HbO2  (aq)


where HbO2  is oxyhemoglobin (oxygen bound to hemoglobin)


At  an  altitude  of  3  km  the  partial  pressure  of 
oxygen  is  only  about  0.14  atm,  compared  to  0.2 
atm  at  sea  level.  According  to  Le  Châtelier's 
principle,  the  equilibrium would be  shifted  to  the 
left.  This  change  causes  hypoxia 
(oxygen 
deprivation).  How can the body compensate?

Answer: The body produces more hemoglobin (Hb), which pushes the reaction toward 
products, resulting in more highly oxygenated blood.

The  structure  of  Hb.  Hb  is made  up  of  four  polypeptide  subunits:  two  alpha  subunits 
colored  in magenta  and  two  beta  subunits colored  in blue. Each  subunit  has one  iron-
containing  heme  group,  which  binds  oxygen  for  transport.  The  heme  groups  (two  are 
visible) are shown in black.  PDB file 1GZX.
