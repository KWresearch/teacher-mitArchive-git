Recall from Lecture 17 that the ∆H° of ATP hydrolysis is -24 kJ/mol of ATP.

Example 1) from page 3 of Lecture 18 notes: ATP-coupled reactions in the body 
  
Many biological reactions are non-spontaneous, meaning they require energy to proceed 
in the forward direction. 
 
The hydrolysis of ATP (ATP → ADP), a spontaneous process, can be coupled to a non-
spontaneous reaction to drive the non-spontaneous reaction forward. 
 
ADP 
ATP 

 

The resulting ∆Gº of the coupled reaction is the 
sum of the individual ∆Gº values. 

 
First, let’s calculate the ∆Gº for ATP hydrolysis at 310 K (body temperature) given that 
∆H° = -24 kJ/mol (from Lecture #17) and ∆S° = +22 J/K•mol. 
 
∆Gº  =  ∆Hº - T∆Sº 
 
∆Gº  =  -24 kJ/mol – 310 K (0.022 kJ/mol)  
 
∆Gº  =  -31 kJ/mol of ATP hydrolyzed 
 
Note:  the  calculated  free  energies  are  under  standard  conditions.  This  is  an 
approximation since these molecules are NOT under standard conditions in cells. 
 
 
Consider the following ATP-coupled reaction: the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-P. 
 
Why  this  reaction  is  important:  Adding  a  phosphate  (P)  group  to  glucose  gives  the 
glucose  a  negative  charge, which  prevents  the  glucose molecule  from  diffusing  back  out 
of the cell through the “greasy” cell membrane.

∆Gº  = +17 kJ/mol for glucose to glucose-6-P 
 
∆Gº  = -31 kJ/mol for ATP hydrolysis

An enzyme couples the glucose to glucose-6-P reaction to ATP hydrolysis. 
The net change in free energy =  17 kJ/mol + (-31 kJ/mol) = -14 kJ/mol 
 
 
If ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous, why is it not occurring unregulated in the cell? 
 
KINETICS!    A  reaction  can  be  thermodynamically  spontaneous,  but  kinetically 
very very slow.   
 
 
 
Example 2) from page 5 of Lecture 18 notes: Enthalpy and hydrogen bonds  
 
A  hydrogen  bond  is  an  electrostatic  interaction  between  a  hydrogen  atom  in  a 
polar bond (typically a H-F, H-O or H-N bond) and a “hydrogen-bond acceptor”, 
a strongly electronegative atom. 
 
 
 
 
The H-bond acceptor (Y) atom must be small, highly electronegative atom with a  
lone pair of electrons available for bonding. 
 
For example, hydrogen bonds form between water molecules:  
 
O
 
 
 
 

where X = O, N, F 
And Y is the hydrogen bond acceptor: N, O, or F

Mean bond enthalpies of hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds): 
 
H-bonds are the strongest type of intermolecular interaction.  However, H-bonds 
are weaker than covalent or ionic bonds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
OH---O      H-bond 
 
H-O           covalent bond 
 
OH---N     H-bond 
 
NH---N     H-bond 
 
H-N           covalent bond 
 
Hydrogen  bonding  can  be  intermolecular  (as  in  the  water  molecules  above)  or 
intramolecular.    Intramolecular  hydrogen  bonds  in  proteins  are  required  for  a 
protein’s 3-dimensional shape. 
 
 
Hydrogen bonds are also important in DNA structure and function.  
 
 

Hydrogen bonding in DNA 
 
Hydrogen bonding binds together complementary strands of DNA to form a double 
helix.

The  lower  bond  enthalpies  of  hydrogen  bonds  compared  to  covalent  bonds 
facilitate the separation of DNA strands during DNA replication.
