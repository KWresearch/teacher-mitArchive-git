Restriction of Rotation around Double Bonds 
See pages 5 and 6 of lecture 15 notes for a description of double bonds using valence 
bond theory and hybridization. 
 
Atoms attached by single bonds can rotate freely around the bond axis. 
 
In  contrast  double  bonds  prevent  rotation  around  the  bond  axis,  since  rotation  would 
break the pi bond (see lecture 15 notes for a discussion of sigma and pi bonds).  
 
This  means  that  molecules  are  made  rigid  by  double  bonds,  locking  a  molecule  into  a 
specific  conformation.  For  example,  cis-butene  and  trans-butene  shown  below  are  two 
distinct  molecules.  There  is  NO  rotation  around  the  double  bond.  Cis  and  trans-butene 
are examples of geometric or “cis-trans” isomers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example from lecture 15 
 
In  drugs  containing  double  bonds,  one  geometric  isomer  may  be  significantly  more 
potent  than  the  other  isomer,  since  the  lack  of  rotation  around  the  bond  prevents 
rotational  inter-conversion  between  the  two  forms.  This  means  that  one  isomer  may  be 
able  to achieve  the necessary conformation  to bind a  target molecule  (such as an enzyme 
or  receptor), while  the  other  isomer may  not  be  able  to  bind  at  all  or may  be  an  inferior 
binding partner. 
 
For example, chlorprothixine is a first generation antipsychotic drug that was first used to 
treat  schizophrenia  and  other  disorders  in  the  1950’s.  The  drug  functions  by  blocking 
certain receptors in neurons, which requires binding of  the drug  to  the receptor. Research 
has  shown  that  cis-chlorprothixene  is  biologically  active,  while  the  trans  form  is  almost 
completely  inactive.  In  fact,  the  trans  isomer  is  considered  a  contaminant  in  the  drug 
formulation.
