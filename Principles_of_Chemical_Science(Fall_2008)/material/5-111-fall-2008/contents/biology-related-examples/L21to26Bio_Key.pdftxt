Solutions to selected biology-related questions from problem sets for lectures 21-26 

 
Acid-base problems
A.   
A pharmaceutical molecule with antifungal properties is only active when deprotonated and 
negatively charged (A-). The protonated state (HA) is inactive.  If the pKa of this drug is 
10.0, (a) calculate the ratio of protonated to deprotonated compound at physiological pH 
(7.4). (b) Is this drug likely to be a useful pharmaceutical agent?  
 
(a) calculate the ratio of protonated to deprotonated compound at physiological pH (7.4). 
Since we are given both the pH and pKa of the compound, we can use the Henderson-
Hasselbalch equation to solve for the ratio of [HA] to [A-]. 
 

pH = pKa - log([HA] / [A-]) 
log([HA] / [A-]) = pKa – pH 
log([HA] / [A-]) = 10.0 – 7.4 
log([HA] / [A-]) = 2.6 
([HA] / [A-]) = 398.11 
([HA] / [A-]) = 400 (correct sig figs) 
 
The ratio of protonated (inactive) compound to deprotonated (active) compound is 400 to 
1 at physiological pH. 
 
(b) Is this drug likely to be a useful pharmaceutical agent?  
Since the vast majority of the compound is in the inactive form at physiological pH, it is 
unlikely to be a useful pharmaceutical agent.* Ideally, most of the compound would be 
active in the body.  
*However, if the active compound is highly potent, it is possible that a small fraction of 
active compound is sufficient for useful antifungal activity. 
 
B. 
Absorption of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, C9H8O4,) into the bloodstream occurs only 
when the molecule is in its conjugate base form.   
(a)  If a patient takes two tablets of aspirin (325 mg each), how many grams of aspirin 
are available for immediate absorption in the stomach?  The pH of the stomach is 1.6, 
and the pKa of aspirin is 3.5. 
   
Since we are given both the pH of the stomach and the pKa of aspirin, we can use the 
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to solve for the ratio of [HA] to [A-]. 
 

pH = pKa - log([HA] / [A-]) 
log([HA] / [A-]) = pKa – pH 
log([HA] / [A-]) = 3.5 – 1.6 
log([HA] / [A-]) = 1.9 
([HA] / [A-]) = 79

The ratio of protonated aspirin to its conjugate base is 79 to 1. 
So one-eightieth (1/80) of the total aspirin taken will be in the conjugate base form and 
available for immediate absorption in the stomach: 
 
2 x 325 mg x (1/80) = 8.75 mg 
9 mg 

 
(b)  Would you expect more or  less aspirin to be absorbed in the small intestine (pH ≈ 
7.5) compared to the stomach? Briefly explain your answer (no calculation is required).  
 
More aspirin will be absorbed in the small intestine.  The higher pH in the intestine 
means that more aspirin will be in the conjugate base form and therefore available for 
absorption.  
 
C. (Modified from problem 11.18 in Atkins 3rd ed) 
Phosphate buffers are very useful in biochemical experiments. Your research supervisor 
asks you to make up a phosphate buffer to carry out kinetic assays on an enzyme: 
3- and HPO4
2- ions required to prepare a 
(a)  Determine the ratio of molarities of PO4
phosphate buffer with a pH of 12.0? 
(b)  What mass of K3PO4 must be added to 1.00 L of 0.100 M K2HPO4(aq) to prepare a 
buffer solution with a pH of 12.0? 
 
(a) We need to think about what happens when you have a solution of PO43- and 
HPO42- in water: HPO42- (aq) + H2O ((cid:65))          PO43-(aq) + H3O+1 (aq). We can look 
up the Ka for that reaction in table10.9 (page 391 in the text), recognizing that we 
are looking at the ionization of the third proton. The Ka is 2.1 x 10-13.  Now to 
determine the ratios of ions we can substitute into the Henderson-Hasselbach 
equation:

(b) We need to realize that we are adding the potassium salt of HPO4-2, so the 
concentration of HPO4-2 is 0.100 M, so we can substitute that into the

Oxidation-reduction problems
D.  
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a harmful and reactive byproduct of metabolism.  To 
prevent H2O2 from causing extensive oxidative damage to cells, the enzyme catalase  
catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 to much less reactive molecules, oxygen and water.

Use oxidation numbers to identify which molecules are reduced and/or oxidized in this 
reaction. 
 
H2O2 is both reduced to H2O (oxidation number of oxygen changes from -1 to -2) and 
oxidized to O2 (oxidation number changes from -1 to 0).

Oxidative damage of DNA  leads  to mutation, which can  in  turn  lead  to cancer or genetic 
defects.  The  redox  potentials  of  the  four  nucleotides  of  DNA  are  listed  below.  Which 
nucleotide  (A, G, T, C)  is  the most  likely  to undergo oxidation? Explain  your answer  for 
full credit.

G is most likely to undergo oxidation. G has the lowest redox potential of the four 
bases, which indicates that it is the easiest to oxidize 
 
 
F.  
The enzyme known as laccase is a multicopper oxidase that is widely distributed in 
4- complex was used to study the structure of the 
higher plants and fungi.  The Fe(CN)6
active site of this enzyme. 
(a) Indicate the oxidation number of the central atom in this complex. 
 
Fe is the central atom. Since each of the six cyano (CN-) groups carries a -1 charge and 
the total charge of the complex is 4-, Fe has an oxidation number of 2+.
 
(b) Calculate the d-electron count 
 
The d-electron count of a metal is equal to the group number (from the periodic table) 
minus the oxidation number of the metal. 
 
The oxidation number of Fe is +2 (see part a) 
The group number of Fe is 8 
 
d-electron count = 8 – 2 = 6 
The d-electron count is d6
 
(c )What is the coordination geometry? 
 
The coordination number (CN) is 6, so the geometry is octahedral. 
 
G.  
Zinc can act as a Lewis acid, and coordinate amino acids like cysteine by their sulfhydryl 
(SH) groups.  Normally, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine has a pKa of ~8.  However, the 
interaction with zinc can lower the pKa  of the sulfhydryl group by as much as 4 pH units.  
Using your knowledge of acid/base chemistry, estimate the approximate ratio of 
protonated to deprotonated cysteine at neutral pH for (a) free cysteine (pKa of ~ 8) and 

 

4

(b)  cysteine coordinated to zinc (pKa of ~ 4).  (Since this is an estimate, don’t worry 
about sig figs).

We can treat this like a buffer problem and thus take advantage of the Henderson-
Hasselbach equation: pH = pKa – log [HA/A-]

When there is no zinc around there is 10 times as much protonated cysteine as there is 
deprotonated cysteine (activated for nucleophillic attack and therefore the form of 
cysteine which can partake in chemical reactions).

When zinc is coordinated to the cysteine there is 1000 times as much deprotonated 
cysteine as there is protonated cysteine.  In this case a much greater portion of the 
cysteines are deprotonated and ready to partake in a chemical reaction.
