Selected biology-related questions from problem sets for lectures 27-36 

 
Transition Metals 
 
A.  
Cisplatinum [Pt(NH3)2Cl2] is a potent anticancer drug. (a) Draw the structure of this square 
planar molecule and the structure of its isomer transplatinum. (b) What are the angles for a 
square planar molecule? (c) What is the CN? (d) Draw the crystal field energy-level 
diagram for cisplatinum, labeling the d-orbitals. (e) Predict whether cisplatinum is 
diamagnetic or paramagnetic? Explain your answer.  
 
B.   
Octahedral platinum(IV) complexes are used in protein crystallography to help determine 
three-dimensional protein structures.  If the octahedral crystal field splitting energy (Î”o) is 
large for these complexes, (a) predict whether they are diamagnetic or paramagnetic, and 
(b) write the expected dn electron configuration.  
 

 
Rate laws and enzyme kinetics
 
C. 
The element techneticum has never been found in nature.  It can be obtained readily as a 
product of uranium fission in nuclear power plants, however, and is produced in quantities 
of many kilograms per year.  MIT Chemistry Professor Alan Davison pioneered the use of 
Techneticum in the diagnosis of heart disease.  Calculate the total activity (in 
disintegrations per second) caused by the decay of 0.5 microgram of 99mTc (an excited 
nuclear state of 99Tc), which has a half-life of 6.0 hours. 
 
D. 
Consider the formation of a DNA double helix from strands A and B to form an unstable 
helix (UH) and a stable helix (SH). 
k 1

Step 1:

A  +  B

UH

k -1

k 2

UH

Step 2:
 
(a) What is the molecularity of each step? 
Step 1 is bimolecular and step 2 is unimolecular. 

 

SH

 
(b) Write the rate law for the formation of the stable helix (SH) using the steady-state 
approximation.  Be sure to eliminate intermediates from the rate expression.
