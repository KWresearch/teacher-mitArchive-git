Selected biology-related questions from problem sets for lectures 21-26 

 
Acid-base problems
A.   
A pharmaceutical molecule with antifungal properties is only active when deprotonated and 
negatively charged (A-). The protonated state (HA) is inactive.  If the pKa of this drug is 
10.0, (a) calculate the ratio of protonated to deprotonated compound at physiological pH 
(7.4). (b) Is this drug likely to be a useful pharmaceutical agent?  
 
B. 
Absorption of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, C9H8O4,) into the bloodstream occurs only when 
the molecule is in its conjugate base form.   
 
(a)  If a patient takes two tablets of aspirin (325 mg each), how many grams of aspirin are 
available for immediate absorption in the stomach?  The pH of the stomach is 1.6, and the 
pKa of aspirin is 3.5. 
 
(b)  Would you expect more or  less aspirin to be absorbed in the small intestine (pH ≈ 7.5) 
compared to the stomach? Briefly explain your answer (no calculation is required).  
 
C. (Modified from problem 11.18 in Atkins 3rd ed) 
Phosphate buffers are very useful in biochemical experiments. Your research supervisor 
asks you to make up a phosphate buffer to carry out kinetic assays on an enzyme: 
3- and HPO4
2- ions required to prepare a 
(a)  Determine the ratio of molarities of PO4
phosphate buffer with a pH of 12.0? 
(b)  What mass of K3PO4 must be added to 1.00 L of 0.100 M K2HPO4(aq) to prepare a 
buffer solution with a pH of 12.0? 
 
 
Oxidation-reduction problems
 
D.  
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a harmful and reactive byproduct of metabolism.  To prevent 
H2O2 from causing extensive oxidative damage to cells, the enzyme catalase  
catalyzes the conversion of H2O2 to much less reactive molecules, oxygen and water. 
 

2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2 

 
Use oxidation numbers to identify which molecules are reduced and/or oxidized in this 
reaction. 
 
E.  
Oxidative damage of DNA leads to mutation, which can in turn lead to cancer or genetic 
defects. The redox potentials of the four nucleotides of DNA are listed below. Which 

 

1

nucleotide (A, G, T, C) is the most likely to undergo oxidation? Explain your answer for full 
credit.

F.  
The enzyme known as laccase is a multicopper oxidase that is widely distributed in 
4- complex was used to study the structure of the 
higher plants and fungi.  The Fe(CN)6
active site of this enzyme. 
(a) Indicate the oxidation number of the central atom in this complex. 
(b) Calculate the d-electron count 
(c )What is the coordination geometry? 
 
 
G.  
Zinc can act as a Lewis acid, and coordinate amino acids like cysteine by their sulfhydryl 
(SH) groups.  Normally, the sulfhydryl group of cysteine has a pKa of ~8.  However, the 
interaction with zinc can lower the pKa  of the sulfhydryl group by as much as 4 pH units.  
Using your knowledge of acid/base chemistry, estimate the approximate ratio of 
protonated to deprotonated cysteine at neutral pH for (a) free cysteine (pKa of ~ 8) and (b)  
cysteine coordinated to zinc (pKa of ~ 4).  (Since this is an estimate, don’t worry about sig 
figs).
