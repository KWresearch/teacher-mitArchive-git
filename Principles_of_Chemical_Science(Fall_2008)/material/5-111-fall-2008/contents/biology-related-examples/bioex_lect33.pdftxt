Reaction Mechanism 
See lectures 32 and 33 for determining reaction mechanisms. 

Example  from  pg.  4  of  Lecture  33  notes:  The  reaction mechanism  of  natural  ozone 
depletion: 

Through  a variety of catalytic  cycles, Cl  and Br  ions catalyze  the destruction of  ozone  in 
the  stratosphere.  However,  at  high  concentrations,  ozone  decays  into  oxygen  without 
metal catalysts required: 

O3 

O2  +  O 

ratef= k1[O3]


2O3  → 3O2 
proposed mechanism: 
k1 

Step 1 
(fast 
reversible) 

Step 2 
(slow) 

k-1


k2 
O  + O3  → O2  + O2 

rater= k-1[O2][O]


rate= k2[O][O3] 

The rate is determined by the slowest step 

The rate of formation of O2  is equal to 2 times the rate of the slow step (k2[O][O3]), since 
two molecules of O2  are formed. 

Thus, rate of formation of O2  = 2k2[O][O3], but “O” is an intermediate, solve for “O” in 
terms of products and reactants and rate constants. 

Since the first step is fast and reversible and the second step is slow, the first step is in 
equilibrium and we can write 

[O]  =  k1  [O3 ]

k-1 [O2]


[O2][O]  =  k1  = K1 

or 

k-1 

[O3] 
substituting: 
rate  =  2k2 k1  [O3 ]2 

k-1 [O2] 

rate  =  kobs 	

[O3]2 
[O2] 

What is the order in O3?  2 
What is the order in O2?  -1 
What is the overall order?  1 

double O3/rate will?  multiply by 4 
double O2/  multiply by ½ 
double both O3  and O2/  double
