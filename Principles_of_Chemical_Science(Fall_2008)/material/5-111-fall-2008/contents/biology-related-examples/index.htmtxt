In an effort to illuminate connections between chemistry and biology and spark
students' excitement for chemistry, we incorporate frequent biology-related
examples into the lectures. These in-class examples range from two to ten
minutes, designed to succinctly introduce biological connections without
sacrificing any chemistry content in the curriculum.
A list of the biology-, medicine-, and MIT research-related examples used in
5.111 is provided below. Click on the associated PDF for more information on
each example.
To reinforce the connections formed in lecture, we also include biology-related
problems in each homework assignment. Selected homework problems and solutions
are available below.
                                                        Biology-related examples.
