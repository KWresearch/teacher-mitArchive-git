See lecture 31 for a discussion of kinetics versus thermodynamics. 

When  considering  a  chemical  reaction,  one  must  ask  whether  the  reaction  will  go 
(thermodynamics), and how fast the reaction will go (kinetics). 

Example  from  pg.  1  of  Lecture  31  notes:  Kinetics  of  glucose  oxidation  (energy 
production) in the body 

The oxidation of glucose provides energy for the body, which is stored in the form of 
ATP. 

C6H12O6 + 6O2 ! 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy 
Consider the Thermodynamics for the Oxidation of Glucose 
C6H12O6  + 6O2  → 6CO2  + 6H2O 
∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S° 
∆H° = -2816 kJ/mol 
T∆S° or ∆S° is (+) 
∆G° = -2,885 kJ/mol	
Thermodynamically favorable.

With such a thermodynamically favorable process, why doesn’t candy explode into CO2 
and H2O when exposed to air (see class activity)? 
KINETICS. Glucose oxidation is slow.  The body uses protein catalysts called enzymes to 
speed up the reactions. 

Example from Lecture 31 lecture: Diamonds are forever (kinetically speaking) 

Consider the thermodynamics of the conversion 

of diamonds to graphite:

For 12.01 g (1 mol) of carbon,

C(graphite)  is 2,900 J more stable than C(diamond).


This means that graphite formation is

thermodynamically favorable and spontaneous!


However, there is a HUGE activation barrier for

conversion, so diamonds are kinetically inert.
