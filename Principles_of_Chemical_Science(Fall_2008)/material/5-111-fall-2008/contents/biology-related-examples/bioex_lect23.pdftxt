pH and Buffers: Buffering in the Blood 
See  lecture  21  and  22  notes  for  acid-base  equilibrium  and  lecture  22  and  23 notes  for 
an introduction to buffers. 

A  buffer  solution  is  any  solution  that  maintains  an  approximately  constant  pH  despite 
small  additions of  acid  and base. The pH of  a buffer  is maintained by  a mixture of weak 
conjugate acids and bases, which provides a source or sink for protons. 

Blood is buffered in the pH range 7.35-7.45

- (carbonic acid/bicarbonate) 

Buffering agents in blood: H2CO3/HCO3

Example from Lecture 23 video: Effects on Blood pH from Vitamin B12  Deficiency 

The  buffering  capacity  of  a  buffered  solution  can  be  overcome  by  the  addition  of 
excessive acid or base. 

An  instance  of  too  much  acid  affecting  the  pH  of  blood  occurs  in  the  disease 
methylmalonic  aciduria,  a  metabolic  disorder  in  which  methylmalonic  acid  builds  up  in 
- buffering capacity. 
the blood and overcomes the H2CO3/HCO3

In  healthy  individuals,  fatty  acids  (fats)  are  converted  into  energy  through  the  series  of 
steps  shown  below.  Enzymes  catalyze  each  of 
these  steps,  and 
the  enzyme 
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), which requires vitamin B12  binding for activity, 
catalyzes  the  conversion  of  methylmalonyl-CoA  to  succinyl-CoA.  In  the  absence  of 
sufficient  vitamin  B12  or 
in  cases  where  vitamin  B12  cannot  bind  to  MUT, 
methylmalonyl-CoA  is instead  converted  to methylmalonic acid, and buildup of  this acid 
can result in a lowering of blood pH.

In methylmalonic aciduria, the MUT-catalyzed step cannot occur, resulting in a buildup of 
acid instead of the conversion of fatty acids into energy. 

The  disease  methylmalonic  aciduria  can  be  caused  by  insufficient  vitamin  B12  intake. 
However,  it  is  most  often  caused  by  a  genetic  mutation  in  the  gene  encoding  the  MUT 
enzyme. A  single  amino  acid  substitution  from  a  glycine  (the  smallest  amino  acid)  to  an 
arginine (a much larger amino acid) can destroy all MUT activity. 

Using  X-ray  crystallography,  scientists  determined  that  the  glycine-to-arginine  mutation 
occurs  in  the  B12  binding  pocket,  blocking  vitamin  B12  binding  (see  pictures  A  and  B 
below).  This  explains  why  it  is  not  effective  to  treat  individuals  with  methylmalonic 
aciduria  with  high  doses  of  B12,  since  the  B12  cannot  bind  to  MUT.  Using  this 
information, scientists are now looking into treatment with a truncated B12 mimic that can 
bind  in  the  blocked  pocket  of  the  mutant  MUT  enzyme  (see  picture  C  below).  This 
truncated  B12  can  partially  restore MUT  activity, and may  lead  to  a  successful  treatment 
for methylmalonic aciduria. 

The MUT enzyme is shown in white, the arginine  residue in the mutant enzyme is shown 
(blocking the binding pocket) in blue, and vitamin B12  is shown in red.
