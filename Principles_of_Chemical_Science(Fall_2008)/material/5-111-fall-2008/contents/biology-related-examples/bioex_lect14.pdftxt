2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
Discussed at the start of lecture #14 (not in notes or in the syllabus) 
 
The 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, 
and Roger Tsien for their work on Green Fluorescent Protein. 
 
The molecular structure of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) 
 
(GFP figures are from the Protein Data Base (PDB) accession number 1GFL)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
GFP is a 238-amino acid fluorescent protein that was first isolated from the jellyfish 
Aequorea Victoria. 
 
The chromophore of GFP (highlighted in magenta) is formed from natural amino acids. 
This means that GFP-tags can be expressed in vivo, making them ideal fluorescent tags in 
biological systems. 
 
The GFP chromophore is NOT fluorescent on its own, so the entire GFP protein must be 
used as a fluorescent tag. This is because the chromophore is environment sensitive and 
the fluorescence is quenched in a polar environment, such as water. 
 
Protein engineering has resulted in the development of a rainbow of other GFP analogs 
with a range of excitation and emission wavelengths.
