Metals in Biology: Crystal Field Theory and Magnetism 
See lectures 28 and 29 for an introduction to crystal field theory. 

Magnetism

Compounds possessing unpaired electrons are paramagnetic (attracted by magnetic field);

those in which the electrons are paired are diamagnetic (repelled by magnetic field).


Example  from page 4 of Lecture 29 notes:  Inspiration  from Metalloenzymes  for the 
Reduction of Greenhouse Gasses. 

A smoggy day in NYC 

Researchers  are  very  interested  in 
developing 
for 
catalysts 
new 
removing  harmful  greenhouse  gasses, 
such  as  carbon  monoxide  (CO)  and 
carbon  dioxide 
the 
from 
(CO2) 
atmosphere. 

Nature has already  figured out  how  to 
accomplish 
this.  Certain  microbes 
“live  on”  CO  or  CO2,  utilizing 
enzymes  with  metal  cofactors  that 
facilitate carbon fixation reactions.

Microbes  remove  ~100  million  tons  of  CO  from  atmosphere  each  year  and  produce  ~1 
trillion kg of acetate annually from greenhouse gases.

H2O + CO    H2 +  CO2 

•  Highly active CO metabolism 
•  Strict anaerobe 
•  Doubling time on CO is 2 hours 
•  Optimium temperature: 70 °C. 

4 H2  + 2 CO2    CH3COOH + 2 H2O 
2 H2O + 4 CO    CH3COOH + 2 CO2 

•  Model acetogenic bacterium 
•  Strict anaerobe 
•  Optimum temperature: 55 °C. 

How are these reactions facilitated? Metal clusters in enzymes. 

Nickel  is  key  to  this  amazing  chemistry,  but  in  order  to  mimic  Nature’s  solution,  it  is 
essential to know the geometry around the Ni center. 

??? geometry ??? 
initially unknown 

Putting it all together: If a Ni2+  (d8) center in an enzyme is found to be diamagnetic, does 
it have square planar, tetrahedral, or octahedral geometry?

Answer: 
The Ni site has a square planar geometry. 
(Fill in the 8 d-electrons in each diagram to 
see that only the square planar field will 
result in no unpaired electrons.) 

This square planar Ni site is found in an 
enzyme called acetyl-CoA synthase, which 
catalyzes reactions that consume CO2  and 
CO.
