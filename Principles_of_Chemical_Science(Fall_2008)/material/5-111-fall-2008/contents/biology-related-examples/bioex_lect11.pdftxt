Lewis Structures of some Biologically-Interesting Molecules 
See  lecture  10  (starting  on  page  3  of  the  notes),  lecture  11,  and  lecture  12  for  a 
description of covalent bonding and Lewis structures. 
 
Lewis  structures  can  be  found  in  almost  any  chemistry  laboratory  notebook  at  MIT.  
They are easy  to draw and quickly communicate  information about  the  functional groups 
and reactivity of small molecules.   
 
Below are two examples of molecules frequently used to teach Lewis structure rules with 
some  additional  information  about  the  chemical  and  biological  significance  of  the 
molecules. 
 
Example 1) from page 2 of Lecture 11 notes: Cynanide ion (CN-1) 
Salts of CN-1, such as sodium cyanide (NaCN) and potassium cyanide (KCN), are used as 
reagents  in organic synthesis. These  reagents are very  reactive and allow chemists  to add 
a  carbon  atom  to  molecules,  a  reaction  that  is  very  useful  in  the  synthesis  of  complex 
molecules.

However, students may be more familiar with cyanide as a poison.  Even in a laboratory 
setting,  cyanide  salts  are  considered  dangerous  to  work  with 
and are  labeled as a PHS  (a particularly hazardous  substance), 
requiring  special  safety  precautions.    Hydrogen  cyanide 
(HCN) smells like almonds, and while there are trace amounts 
of  cyanide  in  certain  types  of  almonds,  the  concentrations  are 
far too small to cause any harm.

In contrast, dangerous levels of cyanide (or a cyanide precursor) can be found in cassava, 
a  shrub  native  to  South America.   Although  it  is  poor  in 
protein  and  nutrients,  the  cassava  root  is  a  major  source 
of  carbohydrates  for  much  of  the  world.    Roots,  which 
are  eaten  cooked  or  raw 
throughout  Africa,  are 
characterized  as  sweet  or  bitter.    Bitter  cassava  roots 
contain  high  levels  of  cyanide,  even when  cooked.  Plant 
scientists  have  developed  techniques  to  reduce  the 
cyanide  concentrations,  namely  by  mixing  the  cassava 
powder  with  water,  spreading  it  very  thin  and  leaving  it 
in  the sun  for several hours. This enables  the enzymes  in 
the flour to break down the cyanide, releasing the poison 
as  HCN  into  the  air.    This  cassava  preparation  is 
promoted  throughout  rural  African  villages  that  rely  on 
cassava as a major part of their diet.

Luckily  in  the  US,  we  don’t  have  to  worry  about  ingesting  dangerous  levels  of 
cyanide…unless you smoke.  HCN is a component of cigarette smoke.

Example 2) from pages 2-3 of Lecture 11 notes: Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) 
 
 
 
 
 
SOCl2  is  a  reagent  used  in  organic  and medicinal  chemistry  to  convert  carboxylic  acid 
(COOH)  groups  to  acid  chloride  (COCl)  groups  in  molecules.    One  example  of  using 
SOCl2  in  the  synthesis  of  pharmaceuticals  is  for  novacaine,  an  anesthetic  drug  used  in 
dentistry  and  to  reduce  pain  in  intramuscular  injections  of  other  drugs,  such  as 
antibiotics.
