Transition Metals and Coordination Complexes 
See pages 2 and 3 of lecture 27 notes for an introduction to coordination complexes. 
See page 5 of lecture 27 notes for a discussion of geometric isomers. 

Chelate Effect in Coordination Complexes:

Ligands that bind a metal at one site are called unidentate or monodentate (one tooth).


Ligands that have two or more points of attachment to the metal are called chelating 

ligands and the coordination complexes are called chelates (greek for claws).


Bidentate – two points of attachment

Tridentate – three points of attachment

Tetradentate  –  four points of attachment  (ex. corrin ring of vitamin B12)

Hexadentate – six points of attachment (ex. EDTA)


Metal  chelates  are  unusually  stable.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  favorable  entropic  factor

accompanying  release  of  non-chelating  ligands  (usually  H2O)  from  the  coordination

sphere.


Examples from page 4 of Lecture 27 notes: Chelation Complexes in Biology 

Vitamin B12 
In  vitamin  B12,  the  cobalt  is  coordinated  by  a  planar  tetradentate  ligand  (corrin  ring 
system).  It  is  also  coordinated  by  an  upper  axial  ligand  (5’deoxyadenosine)  and  a  lower 
axial ligand (dimethylbenzimidazole) 

Dorothy  Crowfoot  Hodgkin  used  X-ray  crystallography  to  determine  the  structure  of 
vitamin  B12,  for  which  she  was  awarded  the  1964  Nobel  Prize  in  Chemistry.  Her  work 
pioneered  the use of  crystallography  to  solve  the  structure of  complex molecules. Today 
crystallography  is  used  to  determine  structures  of  incredibly  large  and  complex 
molecules, such as proteins.

EDTA in complex with metal (M) 

Binding  of  EDTA  is  entropically  favorable  for  a  metal.  Six  molecules  of  H2O  are 
released for every 1 molecule of EDTA bound.

In medicine – ETDA is used as a treatment for acute lead poisoning. 
EDTA chelates the lead, and the chelation complex is excreted from the body. This 
treatment is only used for severe cases of lead poisoning, and patienta are carefully 
monitored because EDTA also chelates other (essential) metals in the body. 

Other uses of EDTA include: 
Food additive – “added for freshness” since bacteria requires metals for survival 
Bathtub cleaner – EDTA chelates Ca2+  in tub scum 
Hollywood – In the vampire movie “Blade”, ETDA is used to kill vampires by chelating 
iron in the blood.

Geometric (Cis-Trans) Isomers 

Stereoisomers: 
Molecules with the same molecular formula and atomic connectivity, but different atomic 
arrangements in space. Geometric isomers can have vastly different properties. 

Example from page 5 of Lecture 27 notes: The Anti-Cancer Drug Cis-Platin 

[Pt(NH3)2Cl2]  has  two  geometric  isomers.  The  cis  isomer,  cis-platin,  is  a  potent 
chemotherapeutic agent, while the trans stereoisomer has negligible anti-cancer activity.

Putative  mechanism  of  action:  Following  displacement  of  a  chloride  (Cl)  ligand  with 
water,  cis-platin  coordinates  to  DNA  in  cancer  cells,  thereby  inhibiting  DNA 
transcription  and  leading  to  apoptosis  (programmed  cell  death).  Trans-platin  is  thought 
to be deactiviated in cells and does not bind DNA.
