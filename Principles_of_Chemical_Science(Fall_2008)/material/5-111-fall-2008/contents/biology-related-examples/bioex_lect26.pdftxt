Chemical and Biological Oxidation/Reduction Reactions 
See  pages  1-3  of  lecture  26  notes  for  the  relationship  between  Gibbs  free  energy  and 
cell  potential.  See  pages  3-6  of  Lecture  26  notes  for  adding  and  subtracting  half-cell 
reactions. 

Example from page 1 of Lecture 27 notes: 

Reduction of Vitamin B12  in the Body 
Proper  functioning  of  an  enzyme  called  methionine  synthase  is  thought  to  be  necessary 
for  preventing  heart  disease  and  birth  defects  and  for  maintaining  mental  health.  This 
enzyme requires vitamin B12  and folic acid.

methionine synthase. 

The B12 molecule is shown in black. 
(Figure from PDB: 1BMT) 

THE VITAMIN B12  MUST BE REDUCED FOR THE ENZYME TO BE ACTIVE. 

Where do you get vitamin B12  and folic acid in your diet? 
Vitamin B12: Red meat 
Folic acid: Beer (Norwegian), Leafy green vegetables, Orange juice 

Vitamin B12  has a large negative reduction potential, so how is it reduced in the 
body? 

Vitamin B12  is reduced by a protein called flavodoxin. 

E° for vitamin B12  is -0.526 V 
E° for flavodoxin is -0.230 V 

Which is the better reducing agent, vitamin B12 or flavodoxin? 

Answer: Vitamin B12  is a better reducing agent than flavodoxin, meaning B12  is harder to 
reduce. 

Is the reduction of vitamin B12  by flavodoxin spontaneous? 

Answer: 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(reduction) - E° (oxidation) 
=  E° (vitamin B12) - E° (flavodoxin) 
= -0.526 V -(-0.230 V) = -0.296 V 

∆G°  = -nℑ∆E° = -(1)(96485 Cmol-1)(-0.296 V) = +28.6 kJ/mol 

No. Reduction of vitamin B12  by flavodoxin is NOT spontaneous (∆G° is positive). 

Since  vitamin  B12  is  a  better  reducing  agent  than  flavodoxin,  we  might  expect  that 
vitamin B12  should reduce flavodoxin, not the other way around. So why don't we all 
have heart disease and megaloblastic anemia? 

In other words, how is the B12  reduction reaction driven forward? 

Answer: S-adenosylmethionine provides the energy to drive the reaction.

The ∆G° for the cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine is -37.6 kJ/mol 

What do you call a cell in which an unfavorable reaction is driven forward by applying 
energy? 

Answer: Electrolytic Cell 

(For  more  information  on  vitamin  B12:  Lecture  23  includes  a  different  example  of  an 
enzyme  that  requires B12-binding,  and Lecture 27  includes a  chelation-complex  example 
with the structure of vitamin B12.)
