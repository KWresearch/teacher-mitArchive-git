Wave-Particle Duality of Light: Quantum Dot Research at MIT 
See Lecture 3 for a description of the wave-particle duality of light. 
 
Example from page 5 of Lecture 3 notes following a description of the relationship 
between the wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) of light:  λν = c = 2.9979 x 108 ms-1
 
Quantum  dots  are 
fluorescent  nanoparticles  of 
semiconductor  material.  Their  small  size  and  favorable 
fluorescent  properties  (such  as  intense  brightness) make 
them  ideal  candidates  for  biological  and  medicinal 
imaging applications. For example, chemical attachment 
of  quantum  dots  to  specific  cell  types,  such  as  cancer 
cells, may lead to important advances in imaging cancer. 
By  shining  UV  light  onto  the  area  near  a  tumor  and 
detecting  the  light  emitted  from  the  quantum  dots,  a 
surgeon could unambiguously visualize tumor cells.

MIT Chemistry Research Example: 
 
Research  in  the  Bawendi  laboratory  includes  the  synthesis  and  application  of 
quantum  dots,  semiconductor  crystals  of  <10  nm  in  diameter.  Quantum  dots  excited 
by  UV  radiation  emit  light  of  characteristic  color  that  corresponds  to  the  size  and 
material  of  the  quantum  dot.  Smaller  dots  emit  bluer  (higher  frequency)  light  and 
larger  dots  emit  redder  (lower  frequency)  light.  Quantum  dots  are  being  used  and 
designed for an ever-increasing number of biological and sensor applications.

•  Methods  developed  by  the  Bawendi  lab  for  synthesizing  quantum  dots  are 
now used by research groups around the world. 
•  In  collaboration  with  other  laboratories,  including  the  lab  of  MIT  professor 
Alice  Ting,  new  cell  imaging  applications  are  being  developed  for  quantum 
dots.
