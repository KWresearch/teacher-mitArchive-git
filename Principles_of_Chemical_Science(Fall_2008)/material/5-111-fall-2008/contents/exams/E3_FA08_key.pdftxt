Third Hour Exam 
5.111 
Write  your  name  below.    This  is  a  closed  book  exam.    Solve  all  6  problems.    Read  all  problems 
thoroughly and read all parts of a problem.  Many of the latter parts of a problem can be solved without 
having  solved  earlier  parts.    Show  all  work  to  receive  full  credit.    Physical  constants,  formulas, 
standard  reduction  potentials,  and  a  periodic  table  are  given  on  the  last  two  pages  of  the  exam.    You 
may detach the last 2 pages after the exam has started.

ΔG = ΔH - TΔS 
ΔG = -602 kJ/mol  - 273(-0.108 kJmol-1K-1) 

1. THERMODYNAMICS (14 points total) 
Consider the formation of MgO (s).  Assume that ΔH r° and ΔSr° are independent of temperature.      
       
ΔH r° =  -602 kJ/mol 
     
Mg (s) + 1/2 O2 (g) → MgO (s) 
Sr° =  -108 JK-1mol-1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Δ
  
(a) (6 points) Calculate ΔG r° for the formation of MgO (s) at 0 °C (273 K). Is the reaction spontaneous 
or non-spontaneous at 0 °C? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) (6 points) Is there a temperature at which the formation of MgO switches from spontaneous to non-
spontaneous or vice versa?  If no, explain briefly why not.  If yes, calculate the temperature (T*) at 
which the spontaneity of the reaction switches. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

0 = ΔH – T*ΔS 
T* = ΔH / ΔS   
 
 
 
T* = 5574 K 
 
T* = 5570 K 

T* =  -602 kJ/mol 
         - 0.108 kJ/mol•K 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

Yes.

2. CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM (12 points total) 
 
Explain the effect of each of the following stresses on the position of the following equilibrium: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

shift toward products 

Heat is produced in the forward direction.  As heat is removed, the reaction will shift to  
produce more heat. 

3 NO (g)                N2O (g) +  NO2 (g)  
The reaction as written is exothermic. 
 
(a) (4 points) The equilibrium mixture is cooled. Explain your answer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) (4 points) The volume of the equilibrium mixture is reduced at constant temperature. Explain your 
answer. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c) (4 points) Gaseous argon (which does not react) is added to the equilibrium mixture while both the 
total gas pressure and the temperature are kept constant. Explain your answer.
 

If volume decreases, then the total pressure (and each partial pressure) increases. 

 
3 mol of g to 2 mol of g 
reaction shifts to 2 mol of gas. 

shift toward products 

 

shift toward reactants 

If total pressure is the same, volume must have increased.  If volume increased, the partial 
pressure of each gas decreased, so shift to side with more mol of gas to compensate 

 

3 mol g    ←   2 mol g
