Second Hour Exam- Answer Key

5.111 
Write your name below.   Do not open  the exam until  the start of the exam  is announced.   The exam 
is closed notes and closed book.  
1.  Read each part of each problem carefully and thoroughly.   
2.  Read  all  parts  of  each  problem.    MANY  OF  THE  LATTER  PARTS  OF  A  PROBLEM  CAN  BE 
SOLVED WITHOUT HAVING SOLVED EARLIER PARTS.  However, if you need a numerical result 
that  you  were  not  successful  in  obtaining  for  the  computation  of  a  latter  part,  make  a  physically 
reasonable approximation for that quantity (and indicate it as such) and use it to solve the latter parts.  
3.   A problem  that  requests  you  to  “calculate”  implies  that  several  calculational  steps may be necessary 
for the problem’s solution.  You must show these steps clearly and indicate all values, including physical 
constants used to obtain your quantitative result.  Significant figure usage must be correct.     
4.    If  you  don’t  understand what  the  problem  is  requesting,  raise  your  hand  and  a  proctor will  come  to 
your desk.   
5.    Physical  constants,  formulas  and  a  periodic  table  are  given  on  the  last  page.    You  may  detach  this 
page once the exam has started.

KF has an ionic bond with a bond length of 0.217 nm. Calculate the ∆E, in kJ/mol, for the formation of 
a KF bond from the neutral atoms K and F.  For this calculation, assume that the potassium and fluorine 
ions are point charges. IE and EA information for K and F is provided in the table below.
