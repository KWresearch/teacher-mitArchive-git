First Hour Exam

Write your name below.   Do not open  the exam until  the start of the exam  is announced.   The exam 
is closed notes and closed book.  
1.  Read each part of each problem carefully and thoroughly.   
2.  Read  all  parts  of  each  problem.    MANY  OF  THE  LATTER  PARTS  OF  A  PROBLEM  CAN  BE 
SOLVED WITHOUT HAVING SOLVED EARLIER PARTS.  However, if you need a numerical result 
that  you  were  not  successful  in  obtaining  for  the  computation  of  a  latter  part,  make  a  physically 
reasonable approximation for that quantity (and indicate it as such) and use it to solve the latter parts.  
3.  A problem that requests you to “calculate” implies that several calculation steps may be necessary for 
the  problem’s  solution.    You  must  show  these  steps  clearly  and  indicate  all  values,  including  physical 
constants used to obtain your quantitative result.  Significant figures must be correct.     
4.    If  you  don’t  understand what  the  problem  is  requesting,  raise  your  hand  and  a  proctor will  come  to 
your desk.   
5.    Physical  constants,  formulas  and  a  periodic  table  are  given  on  the  last  page.    You  may  detach  this 
page once the exam has started.

A  beam  of  light with  an  intensity  of  15 W  is  incident  on  a  copper  plate  (φ  =  7.43  x  10-19  J).    Electrons 
with a minimum wavelength of 3.75 x 10-10 m are ejected from the surface of the copper.

A  beam  of  light with  an  intensity  of  15 W  is  incident  on  a  copper  plate  (φ =  7.43  x  10-19  J).    Electrons 
with a minimum wavelength of 3.75 x 10-10 m are ejected from the surface of the copper.   
 
(b)  (6  points) Calculate  the maximum  number  of  electrons  that  can  be  ejected  by  a  3.0-second  pulse  of 
the incident light. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(c)  (4  points)  If  a  new  light  source  (Ei  =  7.19  x  10-19  J)  with  an  intensity  of  35  W  is  incident  on  the 
copper surface, what is the maximum number of electrons that can be ejected from a 6.0 second pulse of 
light?

  2. (16 points) One-electron atoms: 
 
Consider a Ca19+ ion with its electron in the 5th excited state. 
 
(a)  (12  points)  Calculate  the  longest wavelength  of  light  that  could  be  emitted when  the  Ca19+  electron 
transitions to a lower energy state.  Report your answer with three significant figures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b)  (4  points)  Suppose  the  same  transition  as  in  part  (a)  took  place  in  a  hydrogen  atom.  Would  the 
wavelength of emission be longer than, shorter than, or the same as your answer to part (a). Very briefly 
explain  why.    (Note:  This  question  does  NOT  require  a  calculation.    Also,  you  do  not  need  to  use  the 
answer to part (a) to answer this question.)

3. (32 points) Multi-electron atoms 
(a)  (16  points)  An  x-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  experiment  with  an  unidentified  element,  X,  
displays an emission spectrum with four distinct kinetic energies: 5.9 x 10-17 J, 2.53 x 10-18 J, 2.59 x 10-
20  J,  and  2.67  x  10-20  J.  (Assume  the  incident  light  has  sufficient  energy  to  eject  any  electron  in  the 
atom.)
