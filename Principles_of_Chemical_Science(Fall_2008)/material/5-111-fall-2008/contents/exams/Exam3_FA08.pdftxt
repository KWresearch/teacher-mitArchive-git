Third Hour Exam 
5.111 
Write  your  name  below.    This  is  a  closed  book  exam.    Solve  all  6  problems.    Read  all  problems 
thoroughly and read all parts of a problem.  Many of the latter parts of a problem can be solved without 
having  solved  earlier  parts.    Show  all  work  to  receive  full  credit.    Physical  constants,  formulas, 
standard  reduction  potentials,  and  a  periodic  table  are  given  on  the  last  two  pages  of  the  exam.    You 
may detach the last 2 pages after the exam has started.

 (a) (6 points) Calculate ΔG r° for the formation of MgO (s) at 0 °C (273 K). Is the reaction 
spontaneous or non-spontaneous at 0 °C? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(b) (6 points) Is there a temperature at which the formation of MgO switches from spontaneous to non-
spontaneous or vice versa?  If no, explain briefly why not.  If yes, calculate the temperature (T*) at 
which the spontaneity of the reaction switches.
