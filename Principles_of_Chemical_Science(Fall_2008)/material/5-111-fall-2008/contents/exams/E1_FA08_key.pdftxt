Write your name below.   Do not open  the exam until  the start of the exam  is announced.   The exam 
is closed notes and closed book.  
1.  Read each part of each problem carefully and thoroughly.   
2.  Read  all  parts  of  each  problem.    MANY  OF  THE  LATTER  PARTS  OF  A  PROBLEM  CAN  BE 
SOLVED WITHOUT HAVING SOLVED EARLIER PARTS.  However, if you need a numerical result 
that  you  were  not  successful  in  obtaining  for  the  computation  of  a  latter  part,  make  a  physically 
reasonable approximation for that quantity (and indicate it as such) and use it to solve the latter parts.  
3.  A problem that requests you to “calculate” implies that several calculation steps may be necessary for 
the  problem’s  solution.    You  must  show  these  steps  clearly  and  indicate  all  values,  including  physical 
constants used to obtain your quantitative result.  Significant figures must be correct.     
4.    If  you  don’t  understand what  the  problem  is  requesting,  raise  your  hand  and  a  proctor will  come  to 
your desk.   
5.    Physical  constants,  formulas  and  a  periodic  table  are  given  on  the  last  page.    You  may  detach  this 
page once the exam has started.

  2. (16 points) One-electron atoms: 
 
Consider a Ca19+ ion with its electron in the 5th excited state.      n = 6 state 
 
(a)  (12  points)  Calculate  the  longest wavelength  of  light  that  could  be  emitted when  the  Ca19+  electron 
transitions to a lower energy state.  Report your answer with three significant figures.

(b)  (4  points)  Suppose  the  same  transition  as  in  part  (a)  took  place  in  a  hydrogen  atom.  Would  the 
wavelength of emission be longer than, shorter than, or the same as your answer to part (a). Very briefly 
explain  why.    (Note:  This  question  does  NOT  require  a  calculation.    Also,  you  do  not  need  to  use  the 
answer to part (a) to answer this question.) 
 
n = 6  to n = 5 in H atom 
For H atom, Z =1, so the ν of the emitted light would be lower.  Since ν = c/λ, the wavelength of the 
emitted light would be longer than the answer to part (a).

3. (32 points) Multi-electron atoms 
(a)  (16  points)  An  x-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  experiment  with  an  unidentified  element,  X,  
displays an emission spectrum with four distinct kinetic energies: 5.9 x 10-17 J, 2.53 x 10-18 J, 2.59 x 10-
20  J,  and  2.67  x  10-20  J.  (Assume  the  incident  light  has  sufficient  energy  to  eject  any  electron  in  the 
atom.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(i) (4 points) Name all of the possible ground state atoms that could yield this spectrum. 
4 orbitals: 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s 
 
 Na 
or Mg 

(ii) (8 points) Calculate the binding energy of an electron in the 2p orbital of element X if the x-rays 
used for the spectroscopy experiment had an energy of 2.68 x 10-16 J.  
 
2p orbital: 2nd lowest IE, so 2nd highest KE. 
  KE = 2.53 x 10-18 J 
 
Ei = IE  +  KE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BE  = -IE  = -2.65 x 10-16 J  (also accept –2.66 x 10-16 J) 

IE  = Ei – KE 
IE = 2.68 x 10-16 J – 0.0253 x 10-16 J 
IE = 2.6547 x 10-16 J 

 
 
 

 
 

 

 
 
 
 

(iii) (4 points) Consider both the filled and unfilled orbitals of element X.  Determine the number of: 
total nodes in a 4d orbital: 
 
n – 1     4 – 1  = 3 total nodes 
 
 
angular nodes in the 2py orbital: 
 
l    p orbitals have l = 1   1 angular node 
 
 
degenerate 5p orbitals:

kJ/mol, and 2912 kJ/mol respectively.

(ii)  (4  points)  Would  it  be  expected  that  the  minimum  energy  necessary  to  eject  a  3s  electron 
from phosphorus  in a photoelectron spectroscopy experiment be  larger, smaller, or the same as 
the 4th ionization energy (IE4) of phosphorus?  Briefly explain your answer. 

[Ne] 3s23p3                         [Ne] 3s13p3  +  e-
 
The E to eject a 3s electron from P would be smaller than the 4th IE because there are more 
electrons in P, meaning more shielding and a lower Zeff.

(iii) (4 points) Which experience less shielding, 3s-electrons or 3p-electrons in phosphorus? Very 
briefly explain why. 

 
    3s    3s  e-s penetrate closer to the nucleus, so Zeff avg for 3s > Zeff avg for 3p. 
 
 

(iv)  (4  points)  On  the  plot  below,  graph  the  radial  probability  distribution  for  a  phosphorus  3p 
orbital with a solid line. Label the rmp, and point to each node with an arrow.  Label the axes, but 
do not include numbers or units.

(v) (2 points) Is the rmp for a hydrogen 3p orbital longer or shorter than the rmp for a 3p 
phosphorus orbital?  Very briefly explain why. 
 
rmp for a H 3p orbital is longer because Zeff is smaller for the H atom (because Z is less).
