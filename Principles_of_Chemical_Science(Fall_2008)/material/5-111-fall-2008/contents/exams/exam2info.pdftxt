5.111 Principles of Chemical Science
Fall 2008

Exam 2 covers  lectures #10-17 and associated reading and problem sets 4-5.    It may also 
draw on earlier topics.  The exam is closed book and closed notes. You will need to bring 
your  calculator.    Please  note  that  bringing  calculators  with  any  relevant  physical  or 
chemical  information  is  cheating.  The  one  and  only  exception  is  that  if  your  calculator 
includes  values  for  extremely  common  fundamental  physical  constants  like  c  and  h  and 
me, it is acceptable to use them. No constants that are commonly defined in terms of such 
fundamental  constants  (for  example,  the  Rydberg  constant)  are  acceptable.  It  is  your 
responsibility  to  make  sure  that  no  unacceptable  information  is  available  on  your 
calculator.  
 
A  sheet  that  includes  a  list  of  physical  constants,  a  periodic  table  without  electron 
configurations  and most  equations will  be  supplied.   On  the  exam,  please  pay  attention 
to significant figures and units and box your final answer. 
 
The  new  equations  for which  you  are  responsible  include  calculating  formal  charge,  and 
calculating  reaction enthalpies  from heats of  formation and bond enthalpies.    In addition, 
you  need  to  know  principles  such  as,  covalent  and  ionic  bonding;  Lewis  structures; MO 
theory; hybridization;  relationships between ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS; and Hess's  law.   These are 
examples of principles that you should know, but this is NOT an all-inclusive list.   
 
You are responsible for knowing the following guidelines for relative MO energies: 
 
For homonuclear diatomic molecules: 
•  The relative E ordering is πpx and πpy < σpz if Z < 8. 
•  The relative E ordering is σpz < πpx and πpy if Z = or > 8 for any row two elements 
and other examples we will see in this course (or on the exam). 
For heteronuclear diatomic molecules: 
•  The relative E ordering is πpx and πpy < σpz if Z < 8 for both atoms. 
•  You are NOT  responsible  for predicting  the energy  level ordering  if either one of 
the atoms has Z = or > 8. 

 
For full credit on MO diagrams,  
• 
label increasing energy with an arrow next to the diagram. 
•  pay attention to whether the question asks for valence electrons or all electrons. 
• 
for  any  bonding  orbital  drawn,  include  the  corresponding  anti-bonding  orbital, 
even if it is not filled with any electrons. 
•  Label  each  atomic  orbital  (1s,  2s,  2px,  2py,  etc.)  and  each molecular  orbital  (σ2s, 
π2px, π2py, etc.) that you draw. 
•  Fill in the electrons for both the atomic and molecular orbitals. 

5.111 Instructions and Logistics for Exam 2 

 
As with exam 1, the nature of exam 2 material requires both understanding AND 
LOTS OF PRACTICE for success.  Please plan your studying accordingly.
