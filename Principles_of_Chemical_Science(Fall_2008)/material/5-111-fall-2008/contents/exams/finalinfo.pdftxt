INSTRUCTIONS AND LOGISTICS FOR 5.111 FINAL EXAM 
 
 
 
FINAL  (300  points):  Approximately  140  points  of  the  final  exam  covers  lectures  #27-36  (transition 
metals  and  kinetics),  associated  reading,  problem  sets  #9-10,  and  the  extra  problem  set.  
Approximately 160 points of the final exam covers lectures #1-26 and associated reading, and problem 
sets  #1-8.   Exam  is  closed  book  and  closed  notes.    Paper  or  electronic  dictionaries  are  not  allowed. A 
list  of  physical  constants,  equations,  and  a  periodic  table  without  electron  configurations  will  be 
supplied.  Bring  your  calculator.    Please  note  that  bringing  calculators  with  any  relevant  physical  or 
chemical  information  is cheating. The one and only exception  is  that  if your calculator  includes values 
for extremely common fundamental physical constants like c and h and me, it is acceptable to use it. No 
constants  that  are  commonly  defined  in  terms  of  fundamental  constants  (for  example,  the  Rydberg 
constant or  the Bohr  radius) are acceptable.  It  is your  responsibility  to make  sure  that no unacceptable 
information  is  available  on  your  calculator.  Quantitative  solutions  to  problems  must  have  the  correct 
number  of  significant  figures.    Full  credit  will  only  be  awarded  if  your  work  is  presented  clearly, 
contains correct units, and is intelligible. 
 

Equations  that  you  are  responsible  for  are  the  same  as  those  for  the  hour  exams.    See 
instructions  for Exams 1, 2, and 3.   For  the new material, you are  required  to know  that  I-, Br-, Cl- are 
weak field ligands, that F-, OH-, H2O are weak to intermediate field ligands, and that NH3, CN-, CO are 
strong  field  ligands.   Equations  that you need  to know  include  those  for  calculating  electron d-counts, 
CFSE, E=hν, c=λν, ∆E = Ea,f-Ea,r.
