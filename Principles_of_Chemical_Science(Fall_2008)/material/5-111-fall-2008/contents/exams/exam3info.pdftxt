5.111 INSTRUCTIONS AND LOGISTICS FOR EXAM III 

 
 
Exam  III  covers  Lectures  17-26  (Entropy  and  Free  Energy,  Chemical  Equilibrium,  Acid-Base 
Equilibrium, Oxidation-Reduction)  and  associated  reading  and  problem  sets  #6,  #7,  and  #8.    The  exam 
is  closed  book  and  closed  notes.    Bring  your  calculator.  Please  note  that  bringing  calculators  with  any 
relevant  physical  or  chemical  information  is  cheating.  The  one  and  only  exception  is  that  if  your 
calculator  includes values  for extremely common  fundamental physical constants  like c and h and me,  it 
is  acceptable  to  use  them.  No  constants  that  are  commonly  defined  in  terms  of  such  fundamental 
constants (for example, the Rydberg constant or the Bohr radius) are acceptable. It is your responsibility 
to  make  sure  that  no  unacceptable  information  is  available  on  your  calculator.  A  list  of  physical 
constants,  a  periodic  table  without  electron  configurations,  and  most  equations  will  be  supplied.    Full 
credit  for a problem will be given only  if each step of  its solution  is clearly shown,  including  the values 
of the constants.  Quantitative solutions to problems must have the correct number of significant figures.
