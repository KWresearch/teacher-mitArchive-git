5.111 Instructions and Logistics for Exam 1 

 
 
Exam 1 covers lectures #1-9 (though the end of lecture #9 notes) and associated reading and problem sets 
#1-3. The  exam  is  closed  book  and  closed notes. You will need  to bring your calculator. Please note  that 
bringing  calculators  with  any  relevant  physical  or  chemical  information  is  cheating.  The  one  and  only 
exception is that if your calculator includes values for extremely common fundamental physical constants 
like  c,  h  and  me,  it  is  acceptable  to  use  them.  No  constants  that  are  commonly  defined  in  terms  of  such 
fundamental  constants  (for  example,  the  Rydberg  constant  or  the  Bohr  radius)  are  acceptable.  It  is  your 
responsibility to make sure that no unacceptable information is available on your calculator.  
 
A  sheet  that  includes  a  list  of  physical  constants,  a  periodic  table  without  electron  configurations,  and 
most  equations  will  be  supplied  for  exam.    Please  note  that  values  used  for  physical  constants  must  be 
shown in your answers. Partial credit for a problem will be given only if each step of its solution is clearly 
shown.    Please  pay  attention  to  significant  figures  and  units  and  box  your  final  answer.    Equations 
for which you are responsible include E = hν = hc/λ, c = νλ, KE = (½)mv2, and p = mv.  In addition, you 
need  to  know  principles  such  as  how  to  determine  the  number  of  radial  and  angular  nodes  in  a 
wavefunction,  electron  configurations,  conservation  of  energy  as  applied  to  the  photoelectric  effect  and 
photoelectron  spectroscopy,  the  relationship  between  the  four  quantum  numbers,  and  the  physical 
significance of RPD.  You should be able to sketch the RPD’s for all orbitals up through n = 4. These are 
examples of principles that you should know, but this is NOT an all-inclusive list.
