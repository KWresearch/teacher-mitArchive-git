5.111 Recitation Scenarios / Case Studies Led by Former 5.111 TAs 

Part 1: Examples 1-4 

1)  The  student  who  lacks  study  skills.  A  student  who  is  constantly  requesting  more 
materials, including other books to read or more practice problems, thinking that this will 
clarify  the  confusion  from  the  assigned  readings  and  problems.  A  discussion  on  how  to 
help  your  class  succeed  in  5.111  with  good  study  skills,  including  stressing  the 
importance  of  understanding  each  homework  problem,  setting  aside  sufficient  time  to 
study, and coming to office hours prepared with specific questions.

2)  The  needy  student.  The  story  of  a  student  who  takes  advantage  of  the  TA’s  time, 
refusing  to put  in any  serious work on his/her  own,  requesting more  and more  time from 
the  TA,  and  making  increasingly  questionable  excuses  for  incomplete  or  poor  work.  A 
discussion  on  how  to  deal  with  this  type  of  student,  as  well  as  students  who  come  to 
office hours without specific questions,  looking for  lecture summaries (“acid-base…what 
is  that  about?”). Also  how  to deal with  students who  request  unwarranted  homework  re-
grades.

3)  The  students with  identical homework  answers  and  the  student  caught  cheating. 
A  case  of  two  students  that  hand  in  identical  problem  sets.  The  MIT  chemistry 
department  policy  states  that  students  are  encouraged  to  work  together,  but  absolutely 
may  not  copy  answers  and  must  hand  in  their  own  work.  Also,  the  case  of  a  student 
caught  cheating  on  an  exam  or  with  clickers.  A  discussion  on  how  to  handle  copied 
homework  and  other  forms  of  cheating.  There  can  be  a  misconception  by  students  that 
the  problem  set  grades  are  more  important  than  the  experience  of  trying  each  problem 
themselves  and  assessing what  areas  they  need  to  spend more  time  on  to  succeed  on  the 
exams.

4) The  student with  a weak  science background. A  student  from  an  economically  less 
privileged school district  that has a very weak  science background and struggles with  the 
5.111  material  despite  putting  in  an  excellent  effort.  A  discussion  on  how  to  give  such 
students  the  needed  encouragement  and  help  and  on  the  tutoring  and  advising  resources 
at MIT.

Part 2: Examples 5-8 

5)  The  student who  thinks  he/she  is  failing. A  student who  is  doing  fine  in  the  course, 
but  is convinced  that he/she is failing. A discussion on students’  insecurities at MIT after 

being  at  the  top  of  their  class  in  high  school  and  the  perception  that  they  don’t  belong 
here  or  were  accepted  into  MIT  by  accident.  Also  as  discussion  on  when  this  type  of 
person DOES end up failing (leading into the next topic…)

6)  The  student who  is  failing. A  struggling  student who  is  in  danger  of  failing  this  and 
perhaps  other  courses.  A  discussion  on  what  steps  to  take,  including  contacting  the 
freshman  advisor  to  get more  information,  and when  it might  be  appropriate  to  advise  a 
student  to  drop  the  course.  Some  students  in  this  situation  are  overcommitted  both  with 
the number of classes they are taking and with extracurricular activities.  Also, what to do 
when you think the academic issue might be related to personal or mental health issues.

7)  The  “advanced”  student  who  questions  your  authority  as  a  TA.  The  case  of  a 
student that tries to trick or stump the TA with off-topic questions or makes inappropriate 
comments meant  to  undermine  your  authority  as  the  teacher.  This  only  occurs  in  one  or 
two  recitations  each  year,  but  it  is  important  to  be  aware  of  so  you  can  handle  the 
situation before it escalates. Also how  to handle “red herring” questions or questions that 
stray too far from the course material without confusing other students in the class.

8) Balancing classwork, lab selection and TAing.  A discussion of how to balance your 
own time during the first semester and how to deal with the stress of trying to teach while 
simultaneously  taking classes and  trying  to select  a lab. How  to prioritize your  time,  stay 
organized, and keep on top of your work.
