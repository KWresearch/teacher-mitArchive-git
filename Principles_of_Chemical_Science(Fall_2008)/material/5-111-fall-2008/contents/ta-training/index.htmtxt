All Teaching Assistants (TAs) for 5.111 must go through a 5-day training prior
to the start of the course.
***** Teaching Assistant (TA) Information and Expectations for 5.111 *****
Throughout the course, we will introduce connections between disciplines and
demonstrate the relevance of chemical principles by incorporating examples from
biology and medicine. These connections will be made through in-class examples
and reinforced through biology-related problem-set questions. We hope to
facilitate the class's understanding of and enthusiasm for chemistry through
these connections as well as by communicating our own excitement for the
material through our teaching. You as TAs have a major impact on the success of
these goals through your interactions with students in your recitation sections
and office hours.
Below we provide some general expectations for Teaching Assistants. TAing this
course involves
    * Attending all class lectures, which are 3 times per week.
    * Preparing for and leading your recitation section, which will meet twice
      per week. You will be provided with suggested problems and topics for
      each recitation, but you are free to structure your classroom in whatever
      way works best for your class. During this training we will discuss
      active learning strategies, setting expectations, and other related
      topics.
    * Participating in weekly TA meetings.
    * Holding two office hours per week (as one 2-hour or two 1-hour sessions).
      In addition, many students send questions by email, so please check your
      email at least once each morning and afternoon.
    * Grading problem sets and exams. Problem sets are due each week. Homework
      should be graded and returned in recitation sections. Exams will be
      graded immediately following each exam.
    * Reinforcing the biology-connections made in the lecture and in the
      problem sets.
