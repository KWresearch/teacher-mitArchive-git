9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:25
PROFESSOR: And this is a
question based on where we left

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
off on Wednesday -- we were
talking about Coulomb's force

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
law to describe the interaction
between two particles, and

12
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
good job, most of you
got this correct.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
So, what we're looking at here
is the force when we have

14
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
two charged particles, one
positive, one negative -- here,

15
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
the nucleus and an electron.
 

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
So, I know this is a simple
example and I can see everyone

17
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
pretty much got it right, and
probably those that didn't

18
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
actually made some sort of
clicker error is my guess.

19
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
But I wanted to use this to
point out that in this class in

20
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
general, any time you see an
equation to explain a certain

21
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
phenomenon, such as here
looking at force, it's a good

22
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
idea to check yourself by first
plugging it into the actual

23
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
equation, so you can plug in
infinity and this equation

24
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
here, and what you would see
is, of course, the force, if

25
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
you just solve the math
problem goes to zero.

26
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
But you can also look at it
qualitatively, so, if you think

27
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
about the force between the
electron and the proton, you

28
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
could just qualitatively think
about what's happening.

29
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
If they're close together
there's a certain force --

30
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
they're attracted because they
have opposite charges, but as

31
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
that gets further and further
away, that force is going to

32
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
get smaller and smaller, and
eventually the force is

33
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
going to approach zero.
 

34
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
So, it's a good kind of mental
check as we go through this

35
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
course to remember every time
there's an equation, usually

36
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
there's a very good reason for
that equation, and you can go

37
00:01:47 --> 00:01:50
ahead and just use your
qualitative knowledge, you

38
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
don't have to just always
stick with the math to check

39
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
and justify your answers.
 

40
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
So, we can get started with
today's lecture notes.

41
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
And, as I mentioned, we left
off and as we started back here

42
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
to describe the atom and how
the atom holds together the

43
00:02:07 --> 00:02:11
nucleus and the electron
using classical mechanics.

44
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
And today we'll finish that
discussion, and, of course,

45
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
point out actually the failure
of classical mechanics to

46
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
appropriately describe
what's going on in an atom.

47
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
So, then we'll get to turn to a
new kind of mechanics or

48
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
quantum mechanics, which will
in fact be able to describe

49
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
what's happening on this very,
very small size scale -- so on

50
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
the atomic size scale on the
order of nanometers

51
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
or angstroms, very
small particles.

52
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
And the reason that quantum
mechanics is going to work

53
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
where classical mechanics fails
is that classical mechanics did

54
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
not take into account the fact
that matter has both wave-like

55
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
and particle-like properties,
and light has both wave-like

56
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
and particle-like properties.
 

57
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
So, we'll take a little bit of
a step back after we introduce

58
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
quantum mechanics, and talk
about light as a wave, and the

59
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
characteristic of waves, and
then light as a particle.

60
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
And one example of this is in
the photoelectric effect.

61
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
So, we just talked about the
force law to describe the

62
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
interaction between a
proton and an electron.

63
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
You told me that when the
distance went to infinity,

64
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
the force went to zero.
 

65
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
What happens instead when
the distance goes to zero?

66
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
What happens to the force?
 

67
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Yeah.
 

68
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
So, the force actually goes to
infinity, and specifically it

69
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
goes to negative infinity.
 

70
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
Infinity is the force when
we're thinking about it and our

71
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
brains, negative infinity is
when we actually plug it into

72
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
the equation here, and the
reason is the convention that

73
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
the negative sign is just
telling us the direction that

74
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
the force is coming together
instead of pushing apart.

75
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
So, we can use Coulomb's force
law to think about the force

76
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
between these two particles --
and it does that, it tells us

77
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
the force is a function
of that distance.

78
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
But what it does not tell us,
which if we're trying to

79
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
describe an atom we really want
to know, is what happens to the

80
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
distance as time passes?
 

81
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
So, r is a function of time.
 

82
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
But luckily for us, there's a
classical equation of motion

83
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
that will, in fact, describe
how the electron and nucleus

84
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
change position or change their
radius as a function of time.

85
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
So, that's -- does anyone
know which classical law

86
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
of motion that would be?
 

87
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
Yup, so it's going to be
Newton's second law, force

88
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
equals mass times acceleration
-- those of you that are quick

89
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
page-turners, have a little
one-up on answering that.

90
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
And that tells us force as a
function of acceleration, we

91
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
want to know it though as a
function of radius, so we can

92
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
just take the first derivative
and get ourselves to velocity.

93
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
So, force is equal
to mass times dv

94
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
/dt.
 

95
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
But, of course, we want to go
all the way to distance, so we

96
00:04:52 --> 00:04:54
take the second derivative and
we have this equation

97
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
for force here.
 

98
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
And what we can do in order
to bring the two equations

99
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
together, is to plug in the
Coulomb force law right here.

100
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
So, now we have our Coulomb
force law all plugged in here,

101
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
and we have this differential
equation that we could solve,

102
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
if we wanted to figure out what
the force was at different

103
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
times t, or at different
positions of r.

104
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
So, all you will have the
opportunity to solve

105
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
differential equations in
your math courses here.

106
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
We won't do it in this
chemistry course.

107
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
In later chemistry courses,
you'll also get to solve

108
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
differential equations.
 

109
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
But instead in this chemistry
course, I will just tell

110
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
you the solutions to
differential equations.

111
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
And what we can do is we can
start with some initial value

112
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
of r, and here I write
r being ten angstroms.

113
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
That's a good approximation
when we're talking about

114
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
atoms, because that's about
the size of and atom.

115
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
So, let's say we start
off at the distance

116
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
being ten angstroms.
 

117
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
We can plug that into this
differential equation that

118
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
we'll have and solve it, and
what we find out is that r

119
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
actually goes to zero at a
time that's equal to 10 to

120
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
the negative 10 seconds.
 

121
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
So, let's think qualitatively
for a second about what that

122
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
means or what the real
meaning of that is.

123
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
What that is telling us is
that according to Newtonian

124
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
mechanics and Coulomb's force
law, is that the electron

125
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
should actually plummet into
the nucleus in 0.1 nanoseconds.

126
00:06:16 --> 00:06:22
So, we have a little
bit of a problem here.

127
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
And the problem that we have is
that what we're figuring out

128
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
mathematically is not exactly
matching up with what we're

129
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
observing experimentally.
 

130
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
And, in fact, it's often kind
of difficult to experimentally

131
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
test your mathematical
predictions -- a lot of people

132
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
spend many, many years testing
one single mathematical

133
00:06:42 --> 00:06:43
prediction.
 

134
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
But, I think all of us right
now can probably test this

135
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
prediction right here, and
we're observing that, in fact,

136
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
all of us and all the atoms we
can see are not immediately

137
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
collapsing in less
than a nanosecond.

138
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
So, just, if you can take what
I'm saying for a moment right

139
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
now that in fact this should
collapse in this very small

140
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
time frame, we have to see that
there's a problem with one of

141
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
these two things, either the
Coulomb force law or

142
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Newtonian mechanics.
 

143
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
So, what do you guys think
is probably the issue here?

144
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
So, it's Newtonian mechanics,
and the reason for this is

145
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
because Newtonian mechanics
does not work on this very,

146
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
very small size scale.
 

147
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32
As we said, Newtonian mechanics
does work in most cases, it

148
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
does work when we're discussing
things that we can see, it

149
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
does work even on things that
are too small to measure.

150
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
But once we got to the atomic
size scale, what happens is we

151
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
need to be taking into account
the fact that matter has these

152
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
wave-like properties, and we'll
learn more about that later,

153
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
but essentially classical
mechanics does not take

154
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
that into account at all.
 

155
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
So, we need a new kind of
mechanics, which is quantum

156
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
mechanics, which will
accurately explain the

157
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
behavior of molecules
on this small scale.

158
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
So, as I mentioned, the real
key to quantum mechanics is

159
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
that it's treating matter not
just like it's a particle,

160
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
which is what we were just
doing, but also like it's

161
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
a wave, and it treats
light that way, too.

162
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
The second important point to
quantum mechanics is that it

163
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
actually considers the fact
that light consists of

164
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
these discrete packets or
particle-like pieces of energy,

165
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
which are called photons.
 

166
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
And if you think about what's
actually happening here, this

167
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
second point that light
consists of photons is actually

168
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
the same thing as saying that
light shows particle-like

169
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
properties, but that's such an
important point that I put it

170
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
separately, and we'll cover
that separately as we go along.

171
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
So, we now have this new way of
thinking about how a nucleus

172
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
and an electron can hang
together, and this is quantum

173
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
mechanics, and we can use this
to come up with a new way

174
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
to describe our atom and
the behavior of atoms.

175
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
But the problem is before we do
this, it makes sense to take a

176
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
little bit of a step back and
actually make sure we're all on

177
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
the same page and understanding
why quantum mechanics is so

178
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
important and how it works, and
specifically understanding what

179
00:09:09 --> 00:09:13
we mean when we say that light
is both a particle and a wave,

180
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
and that matter is both
a particle and a wave.

181
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
So, we'll move on to this
discussion of light as a wave,

182
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
and we really won't pick up
into going back to applying

183
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
quantum mechanics to the atom
until Friday, but in the

184
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
meantime, we'll really get to
understand the wave particle

185
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
duality of light and of matter.
 

186
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
So, we'll start with thinking
about some properties of waves

187
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
that are going to be applicable
to all waves that we're talking

188
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
about, including light waves.
 

189
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
The easiest kind of waves for
us to picture are ocean waves

190
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
or water waves, because we can,
in fact, see them, but they

191
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
have similar properties
to all waves.

192
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
And those properties include
that you have this periodic

193
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
variation of some property.
 

194
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
So, when we're talking about
water waves, the property

195
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
we're discussing is
just the water level.

196
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
So, for example, we have this
average level, and then it can

197
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
go high where we have the
peak, or it can go very low.

198
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
We can also discuss sound
waves, so again it's just the

199
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
periodic variation of some
property -- in this case we're

200
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
talking about density, so we
have high density areas

201
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
and low density areas.
 

202
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
So, regardless of the type of
wave that we're talking about,

203
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
there's some common definitions
that we want to make sure that

204
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
we're all able to use, and
the first is amplitude.

205
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
And when we're talking about
the amplitude of the wave,

206
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
we're talking about the
deviation from that

207
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
average level.
 

208
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
So, if we define the average
level as zero, you can have

209
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
either a positive amplitude
or a negative amplitude.

210
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
So, sometimes people get
confused when they're solving

211
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
problems and call the amplitude
this distance all the way from

212
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
the max to the min, but it's
only half of that because we're

213
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
only going back to
the average level.

214
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
So, what we really want to talk
about here is light waves, and

215
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
light waves have the same
properties as these other kind

216
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
of waves in that they're the
periodic variation

217
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
of some property.
 

218
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
So, when we're discussing light
waves, what we're talking about

219
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
is actually light or
electromagnetic radiation, is

220
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
what we'll be calling it
throughout the course.

221
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
And that's the periodic
variation of an electric field.

222
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
So, instead of having the
periodic variation of water, or

223
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
the periodic variation of air
density, here we're talking

224
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
about an electric field.
 

225
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
We know what an electric field
is, it's just a space through

226
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
which a Coulomb force operates.
 

227
00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
And the important thing to
think about when you're talking

228
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
about the fact that it's a
periodic variation, is if

229
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
you put a charged particle
somewhere into an electric

230
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
field, it will, of course, go
in a certain direction toward

231
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
the charge it's attracted to.
 

232
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
But you need to think about the
difference, if you have a

233
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
particle here on your wave,
it will go in one direction.

234
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
But remember, waves don't
just have magnitude, they

235
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
also do have direction.
 

236
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
So, if instead you put your
particle somewhere down here on

237
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
the electric field, or on the
wave, the electric field will

238
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
now be in the other direction,
so your particle will be

239
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
pushed the other way.
 

240
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
And from physics you know that,
of course, if we have a

241
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
propagating electric field, we
also have a perpendicular

242
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
magnetic field that's
going back and forth.

243
00:12:14 --> 00:12:18
But in terms of worrying about
using the concepts of a wave to

244
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
solve chemistry problems in
this course, we can actually

245
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
put aside the fact, and only
focus on the electric field

246
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
part of things, because that's
what's going to be interacting

247
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
with our charged particles,
such as our electrons.

248
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
So, other properties of waves
that you probably are all

249
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
familiar with but I just want
to review is the idea

250
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
of a wavelength.
 

251
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
If we're talking about the
wavelength of a wave, we're

252
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
just talking about the distance
that there is between

253
00:12:45 --> 00:12:50
successive maxima, or of
course, we can also be talking

254
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
about the distance between
successive minima.

255
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
Basically, we can take any
point on the wave, and it's the

256
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
distance to that same point
later on in the wave.

257
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
So, that's what we
call one wavelength.

258
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
We also commonly discuss the
frequency of a wave, and the

259
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
frequency is just the number
of cycles that that wave

260
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
goes through per unit time.
 

261
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
So, by a cycle we'd basically
mean how many times we cycle

262
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
through a complete wavelength.
 

263
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
So, if something cycles through
five wavelengths in a single

264
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
second, we would just say
that the frequency of that

265
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
wave is five per second.
 

266
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
We can also mathematically
describe what's going on here

267
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
other than just graphing it.
 

268
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
So, if we want to look at the
mathematical equation of a

269
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
wave, we want to describe --
again as I mention, what we're

270
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
describing is the electric
field, we're not worrying about

271
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
the magnetic field here, as a
function of x and t that's

272
00:13:46 --> 00:13:57
equal to a cosine [ 2 pi x over
wavelength, minus 2 pi nu t ].

273
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
And note this is the
Greek letter nu.

274
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
This is not a v.
 

275
00:14:01 --> 00:14:07
Where we have E, which is
equal to the electric

276
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
field, what is x?
 

277
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
STUDENT: Position.
 

278
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
PROFESSOR: Yup, the
position of the wave.

279
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
And what about t?
 

280
00:14:21 --> 00:14:26
Yeah, so we're talking about
both position and time.

281
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
So what we can do if we're
talking about a wave is think

282
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
of it both in terms of position
time, but if we're trying to

283
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
visualize this -- for example
if we're actually to graph this

284
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
out, the easiest thing to do is
keep one of these two variables

285
00:14:40 --> 00:14:47
constant, either the x or the
t, and then just consider

286
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
the other variable.
 

287
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
So, for example, if we're to
hold the time constant, this

288
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
makes it a lot simpler of an
equation, because what we can

289
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
end up doing is actually
crossing out this

290
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
whole term here.
 

291
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
So what we're left with is just
that the electric field as a

292
00:15:03 --> 00:15:09
function of distance is a times
cosine of the argument there,

293
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
which is now just 2 pi
x over wavelength.

294
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
So, what we want to be able to
do, either when we're looking

295
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
at the graph or looking at the
equation up there, is to

296
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
think about different
properties of the wave.

297
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
For example, to think about
at what point do we have

298
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
the wave where it's at
its maximum amplitude?

299
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
So, if we think about that, we
need to have a point where

300
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
we're making this argument of
the cosine such that the cosine

301
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
is going to all be equal to
one, so all we're left

302
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
with is that a term.
 

303
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
So, we can do that basically
any time that we have an

304
00:15:45 --> 00:15:50
integer variable that is either
zero or an integer variable

305
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
of the wavelength.
 

306
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
So, for example, negative
wavelength or positive

307
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
wavelength are two times the
wavelength, because that lets

308
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
us cross out the term with the
wavelength here, and we're

309
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
left with some integer
multiple of just pi.

310
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
So, that's sort of the
mathematically how we get to a,

311
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
but we can also just look at
the graph here, because every

312
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
time we go one wavelength, we
can see that we're

313
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
back in a maximum.
 

314
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
So, I mentioned we should be
able to figure out where

315
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
the maximum amplitude is.
 

316
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
You should also just looking at
an equation, immediately be

317
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
able to figure out what that
maximum amplitude is in terms

318
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
of the height of it just by
looking at that a-term, here we

319
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
should also be able to know the
intensity of any light wave,

320
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
because intensity is just
the amplitude squared.

321
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
So, we should immediately be
able to know how bright or how

322
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
intense a light is just looking
at the wave equation, or

323
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
just by looking at a graph.
 

324
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
We can also do a similar thing,
and I'll keep my distance from

325
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
the board, but we can instead
be holding x constant, for

326
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
example, putting x to be equal
to zero, and then all we're

327
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
doing is considering the
electric field as

328
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
a function of t.
 

329
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
So, in this case we're crossing
out the first term there, and

330
00:17:06 --> 00:17:13
we're left with amplitude times
the cosine of 2 pi nu times t.

331
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
And, of course, we can do the
same thing again, we can think

332
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
about when the amplitude is
going to be at its maximum, and

333
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
it's going to be any
time cosine of this term

334
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
now is equal to one.
 

335
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
So that will be at, for
example, negative 1 over

336
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
nu, or 0, or 1 over nu.
 

337
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
And again, we can just look at
our graph to figure that out,

338
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
that's exactly where
we're at a maximum.

339
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
So, 1 over nu is another term
we use and we call it the

340
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
period of a wave, and the
period is just the inverse

341
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
of the frequency.
 

342
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
And if we think about
frequency, that's number

343
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
of cycles per unit time.
 

344
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
So, for example, number of
cycles per second, whereas the

345
00:17:51 --> 00:17:58
period is how much time it
takes for one cycle to occur.

346
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
And when we talk about units of
frequency, in almost every

347
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
case, you'll be talking about
number of cycles per second.

348
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
So, you can just write
inverse second, the

349
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
cycle part is assumed.
 

350
00:18:07 --> 00:18:13
But you'll also frequently see
it called Hertz, so, Hz here.

351
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
So, if you're talking about
five cycles per second, you

352
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
can write five per second,
or you can write five Hertz.

353
00:18:18 --> 00:18:21
The one thing you want to keep
in mind though is that Hertz

354
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
does not actually mean
inverse seconds, it

355
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
means cycles per second.
 

356
00:18:24 --> 00:18:27
So, if you're talking about a
car going so many meters per

357
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
second, you can't say it's
going meter Hertz, you have

358
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
to say meters per second.
 

359
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
So, this really just means
for frequency, it's

360
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
a frequency label.
 

361
00:18:37 --> 00:18:37
Alright.
 

362
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
So, since we have these terms
defined, we know the frequency

363
00:18:40 --> 00:18:43
and the wavelength, it turns
out we can also think about the

364
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
speed of the wave, and
specifically of a light wave,

365
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
and speed and is just equal to
the distance that's

366
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
traveled divided by
the time the elapsed.

367
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
And because we've defined
these terms, we have ways

368
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
to describe these things.
 

369
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
So, we can describe the
distance that's traveled,

370
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
it's just a wavelength here.
 

371
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
And we can think about how long
it takes for a wave, because

372
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
waves are, we know not just
changing in position, but the

373
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
whole wave is moving forward
with time, we can think about

374
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
how long it takes for wave
to go one wavelength.

375
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
So, one distance that's
equal to lambda.

376
00:19:18 --> 00:19:25
So, how much time would that
take, does anyone know?

377
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
So, would it take, for
example, the same amount

378
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
of time as the frequency?
 

379
00:19:33 --> 00:19:34
The period, that's right.
 

380
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
So, it's going to take one
period to move that long.

381
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
And another way we can say
period is just 1 over nu or 1

382
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
over the frequency So, now we
know both the distance traveled

383
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
and the time the elapsed.
 

384
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
So, we can just plug it in.
 

385
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
Speed is equal to the distance
traveled, which is lambda over

386
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
the time elapsed, which is 1
over nu. so, we can re-write

387
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
that as speed is equal to
lambda times nu, and it turns

388
00:20:02 --> 00:20:04
out typically this is reported
in meters per second or

389
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
nanometers per second.
 

390
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
So, now we have an equation
where we know the relationship

391
00:20:09 --> 00:20:14
between speed and wavelength
and frequency, and it turns out

392
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
that we could take any wave,
and as long as we know the

393
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
frequency and the wavelength,
we'll be able to

394
00:20:19 --> 00:20:20
figure out the speed.
 

395
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
But, of course, there's
something very special about

396
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
electromagnetic waves,
electromagnetic radiation

397
00:20:25 --> 00:20:28
and the speed.
 

398
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
And it's not really surprising
for me to tell you that

399
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
electromagnetic radiation has a
constant speed, and that speed

400
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
is what we call the speed of
light, and typically we

401
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
abbreviate that as c, and
that's from the Latin term

402
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
celeritas, which means
speed in Latin.

403
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
That's one of four or five
Latin words I remember from

404
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
four years of high school
Latin, but it comes in handy

405
00:20:50 --> 00:20:53
to remember speed of light.
 

406
00:20:53 --> 00:20:56
And some of you may have
memorized what the speed of

407
00:20:56 --> 00:20:59
light is in high school --
it's about 3 times 10 to

408
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
the 8 meters per second.
 

409
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
This is another example of a
constant that you will

410
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
accidentally memorize in this
course as you use it

411
00:21:06 --> 00:21:07
over and over again.
 

412
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
But again, that we will supply
for you on the exam just in

413
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
case you forget it
at that moment.

414
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
And this is a very fast speed,
of course, it's about 700

415
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
million miles per hour.
 

416
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
So, one way to put that in
perspective is to think about

417
00:21:22 --> 00:21:27
how long it takes for a
light beam to get from

418
00:21:27 --> 00:21:28
earth to the moon.
 

419
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
Does anyone have any guesses?
 

420
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
Eight seconds,
that sounds good.

421
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
Anyone else?
 

422
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
These are all really good
guesses, so it actually takes

423
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
1.2 seconds for light to travel
from the earth to the moon.

424
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
So, we're talking pretty
fast, so that's nice to

425
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
appreciate in itself.
 

426
00:21:48 --> 00:21:53
But other than that point, we
can also think about the fact

427
00:21:53 --> 00:22:00
that frequency and wavelength
are related in a way that now

428
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
since we know the speed
of light, if we know one

429
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
we can tell the other.
 

430
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
So, you can go ahead
and switch us to our

431
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
clicker question here.
 

432
00:22:08 --> 00:22:13
So, we should be able to look
at different types of waves and

433
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
be able to figure out something
about both their frequency and

434
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
their wavelength, and know the
relationship between the two.

435
00:22:20 --> 00:22:23
So, it's up on this screen
here now, so we'll

436
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
work on the other one.
 

437
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
If you can identify which of
these statements is correct

438
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
based on what you know about
the relationship between

439
00:22:30 --> 00:22:42
frequency and wavelength and
also just looking at the waves.

440
00:22:42 --> 00:22:42
Alright.
 

441
00:22:42 --> 00:22:49
So, let's give ten
more seconds on that.

442
00:22:49 --> 00:23:06
So, ten seconds on that.
 

443
00:23:06 --> 00:23:06
Alright.
 

444
00:23:07 --> 00:23:08
So, good job.
 

445
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
So, most people could recognize
that light wave a has

446
00:23:12 --> 00:23:13
the shorter wavelength.
 

447
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
We can see that just by looking
at the graph itself -- we can

448
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
see, certainly, this is shorter
from maxima to maxima.

449
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
This we can't even see the next
maxima, so it's much longer.

450
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
And then, we also know that
means that it has the higher

451
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
frequency, because our
relationship between

452
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
wavelength and frequency
are inversely related.

453
00:23:32 --> 00:23:35
And also, we know
the speed of light.

454
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
So, if we think about if it's a
shorter wavelength, we'll be

455
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
able to get a lot more
wavelengths in, in a given

456
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
time, than we would for
a longer wavelength.

457
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
So, we can switch back to the
notes and think about what this

458
00:23:47 --> 00:23:50
means, and what this means when
we're talking about all the

459
00:23:50 --> 00:23:53
different kinds of light waves
we have, and I've shown a bunch

460
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
here, is that if we have the
wavelength, we also know the

461
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
frequency of these wavelengths.
 

462
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
So, for example, radio waves,
which have very long

463
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
wavelengths have very
low frequencies.

464
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
Whereas where we go to waves
that have very short

465
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
wavelengths, such a x-rays or
cosmic rays, they, in turn,

466
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
have very high frequencies.
 

467
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
So, it's important to get a
little bit of a sense of

468
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
what all these different
kinds of lights do.

469
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
You're absolutely not
responsible to memorize what

470
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
the wavelengths of the
different types of lights are,

471
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
but you do want to be able to
know the general order of them.

472
00:24:34 --> 00:24:37
So, if someone tells you
they're using UV light versus

473
00:24:37 --> 00:24:40
x-ray light, you know that the
x-ray light is, in fact,

474
00:24:40 --> 00:24:41
at a higher frequency.
 

475
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
So that's the important
take-away message

476
00:24:43 --> 00:24:44
from this slide.
 

477
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
If we think about these
different types of lights,

478
00:24:47 --> 00:24:50
microwave light, if it's
absorbed by a molecule, is a

479
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
sufficient amount of frequency
and energy to get those

480
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
molecules to rotate.
 

481
00:24:55 --> 00:24:57
That, of course, generates
heat, so that's how

482
00:24:57 --> 00:24:58
your microwaves work.
 

483
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
If we talk about infrared
light, which is at a higher

484
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
frequency here and a shorter
wavelength, infrared light when

485
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
it's absorbed by molecules
actually is enough to cause

486
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
molecules now to vibrate.
 

487
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
If we move up to the more
high-frequency and divisible

488
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
light and all the way into UV
light, if you shine UV light at

489
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
certain molecules, it's going
to have enough energy to

490
00:25:21 --> 00:25:26
actually pop those electrons in
that molecule up to a higher

491
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
energy level, which will make
more sense once we talk about

492
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
energy levels in atoms, but
that's what UV light can do.

493
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
And actually, that's
responsible for fluorescence

494
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
and phosphorescence that you
see where typically

495
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
UV light comes in.
 

496
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
So, if you use a black lamp or
something and you excite

497
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
something up to a higher energy
level and then it relaxes back

498
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
down to its lower energy state,
it's going to emit a new

499
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
wavelength of light, which is
going to be visible to you.

500
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
X-rays are at even a higher
frequency, and those are

501
00:25:55 --> 00:25:59
sufficient to actually be
absorbed by a molecule and

502
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
pop an electron all the
way out of that molecule.

503
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
You can see how that would be
damaging to the integrity of

504
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
that molecule, that's why
x-rays are so damaging -- you

505
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
don't want to have electrons
disappearing for no good reason

506
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
from your molecules that can
cause the kind of mutations

507
00:26:13 --> 00:26:16
we don't want to be
seeing in ourselves.

508
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
And then also as we go
higher, we have gamma

509
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
rays and cosmic rays.
 

510
00:26:21 --> 00:26:25
Within the visible range of
what we can see, you also want

511
00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
to know this relative order
that's pretty easy -- most of

512
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
us have memorized that in
kindergarten, so that

513
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32
should be fine.
 

514
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
Just remembering that violet is
the end that actually has the

515
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
shortest wavelength, which
means that it also has, of

516
00:26:39 --> 00:26:42
course, the highest frequency.
 

517
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
So, just an interesting fact
about this set of light, which

518
00:26:45 --> 00:26:48
we're most familiar with, if we
think about our vision, it

519
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
turns out that our vision's
actually logarithmic and it's

520
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
centered around this
green frequency.

521
00:26:54 --> 00:26:57
So, if instead of a red laser
pointer here, I had a green

522
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
one, you'd actually, to our
eyes, it would seem like the

523
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
green one was brighter, even if
the intensity was the same, and

524
00:27:04 --> 00:27:07
that's just because our eyes
are centered and logarithmic

525
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
around this green
frequency set.

526
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
So, using the relationship
between frequency and

527
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
wavelength, we can actually
understand a lot about what's

528
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
going on, and pretty soon we'll
also draw the relationship very

529
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
soon to energy, so it will be
even more informative then.

530
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
But I just want to point out
one of the many, many groups at

531
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
MIT that works with different
fluorescing types of molecules,

532
00:27:32 --> 00:27:36
and this is Professor Bawendi's
laboratory at MIT, and he

533
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
works with quantum dots.
 

534
00:27:38 --> 00:27:42
And quantum dots are these
just very tiny, tiny crystals

535
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
of semiconductor material.
 

536
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
They're on the order of one to
ten nanometers, and these can

537
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
be shined on with UV light --
they have a lot of different

538
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
interesting properties, but one
I'll mention is that if you

539
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
excite them with UV light, they
will have some of the electrons

540
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
move to a higher energy state,
and when they drop back down,

541
00:28:01 --> 00:28:06
they actually emit light with a
wavelength that corresponds

542
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
with the size of the
actual quantum dot.

543
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
So, from what we know so far,
we should be able to look at

544
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
any of these quantum dots,
which are depicted as a cartoon

545
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
here, but here we have an
actual picture of the quantum

546
00:28:19 --> 00:28:24
dots suspended in some sort of
solution and shone on with UV

547
00:28:24 --> 00:28:27
light, and you can see that you
can achieve this whole

548
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
beautiful range of colors just
by modulating the size

549
00:28:32 --> 00:28:33
of the different dots.
 

550
00:28:33 --> 00:28:36
And we should be able to know
if we're looking at a red dot

551
00:28:36 --> 00:28:41
-- is a red dot, it's going to
have a longer wavelength, so is

552
00:28:41 --> 00:28:44
this a higher or
lower frequency?

553
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
Yeah, and similarly, if someone
tells us that their dot is

554
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
blue-shifted, that should
automatically in our heads tell

555
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
us, oh it shifted to
a higher frequency.

556
00:28:52 --> 00:28:55
And these dots are really
interesting in that you can,

557
00:28:55 --> 00:28:58
I'm sure by looking at this
picture, already imagine just

558
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
a whole slew of different
biological or sensing

559
00:29:01 --> 00:29:02
applications that
you could think of.

560
00:29:02 --> 00:29:05
For example, if you were trying
to study different protein

561
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
interactions, you could think
about labeling them with

562
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
different colored dots, or
there's also a bunch of

563
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
different fluorescent
techniques that you could apply

564
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
using these dots, or you could
think of in-vivo sensing, how

565
00:29:16 --> 00:29:19
useful these could be if you
could think of a way to get

566
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
them into your body without
being too toxic, for example.

567
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
These are all things that the
Bawendi group is working on.

568
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
What they are real experts in
is synthesizing many different

569
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
kinds of these dots, and they
have a synthetic scheme that's

570
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
used by research groups
around the world.

571
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
The Bawendi group also
collaborates with people,

572
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
both at different
schools and at MIT.

573
00:29:39 --> 00:29:43
One example, on some of their
biochemistry applications is

574
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
with another Professor at
MIT, Alice Ting and her lab.

575
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
So really what I want to point
out here is as we get more into

576
00:29:52 --> 00:29:55
describing quantum mechanics,
these quantum dots are one

577
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
really good example where a lot
of the properties of quantum

578
00:29:58 --> 00:29:59
mechanics apply directly.
 

579
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
So, if you're interested, I
put the Bawendi lab research

580
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
website onto your notes.
 

581
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
And also, Professor Bawendi
recently did an interview with

582
00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
"The Tech." Did anyone see
that interview in the paper?

583
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
So, three or four -- a few of
you read the paper last week.

584
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
So, you can either pick up
an old issue or I put the

585
00:30:18 --> 00:30:19
link on the website, too.
 

586
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
And that's not just about his
research, it's also about some

587
00:30:23 --> 00:30:26
of his memories as a student
and advice to all of you.

588
00:30:26 --> 00:30:29
So, it's interesting to read
and get to know some of these

589
00:30:29 --> 00:30:32
Professors at MIT a
little bit better.

590
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
So, one property that was
important we talked about with

591
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
waves is the relationship
between frequency

592
00:30:38 --> 00:30:39
and wavelength.
 

593
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
Another very important property
of waves that's true of all

594
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
waves, is that you can have
superposition or interference

595
00:30:47 --> 00:30:48
between two waves.
 

596
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
So, if we're looking at waves
and they're in-phase, and when

597
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
I talk about in-phase, what I
mean is that they're lined up,

598
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
so that the maxima are in the
same position and the minima

599
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
are in the same position, what
we can have a something called

600
00:31:01 --> 00:31:03
constructive interference.
 

601
00:31:03 --> 00:31:06
And all we mean by constructive
interference is that literally

602
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
those two waves add together,
such as the maxima are now

603
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
twice as high, and the minima
are now twice as low.

604
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
So, you can also imagine a
situation where instead of

605
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
being perfectly lined up, now
we have the minima being lined

606
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
up with the maxima here.
 

607
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
So, if we switch over to a
clicker question maybe on this

608
00:31:27 --> 00:31:41
screen -- okay, can it be
done up there to switch?

609
00:31:41 --> 00:31:44
So, we're still settling
in with the renovations

610
00:31:44 --> 00:31:46
here in this room.
 

611
00:31:46 --> 00:31:48
So, why don't you all go ahead
and tell me what happens if

612
00:31:48 --> 00:31:56
you combine these two waves,
which are now out of phase?

613
00:31:56 --> 00:32:07
So, let's -- okay, so, why
don't you all think about would

614
00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
happen -- we'll start with
the thought exercise.

615
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
You can switch back to
my lecture notes then

616
00:32:12 --> 00:32:18
if this isn't going.
 

617
00:32:18 --> 00:32:18
Alright.
 

618
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
So, hopefully what everyone
came up with is the straight

619
00:32:21 --> 00:32:23
line, is that what
you answered?

620
00:32:23 --> 00:32:24
STUDENT: Yeah.
 

621
00:32:24 --> 00:32:25
PROFESSOR: OK, very good.
 

622
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
And I didn't make you try
to draw the added, the

623
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
superimposed positive
construction in your notes, but

624
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
I think everyone can handle
drawing a straight line.

625
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
So, you can go ahead and draw
what happens when we have

626
00:32:39 --> 00:32:42
destructive interference.
 

627
00:32:42 --> 00:32:44
And destructive interference,
of course, is the extreme, but

628
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
you can picture also a case
where you have waves that are

629
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
not quite lined up, but they're
also not completely

630
00:32:50 --> 00:32:50
out of phase.
 

631
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
So in that case, you're either
going to have the wave get a

632
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
little bigger, but not twice as
big or a little bit smaller.

633
00:32:56 --> 00:32:59
So, I think the easiest way to
think about interference is not

634
00:32:59 --> 00:33:02
actually with light, but
sometimes it's easiest to think

635
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
about with sound, especially
when you're dealing with times

636
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
where you have destructive
interference.

637
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
Has anyone here ever been in a
concert hall where they feel

638
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
like they're kind of in a dead
spot, or you don't quite hear

639
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
as well, and if you move down
just two seats all of a sudden

640
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
it's just blasting at you --
hopefully not in this room.

641
00:33:19 --> 00:33:22
But have people
experienced that before?

642
00:33:22 --> 00:33:24
Yeah, I definitely
experienced it, too.

643
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
And really, all you're
experiencing there is

644
00:33:26 --> 00:33:30
destructive interference
in a very bad way.

645
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
Halls, they try to design halls
such that that doesn't happen,

646
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
and I show an example of a
concert hall here -- this is

647
00:33:38 --> 00:33:41
Symphony Hall in Boston, and I
can pretty much guarantee you

648
00:33:41 --> 00:33:45
if you do go to this Symphony
Hall, you will not experience

649
00:33:45 --> 00:33:46
a bad seat or a dead seat.
 

650
00:33:46 --> 00:33:50
This is described as actually
one of the top two or three

651
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
acoustic concert halls
in the whole world.

652
00:33:53 --> 00:33:57
So, it's very well designed
such that they've minimized

653
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
any of these destructive
interference dead sounds.

654
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
So, it's nice, on a student
budget you can go and get the

655
00:34:03 --> 00:34:05
worst seat in the house and you
can hear just as well as they

656
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
can hear up front, even if you
can't actually see

657
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
what's going on.
 

658
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
So, another example of
destructive interference is

659
00:34:14 --> 00:34:16
just with the Bose headphones.
 

660
00:34:16 --> 00:34:18
I've never actually tried these
on, but you see people with

661
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
them, and what happens here is
it's supposed to be those noise

662
00:34:22 --> 00:34:24
cancellation headphones.
 

663
00:34:24 --> 00:34:27
All they do is they take in the
ambient noise that's around it,

664
00:34:27 --> 00:34:29
and there's actually battery in
the headphones, that then

665
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
produces waves that are going
to destructively interfere

666
00:34:33 --> 00:34:34
with that ambient noise.
 

667
00:34:34 --> 00:34:38
And that's how it actually gets
to be so quiet when you have

668
00:34:38 --> 00:34:43
on, supposedly, these quite
expensive headphones.

669
00:34:43 --> 00:34:47
So, that's light as a wave, and
the reason -- well, that was

670
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
sound as a wave, but light
as a wave is the same idea.

671
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
And it was really established
by the early 1900s that, in

672
00:34:53 --> 00:34:55
fact, light behaved as a wave.
 

673
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
And the reason that it was so
certain that light was a wave

674
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
was because we could observe
these things -- we could see,

675
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
for example, that light
defracted, and we could see

676
00:35:03 --> 00:35:07
that light constructively or
destructively could interfere

677
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
with other light waves, and
this was all confirmed

678
00:35:11 --> 00:35:12
and visualized.
 

679
00:35:12 --> 00:35:17
But also, around the time that
Thomson was discovering the

680
00:35:17 --> 00:35:20
electron, there were some other
observations that were going

681
00:35:20 --> 00:35:24
on, and the most disturbing to
kind of the understanding of

682
00:35:24 --> 00:35:27
the universe was the fact that
there were some observations

683
00:35:27 --> 00:35:30
about light that didn't make
sense with this idea that

684
00:35:30 --> 00:35:32
light is a particle.
 

685
00:35:32 --> 00:35:35
And the photoelectric
effect is maybe the most

686
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
clear example of this.
 

687
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
So, the photoelectric effect is
the effect that if you have

688
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
some metal, and you can pick
essentially any metal you want,

689
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
and you shine light of a
certain frequency onto that

690
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
metal, you can actually pop off
an electron, and you can go

691
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
ahead and measure what the
kinetic energy of that electron

692
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
that comes off is, because we
can measure the velocity and we

693
00:35:58 --> 00:36:01
know that kinetic energy equals
1/2 m b squared, and thanks to

694
00:36:01 --> 00:36:05
Thomson we also know the
mass of an electron.

695
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09
So, this is an interesting
observation, and in itself not

696
00:36:09 --> 00:36:14
too disturbing, yet but the
important thing to point out is

697
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
that there's this threshold
frequency that is of the metal,

698
00:36:18 --> 00:36:21
and each metal has a different
threshold frequency, such as if

699
00:36:21 --> 00:36:23
you shine light on the metal
where the frequency of the

700
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
light is less than the
threshold frequency, nothing

701
00:36:27 --> 00:36:31
will happen -- no electron will
pop off of that metal.

702
00:36:31 --> 00:36:34
However, if you shine a light
with a frequency that's greater

703
00:36:34 --> 00:36:37
than the threshold frequency,
you will be able to

704
00:36:37 --> 00:36:39
pop off an electron.
 

705
00:36:39 --> 00:36:42
So, people were making this
observation, but this wasn't

706
00:36:42 --> 00:36:45
making any sense at all because
there was nothing in classical

707
00:36:45 --> 00:36:48
physics that described any sort
of relationship between the

708
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
frequency of light and the
energy, much less the energy of

709
00:36:53 --> 00:36:56
an electron that would get
popped off of a metal that

710
00:36:56 --> 00:37:01
would basically come off only
when we're hitting this

711
00:37:01 --> 00:37:03
threshold frequency.
 

712
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
So, what they could do was
actually graph what was

713
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
happening here, so we can also
graph what was happening, and

714
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
what they found was that if we
were at any point below the

715
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
threshold frequency and we were
counting the numbers of

716
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
electrons that were popping off
of our metal, we weren't

717
00:37:20 --> 00:37:21
seeing anything at all.
 

718
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
But if you go up the threshold
frequency, suddenly you see

719
00:37:25 --> 00:37:28
that there's some number of
electrons that comes off, and

720
00:37:28 --> 00:37:31
amazingly, the number of
electrons actually had no

721
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
relationship at all to the
frequency of the light.

722
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
And this didn't make a lot of
sense to people at the time

723
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
because they thought that the
frequency should be related to

724
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
the number of electrons that
are coming off, because you

725
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
have more frequency coming in,
you'd expect more electrons

726
00:37:48 --> 00:37:50
that are coming off -- this
wasn't what people were seeing.

727
00:37:50 --> 00:37:53
So, what they decided to do is
just study absolutely

728
00:37:53 --> 00:37:56
everything they could about the
photoelectric effect and hope,

729
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
at some point, someone would
piece something together that

730
00:37:58 --> 00:38:00
could explain what's going on
or shed some light

731
00:38:00 --> 00:38:02
on this effect.
 

732
00:38:02 --> 00:38:04
So, one thing they did, because
it was so easy to measure

733
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
kinetic energy of electrons, is
plot the frequency of the light

734
00:38:09 --> 00:38:12
against the kinetic energy of
the electron that's

735
00:38:12 --> 00:38:13
coming off here.
 

736
00:38:13 --> 00:38:16
And in your notes and on these
slides here, just for your

737
00:38:16 --> 00:38:18
reference, I'm just pointing
out what's going to

738
00:38:18 --> 00:38:19
be predicted from
classical physics.

739
00:38:19 --> 00:38:22
You're not responsible for that
and we won't really discuss it,

740
00:38:22 --> 00:38:25
but it just gives you the
contrast of the surprise that

741
00:38:25 --> 00:38:27
comes up when people make
these observations.

742
00:38:27 --> 00:38:31
And the first observation was
that the frequency of the light

743
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
had a linear relationship to
the kinetic energy of the

744
00:38:35 --> 00:38:38
electrons that are
ejected here.

745
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
This made no sense at all to
people, and again they saw this

746
00:38:42 --> 00:38:45
effect where if you were below
that threshold frequency,

747
00:38:45 --> 00:38:48
you saw nothing at all.
 

748
00:38:48 --> 00:38:51
So, that was frequency
with kinetic energy.

749
00:38:51 --> 00:38:54
The next thing that they wanted
to look at was the actual

750
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58
intensity of the light and see
what the relationship of

751
00:38:58 --> 00:39:00
intensity to kinetic energy is.
 

752
00:39:00 --> 00:39:03
So, what we would expect is
that there is a relationship

753
00:39:03 --> 00:39:06
between intensity in kinetic
energy, because it was

754
00:39:06 --> 00:39:09
understood that however intense
the light was, if you had a

755
00:39:09 --> 00:39:12
more intense light, it was a
higher energy light beam.

756
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
So that should mean that the
energy that's transferred to

757
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
the electron should be greater,
but that's not what you saw at

758
00:39:18 --> 00:39:21
all, and what you saw is that
if you kept the frequency

759
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
constant, there was absolutely
no change in the kinetic energy

760
00:39:25 --> 00:39:29
of the electrons, no matter
how high up you had the

761
00:39:29 --> 00:39:30
intensity of the light go.
 

762
00:39:30 --> 00:39:33
You could keep increasing
the intensity and nothing

763
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
was going to happen.
 

764
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
So, we could also plot the
number of electrons that are

765
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43
ejected as a relationship to
the intensity, so that was

766
00:39:43 --> 00:39:46
yet another experiment
they could do.

767
00:39:46 --> 00:39:48
And this is what they had
expected that there would be no

768
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
relationship, but instead here
they saw that there was a

769
00:39:53 --> 00:39:56
linear relationship not to the
intensity and the kinetic

770
00:39:56 --> 00:39:59
energy of the electrons, but to
the intensity and the

771
00:39:59 --> 00:40:00
number of electrons.
 

772
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
So, none of these observations
made sense to any scientists at

773
00:40:04 --> 00:40:06
the time, and really all of
these observations were made

774
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
and somewhat put aside for
several years before someone

775
00:40:10 --> 00:40:13
that could kind of process
everything that was going on at

776
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
once came along, and that
person was Einstein,

777
00:40:17 --> 00:40:19
conveniently enough -- if
anyone could put it together,

778
00:40:19 --> 00:40:22
we would hope that he
could, and he did.

779
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
And what he did in a way that
made sense when all of us look

780
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
at it, is he plotted all of
these different metals on the

781
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
same graph and made
some observations.

782
00:40:32 --> 00:40:35
So, for example, here we're
showing rubidium and potassium

783
00:40:35 --> 00:40:40
and sodium plotted where we're
plotting the frequency --

784
00:40:40 --> 00:40:43
that's the frequency of that
light that's coming into the

785
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48
metal versus the kinetic energy
of the electron that's ejected

786
00:40:48 --> 00:40:50
from the surface of the metal.
 

787
00:40:50 --> 00:40:53
And what he found here, which
is what you can see and we can

788
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
all see pretty clearly, is the
slope of all of these lines is

789
00:40:57 --> 00:41:01
the same regardless of what
the type of metal is.

790
00:41:01 --> 00:41:05
So, he fit all these to the
equation of the line, and what

791
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
he noticed was the slope was
specifically this number, 6.626

792
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
times 10 to the negative
34, joules times seconds.

793
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
And he also found that the y
intercept for each one of these

794
00:41:18 --> 00:41:24
metals was equal to basically
this number here, which was the

795
00:41:24 --> 00:41:32
slope times the minimum
frequency required of each

796
00:41:32 --> 00:41:37
specific metal, so that's of
the threshold frequency.

797
00:41:37 --> 00:41:40
And he actually knew that this
number had popped up before,

798
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
and a lot of you are familiar
with this number also, and

799
00:41:44 --> 00:41:45
this is Planck's constant.
 

800
00:41:45 --> 00:41:48
Planck had observed this number
as a fitting constant years

801
00:41:48 --> 00:41:51
earlier when he looked at some
phenomena, and you can read

802
00:41:51 --> 00:41:53
about in your book, such
as black body radiation.

803
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
And what he found was he needed
this constant to fit his

804
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
data to what was observed.
 

805
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
And this is the same thing that
Einstein was observing, that he

806
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
needed this fitting constant,
that this constant was just

807
00:42:07 --> 00:42:09
falling right out of, for
example, this slope and

808
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
also the y intercept.
 

809
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
So he decided to go ahead and
define exactly what it is, this

810
00:42:16 --> 00:42:19
line, in terms of these new
constants, this constant he's

811
00:42:19 --> 00:42:22
calling h, which is
Planck's constant.

812
00:42:22 --> 00:42:25
So, on the y axis we
have kinetic energy, so

813
00:42:25 --> 00:42:27
we can plug that in.
 

814
00:42:27 --> 00:42:29
If we talk about what the x
axis is, that's just the

815
00:42:29 --> 00:42:32
frequency of the light
that's coming in.

816
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
We know what m is,
m is equal to h.

817
00:42:36 --> 00:42:41
And then we can plug in what b
is, the y intercept, because

818
00:42:41 --> 00:42:47
that's just the negative of h
times that threshold frequency.

819
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
So we have this new equation
here when we're considering

820
00:42:50 --> 00:42:53
this photoelectric effect,
which is that the kinetic

821
00:42:53 --> 00:42:59
energy is equal to h nu minus
h nu threshold of the metal.

822
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
And what Einstein concluded and
observed is that well, kinetic

823
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
energy, of course, that's an
energy term, and h times nu,

824
00:43:07 --> 00:43:10
well that has to be energy
also, because energy has to be

825
00:43:10 --> 00:43:13
equal to energy -- there's
no other way about it.

826
00:43:13 --> 00:43:15
And this worked out with units
as well because we're talking

827
00:43:15 --> 00:43:18
about joules for kinetic
energy, and when we're talking

828
00:43:18 --> 00:43:21
about h times nu, we're talking
about joules times second

829
00:43:21 --> 00:43:23
times inverse seconds.
 

830
00:43:23 --> 00:43:26
So, the very important
conclusion that Einstein made

831
00:43:26 --> 00:43:32
here is that energy is equal to
h times nu, or that h times nu

832
00:43:32 --> 00:43:35
is an actual energy term.
 

833
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
And this kind of went along
with two observations.

834
00:43:39 --> 00:43:42
The first is that energy of
a photon is proportional

835
00:43:42 --> 00:43:43
to its frequency.
 

836
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
So this was never recognized
before that if we know the

837
00:43:47 --> 00:43:52
frequency of a photon or a wave
of light, we can know the

838
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
energy of that light.
 

839
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
So, since we know that there's
relationship also between

840
00:43:57 --> 00:43:59
frequency and wavelength, we
can do the same thing -- if we

841
00:43:59 --> 00:44:02
know the wavelength, we can
know the energy of the light.

842
00:44:02 --> 00:44:06
And I use the term photon here,
and that's because he also

843
00:44:06 --> 00:44:08
concluded that light must be
made up of these energy

844
00:44:08 --> 00:44:11
packets, and each packet has
that h, that Planck's

845
00:44:11 --> 00:44:15
constant's worth of energy in
it, so that's why you have to

846
00:44:15 --> 00:44:17
multiply Planck's constant
times the frequency.

847
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
Any frequency can't have an
energy, you have to -- you

848
00:44:21 --> 00:44:24
don't have a continuum of
frequencies that are of a

849
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28
certain energy, it's actually
punctuated into these packets

850
00:44:28 --> 00:44:30
that are called photons.
 

851
00:44:30 --> 00:44:33
And, as you know, Einstein made
many, many, many very important

852
00:44:33 --> 00:44:38
contributions to science and
relativity, but he called this

853
00:44:38 --> 00:44:42
his one single most important
contribution to science, the

854
00:44:42 --> 00:44:46
relationship between energy and
frequency and the

855
00:44:46 --> 00:44:48
idea of photons.
 

856
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
So this means we now have a new
way of thinking about the

857
00:44:52 --> 00:44:56
photoelectric effect, and that
is the idea that h times

858
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59
nu is actually an energy.
 

859
00:44:59 --> 00:45:02
So, it's the energy of an
incident photon if we're

860
00:45:02 --> 00:45:04
talking about nu where we're
talking about the energy of the

861
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
photon going in, so we can
abbreviate that as e sub i,

862
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
energy of the incident photon.
 

863
00:45:11 --> 00:45:16
We can talk about also h times
nu nought, which is that

864
00:45:16 --> 00:45:17
threshold frequency.
 

865
00:45:17 --> 00:45:20
So this is a term we're going
to see a lot, especially in

866
00:45:20 --> 00:45:23
your problem sets, it's called
the work function, and the work

867
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28
function is the same thing as
the threshold frequency of a

868
00:45:28 --> 00:45:30
metal, except, of course, that
it's multiplied by

869
00:45:30 --> 00:45:31
Planck's constant.
 

870
00:45:31 --> 00:45:34
So, it's the minimum energy
that a certain metal requires

871
00:45:34 --> 00:45:36
in order to pop a photon out
of it -- in order to eject

872
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
an electron from the
surface of that metal.

873
00:45:38 --> 00:45:46
So this is our new kind of
schematic way that we can

874
00:45:46 --> 00:45:50
think about looking at the
photoelectric effect, so if

875
00:45:50 --> 00:45:53
this is the total amount of
energy that we put into the

876
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
system, where here we have the
energy of a free electron.

877
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
We have this much energy going
in, the metal itself requires

878
00:46:01 --> 00:46:05
this much energy, the work
function, in order to

879
00:46:05 --> 00:46:06
eject an electron.
 

880
00:46:06 --> 00:46:09
So that much energy is going to
be used up just ejecting it.

881
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
And what we have left over is
this amount of energy here,

882
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
which is going to be the
kinetic energy of the

883
00:46:15 --> 00:46:17
ejected electron.
 

884
00:46:17 --> 00:46:20
So, therefore, we can rewrite
our equation in two ways.

885
00:46:20 --> 00:46:24
One is just talking about it in
terms only of energy where our

886
00:46:24 --> 00:46:27
kinetic energy here is going to
be equal to the total energy

887
00:46:27 --> 00:46:32
going in -- the energy initial
minus this energy of the

888
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
work function here.
 

889
00:46:34 --> 00:46:38
We can also talk about it in
terms of if we want to solve,

890
00:46:38 --> 00:46:41
if we, for example, we want to
find out what that initial

891
00:46:41 --> 00:46:44
energy was, we can just
rearrange our equation, or we

892
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
can look at this here where the
initial energy is equal to

893
00:46:48 --> 00:46:50
kinetic energy plus
the work function.

894
00:46:50 --> 00:46:54
So before we go we'll try to
see if we can do a clicker

895
00:46:54 --> 00:46:58
question for you on this,
and we can, very good.

896
00:46:58 --> 00:47:01
So, everyone take those
clickers back out and tell me,

897
00:47:01 --> 00:47:03
if a beam of light with a
certain energy, and we're going

898
00:47:03 --> 00:47:08
to say four electron volts
strikes a gold surface, and

899
00:47:08 --> 00:47:11
here we're saying that the gold
surface has a work function of

900
00:47:11 --> 00:47:17
5.1 electron volts, what is the
maximum kinetic energy of the

901
00:47:17 --> 00:47:31
electron that is ejected?
 

902
00:47:31 --> 00:47:37
So why don't you go ahead and
take ten seconds on that.

903
00:47:37 --> 00:47:40
And if you don't know, that's
okay, just type in an answer

904
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
and give it your best shot.
 

905
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
And let's see what we
come up with here.

906
00:47:47 --> 00:47:47
Alright.
 

907
00:47:47 --> 00:47:52
So, it looks like some of you
were tricked, but many of you

908
00:47:52 --> 00:47:55
were not, so no electrons
will be ejected.

909
00:47:55 --> 00:47:59
The reason for that is because
this is the minimum amount of

910
00:47:59 --> 00:48:02
energy -- hold off a sec on the
packing up, so in case someone

911
00:48:02 --> 00:48:04
doesn't understand -- this is
the minimum amount of energy

912
00:48:04 --> 00:48:07
that's required from the energy
going in in order to

913
00:48:07 --> 00:48:08
eject an electron.
 

914
00:48:08 --> 00:48:12
So if the incident energy is
less than the energy that's

915
00:48:12 --> 00:48:14
required, absolutely
nothing will happen.

916
00:48:14 --> 00:48:16
That's the same thing we
were talking about with

917
00:48:16 --> 00:48:17
threshold frequency.
 

918
00:48:17 --> 00:48:20
All right, now you can pack up
and we'll see you on Wednesday.

919
00:48:20 --> 00:48:21
