00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
PROFESSOR: -- 10 seconds

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
clicker question.
 

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
As you can see we're having
another competition today,

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
so see if you can beat out
Justin's recitation and get

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
the most correct today.
 

14
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
So, this is a topic from
Friday, which is asking us

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
which of the following
molecules are free

16
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
radical species.
 

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:42
OK.
 

18
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
So it looks like most and
you got it, that it's o h.

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
Let's quickly go over why
that is just in case you

20
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
weren't one of that 74%.
 

21
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
So, if we're looking at o
h versus c o, what are we

22
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
looking at to decide if
we have a radical here?

23
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
Valence electrons.
 

24
00:01:00 --> 00:01:06
So we have 6 plus 1 in terms of
o h, that's 7, versus having

25
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
4 plus 6, which is 10.
 

26
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Specifically, what do we
look for in terms of

27
00:01:12 --> 00:01:12
valence electrons?
 

28
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
Odd numbers.
 

29
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
So, we have a radical here with
o h, whereas we have an even

30
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
number of valence electrons for
c o, so that's not a radical,

31
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
in terms of what we know how to
think about so far, which is

32
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
using our Lewis structures
to determine that.

33
00:01:29 --> 00:01:30
All right.
 

34
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
So that's a little review
from Friday, let's move

35
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
on to today's lecture.
 

36
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
In terms of what we're going to
be talking about today, we're

37
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
going to finish up with talking
about polar covalent bonds, and

38
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
finish up with discussing the
idea of polar molecules.

39
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
And then we'll move on to start
talking about well, we know how

40
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
to draw our Lewis structures,
how can we use those Lewis

41
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
structures to think about the
actual shapes of molecules.

42
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
So, first thinking about
our polar covalent bonds.

43
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
What we had established is if
we have a case where we have a

44
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
covalent bond, but there's
unequal sharing of electrons

45
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
between the two atoms, namely
because they have different

46
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
electronegativities, what we
see is we have a polar bond or

47
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
a polar covalent bond where one
of the atoms is going to pull

48
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
away more of the electron
density from that bond, giving

49
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
it that partial negative charge
where the other atom is going

50
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
to end up with a partial
positive charge.

51
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
In terms of thinking about
well, what do we call a

52
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
covalent bond versus a polar
covalent bond versus a purely

53
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
ionic bond, it turns out that
the distinction is a little bit

54
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
fuzzy, it's not a clear line,
but in terms of talking about

55
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
things in general, and
especially in thinking about

56
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
problems for this course, what
we're going to say is if you

57
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
have an electronegativity or
chi difference between the two

58
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
atoms that is greater than 0 .
 

59
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
4, and less than 1 .
 

60
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
7, and we're talking about the
Pauling electronegativity scale

61
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
here, which is what's used
throughout your book.

62
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
If you have a difference in
electronegativity anywhere in

63
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
that range, we'll have what we
call a polar covalent bond

64
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
between those two atoms.
 

65
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
So, for example, if we compare
the chi values for hydrogen

66
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
versus carbon, we see they only
have a difference of 0.4 .

67
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
0.4 is not greater than 0.4 .
 

68
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
So we would not call this a c h
bond, we would not say it's

69
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
polar covalent, we would
just call it covalent.

70
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
In contrast, if we talk about a
carbon oxygen bond, now we have

71
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
a chi difference of 0.8 , so
that is greater than 0.4 , so

72
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
we'll call carbon oxygen
bond polar covalent.

73
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
We can extend this idea of
talking about these polar

74
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
covalent bonds to thinking
about an entire molecule.

75
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
I'm sure you've all heard of
the term a polar molecule

76
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
versus a non-polar molecule,
and essentially, when we talk

77
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
about having a polar molecule,
what we're saying is that

78
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
there's is a net non-zero
dipole moment within

79
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
the whole molecule.
 

80
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
So essentially, what we have to
do is combine all of the

81
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
individual bonds to think about
the molecule as a whole.

82
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
So, let's take an example of
carbon dioxide here, or c o 2.

83
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
Very soon in the lecture you'll
learn how to predict shapes

84
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
based on Lewis structures.
 

85
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
So you will quickly see that
this is a linear molecule.

86
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
We can think about the
2 bonds within it.

87
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
There's two carbon oxygen
bonds, and we know that there

88
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
is a dipole in that bond, which
is going toward the oxygen.

89
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
Remember, in chemistry we
always draw the arrow, we're

90
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
always interested in what
those electrons are doing.

91
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
So if we draw in the bond
dipoles, and you can draw these

92
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
into your notes, you want to
draw an arrow towards the

93
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
oxygen in each case.
 

94
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
But we're not just interested
here in thinking about do we

95
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
have a polar bond, we actually
want to know in general do

96
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
we have a polar molecule.
 

97
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
So, looking at c o 2 as a
whole, do you think we have

98
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
a polar or a non-polar
molecule here?

99
00:04:56 --> 00:04:56
Non-polar.
 

100
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
OK, very good for all of
you that said non-polar.

101
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
The reason it's non-polar is we
simply have two equal vectors

102
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
in opposite directions, so
they cancel each other out.

103
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
The net effect is that we
have a 0 dipole moment

104
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
in the c o molecule.
 

105
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
In contrast, we can
look at h 2 o.

106
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
H 2 o actually has this bent
shape, and again, we'll see

107
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
very soon and how to predict
that h 2 o has a bent

108
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
shape, that water is bent.
 

109
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
And again, we do have dipole
moments -- we have bonds where

110
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
there is a polar bond and we
should point our arrow toward

111
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
the oxygen, because electron
density is being pulled from

112
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
the hydrogen atoms
to the oxygen.

113
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
And again, we can cancel some
of these vectors out, but we

114
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
still have a net dipole moment
that is going to be going up if

115
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
we think about combining
these 2 vectors here.

116
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
So, what we would say, which is
what we know from everything

117
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
we've always heard, which is
that water is a polar molecule.

118
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
So, this is a great
way to think about

119
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
molecules in general.
 

120
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
It's very easy to think about
if those vectors cancel each

121
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
other out or if they're
additive when we're talking

122
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
about just single bonds, so we
have two atoms or if we have

123
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
just three atoms, as we
do in these cases here.

124
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
But it turns out, a lot of the
molecules we consider are

125
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
actually much, much, much
larger than just a

126
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
couple of atoms.
 

127
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
So we can't often think
about canceling all the

128
00:06:27 --> 00:06:28
different vectors out.
 

129
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
And in general, when we're
talking about these really

130
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
large molecules, whether
they're large organic molecules

131
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
or we're talking about
proteins, which can have

132
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
thousands of atoms in them,
instead of adding up all those

133
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
individual polar bonds, what we
do is we talk about the number

134
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
of polar groups that it
will have in the molecule.

135
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
So we can think about a
protein, for example, as having

136
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
a lot of different polar groups
or one that has not too

137
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
many polar side groups.
 

138
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
That's one way you hear people
talking about proteins, and

139
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
that has a lot to do with their
solubility in water, and also

140
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
about how the protein's
going to fold.

141
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
But let's look at a little bit
about less complicated example

142
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
than a protein with thousands
of different atoms.

143
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
Let's instead consider a couple
of vitamins here, which

144
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
instead have a few dozen
different atoms in them.

145
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
Specifically, let's look at
vitamin A and vitamin B9.

146
00:07:17 --> 00:07:26
Does anyone know another
name for vitamin B9?

147
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
I don't think I hear it --
does anyone say folic acid.

148
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
It's also sometimes
called vitamin M.

149
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
It's one of the vitamin B9
vitamins, there's actually

150
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
other forms of vitamin B9,
but this is one of the big

151
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
ones that you hear about.
 

152
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Hopefully you're all very
familiar with folic acid,

153
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
because it's an important
vitamin to take, especially if

154
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
you're a woman, especially if
there's any chance you ever

155
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
might become pregnant in any
kind of near future time,

156
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
by accident or on purpose.
 

157
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
And the reason for this is
because folic acid deficiency

158
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
in pregnant women leads to
neural tube defects in babies,

159
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
and your brain develops very,
very, very early in pregnancy,

160
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
the brain of an embryo.
 

161
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
So it turns out that a lot of
women don't realize they're

162
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
pregnant while the fetus' brain
is developing, and if these

163
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
women are not getting enough
folic acid, you can end up with

164
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
spina bifida, which is an
absolutely devastating and

165
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
very preventable disease or
other neural tube defects.

166
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
So hopefully, if you're not
familiar with folic acid,

167
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
you'll become familiar at least
within the next 10 or 15 years

168
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
or so before you're thinking
about maybe, on purpose,

169
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
becoming pregnant at some time.
 

170
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
Vitamin A you probably all
heard about growing up, getting

171
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
enough of your carrots
so you can see at night.

172
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Vitamin A is important
for eye health.

173
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
But just looking at the
structure of these two

174
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
molecules, knowing what we know
so far about general chemistry,

175
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
we can already say a lot about
how these are going to function

176
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
the body or how they'll
be treated in the body.

177
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
And specifically, let's take a
look at which of these two

178
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
molecules has more polar bonds
and see what that tells us.

179
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
So take a look at your two
structures and tell me which

180
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
has, between folic acid
and vitamin A, more polar

181
00:09:09 --> 00:09:19
groups within the vitamin.
 

182
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
And this should go pretty
quickly since you don't need to

183
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
have an exact number, we're
just looking and glancing

184
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
and seeing which has more.
 

185
00:09:25 --> 00:09:39
So let's take 10
seconds on this.

186
00:09:39 --> 00:09:39
All right, great.
 

187
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
So most you said folic acid or
vitamin B9, so let's switch

188
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
back to our notes and
take a look at why.

189
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
So vitamin B9 has
more polar bonds.

190
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
It's very easy to see, once
I highlight, that it's not

191
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
even a close call at all.
 

192
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
We have a bunch of different
polar bonds in B9 versus

193
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
just one in vitamin A.
 

194
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
Remember, the c h bond we're
not calling polar covalent

195
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
because it only has an
electronegativity difference

196
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
of 0.4 between the two atoms.
 

197
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
So what we know is that vitamin
B9, folic acid, is more polar.

198
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
Remember, we also just said
that water is polar, so

199
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
would we say that B9 is
water or fat soluble?

200
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
It's going to be water soluble
-- everyone knows the saying,

201
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
"like dissolves like." B9 is
going to be very water soluble.

202
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
This actually is very
important if you think

203
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
about taking your vitamins.
 

204
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
This means if it's water
soluble, any vitamins that are

205
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
water soluble, and now you
should to be able to look at

206
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
the structure of any vitamin
and tell me, for example, that

207
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
vitamin C is water soluble,
that folic acid is

208
00:10:42 --> 00:10:42
water soluble.
 

209
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
If you take these vitamins,
what happens is that they're

210
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
very quickly and easily
excreted into your urine.

211
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
So, for example, some
people like to take mega

212
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
doses of vitamin C.
 

213
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
What really happens is that you
have a mega dose of vitamin C

214
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
in your urine, it doesn't stick
around long in your body.

215
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
So it doesn't help and
just take all of your

216
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
vitamin C at once.
 

217
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
That's why it's important to
eat balanced meals throughout

218
00:11:03 --> 00:11:07
the day, you need to be getting
a constant supply of these

219
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
water soluble vitamins.
 

220
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
The same is for folic acid, you
can't just take it once a

221
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
month, you need to be taking it
regularly in order that you

222
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
keep the stores up in your
body, otherwise you're going to

223
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
excrete it, you're going to
get rid of it very quickly.

224
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
In contrast, if we think about
vitamin A, is this going to be

225
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
water soluble or fat soluble?
 

226
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
Yup, so this is the
fat soluble vitamin.

227
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
Vitamin E is another big one
that's fat soluble that gets a

228
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
lot of press in terms of being
an important vitamin to take.

229
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
We can think about what it
means when a vitamin is

230
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
fat soluble instead
of water soluble.

231
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
Well, now it's not going to get
excreted out of our body so

232
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
quickly, so we actually can
build up amounts of vitamin A

233
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
vitamin E, for example, but
that can also pose a problem if

234
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
you think about biologically
what's happening.

235
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
And up here I just show two
different supplements that

236
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
I found on the internet.
 

237
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
This is One A Day vitamin,
it has about 100% of what

238
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
you need of everything.
 

239
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
And then this vitamin is one
that I found that's supposed to

240
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
really help you with your eye
health, if you have bad vision

241
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
instead of glasses, they
suggest that you try

242
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
this vitamin here.
 

243
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
And what you can see is that it
has five times your daily value

244
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
of vitamin A, and 13 times
what you need of vitamin E.

245
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Is this a good idea?
 

246
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
No.
 

247
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Basically, you are just
building up more and more and

248
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
more of these fat soluble
vitamins into your body.

249
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
And there have been studies
that have come out recently

250
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
trying to look at the health
benefits of vitamin E, and in

251
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
some of these studies they give
these mega doses, and instead

252
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
what they find is increased
bleeding in these patients, an

253
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
increase in overall different
types of death that

254
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
can be happening.
 

255
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
You want to take your vitamins,
it's very important, but you

256
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
don't want it just build up,
and you want to think about is

257
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
the vitamin that I'm going and
getting 800 times what I need a

258
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
day, is that a water soluble
vitamin or a fat soluble

259
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
vitamin, and using your
chemistry, you should be able

260
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
to very quickly take a quick
look at that structure

261
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
and figure out what kind
of a vitamin that is.

262
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
All right.
 

263
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
So that's just one reason we
would want to be able to think

264
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
about polarity is thinking
about whether something is

265
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
very water soluble or not.
 

266
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Let's think about some other
things that have to do with

267
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
polarity and then can tell us
a lot of other information.

268
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
So let's move on to talking
about the shapes of molecules.

269
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
And the shapes of molecules is
very important for a number of

270
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
different properties when we're
thinking about chemical

271
00:13:28 --> 00:13:32
reactions and reactions that
take place in the body.

272
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
When we talk about shapes of
molecules, we're talking about

273
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
the geometry of that molecule.
 

274
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
And the geometry influences all
of its different properties,

275
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
including things like melting
point or boiling point,

276
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
it's reactivity.
 

277
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
We just saw when talking about
polar molecules, that it

278
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
influences whether or not the
molecule itself is

279
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
polar or apolar.
 

280
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
It's also really important
when we talk about biology.

281
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
Shape is particularly important
when you think about enzymes

282
00:14:00 --> 00:14:05
having an active site where a
molecule needs to fit perfectly

283
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
into the active site, it does
that because of its shape.

284
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
A quick example that we can
think about is with sucrose.

285
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
Does anyone know
what sucrose is?

286
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
It's just table sugar --
sucrose is that crystal in

287
00:14:17 --> 00:14:22
sugar that we hopefully
use in most of our sugar

288
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
intake as sweeteners.
 

289
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
A lot of times we use corn
syrup, which is often not

290
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
sucrose and which tends to be
not always as good for us,

291
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
although anything in too much
excess is obviously a

292
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
non-ideal situation.
 

293
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
But in order for us to use the
energy from sucrose, sucrose is

294
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
made up of two individual
sugar monomers.

295
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
It's made up of a monomer of
glucose and one of fructose, a

296
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
6 and a 5 membered ring, so in
order for our body to use it,

297
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
we need to break it into
with its monomers.

298
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
And if we that, we can do it by
what's called hydrolysis --

299
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
sucrose and water breaks
down into its two monomers,

300
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
now our body can use it.
 

301
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
The problem is this process
takes on the order of 10 or

302
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
maybe 100 years in order
for us to get enough of

303
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
the sugar broken down.
 

304
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
That's why we need an enzyme
molecule, and the enzyme in

305
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
our body is called sucrase.
 

306
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
Sucrase breaks down sucrose, it
catalyzes that reaction, so

307
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
it happens very quickly.
 

308
00:15:13 --> 00:15:17
And the key is, and here's
a ball and stick shape of

309
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
what sucrose looks like.
 

310
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
It needs to fit exactly
into that active site.

311
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
When it does, it combines into
the enzyme, the enzyme can then

312
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
catalyze the hydrolysis or the
breaking apart of those two

313
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
individual monomers into
its separate pieces.

314
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
And then it let's go of the
glucose and the fructose, and

315
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
we get our enzyme back again,
and something else combined

316
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
into that active site.
 

317
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
So, this is one very simple
example of why molecular

318
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
shape is very important.
 

319
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
A lot of times you're thinking
about small molecules

320
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
interacting with proteins or
interacting with other

321
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
molecules, and you want to
think about the shape of that

322
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
molecule to think about
how that interaction is

323
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
going to take place.
 

324
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
So what we're going to use to
think about molecular shape or

325
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
molecular geometry is what's
called valence shell electron

326
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
repulsion or vsper theory.
 

327
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
And this theory is very
convenient for us to be

328
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
thinking about because we are
now masters of drawing Lewis

329
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
structures, and vesper theory
is based on Lewis structures,

330
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
and also the principle that
when we have valence electron

331
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
pairs, they're going
to repel each other.

332
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
This make sense any time you
have negatively-charged

333
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
electrons, you want to get them
as far away from each other as

334
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
possible because they're
all negatively charged.

335
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
And the other principle is that
the geometry around that

336
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
central atom, which you've
identified as the central atom

337
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
in the Lewis structure, is
going to be such that it

338
00:16:40 --> 00:16:45
minimizes the repulsion between
those either bonding electrons

339
00:16:45 --> 00:16:48
or the electron pairs.
 

340
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
So when we talk about vsper
there's a special nomenclature

341
00:16:50 --> 00:16:57
that we do use, and in vsper
we have a -- does anyone know

342
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
what a means in vsper theory?
 

343
00:16:59 --> 00:17:04
It's a central atom.
 

344
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
What about x?
 

345
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
So this is actually the
bonding, any bonding

346
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
atom you call x.
 

347
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
And then we have e, which
is equal to lone pairs.

348
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
So e is a lone pair -- e is not
a lone pair electron, so if

349
00:17:21 --> 00:17:28
you have two electrons,
that's one lone pair.

350
00:17:28 --> 00:17:28
All right.
 

351
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
So there are some guidelines
that we use when we're coming

352
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
up with these vsper geometries.
 

353
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
The first thing we talk about
is the steric number, which

354
00:17:35 --> 00:17:37
we use to predict what
that geometry will be.

355
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
When we're talking about steric
number, all we're talking about

356
00:17:41 --> 00:17:46
is adding together the number
we have of bonded atoms, plus

357
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
the number of lone pairs.
 

358
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
So, essentially were just
adding x to e and that gives

359
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
us our steric number.
 

360
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
So, for example, if we look
at this molecule, which is

361
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
a x 2 e, what is the
steric number here?

362
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
Yeah, it's 3, so we have
a steric number of 3.

363
00:18:03 --> 00:18:05
Something that I want to point
out is that we could have a

364
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
different molecule, which is
also a x 2 e, but in this case

365
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
we have a double bond between
the central atom and one of the

366
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
x atoms here, and what I want
to point out is in vsper theory

367
00:18:18 --> 00:18:21
we treat bonds as bonds, we
don't worry about if they're

368
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
single or they're double
or they're triple.

369
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
So again, we call this a
x 2 e, this again, has

370
00:18:27 --> 00:18:28
a steric number of 3.
 

371
00:18:28 --> 00:18:33
So what's important in terms of
vsper theory is the number of

372
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
atoms bonded to a central atom.
 

373
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
What's not important is
the types of bonds that

374
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
we're dealing with.
 

375
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
A few other guidelines I want
to mention is first of all, to

376
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
think about resonance
structures.

377
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
So on Friday we were talking
about the chromate anion, and

378
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
we said that here are two of
its resonance structures here,

379
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
but that we could actually draw
four more resonance structures,

380
00:18:55 --> 00:19:00
and I just want to point out
when you take a molecule that

381
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
has many different resonance
structures and you want to draw

382
00:19:03 --> 00:19:08
its vsper, it's Lewis structure
and its vsper geometry, you can

383
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
take any single one of those
resonance structures, it

384
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
doesn't matter, you'll all end
up with the same geometry.

385
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
And lastly, if we're talking
about a molecule that has more

386
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
than one central atom, which is
what we're very, very often

387
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
doing, you need to deal
with each one separately.

388
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
So for example, with methanol
here, we have a carbon, which

389
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
is a central atom, and we also
have an oxygen, which is a

390
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
central atom, you need to talk
about the geometry separately,

391
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
we don't talk about
the geometry of the

392
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
entire molecule.
 

393
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
So, let's go ahead and look at
some of these vsper examples,

394
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
and Professor Drennan is going
to help demonstrate what some

395
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
of these are with
some models here.

396
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
So the first case we're going
to talk about is without any

397
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
lone pairs -- this is the
most straightforward case.

398
00:19:53 --> 00:19:58
And our first case that we can
have is a x 3, which is going

399
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
to have a linear shape,
and that will have a bond

400
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
angle of a 180 degrees.
 

401
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
The next case that we can
talk about is trigonal

402
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
planar or a x 3.
 

403
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
Now, you do need to know
these geometry, you

404
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
need to know the names.
 

405
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
A lot of them are very
easy to remember.

406
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
I expect not too many of you
will get linear incorrect.

407
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
Also, trigonal
planar, pretty easy.

408
00:20:22 --> 00:20:26
Trigonal, it has 3 atoms
around the central atom and

409
00:20:26 --> 00:20:27
the molecule is planar.
 

410
00:20:27 --> 00:20:34
PROFESSOR: So, what is the
bond angle for this geometry?

411
00:20:34 --> 00:20:35
120.
 

412
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

413
00:20:36 --> 00:20:36
Great.
 

414
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
So, next we can think about a x
4, and this is what's called

415
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
a tetrahedral geometry.
 

416
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
If you're trying to remember
this name you can think of each

417
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
of those bonding atoms as being
in the corner of tetrahedron.

418
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
One thing I want to point out
is you're seeing some notation

419
00:20:53 --> 00:20:56
we haven't used before in this
class where you have a wedge

420
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
coming out at you, and you also
have a dashed line to

421
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
one of those bonds.
 

422
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
Any time you see a wedge in a
Lewis structure, it means that

423
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
it's coming out at you -- it's
either coming out of the screen

424
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
or it's coming out
of your paper.

425
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
And any time you see a dashed
line here, which might be

426
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
easier to see in your notes,
that means that the bond is

427
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
actually going into the page
or into the screen or

428
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
into the blackboard.
 

429
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
PROFESSOR: And what are the
angles for a tetrahedral?

430
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26
PROFESSOR: All right,
so they're 1 0 9 .

431
00:21:26 --> 00:21:26
5.
 

432
00:21:26 --> 00:21:27
Pretty close.
 

433
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
So that's as far away as those
bonds can get from each

434
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
other would be 109 .
 

435
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
5 degrees.
 

436
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
The next case we have is a x 5.
 

437
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
That is what we call
trigonal bipyramidal.

438
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
Again, we have trigonal,
because we have those 3 bonds

439
00:21:43 --> 00:21:47
in the center, and if you can
picture putting walls between

440
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
all those bonds, you can see
there's a pyramid on the

441
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
top and a pyramid on the
bottom, so bipyramidal.

442
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
PROFESSOR: And there are 2 sets
of angles here, what are the

443
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
angles for equatorial atoms?
 

444
00:22:00 --> 00:22:01
120.
 

445
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
And then for axial?
 

446
00:22:02 --> 00:22:02
90.
 

447
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
PROFESSOR: And again, axial,
those are just the ones in the

448
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
axis, and equatorial if you put
your globe around the equator.

449
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
So the last case
we have is a x 6.

450
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
A x 6 is what we call
octahedral -- you can picture

451
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
each of those bonded atoms as
a corner of an octahedron.

452
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
PROFESSOR: And what are
the angles in this,

453
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28
this one set of angles?
 

454
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
90.
 

455
00:22:30 --> 00:22:30
PROFESSOR: Great.
 

456
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
So, 90 degrees.
 

457
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
All right.
 

458
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
So this is all straightforward
when we're just thinking about

459
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
different molecular shapes that
don't have any lone pairs in

460
00:22:40 --> 00:22:42
them, but once we start having
lone pairs, we now need to

461
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
think about how those
lone pairs are going to

462
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
affect the geometry.
 

463
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
But before we do that, let's
talk about some examples of

464
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
molecules without lone pairs.
 

465
00:22:52 --> 00:22:56
So the first case is what we
saw at the beginning of class,

466
00:22:56 --> 00:22:59
carbon dioxide, and we said
that that was linear, and now

467
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
we know why it's linear -- it
has a formula of a x 2,

468
00:23:04 --> 00:23:07
and an s n number of 2.
 

469
00:23:07 --> 00:23:13
And that's a bond
angle of 180 degrees.

470
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
So, you can tell us about
borane, borane is a x 3.

471
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
PROFESSOR: And what
is the geometry?

472
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
And the angle?
 

473
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
120.
 

474
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
Feel free to yell out very
loudly, we want people in

475
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
OpenCourseWare to hear the
answers coming from the room.

476
00:23:34 --> 00:23:34
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

477
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
So the next case we're going to
look at is c h 4 or methane,

478
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
and let's do a clicker question
here to make sure everyone is

479
00:23:41 --> 00:23:43
remembering these geometries.
 

480
00:23:43 --> 00:23:46
And this should be very quick,
and try to not turn the page

481
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
back one, and tell us in 10
seconds here what

482
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
the geometry is.
 

483
00:23:50 --> 00:24:06
98%, that is a new record.
 

484
00:24:06 --> 00:24:07
Very good.
 

485
00:24:07 --> 00:24:07
Tetrahedral.
 

486
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
PROFESSOR: All right, while I'm
holding carbon dioxide in one

487
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
hand and methane in the other
hand, I just want to do an

488
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
additional plug for the
energy debate tonight.

489
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
So there will be
representatives from both

490
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
presidential campaigns that
are going to be there to

491
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
answer questions.
 

492
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
And I'm not sure of the exact
format, I'm not sure whether

493
00:24:28 --> 00:24:31
all audience members are going
to be able to ask

494
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
questions or not.
 

495
00:24:33 --> 00:24:34
I'm not sure if I'm going to
be there, I'm supposed to

496
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
be giving a talk actually,
ironically, about energy

497
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
at the same time.
 

498
00:24:40 --> 00:24:43
But if I can't make it and
you're allowed to ask

499
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
questions, I'd like you to
ask a question for me.

500
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
So, my lab looks at enzymes
that remove carbon monoxide

501
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
and carbon dioxide
from the environment.

502
00:24:52 --> 00:24:56
And I have an energy initiative
grant to do this, because MIT

503
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
recognizes that an important
part of any energy initiative

504
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
is thinking about
lowering pollutants and

505
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
greenhouse gases.
 

506
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
So, I heard on Thursday at the
debate when Governor Sarah

507
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
Palin was asked directly if she
really doesn't think there's

508
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
any connection between global
warming and any man-made

509
00:25:13 --> 00:25:16
activities, that she said,
well, you know, it could be

510
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
just regular temperature
fluctuations, and she doesn't

511
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
want to point any fingers.
 

512
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
So, she's not quite sure.
 

513
00:25:23 --> 00:25:26
I also learned on Thursday
that she will head the

514
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
energy initiative in a
McCain/Palin White House.

515
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
So, if you go to this debate, I
would like you to ask what is

516
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
your plan for sequestering
carbon dioxide and other

517
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
greenhouse gases.
 

518
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
You can ask both candidates,
and please let me know what the

519
00:25:41 --> 00:25:44
answer is, because I think
that's a really important

520
00:25:44 --> 00:25:47
question -- here we have carbon
dioxide, here we have methane,

521
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
we need to be thinking
about greenhouse gases.

522
00:25:50 --> 00:25:52
PROFESSOR: You can also
throw in the question

523
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
that you do know this is
tetrahedral and 109 .

524
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
5 degrees -- show your
chemistry knowledge here.

525
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
All right, and let's keep
showing that we know our

526
00:26:02 --> 00:26:08
geometries, let's
look at p c l 5.

527
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
PROFESSOR: And what
is geometry here?

528
00:26:12 --> 00:26:12
Yup.
 

529
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
And the angles?
 

530
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
120 and 90.
 

531
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
PROFESSOR: So, 120
equatorial, and 90 axial.

532
00:26:22 --> 00:26:28
And last we have s f 6.
 

533
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
PROFESSOR: So, what is
the geometry here?

534
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
Octahedral.
 

535
00:26:31 --> 00:26:31
And angle?
 

536
00:26:31 --> 00:26:31
90.
 

537
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
PROFESSOR: All right, so
there's our set of examples,

538
00:26:37 --> 00:26:40
one for each for those
shapes or geometries

539
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
that have no lone pairs.
 

540
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
And now let's think a little
bit about once we do have

541
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
molecules with lone pairs.
 

542
00:26:46 --> 00:26:49
And the biggest point to keep
in mind when we're comparing

543
00:26:49 --> 00:26:53
lone pair electrons with
bonding electrons or electrons

544
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
in bonds, is that when you have
electrons in bonds they have

545
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
less spatial distribution
than lone pairs.

546
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
So that's just a way of saying
that electrons and bonds,

547
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
they take up less space.
 

548
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
So, when we think about lone
pair electrons, they're taking

549
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
up more space and this means
that they're going to

550
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
experience more repulsion in
thinking about the lone pair

551
00:27:15 --> 00:27:19
electrons with either other
lone pair electrons or

552
00:27:19 --> 00:27:20
with bonding electrons.
 

553
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
So let's think a second about
the order that this will be in.

554
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
The biggest repulsion we
would feel is if we have

555
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
two different lone pair
electrons or lone pairs.

556
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
They're going to have
the most repulsion.

557
00:27:31 --> 00:27:34
In the middle is if we're
talking about a lone pair

558
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
with a bonding pair.
 

559
00:27:36 --> 00:27:39
And then the least repulsion is
going to be between two bonds

560
00:27:39 --> 00:27:43
or two bonding pairs
of electrons.

561
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
So, let's look at an example
of where this comes up.

562
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
So the first example I'm going
to talk about is a molecule

563
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
that has the geometry of a
seesaw shape, and once we get

564
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
to having Professor Drennan
actually show you that shape,

565
00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
you will never forget.
 

566
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
See-saw, that's going
to be one of the easy

567
00:27:59 --> 00:28:00
geometries to remember.
 

568
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
But the first thing that we
need to consider in terms of

569
00:28:03 --> 00:28:08
the shape, which starts, if you
picture first of all, and these

570
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
models sometimes don't quite
stay together, we could

571
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
actually have two
different possibilities.

572
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
The first is the idea that we
could have an axial lone

573
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
pair, and the second is the
possibility that we could have

574
00:28:19 --> 00:28:21
an equatorial lone pair.
 

575
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
And we could consider both, and
we should be able to use our

576
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
vsper principles to think about
which one is actually

577
00:28:26 --> 00:28:27
going to happen.
 

578
00:28:27 --> 00:28:31
So if we think about having an
axial lone pair here, that

579
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
would mean that these lone pair
electrons are going to be

580
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
within 90 degrees of three
different loan pairs, and

581
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
actually we'll see later, it
will be more than 90 because

582
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
they're actually going
to push them down.

583
00:28:42 --> 00:28:45
But in terms of considering how
many bonding electron pairs

584
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49
they'll repel strongly, what we
care about is anything within

585
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
90 degrees initially.
 

586
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
So, what we would see with the
axial lone pair is that we have

587
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
three lone pairs that we're
going to very strongly repel.

588
00:28:59 --> 00:29:01
Now would you tell me, if we
think about an equatorial lone

589
00:29:01 --> 00:29:07
pair, how many different
bonding electrons or a bonding

590
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
pairs that will strongly
repel if we have an

591
00:29:10 --> 00:29:11
equatorial lone pair?
 

592
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
So you might need to look at
your notes to actually compare

593
00:29:15 --> 00:29:31
these two before you submit
your answer up here.

594
00:29:31 --> 00:29:31
All right.
 

595
00:29:31 --> 00:29:45
Let's take 10 seconds on that.
 

596
00:29:45 --> 00:29:47
OK, strong showing with the
clicker questions today.

597
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
It's going to be a tight race
for clicker competition.

598
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
It's correct that the
equatorial is, in fact,

599
00:29:53 --> 00:29:58
has two, only two that
it strongly repels.

600
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
So, actually it's probably
easier to look at

601
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
Professor Drennan's model
here to see that.

602
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
So it's where the equatorial
lone pair is that is the

603
00:30:06 --> 00:30:10
actual seesaw geometry.
 

604
00:30:10 --> 00:30:13
PROFESSOR: So, how many of you
had seesaws in playgrounds

605
00:30:13 --> 00:30:15
when you were growing up?
 

606
00:30:15 --> 00:30:16
Oh, a lot of people.
 

607
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
I know that they're not
considered totally safe

608
00:30:18 --> 00:30:20
anymore, so some of
them are going away.

609
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
So this is seesaw.
 

610
00:30:25 --> 00:30:32
Now you should never forget it.
 

611
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
PROFESSOR: All right, so
seesaw, we've got seesaw.

612
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
Just to point out a
few more shapes.

613
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
We took one out, we replaced
one bond with a lone

614
00:30:42 --> 00:30:43
pair in terms of seesaw.
 

615
00:30:43 --> 00:30:49
If we have a x 3 e 2 now we
have two equatorial lone pairs.

616
00:30:49 --> 00:30:50
This is called the T-shaped
 

617
00:30:50 --> 00:30:51
PROFESSOR: T-shaped.
 

618
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
PROFESSOR: See, these aren't
too hard to remember the

619
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
geometries, the geometry names.
 

620
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
And we also can think about
if we have a x 4 e 2.

621
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
So now in order to get our lone
pairs as far away from each

622
00:31:06 --> 00:31:08
other as possible, they're
going to be on the axial

623
00:31:08 --> 00:31:15
position, and this is
called square planer.

624
00:31:15 --> 00:31:18
PROFESSOR: So, this is easy to
remember, square, also planar.

625
00:31:18 --> 00:31:22
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

626
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
So, let's talk a little bit now
about what the actual angles

627
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
are between bonds when now we
have these lone pairs present.

628
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
And remember, what we said is
when we have a lone pair of

629
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
electrons, they actually are
going to have more repulsion

630
00:31:36 --> 00:31:40
than if we just have a
c h bond or a bonded

631
00:31:40 --> 00:31:41
pair of a electrons.
 

632
00:31:41 --> 00:31:46
So essentially what that means
is that in molecules that have

633
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
lone pair electrons, so for
example, if we look at n h 3 or

634
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
ammonia versus methane here,
and Professor Drennan is

635
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
showing those models
to you here.

636
00:31:55 --> 00:31:59
What you end up seeing is
actually that the bonding

637
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
angle in n h 3 between
the n h bonds is smaller.

638
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
And you can't see it with these
models because these are

639
00:32:08 --> 00:32:10
not actual lone pairs.
 

640
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
But if they were actually
repelling each other, they

641
00:32:12 --> 00:32:16
would be pushing those bonds
as far away as possible,

642
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
and instead of being 109 .
 

643
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
5, you'd see that the
angle is now 106 .

644
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
7.
 

645
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
So it's a smaller angle between
bonds, because you have more

646
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
repulsion from those lone pairs
pushing those bonds down.

647
00:32:29 --> 00:32:32
We can also think about the
influence of atomic size

648
00:32:32 --> 00:32:34
in terms of this effect.
 

649
00:32:34 --> 00:32:37
So first of all, what happens
to atomic size as you go

650
00:32:37 --> 00:32:39
down the periodic table?
 

651
00:32:39 --> 00:32:41
Good, it increases.
 

652
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
So we have size increasing as
we go down the periodic table.

653
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
Phosphorous is right underneath
nitrogen on the periodic table,

654
00:32:49 --> 00:32:51
so phosphorous is going to
be bigger than nitrogen.

655
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
In terms of picturing what
happens with those lone pairs,

656
00:32:54 --> 00:32:57
when we have a larger atom, the
orbitals are also going to

657
00:32:57 --> 00:33:00
be larger, they can
take up more space.

658
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
That means these electrons,
this lone pair electrons are

659
00:33:04 --> 00:33:06
going to take up more space.
 

660
00:33:06 --> 00:33:09
This means they're going to
push away those bonding

661
00:33:09 --> 00:33:11
electrons even more.
 

662
00:33:11 --> 00:33:16
So would you expect the bond to
be larger or smaller for p h 3?

663
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

664
00:33:17 --> 00:33:18
PROFESSOR: It's going
to be smaller.

665
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
So, what we see is that angles
between bonded atoms actually

666
00:33:22 --> 00:33:25
decrease as you go down a
column on the periodic table.

667
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
So the actual angles for p h 3
are now going to be really

668
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
quite a bit smaller,
they're 93 .

669
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
3 degrees.
 

670
00:33:38 --> 00:33:38
All right.
 

671
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
So let's create a list for
ourselves in terms of all the

672
00:33:42 --> 00:33:45
geometries that we can have
now that we're dealing

673
00:33:45 --> 00:33:46
with lone pairs.
 

674
00:33:46 --> 00:33:49
One thing I want to point out
in terms of remembering the

675
00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
names of the different
geometries, when you're naming

676
00:33:52 --> 00:33:55
a geometry, the geometry name,
for example, when we looked at

677
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
square planar, we're only
actually naming where the bonds

678
00:34:00 --> 00:34:02
are, where actual atoms are.
 

679
00:34:02 --> 00:34:05
The name doesn't really
depend on the lone pairs.

680
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
And also, when you draw a
geometry, you don't always have

681
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
to draw the lone pairs in, but
you have to remember that the

682
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
lone pairs are very much
affecting the angles within

683
00:34:14 --> 00:34:17
your molecule and also
the actual shape.

684
00:34:17 --> 00:34:20
So, for example, let's start
talking about different types

685
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
that have lone pairs in it.
 

686
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
First of all, thinking about a
x 2 e, so we have one lone

687
00:34:26 --> 00:34:31
pair, and the geometry here is
bent, and I want you, thinking

688
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
about lone pair repulsion, to
tell us what you think

689
00:34:34 --> 00:34:44
the angle between these
bonds are going to be?

690
00:34:44 --> 00:34:59
And let's take 10
seconds on that.

691
00:34:59 --> 00:34:59
OK, good.
 

692
00:34:59 --> 00:35:01
75%, that's not bad.
 

693
00:35:01 --> 00:35:07
Let's think about why.
 

694
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
It's going to be less than 120
degrees, because we know that

695
00:35:11 --> 00:35:16
normally in a trigonal planar
situation, we have an

696
00:35:16 --> 00:35:17
angle of 120 degrees.
 

697
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
And since lone pairs are going
to cause more repulsion, we're

698
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
actually pushing down these two
bonds here closer together, so

699
00:35:26 --> 00:35:28
what we end up seeing is
that they're going to be

700
00:35:28 --> 00:35:30
less than 120 degrees.
 

701
00:35:30 --> 00:35:35
And it depends on the actual
molecule what the exact angles

702
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
are going to be, so you never
have to learn the exact angles

703
00:35:37 --> 00:35:39
in terms of lone pair
electrons, you just need to be

704
00:35:39 --> 00:35:41
able to tell us if the
bond angle is going to be

705
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
less than 120 degrees.
 

706
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
So let's look at another
example here, a x 3

707
00:35:48 --> 00:35:50
with one lone pair, e.
 

708
00:35:50 --> 00:35:53
This is called
trigonal pyramidal.

709
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
Again, you have trigonal
because there's three atoms

710
00:35:56 --> 00:36:02
bonded to the central atom, and
this looks like a pyramid here.

711
00:36:02 --> 00:36:03
PROFESSOR: So, what would
the angle of this be?

712
00:36:03 --> 00:36:04
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

713
00:36:04 --> 00:36:09
PROFESSOR: I think I heard it.
 

714
00:36:09 --> 00:36:10
PROFESSOR: I think so, too.
 

715
00:36:10 --> 00:36:13
Less than 109 .
 

716
00:36:13 --> 00:36:14
5.
 

717
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
Let's take another
example, a x 2 e 2.

718
00:36:18 --> 00:36:19
This is also bent.
 

719
00:36:19 --> 00:36:22
Tell us what the geometry -- we
told you the geometry, tell us

720
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
what the bond angle is going
to be between these bonds.

721
00:36:25 --> 00:36:30
So, let's take 10
seconds on this.

722
00:36:30 --> 00:36:38
Let's re-poll F 4.
 

723
00:36:38 --> 00:36:52
So 10 seconds again.
 

724
00:36:52 --> 00:36:53
All right.
 

725
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
In about 10 seconds, Darcy,
in 10 seconds we'll

726
00:36:57 --> 00:36:59
hit the next side.
 

727
00:36:59 --> 00:37:09
OK, so it's less than 109 .
 

728
00:37:09 --> 00:37:10
5 degrees now.
 

729
00:37:10 --> 00:37:15
So some of you wrote that it
was less than 120 degrees, and

730
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
we can think about if we switch
back to the class notes

731
00:37:18 --> 00:37:20
the difference here.
 

732
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
So even though, so this is now
going to be less than 109 .

733
00:37:24 --> 00:37:28
5, if we looked at the case we
had bent in the first case,

734
00:37:28 --> 00:37:31
that started with 120 and one
of those bonds was replaced

735
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
with a lone pair, but now we
have two lone pairs here, so

736
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
now what we're going to see is
that the two bents are

737
00:37:38 --> 00:37:39
not, in fact, equal.
 

738
00:37:39 --> 00:37:42
The bent where you started
with the tetrahedral shape

739
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
is actually going to
be less than 109 .

740
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
5, and Professor Drennan
can maybe show us that

741
00:37:48 --> 00:37:49
with the models here.
 

742
00:37:49 --> 00:37:53
PROFESSOR: It's a little had to
see, actually, between the two,

743
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
but I think it's easier to see
on this, that if you consider

744
00:37:59 --> 00:38:04
the sort of starting place for
the two, if you look at the

745
00:38:04 --> 00:38:08
bottom set and you put
orbitals, so it also depends on

746
00:38:08 --> 00:38:09
your starting geometry.
 

747
00:38:09 --> 00:38:15
It can be bent if take off
these bonds on the top, but

748
00:38:15 --> 00:38:18
it depends on what the
starting geometries were.

749
00:38:18 --> 00:38:20
And so you will go with
your starting geometry,

750
00:38:20 --> 00:38:22
if it was 109 .
 

751
00:38:22 --> 00:38:23
5, it'll be less than that.
 

752
00:38:23 --> 00:38:26
If it's 120, then
it's less than that.

753
00:38:26 --> 00:38:28
PROFESSOR: So, this is a good
case of where, even when you

754
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
have the geometry the same, you
need to think about how many

755
00:38:30 --> 00:38:32
lone pairs you're dealing with
in your molecule, and think

756
00:38:32 --> 00:38:35
about what would the geometry
be if I just pictured those

757
00:38:35 --> 00:38:38
lone pairs in there as bonds
and then push them even closer

758
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
together so that it's less
than that actual angle.

759
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
OK, let's talk about a x
4 e, and that is what we

760
00:38:47 --> 00:38:49
call the seesaw shape.
 

761
00:38:49 --> 00:38:54
PROFESSOR: And so, what
difference in angles

762
00:38:54 --> 00:38:55
are you going to have?
 

763
00:38:55 --> 00:38:58
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

764
00:38:58 --> 00:38:58
PROFESSOR: Yup.
 

765
00:38:58 --> 00:39:02
PROFESSOR 2: So, two sets
again, one is less than

766
00:39:02 --> 00:39:05
120, and one is going
to be less than 90.

767
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
So, let's look at a x 3 e 2,
you'll notice there's a lot

768
00:39:09 --> 00:39:11
more combinations we can get
to once we're talking

769
00:39:11 --> 00:39:13
about lone pairs.
 

770
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
This is called T-shaped, and we
had briefly discussed that but

771
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
not mention what the
angles would be.

772
00:39:21 --> 00:39:22
PROFESSOR: So, what angle
would you have here?

773
00:39:22 --> 00:39:25
Yup.
 

774
00:39:25 --> 00:39:26
PROFESSOR: All right, great.
 

775
00:39:26 --> 00:39:28
Less than 90 degrees.
 

776
00:39:28 --> 00:39:34
So, we'll start a new page here
and talk about a x 2 e 3,

777
00:39:34 --> 00:39:41
and we'll let you tell us
what this geometry is.

778
00:39:41 --> 00:39:44
Yup, so I hear a lot
of linear out there.

779
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
And you need to keep in mind we
give the names based on where

780
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
the actual bonds are, not where
the lone pairs are, even though

781
00:39:50 --> 00:39:52
the lone pairs, of course,
affect the structure

782
00:39:52 --> 00:39:54
in the geometry.
 

783
00:39:54 --> 00:39:56
PROFESSOR: The angle?
 

784
00:39:56 --> 00:39:58
STUDENT: 180.
 

785
00:39:58 --> 00:39:58
PROFESSOR: Yup, 180.
 

786
00:39:58 --> 00:40:02
PROFESSOR: So, it's exactly
180 here, not less than.

787
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
PROFESSOR: So, for a x 5
e, what we have here is

788
00:40:08 --> 00:40:09
called square pyramidal.
 

789
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
This is square because of the
four square at the bottom of

790
00:40:13 --> 00:40:16
your pyramid, then you can
picture the pyramid as

791
00:40:16 --> 00:40:17
you go to the top.
 

792
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
PROFESSOR: And so what
angles would you have here?

793
00:40:21 --> 00:40:22
Yup, less than 90.
 

794
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
PROFESSOR: So, less
than 90, great.

795
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
All right, there are more.
 

796
00:40:32 --> 00:40:35
So, our next combination that
we can think about is if we

797
00:40:35 --> 00:40:40
have four bonded atoms and two
lone pairs, a x 4 e 2, that's

798
00:40:40 --> 00:40:42
going to be called
square planar.

799
00:40:42 --> 00:40:47
PROFESSOR: So, again, we have
square and it's planar.

800
00:40:47 --> 00:40:49
And so what are
your angles here?

801
00:40:49 --> 00:40:51
Yup, exactly 90.
 

802
00:40:51 --> 00:40:58
PROFESSOR: So next let's
look at a x 3 e 3.

803
00:40:58 --> 00:41:01
This is what we call T-shape,
this is also T-shape.

804
00:41:01 --> 00:41:08
PROFESSOR: And angle here?
 

805
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
PROFESSOR: Yup, I think
we heard less than, it's

806
00:41:12 --> 00:41:14
less than 90 degrees.
 

807
00:41:14 --> 00:41:20
And let's look at a x 2 e 4,
and again, you guys can tell

808
00:41:20 --> 00:41:24
us what this geometry
is, first of all.

809
00:41:24 --> 00:41:25
Yup, it's linear.
 

810
00:41:25 --> 00:41:28
So, we have lots of different
ways we can get to a linear

811
00:41:28 --> 00:41:29
molecule, some of which have
lots of lone pairs, some of

812
00:41:29 --> 00:41:31
which have no lone
pairs at all.

813
00:41:31 --> 00:41:37
This is linear and
a 180 degrees.

814
00:41:37 --> 00:41:37
All right.
 

815
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
So we'll do just a few examples
to show you some actual

816
00:41:41 --> 00:41:42
molecules that have
these geometries.

817
00:41:42 --> 00:41:45
We won't go through all of
them, because as we saw,

818
00:41:45 --> 00:41:47
there's lots of different
combinations we can have

819
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
once we start getting
into lone pairs.

820
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
The first we'll look at is
water here, and water is a good

821
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
one to look at because we had
seen that at the beginning of

822
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
class here when we were talking
about all polar molecules.

823
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
When we talk about the formula
type of water, what when you

824
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
say the formula type is?
 

825
00:42:07 --> 00:42:09
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

826
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
PROFESSOR: A x 2 e
2, that's correct.

827
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
And what is the
geometry of water?

828
00:42:14 --> 00:42:16
It's bent.
 

829
00:42:16 --> 00:42:19
So what we saw at the beginning
of class is water is bent and

830
00:42:19 --> 00:42:21
now you can see why and should
be able to predict

831
00:42:21 --> 00:42:22
that yourself.
 

832
00:42:22 --> 00:42:25
I just want to mention that if
you look, and depending on the

833
00:42:25 --> 00:42:28
edition of the book you have,
in one edition it's called

834
00:42:28 --> 00:42:30
bent, in the other edition
it's called angular.

835
00:42:30 --> 00:42:34
We'll call it bent, but just
remember that bent and angular,

836
00:42:34 --> 00:42:37
they're the same geometry.
 

837
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
Let's look at another
example, s f 4.

838
00:42:41 --> 00:42:43
And here it is drawn here.
 

839
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
What is the formula
type for s f 4?

840
00:42:49 --> 00:42:52
I think I heard it, a x 4 e.
 

841
00:42:52 --> 00:42:55
And the geometry?
 

842
00:42:55 --> 00:42:56
Seesaw, good.
 

843
00:42:56 --> 00:42:59
All right, we never get
seesaw wrong, that's

844
00:42:59 --> 00:43:02
the easy give-away one.
 

845
00:43:02 --> 00:43:05
All right, what about b r f 3?
 

846
00:43:05 --> 00:43:08
This is the shape here.
 

847
00:43:08 --> 00:43:13
What is the geometry for b f
3 -- the original geometry,

848
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
not the new geometry here?
 

849
00:43:17 --> 00:43:18
What was that?
 

850
00:43:18 --> 00:43:19
STUDENT: T.
 

851
00:43:19 --> 00:43:21
PROFESSOR: T-shaped,
that's right.

852
00:43:21 --> 00:43:30
B f 3 is T-shaped.
 

853
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
All right, so let's
look at xenon f 2.

854
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
That's going to have a formula
type of a x 2 e 3, if

855
00:43:39 --> 00:43:43
we actually look at the
Lewis structure here.

856
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
So if you think about what the
geometry is, and you should

857
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
just be able to look at this
and see, what would you say

858
00:43:49 --> 00:43:52
the geometry of xenon f 2 is?
 

859
00:43:52 --> 00:43:53
STUDENT: Linear.
 

860
00:43:53 --> 00:43:55
PROFESSOR: Linear, good.
 

861
00:43:55 --> 00:43:55
All right.
 

862
00:43:55 --> 00:44:01
And let's try one more here,
which is a x 4 e 2, or a

863
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
xenon f 4 -- very explosive,
but a good example.

864
00:44:06 --> 00:44:08
STUDENT: Square planar.
 

865
00:44:08 --> 00:44:10
PROFESSOR: Square planar,
all right, great.

866
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
So, in general, when we think
about vsper theory, even though

867
00:44:14 --> 00:44:18
it doesn't talk about or tell
us anything about the energies

868
00:44:18 --> 00:44:21
of these different shapes, it's
very useful in making a first

869
00:44:21 --> 00:44:24
approximation and coming very
close to thinking about what

870
00:44:24 --> 00:44:26
the actual shapes
of molecules are.

871
00:44:26 --> 00:44:28
So one thing I want to point
out in terms of what you're

872
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
responsible for is you should
be able to fill out one of

873
00:44:32 --> 00:44:37
these charts with only seeing
the labels up here -- tell us

874
00:44:37 --> 00:44:40
the formula type, tell us the
steric number, tell us the

875
00:44:40 --> 00:44:43
geometry, you should be able to
draw the Lewis structure, you

876
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47
already know how to do that,
and also talk about the angles.

877
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
So, as you finish up your
problem-set, you can, I

878
00:44:50 --> 00:44:53
think now, get through
just about all of it.

879
00:44:53 --> 00:44:55
You can do now this part
with the geometry.

880
00:44:55 --> 00:44:57
So, we'll see you on Wednesday
-- we're going to get out

881
00:44:57 --> 00:44:59
a little bit early today.
