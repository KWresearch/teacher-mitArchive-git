PROFESSOR: OK, we have the clicker question up. We're going to have another 
clicker competition today. The defending champs, there's Darcy's recitation. So, OK, 
let's just take 10 more seconds on this. OK, not too bad, 74%. 

So, in this problem, the trick was just to look at the equation and figure out what's 
going on -- which element is being reduced, and which one is being oxidized. So this 
is something that you will be seeing on the upcoming exam. So we're going to talk 
about that in a few minutes, but first I want to answer the question from last time. 

So, first, let's just, I know you've all been wondering about how vitamin B12 is 
reduced in the body. So, let's take a look at this now. So, if everyone can quiet 
down, let's get started. So, vitamin B12 is reduced by a protein that's called 
flavodoxin. And flavodoxin is a protein that has a cofactor which is a flavin, and 
that's also a vitamin B, as it turns out, they're both vitamin B's. So, vitamin B12 has 
a redox potential or a standard reduction potential of minus 0 . 5 2 6 volts, and that 
is a very low number for a biological system. And flavodoxin has a potential of minus 
0. 2 3 volts. So, which of these things is a better reducing agent? So, which thing, 
you want to think about reducing agent, which thing would prefer to be oxidized and 
reduce something else? So, with the low negative number, B12 is a better reducing 
agent than flavodoxin, and just based on these numbers, vitamin B12 should be 
reducing flavodoxin, not the other way around. So, how does this work then? 

So, in your body right now, you have a version of a flavodoxin protein, and you of 
vitamin B12 attached to an enzyme, methionine synthase, and for that to be 
activated, it needs to be reduced. So how is this happening? So, let's consider 
whether the reduction of B12 by flavodoxin is spontaneous. It happens in your body 
so one might think that it is. But let's look at that. 

So, we can look at it the same way you've looked at all the other systems, we're 
talking about batteries, electric chemical cells -- you can use the same equations if 
it's a biological system as you can for any other system. So we've seen this equation 
before. We've calculated changes in the standard reduction potential for a cell, and 
we talked about e nought for reduction minus the e nought for oxidation, and we can 
use that same equation. So we can put it in in the biological context. The vitamin 
B12 is the thing that's being reduced, and the flavodoxin is the thing that's being 
oxidized, that's the reaction that happens. So, we can plug those values in. So we 
have minus 0 . 5 2 6 volts, minus a negative 0 . 2 3 volts, and if you put those 
together, you get minus 0 . 2 9 6 volts. So is that going to be a spontaneous 
reaction? No, it's not going to be. Your value for the e is negative, which means what 
is true about delta g? Positive, so it won't be spontaneous. 

So, let's figure out how not spontaneous it's going to be. How much trouble are we 
all in? So we can use again, the same equation that we used for batteries that we've 
used in this course -- just because it's a biological system, doesn't mean the 
equation doesn't hold. So our equation for delta g nought minus n, the number of 
moles of electrons times Faraday's constant times the change in the standard 
potential. So we can plug it in. I can tell you it's a one electron process -- flavodoxin 
puts one electron into vitamin B12, so we have minus 1 times Faraday's constant 
times the cell potential difference you just measured, which is minus 0 . 2 9 6, and if 
you multiply those out, then you get 28 . 6 kilojoules per mole positive. That is a 
very big value -- that's not spontaneous and it's not a small number for a biological 
system. 

So, why don't we all have heart disease and megaloblastic anemia? Those are 
problems associated when this particular enzyme is not functioning. So, what 
happens in this system is what happens in a number of biological systems. How do 
you drive something forward that is not spontaneous? And what you can do is put 
energy into the system to drive that non-spontaneous reaction. And in this case, the 
energy that's put into the system is from a molecule called s adenosylmethionine. 
And the cleavage of s adenosylmethionine has a delta g nought of negative 37 . 6 
kilojoules per mole. So it's more favorable than the reduction of B12 is unfavorable, 
and so this drives this system. So, s adenosylmethionine is your friend, it helps in 
the body for B12 to be reduced so that you can function and be healthy. 

So, many biological systems work like this. So what have we been calling something, 
a cell, in which an unfavorable reaction is driven by applying some kind of energy or 
current, what do we call that? Two types of cells we mentioned. One that has a 
favorable, it has a spontaneous reaction. A cell that has a spontaneous reaction is 
called what? Galvanic. And the other kind is called? Yup. So, electrolitic cell. So this 
is sort of the biological equivalent of an electrolitic cell where you have s 
adenosylmethionine cleavage coupled to an unfavorable reaction to drive that 
reduction of B12 by flavodoxin. And B12 has such a low potential, that there really 
isn't anything else that can reduce it. It has one of the lowest potentials known in a 
biological system, so nature said, OK, well, we're not going to make something with 
a lower potential to do this chemistry, we'll have something else with a higher 
potential, but will drive the reaction because it's going to be non-spontaneous. So 
that's how this works. 

So, today there's a long list of topics, all of these are pretty short and basically 
constitute the introductory material in this unit. And we've jumped ahead, this is in 
chapter 16. 

So, I really like transition metals, because I am a fan of metals that are involved in 
biological systems. So, I just thought as part of chemistry, I just want to sort of 
review the kind of basic areas of chemistry for a minute. This is not in your handout, 
but just so you sort of think about what are all parts of chemistry. There is organic 
chemistry -- does anyone know what organic chemistry concerns itself with? Carbon. 
And then what we have known as inorganic chemistry. Anyone know what that is? 
Not carbon. 

So, a lot of people who are inorganic chemists study transition metals, but it's 
basically other things besides carbon. And then one of the areas that I like is 
bioinorganic chemistry, and these are people who study metals in biology. So, people 

who study metals in biology, and we're also kind of referred to as, we're sort of in a 
club, which we call the MIB. So, some of you -- and Will Smith did a disservice --
people now associate this with hunting aliens, but in fact, people who are in MIB are 
associated with hunting for metal ions in biological cells. So this is sort of the true 
MIB. And in an honor of this discussion today, I am wearing a teeshirt from one of 
our meetings. This is from the International Congress on Bioinorganic Chemistry, 
which we refer to as ICBIC. And you notice that the clever people who made this 
teeshirt used the B from the bioinorganic to make B12, which is a very popular 
vitamin in the bioinorganic community. 

So, metals in biology. Carbon, carbon's a good thing, amino acids are good, I like 
proteins. But often, when you take a metal and attach it to a protein, that protein 
can do really cool chemistry -- really need oxidation reduction chemistry. So, here is 
part of the periodic table that includes many of these transition metals that we're 
going to be talking about. And things that are in orange here are metals that are 
very important biologically. Some of the things that are in grey here are metals that 
are used as probes or as drugs in biological systems, and some could be both. So, 
when you add a metal to a protein you can do cool stuff. What can you do? Well, you 
can split nitrogen. You learned that the triple bond of nitrogen is pretty hard to 
break, but metals in proteins can do it. You've heard of hydrogen fuel cells and 
things like that. There's a protein called hydrogenase that uses metals to do 
chemistry with hydrogen. You could you radical based chemistry. You can do a lot of 
really great things when you have a protein that has a metal in it. 

So, let me introduce you to some of the concepts and terminology involved in this, 
so we're going to have a metal and the metal's going to be bound to stuff. So, one of 
the great features of transition metals is their ability to form complexes with small 
molecules or ions. They also, this applies to a protein system in the case that instead 
of small molecules, you have amino acids of proteins it can also form complexes 
with. 

So, the way that they do this is metals have often, they can attract electron density, 
usually a lone pair of electrons from another atom, and so they can form what are 
called these coordination complexes. So, now we're going to review for a minute, 
donor atoms, they're called ligands, and we can think about something that we 
learned when we talked about acids and bases, our more broad definition. So, donor 
atoms are ligands, and ligands are what? Lewis acids or Lewis bases, and what do 
they do? OK, let's just take 10 more seconds. 

So most of you thought donor atoms -- the answers that had donate electrons did 
better, so that was good reading of the question, but they are Lewis bases. So Lewis 
bases donate electron pairs. So, here's some examples that you will see of ligands 
that we'll be talking about in this unit. You will become very familiar with some of 
these as you work problems. So they're typically donating one lone pair of electrons. 

So, acceptor atoms are the transition metals themselves, and so the transition 
metals are acting as Lewis acids, and so then they would be accepting those lone 
pairs of electrons. So, you can think about coordination complexes as Lewis acids 
and Lewis bases, or acceptor atoms and donor ligands or donor atoms. So here are 
some examples of transition metals that we're going to see, so it's that sort of d-
block of the periodic table that we'll become very familiar with in this unit. 

So, then when you take your acceptor atom and your donor atom and you put them 
together, you get what is known as coordination complexes. So, coordination 
complex is just the metal or the Lewis acid surrounded by the ligands, or the Lewis 
bases or the donor atoms. 

And here is an example of a coordination complex. We have metal, we have cobalt in 
the middle, and it's surrounded by a series of ligands, and these are n h 3 ligands. 
And so then our cobalt in the center, our metal, is the Lewis acid, and it's going to be 
the acceptor atom. And the n h 3 groups are our Lewis bases, they're donor atoms, 
see it's written with those two electrons there, that they're sharing their electrons 
with the cobalt forming this coordination complex. And in this scheme, we have the 
bonds are just these straight lines are in the plane, the thick bonds coming out are 
coming out toward you, and the dashed lines going back are going back into the 
screen here. 

So, let's talk about a couple of definitions here. We have something called 
coordination number or CN number, and this is simply the number of ligands bonded 
to the metal. So the number is six, there is six ligands. Typically, the numbers will 
range for these coordination complexes to two to 12, with six being the most 
common. So, here is some notation. If you see this picture, you should be able to 
write a notation for it. And within a bracket, you would write cobalt, and then you 
have your n h 3, six of them, so you put that in a bracket and indicate that there's 
six n h 3 groups. Then you have this overall bracket here with a charge up above. 
And so over here, we have this little bracket plus 3, that means that this whole 
coordination complex has a charge of plus 3. Because it has a positive charge, 
sometimes coordination complexes are associated with counter ions. So, you might 
see three chloride minus 1 ions around to counter that charge. And if you did, you 
would see the three chlorides on the outside of the bracket. So things inside of the 
bracket are actually coordinated to the metal, things outside the bracket are counter 
ions. And so that would be how you would translate that particular notation. 

All right, so, we're back to geometry again. As I said, everything you learn in this 
course, we're going to use again. So, if you're forgetting some material from units 1 
and 2, this would be a good time to review those. So, if we have this coordination 
number of six things around, what kind of geometry are we going to have? All right, 
10 seconds. 

Yup, so we have octahedral geometry. And here is an example of our octahedral 
geometry. So, let's just quickly run through the rest of these. You can yell out the 
answers, either looking at your handout or not looking at your handout. The next 
one over here, what is it? Right, trigonal bipyramidal. For a c n number of five, we 
have another option shown over here, what's that one called? Square pyramidal. For 
c n numbers of four, there's two things that you'll commonly see, what's the first one 
called? Square planar. The second one? Tetrahedral. For c n number of three, what's 
that geometry called? Trigonal planar. And c n of two, only one option. Linear. All 
right, so let's just review the angles as well, those are not in your handouts, but you 
can yell those out as well. So what angle do we have in an octahedral system? 90. 
There are two angles involved if we have trigonal bipyramidal. What's the angle from 
the axial to the equatorial? 

STUDENT: 90. 

PROFESSOR: And what's the angle from one equatorial atom to another equatorial 
atom? So, we have 90 and 120. What about in our square pyramidal system, what 
are the angles here? 90. What about square planar? 90. Tetrahedral? Let's try that 
again with more enthusiasm. Awesome, 109 . 5. Trigonal planar? 120. And finally, 
linear. 180. 

So, we're going to use this information again in this unit, and of course, it'll be on 
the final when we're talking about Lewis structures and hybridization and other 
things as well. So this comes back in several times, vsper theory, you have this 
several times. 

OK. So, another term that you hear a lot when people are talking about coordination 
complexes is what's called the chelate effect. So, ligands that bind to a metal at one 
point are called unidentate or monodentate, and that's from dent, which is tooth, so 
one tooth. Now, if a ligand attaches with two or more points of attachment, it can be 
called a chelating ligand. And this comes from the Greek, chele is claw. So, if it's 
attaching with more than one point of attachment, if the ligand is grabbing on, it's 
like a claw and that's called a chelate. So, if you have two points of attachment, 
that's called bidentate. And even if you've never had a unit on transition metals 
before, I bet that you can answer this without me even telling you. What do you 
think tridentate might be? Three. Tetradentate? Four. Hexadentate? Six. So 
sometimes this would be a little question on the final. Please don't get this wrong, 
this is my gift to you, right, you knew it even before I taught it. So, this should be 
something that you can definitely get a couple extra points on on the final. 

All right, so, chelates bind with more than one point of attachment, and metal 
chelates are unusually stable. And this property is due to favorable and tropic factor, 
so we're back to entropy, we're back to thermodynamics. And this has to do with the 
fact that when a chelate binds a metal, it releases a lot of water, and that makes the 
chelate pretty stable. 

So, let me give you some examples of chelates, and then we're going to come back 
and think about the chelate effect again. Of course, you knew it, vitamin B12 has a 
chelating ligand associated with it. So, cobalt is in the middle of vitamin B12, and it 
has a ring system around it. And the ring system has these nitrogens, the nitrogens 
are the donor ligands to the cobalt, and so this ring system is attaching at four 
points, so it's a tetradentate ligand. There's also two other ligands attached to 
vitamin B12, there's an upper ligand shown here, which is 5 prime deoxyadenosine, 
and a bottom ligand, which is a dimethylbenzamitisol ligand. 

So, let's take a look, this is the cartoon, but let's look at another model for this here. 
So, we have a ring system, we have this upper ligand, and then a lower ligand down 
here. And so, the middle ring system is a tetradentate chelate. Overall, at the cobalt 
metal, what is the geometry of this system? It's octahedral, right. So we have this 
sort of square, the middle part is square planar, but the two upper and lower ligands 
make the whole thing an octahedral system. So this is an example of a naturally 
occurring chelated complex. 

So, this structure is actually fairly complicated for a vitamin. It's one of the most 
complex vitamins that's known, and I thought I'd just mention just a moment of 
history. So, this structure was determined by Dorothy Hodgkin who was a 
crystalographer in England. And she started working on this in the late 1940's, and 
people told her she was crazy, that something this large could never be solved by 

these x-ray defraction techniques. And, of course, now people are solving today's 
structures of things like the ribosomes. So, we've come a long way with 
crystallography. But she was one of the first true believers that x-ray crystallography 
was a powerful technique. And so, she went ahead, despite what everyone said, and 
determined this structure. And for this work and for some other things, she was 
awarded a Nobel Prize. So, this was a really significant contribution in the early 
1950's and late 1940's. She had graduate students that she inspired. Some of them 
went on to become famous crystalographers. Other ones were not so successful --
crystallography's hard and it's not for everyone. 

She was actually known also, Dorothy was, for her work in the third world and her 
liberal politics, but one of her graduate students did not agree with her politics, but 
they were still friends. So this is just a message that as you go through your career, 
Margaret Thatcher who is a graduate student of Dorothy Hodgkins, couldn't quite cut 
it as a crystalographer, but for some people, you haven't found your true thing, and 
she was able to find another job, so I'm told. So, just remember that if you're not 
good at one thing, there's something else out there that you might be good at. 

So, let me give you a second example of a chelate. This molecule is known as EDTA. 
So this ligand has six points that it can attach to a metal. So, it is six atoms the can 
serve as these donor ligands. So, we have one up here, have the little electrons and 
the oxygen, another oxygen down here, nitrogen, nitrogen, another oxygen, another 
oxygen. So all of those six points can coordinate to a metal. 

So here again is the free EDTA, and here's a structure of EDTA bound to a metal, the 
metal is abbreviated m. So, why don't you tell me what the geometry is of that 
metal? All right, let's take only 10 more seconds. Hoping for 90, we're getting close, 
maybe by the end of today. 

All right, yeah, so it's octahedral geometry. So we have upper ligands and a lower 
ligand, two ligands coming out, two ligands going back, and it's also a hexadentate 
complex. So we see we're coordinated with the oxygen in red, nitrogen in blue, 
around to the other nitrogen in blue, another nitrogen in purple, another nitrogen up 
here in green and in blue. 

So, EDTA, when EDTA binds to a metal, it forms a very stable metal complex. And 
the reason for this is that chelate effect, and it's entropy. So if we look, metals are 
often coordinated by waters if they're just is solution. But if you bind one molecule of 
EDTA to the metal, it'll take all of those six sites, displacing all of these six waters. 
So here, on this side, you have one thing free in solution, and over here you have six 
things that are free. So that's entrotropically favorable, you have more entropy when 
you have lots of more free things floating around. So this has greater entropy. 

So, the chelate effect, then, has to do with entropic effect, that when you're binding 
a metal with multiple points of attachments, it's releasing water. So these are very 
stable. And so, because of this stability, they have a lot of important uses. What is 
one use you can think of that you might have for such a thing? When might you 
want to chelate a metal out -- get metal out of something pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah, 
you can purify out a metal out of water with this. What about rushing to the 
emergency room with something? Yeah, lead poisoning, yup. So, sometimes you 
might want to just purify your water, you might be happy with that, other times you 
might really want to have that metal out. So, every emergency room in the United 

States, and probably mostly around the world, will have EDTA on hand in case 
someone comes in with lead poisoning. 

Do you know who's at the most risk for lead poisoning, at least in this country? Kids. 
And what do they do they gives them lead poisoning? Lead paint, yeah. So, I don't 
know, most of you are probably living on campus, but if any of you move off 
campus, and some people who are living maybe across the river in fraternity houses, 
those buildings are old and they have had lead paint in at some point or another. So 
this is a big problem, actually, in the Boston area. So, if you have any toddlers 
visiting you, you might want to make sure they're not eating paint chips off any 
window sill or anything like that. Or if you do, have some EDTA on hand. 

All right, one other thing, some of you, once you start studying chemistry, it's always 
fun/scary to start reading the ingredients on food packages. But you will discover 
that some food that you eat will say as an ingredient EDTA added for freshness. So, 
bacteria and fungi and things like that need metals for growth, metals are very 
important for life, and so you add a little EDTA and it prevents things from growing 
on your food. So that's added for freshness. So you'll see it in food. 

Another use that occasionally I find MIT students are not as familiar with is in 
cleaning bathtubs, so you want to chelate out the calcium in tub scum, and that's a 
good use for EDTA. 

So, I always like to mention how freshman chemistry information can make you a lot 
of money. So, I thought I'd tell you a little story about a man named Robert Black. 
So one day, I think it might have been a little before Thanksgiving, Mrs. Robert 
Black, I don't know her first name, said to her husband, "We're having company, 
how about you go clean the bathtub?" Apparently, Robert Black's wife had never 
mentioned this to him before, and he had, in fact, never cleaned a bathtub. Also, I 
think that Robert Black's wife was tired of cleaning the bathtub, and perhaps, had 
not done it for, say, a very long time. So, Robert Black went in there and tried to 
scrub off the scum, and it was actually really challenging and he was very 
frustrating, and he said, "I never want to do that again." 

So, he went and developed a product, a shower cleaner, that had all the ingredients 
of the shower cleaners he was using, except that he advertised it slightly differently, 
and he said "Every time you shower, just spray a little bit on and you'll never have to 
really scrub again." because this will take care of it and avoid scrubbing in the future, 
so a little bit of spraying after each shower avoids these problems. And the 
ingredients he had in were all typical ingredients, including chelating agents. You 
need a surfactant to break up the water beads, and alcohol to get rid of the oily 
stuff, and the chelating agent for the calcium in the tub scum. And the one he 
actually used is EDTA. 

So, as a result of a wife saying to her husband, it's your turn to clean the tub, they 
now make $70 million dollars annually. So, I think this is a lesson that we can learn 
in many ways that cleaning the tub is something that everyone should do at some 
point in their life, and that the simple things you learn in freshman chemistry can, if 
applied correctly, make you a lot of money. And I just want to encourage you, again, 
that anything that I teach you that you use to make a lot of money, I'll remind you 
that I am perfectly willing to have a cut of any of that. So, just something to keep in 
mind. 

So, one more thing that you might have heard for EDTA. Have any of you heard, 
perhaps, maybe watching television or a movie, about a use for EDTA? Have any of 
you, perhaps, seen a movie called Blade? How many of you have seen this? Not very 
many people. Hmm, I think we're going to have a separate course in vampire movies 
and TV. Anyway, Blade fights vampires, and they have a special gun, and the special 
gun has cartridges -- cartridges are shown here. And the cartridges have in them --
anyone want to guess? EDTA, yes. And the idea behind it, if you shoot at a vampire, 
the vampire turns instantaneously to dust, and the idea behind it is that vampires 
drink blood, blood has what in it? Iron. What chelates iron? EDTA. And, therefore, if 
you chelate the iron out of blood, and a vampire's mostly blood, it just 
instantaneously turns to dust. So, actually, as chemistry goes, it's kind of cool, yeah. 
So, that's the final use that I am aware of for EDTA. Some of you may encounter 
some more. 

All right, so coordination complexes. Some of them can have isomers. They can have 
geometric isomers. And geometric isomers can have vastly different properties. And 
if you're interested in biochemistry, this is something that you'll be interested in, 
because this can be very important in biological systems. 

So, let me tell you about a coordination complex that has platinum at the center, it 
has two ammonia ligands and two chloride ligands, and it has two ways that you can 
do it. So, you can either put the ammonia ligands on different sides or you can put 
them on the same side. So, here we have two nitrogen ligands over here, and I have 
these here. So, on one side, you have the two nitrogen ligands, on the other side 
two chlorides, or we can have a transarrangement where they're across from each 
other. So you see, there's 2 different ways to do it, on the same side or sort of 
across. So, cis or trans. Cisplatin is a potent anti-cancer drug, transplatin has no use 
that anyone's been able to detect. So it's the exact same composition, but a different 
arrangement of the atoms coordinated to the central metal. 

So, why should it make a difference, they have the same ingredients, why should 
one be a potent anti-cancer drug and the other one be useless? Well, it's because of 
how it interacts in the body. And so, one of the people who have spent a lot of their 
career studying cisplatin is Professor Steve Lippard, who's in the Chemistry 
Department here, and he has determined x-ray structures looking at this, and done 
a number of other studies. And so, here is a little cartoon of cisplatin bound to DNA, 
so the chlorides are displaced when it binds, and so they need to be on the same 
side, otherwise it's not going to work. And when cisplatin binds to DNA, then this will 
act to kill the cancer cells. 

So, the chlorides both need to be on the same side so a combined DNA. If they're on 
other sides, that's not going to interact with DNA, and so it doesn't have any known 
function. So, geometric isomers, same composition, but in different arrangements 
can have vastly different properties. 

So you can have what are called optical isomers or enantiomers, and so these can 
our mirror images of each other, but they're not superimposable. And so, when you 
have a mirror image like this, it's called a chiral molecule, and this is a term that 
you'll hear a lot when you take organic chemistry. 

So, I have two mirror images up here, so these are mirror images, so the mirror 
plane is between these molecules. But these molecules may look the same in the 
mirror, but they're non-superimposable. So, they are, in fact, different molecules, 

and they can have different properties in a chiral environment. What do I mean by a 
chiral environment? Well, the human body, for example, is a chiral environment. So 
that's why a lot of drugs, people are wanting to make just one enantimer of the drug 
and not the other, one enantiomer can have good properties, the other one may not. 

All right, so let's do some d-electron counting. This is the final thing we need to talk 
about in coordination complexes. So we're going to refer to a thing called the d-
electron count of the metal, which just has to do with a group number from the 
periodic table minus the oxidation number of the metal, is going to tell us the d-
electron count. So, if you haven't learned how to do oxidation numbers yet, you 
need to know that for exam 3, and you need to know that for this unit. 

So, let's look at a few examples of this, and we'll put up our friend, the periodic 
table. So let's look at the complex that we saw on the first page where we had -- in 
the beginning of today's lecture where we had cobalts with six n h 3 ligands in a 
coordination complex that had a charge of plus 3. So here, we need to figure out the 
oxidation number of the cobalt, and for this particular group, the overall charge of 
that is 0. We have three hydrogens at plus 1, and we also have a nitrogen at minus 
1. And so, overall that charge is 0. So we have six things of 0, and what does that 
leave for our cobalt charge? Plus 3. Because overall, it now has to equal plus 3. 

So, then our d count for our electrons is going to be the group number. And for 
cobalt, what's the group number? 9. So minus 3 is 6, so this cobalt in this complex is 
what's called a d 6 system. 

All right, let's look at a couple other examples here. Let's look at nickel with carbon 
monoxide ligands, four of them. What would nickel be in this case? Someone said 
zero. That's right. So this is zero, and nickel is zero, the overall charge is zero. So, 
our oxidation number here is 0. So, our d count here, what's the group number for 
nickel? 10. 10 minus is 10. So we have a d 10 system. 

So, I'm going to write another example down and you're going to tell me the answer 
to this one as a clicker question. So we have cobalt, two waters -- three waters --
that's actually a mistake. It should be two. Two waters, because it's going to be six 
things -- this is not some kind of bizzaro seven complex. So here's the correct, 
cobalt, two waters, one ammonia, and three chlorides with an overall charge of 
minus 1. All right, let's just take 10 seconds, since we're running out of time. 

So that's right, we should have a charge of plus 2 here. This is zero, minus 3, overall 
minus 1, so we have a plus 2 state. We have 9 minus 2, which is 7, and it's a d 7 
system.
