PROFESSOR: So, let's finish up new material today, new material Monday, and then 
we're done with the kinetics unit. So, we're going to talk about temperature, collision 
theory, and activated complex theory today.  
 
So on the first day, we talked about kinetics, we talked about factors affecting the 
rates, and this was in your handout on that first lecture, but just to kind of review for 
a minute what we have talked about so far and where we're going. So these are 
some of the things we came up with are factors affecting the rates of reaction. 
People said mechanism affects the rate of reaction, so we talked about mechanism. 
Concentration of material, nature of material -- that pretty much fits in in every 
lecture. We've been talking some about that, say, if it's first order or second order, if 
you have a concentration term in there, or if you don't have a concentration term. 
The nature of the material, we're going to talk more about that today. Temperature 
is going to be the number one topic for today, and on Monday the number one topic 
is the use of catalysts to speed up reactions. So, by Monday we'll be done with this 
list.  
 
So, what about temperature. So temperature, when I said what affects the rate of 
reaction, temperature was one of the things that you yelled out at me, and that's 
very much true, it has one of the biggest effects on the rate of reactions. So when 
we were talking about the gas phase, there was an observation made that the 
reaction rates tend to increase as the temperature increases. And most of you can 
think about this and are aware of it, and today we're going to talk more about the 
quantitative affect of this, how much does the rate of a reaction increase when the 
temperature increases, how do you know what equation do you use.  
 
So, this idea has been around for awhile. So in 1889, Arrhenius plotted rate 
constants versus temperature, and he found that if he plotted the natural log of 
those rate constants versus inverse temperature, then he would get a straight line. 
So let's look at the plot that he had. So, he found that if he plotted natural log of the 
rate constants versus 1 over temperature, so units or kelvin to the minus 1, that he 
got a straight line. Which means that the rate constants are varying exponentially 
with inverse temperature. So you have to use a natural log to get a straight line, if 
you don't use natural log, you wouldn't get a straight line here.  
 
So, let's look at some of these terms that we have here, and here's our equation for 
the straight line, the natural log of k equals minus e a -- e a is activation energy, 
which we're going to talk a lot about today -- over r t, r is our friend the gas 
constant, and t is temperature, plus natural log of a. So what is a? A is called factor 

a or sometimes it's called pre-exponential factor, and had has the same units as k, k 
being the rate constant.  
 
So, let's think about this equation and this plot, and about factor A and this other 
term, activation energy. So, factor A and activation energy depend on the reaction 
being studied. So, it depends on the nature of the materials involved. So I said we'd 
talk again about nature of the material. So one kind of reaction's going to have one 
activation energy, another one will have a different one.  
 
So, let's think about this term, factor A. What is it exactly? Do you think it would be 
temperature dependent? What do you think? How many people think yes, it would be 
temperature dependent? How many people think no? Some people are not going to 
commit. The answer is no. So, let's think about what factor A is. So, factor A is the 
rate constant at some really, really large temperature. So, if we look at this plot, the 
natural log of k equals the natural log of A, or k equals A if you're along this axis 
here. If you're along that axis here, that's at zero, so that's when 1 over 
temperature equals zero, then the rate constant equals factor A. What would be true 
about the temperature for 1 over temperature to equal zero? Very big. So, at the 
biggest, hugest temperature you can imagine, the rate constant's going to equal A. 
And so, factor A depends on the nature of the material being studied and you would 
have to determine what that value is. But it's definitely not temperature dependent. 
It's the value of the rate constant at an enormous temperature.  
 
So, what about activation energy? Do you think that's temperature dependent? Why 
don't you tell me what you think. All right, let's take 10 more seconds.  
 
All right, so I'd like you to discuss this amongst yourselves and see whether you're 
happy with this answer. All right, go ahead and vote again. All right, 10 more 
seconds. And the correct answer is? So, I think most of you will remember this 
answer. So the activation energy is not temperature dependent. You can calculate 
what the activation energy is by plotting the rate constants versus 1 over 
temperature, and then you get it from the slope of the line. So, activation energy 
depends on the nature of the material, but it isn't temperature dependent. So, we're 
going to talk a lot more about that today.  
 
Before we leave this, I just want to say one thing about a clicker question. So, at the 
end of last time, we had our first repeat winner for a clicker competition. So, we 
thought that we might have an opportunity for recitations to see if they can -- if 
some other recitation can get a second win. So on Monday we're going to have our 
final clicker competition, and if somebody else does tie, one section, that we'll have a 
final one-time clicker question that'll be a run-off. And whatever recitation wins, we 
have special prizes for the members of that recitation. So that's on Monday. So you 
may want to review catalysis on Monday, if you feel that you're in the running for the 
grand champion clicker recitation.  
 
All right, so let's go back to this. So we found out that no, activation energy is not 
temperature dependent.  
 
All right, so what are you going to see on your equation sheet on the final, you may 
see a couple of different forms that are all equivalent to each other. So here is the 
plot of a straight line. It will often be written with just natural log of a and e a over r 
t terms reversed. So that's as a straight line, and this is often what you see for the 
Araneus equation. You can also get rid of the natural logs and have the term here 

exponential, so you have k equals factor A times e to the minus, activation energy 
divided by r t. So, those are the equations, they're all equivalent to each other that 
you might see on your equation sheet.  
 
So, it's also true that non-gases can exhibit this kind of behavior, and let me just 
give you one example of a non-gas that exhibits this kind of behavior and you tell 
me what this is. What is that? Crickets. So crickets exhibit Arrhenius behavior. They 
will chirp faster as the temperature gets hotter. So if you're out camping, sometimes 
it can be in the summer, it can be actually be quite deafening, and you were very 
happy to go back to the city where you only have ambulances and cars going, and 
you don't have this incredible racket at night. You can actually calculate what the 
temperature is by counting the number of chirps of the crickets and using a little 
equation. I think it's you count for 14 seconds and add 40 and that's the 
temperature in fahrenheit or something like that. So, not only gases do this kind of 
behavior.  
 
All right, so activation energy, we're going to be talking a lot about this today. So, 
what is it exactly. So let's think about two molecules coming together. So when two 
molecules come together, you have this bimolecular process going on, but every 
time two molecules come together, they're not going to go on and form a product. 
You're only going to form a product when those molecules have a critical amount of 
energy. When they have the energy which allows them to react, that activation 
energy. If they have enough energy when they come together, they will go on and 
form products. So, that's what activation energy is, it's this critical amount of energy 
that they need to react with each other.  
 
All right, so let's just think about what affects that critical amount of energy, and of 
course, temperature is going to be involved. So let's think about that. So if we have 
fraction of molecules on one side, and we have kinetic energy down here, let's think 
about how temperature is involved in this. So, at a low temperature, the fraction of 
molecules that are going to have enough energy to react is going to be less. And 
let's think about at a higher temperature, go like this, so this is high temperature, 
and we have low temperature up here. And then over here we would have our 
activation energy, the energy needed for a reaction. And you see, if you're at low 
temperature, only a small number of molecules are going to have enough energy to 
react, but if you're at higher temperature, a large number of molecules are going to 
have that critical energy to react. So, at low temperature, not many can react, at 
higher temperature, many more will have that energy -- will be able to overcome 
that activation energy, will have it and they can react.  
 
So, temperature plays a big role here. So we can use this idea of activation energy 
to predict a rate constant. Let's look at an example. So, often people have sucrose in 
their diet, and the hydrolysis of sucrose will form glucose and fructose as part of this 
digestive process. And we can think about the rates at which that would happen in 
the body. So normally, we're at 37 degrees, that's normal body temperature, and we 
have the observed rate constant for that is 1 . times 10 to the minus 3 per molar per 
second. But what happens if your body temperature is lowered, what happens if it 
was at 35 degrees, and to be able to answer that question, you need to know what 
the activation energy is for this process, and here it's 108 kilojoules per mole. So, we 
want to ask the question, what is the new rate constant at 35 degrees?  
 
So, we can take our Arrhenius equations, and we can put a 1 by the rate constant for 
temperature 1, and a 2 for the rate constant at temperature 2. Now we can combine 

these equations. Natural log of a cancels out, it's not temperature dependent so it 
doesn't stay in here. And so we can solve, we can subtract these two, or that's 
equivalent to dividing them, and so natural log of rate constant 2 over rate constant 
1 equals minus the activation energy over the gas constant times this temperature 
term. Does this look at all familiar? Does this look like some other equation you saw 
once upon a time? Do you remember what that equation was called? Van't Hoff 
equation, right. And there we were comparing what instead of rate constants? 
Equilibrium constants, and instead of e a, what term did we have here? Delta h, 
right. And it's good you remember that because we're going to come back to that at 
the end of today's class.  
 
So, we can use this equation and plug in the values. We put in our activation energy, 
and remember to pay attention to units, because if you're going to cancel your joules 
with a gas constant, you want to make sure you've converted your kilojoules to 
joules, and then we can plug everything in and solve for k 2.  
 
So, here k 2 is 7 . 6 times 10 to the minus 4 per molar per second, so it's slower. 
And this is one reason why it's really nice to have your body temperature stay the 
normal temperature. If you get too cold, your body processes, your enzymes are not 
functioning, everything is slowed down. And if you get too hot, that's not good 
either. So you really want to maintain it, and so for some of you who come to MIT 
from warmer climates, let me introduce you to the L.L. Bean catalog, they sell coats, 
they sell boots, and all sorts of things. So, this winter, when you come back for IAP, 
or for the term, you're well-prepared, and you don't have to prove that it's not good 
if your body temperature goes below 37 degrees.  
 
All right, let's think about what else this equation tells us, and the other thing it tells 
us is that if you have a very large activation energy, if this e a is a very, very big 
number, that means that your rate constants will be very sensitive to temperature. 
So if this is really, really big, there's going to be a big change in your rate constants 
as temperature changes. And keep that in mind, we're going to come back to that 
later.  
 
So, what do you think happens to the rate of an enzymatic reaction at liquid nitrogen 
temperatures? We looked at going from 37 degrees to 35, liquid nitrogen is pretty 
cold. So, not a whole lot happens at liquid nitrogen temperatures as far as enzymes 
go, and I'll just mention, so it slows way down, that this is a trick that I use in my 
research. So we have crystals of enzymes, and we can try to get structures in 
particular states by taking the crystals that have enzyme in it, and starting a 
reaction, and then dunking the crystals in liquid nitrogen to kind of stop it at a 
particular stage, and then you look at what the structure looks like. So that's one 
use.  
 
So, we're going to also take a look at other reactions, we don't have any enzymes 
here, but some other things, and look at what happens when we get things to be 
very cold.  
 
[EXPERIMENTING]  
 
So, Dr. Taylor is pouring out some liquid nitrogen.  
 
PROFESSOR: All right, so what we're going to look at is a reaction that we can see 
pretty easily here. Have any of you used glow sticks before, maybe trick or treating 

or some other point. So basically, you may or may not know how they work. There's 
two compartments in glow sticks that have two different chemicals in them, and 
they're trade secrets so we can't put them on the board. But basically, what we have 
here is a reaction. A lot of reactions we know give off heat, or they give infrared 
light. Here we have a reaction that gives off energy as visible light. So would you call 
this an endothermic or an exothermic reaction here? Yeah, so this is an exothermic 
reaction.  
 
So just as Professor Drennan was talking about with slowing down enzymatic 
reactions we can think about if we can slow down this reaction. So, we're just going 
to put it in the liquid nitrogen -- so, keep an eye on this, we'll do several controls of 
different colors here. So, see if an orange glow stick works the same. What we're 
looking to see is if we can slow down this reaction. What would we see if we slowed 
it down or even if we stopped it? Yeah, we're not going to see anymore color. So are 
you starting to see color loss in this first reaction here? So, we'll try green, and 
yellow. So, it looks like this first one might have stopped already, you see there's no 
color anymore here.  
 
What would you expect if this heated back up to room temperature? Yeah, so 
hopefully, if you just keep your eye on this, we'll continue on with the lecturing, 
because I don't know how long it will take for it to warm back up the room 
temperature. But keep an eye and we'll see if we get the temperature back high 
enough to see the glow again.  
 
And since we do have a liquid nitrogen here, it's too hard to resist freezing a flower. 
This has nothing to do with kinetics -- we can't even try that connection. But we will 
be freeze a flower. OK, she will try making -- good catharsis pre-exam.  
 
PROFESSOR: So, has anyone had liquid nitrogen applied to them? It's used in 
doctor's offices, if you want a little something removed perhaps, put a little liquid 
nitrogen on and burn it off. Good premed training for you. I think we're pretty frozen 
here.  
 
So it looks the same, but as you can see -- [INAUDIBLE] -- So I think that's all we 
can do [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE]  
 
PROFESSOR: So I actually heard something interesting on NPR about liquid nitrogen 
removing warts and things like that, and they were talking about how there was 
something that was actually better than liquid nitrogen for doing that. Did anyone 
hear the story about what the thing was that was better than liquid nitrogen?  
 
It was duct tape. And so some scientists had looked at what all the uses of duct tape 
are. And since most of you are planning on being scientists or engineers, duct tape 
will probably be an important part of your life in the future. And so, duct tape worked 
better than liquid nitrogen for removing warts. And they found that duct tape worked 
really well for a lot of things. There was only one thing they tried that it did not work 
well for. Anyone want to guess what that was? Repairing ducts, yes. Not really good 
-- there were many, many, many better ways to repair ducts than with duct tape, 
but I guess they decided that calling it wart removal tape was just not quite as 
catchy as duct tape, so it's still referred to as duct tape.  
 
OK, so when you lower the temperature, things tend to slow down. But if molecules 
are going to react, they need to have enough energy, they need to have a high 

enough temperature to overcome this activation energy. So that critical amount. So 
again, when the molecules come together, and let's just look at these for a minute, 
when they're coming together to react, and if they're going to react, there needs to 
be some energy associated with this, because you're probably going to have to break 
a bond, and that's going to take something, and then you may have to form a new 
bond, for example. So there needs to be a critical amount of energy, you need to be 
able to overcome that activation energy barrier for the molecules to react. So it 
always takes some energy for things to react and so you need to have enough 
energy.  
 
And so, if those molecules have that energy, they'll come together, react, and you'll 
form products. If they don't have that energy, they're just going to go back to what 
they were, unchanged reactants. So you need to have sufficient energy to overcome 
that activation energy barrier.  
 
So, this is just a little movie that shows two molecules coming together, and if they 
have enough energy to react, you will see a spark, and then the molecules will react. 
So, here we go. Molecule in red, in green, they're checking each other out. Do they 
have enough -- they had enough energy, and they reacted, and went on to product.  
 
All right, so let's talk about this activation energy barrier and these activated 
complexes. OK, so in this example, you have n o 2 plus c o, and they can come 
together and form n o plus c o 2. And that's going to take some amount of energy to 
react. And so, I'm drawing something that's called an activated energy diagram, and 
we have potential energy on one axis, and on the other we have what's called a 
reaction coordinate. And so, the reactants are going to have a certain amount of 
energy, so our reactants are going to have some amount of energy, and our 
products will have some amount of energy. But even though in this case the change, 
the products are lower in energy, and you have a delta e for the difference between 
the reactants and the products, they can't go directly to products. They have to 
overcome an activation energy barrier. So they have to overcome some kind of 
barrier before they can react.  
 
So, only ones that can overcome that barrier, that have enough energy to overcome 
this activation energy barrier, so the activation energy for the forward reaction, only 
those will be able to react. There's also an activation energy barrier for the reverse 
reaction on this side. So, if you go from products to reactants, you have to overcome 
that activation energy barrier. And up here, this is called the activated complex, so 
you have some kind of activated complex or transition state, so the molecules will 
come together, they'll form some kind of transition state up here, and then go down 
into products.  
 
OK, so most of you are sort of familiar with the concept, I think, of this activation 
energy, we've been talking about it, but the idea of an activation energy barrier, I 
think is something that probably all of you can personally connect with. So, for me, 
one of the things that I find really hard to do is get started writing a long National 
Institutes of Health grant. They're about 25 pages long, they're single spaced, font 
11, and they have point 5 margins on every side of the page, and it's really dense, 
and it takes a long time to sort of get going on that. And so, there is deadlines, and 
MIT is very particular, you need to have it to the Office of Sponsored Research five 
full business days before it's due at the National Institutes of Health, and then the 
Department needs to sign off on it. And I'll be looking at my calendar and I have 
those dates marked, and checking how many days I have left, and eventually, just 

like getting started, it's like oh, there's so much to do, I have to read the literature, 
the new stuff that's come out on my topic. And I have to think about what projects 
I'm going to do in the future, and I have to write about the progress that I've made 
so far, which is not really what I want it to be. And so, I think a lot about how -- it's 
just overwhelming.  
 
But then eventually something happens. Either it's tremendous fear that there's so 
few days left and you just have to do it. Sometimes it's going and getting an 
enormous cup of coffee and sitting down. You know, people have been known to sort 
of chain themselves to their desk, like they're not going to get to get up until they've 
written the introduction to the grant. So, a lot you can connect with this. That any 
new thing you start, there's some barrier that you have to overcome to get started 
with it. And often once you're started it's not that bad, and some of you may be 
thinking, exam 1 was a long time ago, I recall there was a lot of material on exam 1. 
And it seems really scary. But then the fact that I mention the final exam over and 
over in class is helping you get that energy that you need to overcome that 
activation energy barrier and start studying, because once you start studying you go, 
Oh yeah, I remember this, this wasn't so bad. So you just need to get over that 
activation energy barrier and you're all set.  
 
So, molecules have to do the same thing, and the ones that have higher temperature 
have an easier time getting over that barrier. So, here we can talk about this general 
process. We can look at the individual numbers involved. So in this particular case, 
there's an activation energy for the forward reaction of 132 kilojoules per mole, and 
there is an activation energy for the reverse reaction of 358 kilojoules per mole. And 
there's also a delta e for the reaction, which is this line, from reactions to products, 
which in this case is minus 226 kilojoules per mole. So do you think this reaction is 
endothermic or exothermic? What do you think, exothermic or endothermic? It's 
exothermic, and if you look back in your notes, we talked a little bit about the 
relationship between delta h and delta e. And they're actually pretty similar. A delta 
h usually equals delta e plus a change in p v. So, for gases it's about 1% or 2% 
difference, and for solids, there's really negligible difference between delta e and 
delta h. So, they're pretty similar types of values.  
 
So, we can we can think about what delta e really is, and so delta e in terms of 
activation energy is going to be equal to the activation energy for the forward 
reaction minus the activation energy for the reverse reaction. And in this particular 
case, we have 226 kilojoules per mole is our delta e, and for our forward reaction, 
we have 132 kilojoules per mole, and for the reverse reaction, the activation energy 
for the reverse reaction is 358 kilojoules per mole, and so these should all equal up 
to each other. And so, if you know two of these values, you can calculate the third. 
And this is one of the equations that you have to memorize for the final, because it 
has, its sort of a conceptual thing that you need to understand what this diagram 
says, that this plus that is equal to that, that these all add up to each other. And if 
you have a negative value here, that means it's an exothermic reaction.  
 
So, this delta e is a change in internal energy of the system, and you can determine 
that value experimentally, say, with a calorimetry experiment.  
 
OK, so let's keep this in mind and go on and take a look at how this connects back 
with some other things that we have already talked about in this course. So, for an 
elementary reaction, and I think for all of us, there's always some activation energy 
barrier to overcome. There's always some positive activation energy to overcome. 

And because there's always this activation energy to overcome, increasing the 
temperature is always going to increase the rate of an elementary reaction. It's 
always going to make it easier to get over that activation energy barrier. But for an 
overall reaction, increasing the temperature may not increase the rate of the 
reaction. So let's consider why that would be true.  
 
So, here is a reaction that we've talked about before, we talked about this proposed 
mechanism where we have a fast reversible step and a slow second step. So we 
learned last time that we can write the rate of product formation from the second 
step, there are two molecules of n o 2 being formed, so we have 2 times k 2, the 
concentration of n 2 o 2, and the concentration of o 2. But this is an intermediate, so 
we need to solve for that intermediate.  
 
So, in this case, we have a fast reversible first reaction and a slow second reaction. 
So this intermediate is going to build up, and it's going to be more or less an 
equilibrium with the reactants, because this is very fast, and only a little bit of this is 
siphoned off to make product, and so this creates an equilibrium type situation. So 
why don't you solve this intermediate for me, this is a review from the last class. OK, 
let's just take 10 more seconds. Very good. So, we can solve for this, equilibrium 
constant for the first step, products over reactants, and then if you solved for this, 
the intermediate here, which is the product in the first step, then it would be equal to 
k 1 times n o squared. We can take that term and we can we can plug it in, so over 
here, we can substitute it into this equation, and so we have 2 k 2, big K 1 times n o 
squared times o 2.  
 
All right, so here is our rate then. And if you missed some of this, this was in the 
notes from before. So now let's think about the effect of temperature. So, k 2 is an 
elementary rate constant, and so its temperature -- if you increase the temperature, 
its rate will increase. So here again is our equation, the activation energy is always 
positive, there's always positive, there's always some barrier to overcome. So if you 
increase the temperature, you're always going to increase the elementary rate. Well, 
what about equilibrium constant? So we've talked about this back in chemical 
equilibrium that the effect of temperature on the equilibrium constant depends on 
whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. And you told me before, the 
equation, and that's the Van't Hoff equation shown here. And so look how similar 
those equations are. So for an elementary rate constant, we had e a, and for 
equilibrium constant, we're talking about delta h.  
 
So, if you have, here the reaction is exothermic, and if you increase the temperature 
of an exothermic reaction, what happens to k? It decreases. So, again, it would shift, 
then, to the endothermic direction, decreasing k. So let's look at this then. So we 
have in this k obs term, we have an elementary rate constant and an equilibrium 
constant, so if you if you increase the temperature, the rate constant increases, but 
the equilibrium constant is going to decrease.  
 
So, the magnitude of the increase or decrease depends on the size of the activation 
energy or the size of delta h. So for this particular example, there's no way that you 
would know this so I'm telling you, that the activation energy is a small number, or 
you might be able to look it up in your book, and delta h is a very big number and 
it's negative, it's an exothermic reaction. So if you have a very small number for e a, 
that means that the rate constant will increase only a little bit, it's not that sensitive 
to a change in temperature, because e a's a very small number. But if delta h is a 

big number, then the equilibrium constant would decrease a lot with temperature 
because this is a big number here.  
 
So in this particular example, increasing the temperature actually decreases the 
observed rate, because delta h is, in this particular example, a much bigger thing. So 
if you were given either numbers or some information like that, you should be able 
to rationalize what might be true about the rate of the reaction.  
 
so, a large activation energy means that the rate constant is very sensitive to 
changes in temperature. A large delta h means equilibrium constant is very sensitive 
to changes in temperature. And, as we've talked about, e a is always positive, so the 
elementary rates always increase with temperature, whereas delta h can be positive 
or negative, so equilibrium constants can increase or decrease with temperature. 
And here, the magnitude of delta h indicates the magnitude of the change, how 
much k will change, will it be a big change or a small change, whereas the sign of 
delta h indicates the direction of the change.  
 
So, just want to review one thing and then we'll stop for the day. So when a stress is 
applied to a system, an equilibrium, the system tends to try to minimize that stress. 
So we're back to LeChatelier's principle.  
 
And so, just one more clicker question and we'll stop for the day. So increasing the 
temperature is going to do what again? Again, thinking back to LeChatelier. And just 
10 more seconds. Very good. So, we're going to finish up these notes on Monday. 
We're going to think about LeChatelier in a new way, we're going to think about it in 
terms of activation energy, which is really fun, because we tie back what we learned 
in the middle of course to what we're seeing now in the end of the course.  
 
All right, have a great weekend, everybody.
