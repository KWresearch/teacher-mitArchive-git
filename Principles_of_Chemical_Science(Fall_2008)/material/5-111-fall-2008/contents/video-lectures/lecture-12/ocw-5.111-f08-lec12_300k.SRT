9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
get started here.

10
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
Go ahead and take 10 more
seconds on the clicker

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
question, which probably looks
all too familiar at this

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
point, if you went to
recitation yesterday.

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
All right, and let's
see how we do here.

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:38
OK.
 

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
So, let's talk about
this for one second.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
So what we're asking here, if
we can settle down and listen

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
up, is which equations can be
used if we're talking about

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
converting wavelength to
energy for an electron.

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
Remember, the key word
here is electron.

20
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
This might look familiar to the
first part of problem one on

21
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
the exam, and problem one on
the exam is what tended to be

22
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
the huge problem on the exam.
 

23
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
I think over 2/3 of you decided
on the exam to use this first

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
equation, e equals h
c over wavelength.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
So I just want to reiterate
one more time, why can we not

26
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
use this equation if we're
talking about an electron?

27
00:01:17 --> 00:01:17
C.
 

28
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
OK, good, good, I'm hearing it.
 

29
00:01:19 --> 00:01:20
So the answer is c.
 

30
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
What you need to do is you need
to ask yourself if you're

31
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
trying to convert from
wavelength to energy for an

32
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
electron, and you are tempted,
because we are all tempted to

33
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
use this equation, and if you
were tempted, say, does

34
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
an electron travel at
the speed of light?

35
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
And if the answer is no, an
electron does not travel at the

36
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
speed of light, light travels
at the speed of light, then you

37
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
want to stay away from
using this equation.

38
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
And I know how tempting it is
to do that, but we have other

39
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
equations we can use -- the
DeBroglie wavelength, and this

40
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
is just a combination of energy
equals 1/2 m v squared, and the

41
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
definition of momentum, so we
can combine those

42
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
things to get it.
 

43
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
You might be wondering why I'm
telling you this now, you've

44
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
already -- if you've lost
points on that, lost the points

45
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
on it, and what I'm saying to
you is if there are parts of

46
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
exam 1 that you did not do well
on, you will have a chance to

47
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
show us again that you
now understand that

48
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
material on the final.
 

49
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
One quarter of the final is
going to be exam 1 material,

50
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
and what that means is when we
look at your grade at the end

51
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
of the semester, and we take a
look at what you got on exam 1,

52
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
and you're right at that
borderline, and we say well,

53
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
what happened, did they
understand more at the end of

54
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
the semester, did the
concepts kind of solidify

55
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
over the semester?
 

56
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
And if they did and if you
showed us that they did, then

57
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
you're going to get bumped up
into that next grade category.

58
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
So keep that in mind as you're
reviewing the exam, sometimes

59
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
if things don't go as well
as you want them to, the

60
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
temptation is just to put that
exam away forever and ever.

61
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
But the reality is that new
material builds on that

62
00:02:47 --> 00:02:55
material, and specifically exam
1 a, question 1 a that deals

63
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
with converting wavelength to
energy for an electron.

64
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
I really want you guys know
this and to understand it, so

65
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
I can guarantee you that you
will see this on the final.

66
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
Specifically,
question 1, part a.

67
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
You will see something
very, very similar to

68
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
this on the final.
 

69
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
If you are thinking about 1
thing to go back and study

70
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
on exam 1, 1 a is a really
good choice for that.

71
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
This is important to
me, so you're going to

72
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
see it on the final.
 

73
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
So if you have friends that
aren't here, you might want to

74
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
mention it to them, or maybe
not, maybe this is your reward

75
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
for coming to class, which
is fine with me as well.

76
00:03:33 --> 00:03:33
All right.
 

77
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
So I want to talk a
little bit about exam 1.

78
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
I know most you picked up
your examine in recitation.

79
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
If you didn't, any extra exams
can be picked up in the

80
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
Chemistry Education
office, that's room 2204.

81
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
So, the class average for the
exam was a 68%, which is

82
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
actually a strong, solid
average for an exam 1 grade in

83
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
the fall semester of 511-1.
 

84
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
What we typically see is
something right in this range,

85
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
either ranging from the 50's
for an exam 1 average to

86
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
occasionally getting into the
70's, but most commonly what

87
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
we've seen for exam 1 averages
is 60, 61 -- those low 60's.

88
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
So in many ways, seeing this
68 here, this is a great sign

89
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
that we are off to a good
start for this semester.

90
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
And I do want to address,
because I know many of you,

91
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
this is only your second exam
at MIT, and perhaps you've

92
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
never gotten an exam back that
didn't start with a 90 or start

93
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
with an 80 in terms
of the grades.

94
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
So one thing you need to
keep in mind is don't just

95
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
look at the number grade.
 

96
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
The reason that we give you
these letters grade categories

97
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
is that you can understand what
it actually means, what your

98
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
exam score actually says in
terms of how we perceive you as

99
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
understanding the material.
 

100
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
So, for example, and this is
the same categories that were

101
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
shared in recitation, so I
apologize for repeating, but I

102
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
know sometimes when you get an
exam back, no more information

103
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
comes into your head except
obsessing over the exam, so I'm

104
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
just going to say it one more
time, and that is between

105
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
88 and 100, so that's
20% of you got an A.

106
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
This is just absolutely
fantastic, you really nailed

107
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
this very hard material and
these hard questions on the

108
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
exam where you had to both use
equations and solve problems,

109
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
but also understand the concept
in order to get yourself

110
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
started on solving the problem.
 

111
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
The same with the B, the B
range was between 69 and 87 --

112
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
anywhere in between those
ranges, you've got a B, some

113
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
sort of B on the exam.
 

114
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
So again, if you're in the A or
the B category here, this is

115
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
really something to be proud
of, you really earned

116
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
these grades.
 

117
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
You know these exams, our 511-1
exams, we're not giving you

118
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
points here, there are no give
me, easy points, you earned

119
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
every single one
of these points.

120
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
So, A and B here, these are
refrigerator-worthy grades,

121
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
hang those up in your dorm.
 

122
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
This is something to
feel good about.

123
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
All right.
 

124
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
So, for those of you that got
between a 51 and a 68, this

125
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
is somewhere in the C range.
 

126
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
For some people, they feel
comfortable being in the C

127
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
range, other people really do
not like being in this range.

128
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
We understand that, there
is plenty of room up there

129
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
with the A's and the B's.
 

130
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
You are welcome to come up to
these higher ranges starting

131
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
with the next exam.
 

132
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
And what I want to tell you if
you are in the C range, and

133
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
this is not a place that you
want to be in, anyone that's

134
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
got below the class average, so
below a 68 -- or a 68 or below,

135
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
is eligible for free tutoring,
and I put the website on the

136
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
front page of your notes.
 

137
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
This means you get a one-on-one
tutor paid for by the Chemistry

138
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Department to help you if it's
concepts you're not quite up

139
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
on, if it's exam strategy that
you need to work on more.

140
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Whatever it is that you need
to work on, we want to

141
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
help you get there.
 

142
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
So, if you have a grade that
you're not happy with, that

143
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
you're feeling upset or
discouraged about, please, I'm

144
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
happy to talk to all of you
about your grades individually.

145
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
You can come talk to me, bring
your exam, and we'll go over

146
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
what the strategy should be in
terms of you succeeding

147
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
on the next exam.
 

148
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
You can do the same thing with
all of your TAs are more than

149
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
happy to meet with each
and every one of you.

150
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
And then in addition to that,
we can set you up with a tutor

151
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
if you are in the C range or
below, in terms of

152
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
this first exam.
 

153
00:07:13 --> 00:07:13
All right.
 

154
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
So 44 to 50, this is going
to be in the D range.

155
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
And then anything below
a 44 is going to be

156
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
failing on this exam.
 

157
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
And also keep in mind, for
those of you that are

158
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
freshman, you need at least
a C to pass the class.

159
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
So, if you did get a D or an F
on the first exam, you are

160
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
going to need to really
evaluate why that happened and

161
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
make some changes, and we're
absolutely here to

162
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
help you do that.
 

163
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
So the real key is identifying
where the problem is -- is

164
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
it with understanding the
concepts, are you in a study

165
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
group that's dragging you along
but you're not understanding?

166
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
Do you kind of panic when
you get in the exam?

167
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
There are all sorts of
scenarios we can talk

168
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
about and we want to talk
about them with you.

169
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
Seriously, even if we had a
huge range in this exam from 17

170
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
to 100, if you're sitting there
and you're the 17, and actually

171
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
there's more than 1 so don't
feel alone, if you're a 17 or

172
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
you're a 20, it's not time to
give up, it's not time to drop

173
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
the class and say I'm no good
at chemistry, I can't do this.

174
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
You still can, this is your
first couple of exams,

175
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
certainly your first in this
class, potentially one of your

176
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
first at MIT, so there's tons
of room to improve

177
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
from here on out.
 

178
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
This is only 100
points out of 750.

179
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
So, the same thing goes if you
did really well, you still

180
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
have 650 other points that
you need to deal with.

181
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
So, make sure you don't just
rest on your high score

182
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
from this first exam.
 

183
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
So, OK, so that's pretty much
what I wanted to say about the

184
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
exam, and in terms of there's
tons of resources if things

185
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
didn't work out quite
as you wanted.

186
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
If you feel upset in any way,
please come and talk to me.

187
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
We want you to love chemistry
and feel good about

188
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
your ability to do it.
 

189
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Nobody get into MIT by mistake,
so you all deserve to be

190
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
sitting here, and you all can
pass this class and do well in

191
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
it, so we can help you get
there no matter what.

192
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
You all absolutely can do this.
 

193
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
And then one more time, to
reiterate, in case anyone

194
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
missed it, 1 a, make sure
you understand that, I feel

195
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
like that's important.
 

196
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
And actually all of 1 --
I really feel like the

197
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
photoelectric effect is
important for understanding

198
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
all of these energy concepts.
 

199
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
So, as you go on in this class,
make sure you don't go on

200
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
before you go back and make
sure you understand

201
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
that problem.
 

202
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
All right, so let's move on to
material for exam 2 now, and

203
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
we're already three lectures
into exam 2 material.

204
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
And I do want to say that in
terms of 511-1, what tends to

205
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
happen is the exam scores go up
and up and up, in terms of as

206
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
we go from exam 1, to
exam 2, to exam 3.

207
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
One of these reasons is we are
building on material, the other

208
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
reason is you'll be shocked at
how much better you are at

209
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
taking an exam just a
few weeks from now.

210
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
So this will be on, starting
with the Lewis structures, so

211
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
go back in your notes -- if
this doesn't sound familiar, if

212
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
you spent too much time -- or
not too much time, spent a

213
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
lot of time studying exam
1 and didn't move on here.

214
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Today we're going to talk
about the breakdown

215
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
of the octet rule.
 

216
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
Cases where we don't have eight
electrons around our Lewis

217
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
structures, then we'll move on
to talking about ionic bonds.

218
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
We had already talked about
covalent bonds, and then we

219
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
talked about Lewis structures,
which describe the electron

220
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
configuration in
covalent bonds.

221
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
So now let's think about the
other extreme of ionic bonds,

222
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
and then we'll talk about polar
covalent bonds to end, if we

223
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
get there or will start with
that in class on Monday.

224
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
Also, public service
announcement for all of you,

225
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
voter registration in
Massachusetts, which is where

226
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
we are, is on Monday, the
deadline if you want

227
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
to register to vote.
 

228
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
There's some websites up there
that can guide you through

229
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
registering and also can guide
you through, if you need an

230
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
absentee ballot for
your home state.

231
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
And I actually saw, and I saw a
5.111 student manning, there's

232
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
some booths around MIT that
will register you or get

233
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
you an absentee ballot.
 

234
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
So, the deadline's coming soon,
so patriotic duty, I need to

235
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
remind you of that as your
chemistry teacher -- chemistry

236
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
issues are important
in politics as well.

237
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
So make sure you get
registered to vote.

238
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
I just remembered one more
announcement, too, that I did

239
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
want to mention, some of you
may have friends in 511-2 and

240
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
have heard their class
average for exam 1.

241
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
And I want to tell you, this
happens every year, their

242
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
average was 15 points
higher than our average.

243
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Last year, their average was 15
points higher than our average.

244
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
This is for exam 1.
 

245
00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
This is what tends to
happen to 511-2 grades

246
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
as the exam goes on.
 

247
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
This is what happens to 511-1.
 

248
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
You guys are in a good spot.
 

249
00:11:27 --> 00:11:30
Also, I want to point out that
what's not important is just

250
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
that number grade, but also
the letter that goes with it.

251
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
So, for example, if you got
a 69 in this class on this

252
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
exam, that's a B minus.
 

253
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
If you got a 69 on your exam
in 511-2, that's a D, you

254
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
didn't pass the exam.
 

255
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
So keep that in mind when your
friend might have gotten a

256
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
higher number grade than you
and you know you understand the

257
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
similar material just as well.
 

258
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Similarly, an 80 in this
class on the exam was a

259
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
B plus, a very high B.
 

260
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
An 80 in that class
is going to be a C.

261
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
So, just don't worry so much
about exactly where that

262
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
average lies, you really want
to think about what the

263
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
letter grade means.
 

264
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
OK, I've said enough.
 

265
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
I just -- I hate to see people
discouraged, and I know that a

266
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
few people have been feeling
discouraged, so that's my

267
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
long-winded explanation
of exam 1 grades.

268
00:12:14 --> 00:12:14
All right.
 

269
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
So, let's move on with life
though, so talking about the

270
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
breakdown of the octet rule.
 

271
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
The first example where we're
going to see a breakdown is any

272
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
time we have an odd number
of valence electrons.

273
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
This is probably the easiest to
explain and to think about,

274
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
because if we have an odd
number that means that we can't

275
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
have our octet rule, because
our octet rule works

276
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
by pairing electrons.
 

277
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
And if we have an odd number,
we automatically have

278
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
an odd electron out.
 

279
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
So, if we look at an example,
the methyl radical, we can

280
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
first think about how we draw
the Lewis structure -- we draw

281
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
the skeletal structure here.
 

282
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
And then what we're going to do
is add up our valence electrons

283
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
-- we have 3 times 1 for the
hydrogen atoms, carbon has 4

284
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
valence electrons, so
we have a total of 7.

285
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
If we want to fill all of our
valence shells in each of these

286
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
atoms, we're going to need
a total of 14 electrons.

287
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
So, what we see we're left
with is that we have

288
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
7 bonding electrons.
 

289
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
So we can fill in 6 of those
straightforward here, because

290
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
we know that we need to
make 3 different bonds.

291
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
And now we're left over with 1
electron, we can't make a bond.

292
00:13:19 --> 00:13:24
So, what we'll do is carbon
does not have an octet yet.

293
00:13:24 --> 00:13:27
We can't get it one, but we can
do the best we can and help it

294
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
out with adding that extra
electron onto the carbon atom,

295
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
so that at least we're getting
as close as possible to

296
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
filling our octets.
 

297
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
This is what we call a radical
species or a free radical.

298
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
Free radical or radical species
is essentially any type of a

299
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
molecule that has this unpaired
electron on one of the atoms.

300
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
This might look really strange,
we're used to seeing octets.

301
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
But you'll realize, if you
calculate the formal charge on

302
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
this molecule, that it's not
the worst situation

303
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
ever for carbon.
 

304
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
At least it's formal charge is
zero, even if it doesn't have

305
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
-- it would rather have an
extra bond and have

306
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
a full octet.
 

307
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
But it's not the worst
scenario that we can imagine.

308
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
But still, radicals tend
to be incredibly reactive

309
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
because they do want
to fill that octet.

310
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
So, what happens when you have
a radical is it tends to react

311
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
with the first thing that it
runs into, especially highly

312
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
reactive radicals that are not
stabilized in some other way,

313
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
which you'll tend to talk about
it organic chemistry -- how

314
00:14:24 --> 00:14:26
you can stabilize radicals.
 

315
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
So the term free radical should
sound familiar to you, whether

316
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
you've heard it in chemistry
before, or you haven't heard it

317
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
in chemistry, but maybe have
heard it, I don't know,

318
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
commercials for facial
products or other things.

319
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
People like to talk about free
radicals, and they're sort of

320
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
the hero that gets rid of
free radicals, which

321
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
are antioxidants.
 

322
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
So you hear in a lot of
different creams or products

323
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
or vitamins that they have
antioxidants in them, which

324
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
get rid of free radicals.
 

325
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
The reason you would want to
get rid of free radicals is

326
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
that free radicals can
damage DNA, so they're

327
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
incredibly reactive.
 

328
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
It makes sense that if they hit
a strand of DNA, they're going

329
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
to react with the DNA, you end
up breaking the strands of

330
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
DNA and causing DNA damage.
 

331
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
So, this is actually what
happens in aging because

332
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
we have a lot of free
radicals in our body.

333
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
We can introduce them
artificially, for example,

334
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
cigarette smoke has a lot of
really dangerous free radicals

335
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
that get into the cells in your
lungs, which damage your

336
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
lung DNA, which can
cause lung cancer.

337
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
But also, all of us are living
and breathing, which means

338
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
we're having metabolism go on
in our body, which means that

339
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
as we use oxygen and as we
metabolize our food, we are

340
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
actually producing free
radicals as well.

341
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
So it's kind of a paradox
because we need them because

342
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
they are a natural by-product
of these important processes,

343
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
but then they can go on and
damage cells, which is what

344
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
kind of is causing aging
and can lead to cancer.

345
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
We have enzymes in our body
that repair damage that is done

346
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
by free radicals, that will put
the strands of DNA

347
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
back together.
 

348
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
And we also have
antioxidants in our body.

349
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
So, you might know that, for
example, very brightly colored

350
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
fruit is full of antioxidants,
they're full of chemicals that

351
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
will neutralize free radicals.
 

352
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
Lots of vitamins are also
antioxidants, so we have

353
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
vitamin A on the top
there and vitamin E.

354
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
So, the most common thing we
think of when we think of free

355
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
radicals is very reactive,
bad for your body,

356
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
causes DNA damage.
 

357
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
But the reality is that
free radicals are also

358
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
essential for life.
 

359
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
So this is kind of
interesting to think about.

360
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
And, for example, certain
enzymes or proteins actually

361
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
use free radicals in order to
carry out the reactions that

362
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
they carry out in your body.
 

363
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
So, for example, this is a
picture or a snapshot of a

364
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
protein, this is a crystal
structure of ribonucleotide

365
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
reductase is what it's called.
 

366
00:16:51 --> 00:16:56
It's an enzyme that catalyzes
the reaction of an essential

367
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
step in both DNA synthesis and
also DNA repair, and it

368
00:16:59 --> 00:17:04
requires having radicals within
its active site in order to

369
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
carry out the chemistry.
 

370
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
So, this is kind of a neat
paradox, because radicals

371
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
damage DNA, but in order to
repair your DNA, you need

372
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
certain enzymes, and those
enzymes require different

373
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
types of free radicals.
 

374
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
So, free radicals are
definitely very interesting,

375
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
and once we get -- or hopefully
you will get into organic

376
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
chemistry at some point and get
to really think about

377
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
what they do in terms of
a radical mechanism.

378
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
We can think about radicals
that are also more stable, so

379
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
let's do another example with
the molecule nitric acid.

380
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
So we can again, draw the
skeleton here, and just by

381
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
looking at it we might not know
it's a radical, but as we start

382
00:17:42 --> 00:17:45
to count valence electrons, we
should be able to figure it out

383
00:17:45 --> 00:17:50
very quickly, because what we
have is 11 valence electrons.

384
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
We need 16 electrons
to have full octets.

385
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
So, we're left with 5
bonding electrons.

386
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
We put a double bond in between
our nitrogen and our oxygen, so

387
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
what we're left over with is
this single bonding electron,

388
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
and we'll put that on
the nitrogen here.

389
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
And I'll explain why we put it
on the nitrogen and not the

390
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
oxygen in just a minute.
 

391
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
But what we find is then once
we fill in the rest of the

392
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
valence electrons in terms of
lone pairs, this is the

393
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
structure that we get.
 

394
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
And if you add up all of the
formal charges on the nitrogen

395
00:18:24 --> 00:18:27
and on the oxygen, what you'll
see is they're both 0.

396
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
So if you happen to try drawing
this structure and you put the

397
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
lone pair on oxygen and then
you figured out the formal

398
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
charge and saw that you had a
split charge, a plus 1 and a

399
00:18:37 --> 00:18:39
minus 1, the first thing you
might want to try is putting it

400
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
on the other atom, and once you
did that you'd see that you had

401
00:18:41 --> 00:18:46
a better structure with
no formal charge.

402
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
I have to mention what nitric
oxide does, because it's a

403
00:18:49 --> 00:18:50
very interesting molecule.
 

404
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
Don't get it confused with
nitrous oxide, which is

405
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
happy gas, that's n o 2.
 

406
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
This is nitric oxide, and it's
actually much more interesting

407
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
than nitrous oxide.
 

408
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
It's a signaling molecule in
your body, it's one of the very

409
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
few signaling molecules that is
a gas, and obviously,

410
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
it's also a radical.
 

411
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
What happens with n o is that
it's produced in the

412
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
endothelium of your blood
vessels, so the inner lining of

413
00:19:15 --> 00:19:20
your blood vessels, and it
signals for smooth muscle that

414
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
line your blood vessels to
relax, which causes

415
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
vasodilation , and by
vasodilation, I just mean a

416
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
widening of the blood vessels.
 

417
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
So, n o signals for your blood
vessels to get wider and allow

418
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
more blood to flow through.
 

419
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
And if you think about what
consequences this could have,

420
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
in terms of places where they
have high altitude, so they

421
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
have lower oxygen levels, do
you think that they produce

422
00:19:42 --> 00:19:47
more or less and
n o their body?

423
00:19:47 --> 00:19:48
More?
 

424
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
Yeah, it turns out
they do produce more.

425
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
The reason they produce more is
that they want to have more

426
00:19:52 --> 00:19:55
blood flowing through their
veins so that they can get more

427
00:19:55 --> 00:19:59
oxygenated blood into different
parts of their body.

428
00:19:59 --> 00:20:02
N o is also a target in the
pharmaceutical industry.

429
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
A very famous one that became
famous I guess over 10 years

430
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
ago now, and this is from a
drug that actually targets one

431
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
of n o's receptors, and this
drug has the net effect of

432
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
vasodilation or widening of
blood vessels in a certain

433
00:20:18 --> 00:20:19
area in the body.
 

434
00:20:19 --> 00:20:22
So this is viagra, some of you
may be familiar, I think

435
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
everyone's heard of viagra.
 

436
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
Now you know how viagra works.
 

437
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
Viagra breaks down, or it
inhibits the breakdown of n o's

438
00:20:32 --> 00:20:35
binding partner in just certain
areas, not everywhere

439
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
in your body.
 

440
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
So, in those areas, what
happens is you get more n

441
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
o signaling, you get more
vasodilation, you get

442
00:20:42 --> 00:20:44
increased blood flow.
 

443
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
So that's a little bit
of pharmacology for

444
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
you here today.
 

445
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
All right, so let's talk about
one more example in terms of

446
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
the breakdown of the octet
rule with radicals.

447
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
Let's think about
molecular oxygen.

448
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
So let's go ahead and quickly
draw this Lewis structure.

449
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
We have o 2.
 

450
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
The second thing we need
to do is figure out

451
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
valence electrons.
 

452
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11
6 plus 6, so we would
expect to see 12.

453
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
For a complete octet we would
need 8 electrons each, so 16.

454
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
So in terms of bonding
electrons, what we have

455
00:21:24 --> 00:21:26
is 4 bonding electrons.
 

456
00:21:26 --> 00:21:29
So, we can go ahead and fill
those in as a double bond

457
00:21:29 --> 00:21:32
between the two oxygens.
 

458
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
So, what we end up having left,
and this would be step six then

459
00:21:37 --> 00:21:42
because five was just filling
in that, is 12 minus 4, so we

460
00:21:42 --> 00:21:45
have 8 lone pair
electrons left.

461
00:21:45 --> 00:21:51
So we can just fill it in
to our oxygens like this.

462
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
All right, so using everything
we've learned about Lewis

463
00:21:53 --> 00:21:58
structures, we here have the
structure of molecular oxygen.

464
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
And I just want to point out
for anyone that gets confused,

465
00:22:01 --> 00:22:06
when we talk about oxygen as an
atom, that's o, but molecular

466
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
oxygen is actually o 2,
the same for molecular

467
00:22:08 --> 00:22:09
hydrogen, for example.
 

468
00:22:09 --> 00:22:12
All right, so let's look at
what the actual Lewis structure

469
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
is for molecular oxygen, and it
turns out that actually we

470
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
don't have a double bond, we
have a single bond, and

471
00:22:19 --> 00:22:21
we have two radicals.
 

472
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
And any time we have two
radicals, we talk about

473
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
what's called a biradical.
 

474
00:22:26 --> 00:22:30
And while using this exception
to the Lewis structure rule, to

475
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
the octet rule for odd numbers
of valence electrons can clue

476
00:22:34 --> 00:22:38
us into the fact that we have a
radical, there's really no way

477
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
for us to use Lewis structures
to predict when we have a

478
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
biradical, right, because we
would just predict that we

479
00:22:43 --> 00:22:45
would get this Lewis
structure here.

480
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
So, when I first introduced
Lewis structures, I said these

481
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
are great, they're really
easy to use and they work

482
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
about 90% of the time.
 

483
00:22:53 --> 00:22:55
This falls into that 10%
that Lewis structures

484
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
don't work for us.
 

485
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
It turns out, in order to
understand that this is the

486
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
electron configuration for o 2,
we need to use something called

487
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
molecular orbital theory, and
just wait till next Wednesday

488
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
and we will tell you what that
is, and we will, in fact,

489
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
use it for oxygen.
 

490
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
But until that point, I'll just
tell you that molecular orbital

491
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
theory takes into account
quantum mechanics, which

492
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
Lewis theory does not.
 

493
00:23:21 --> 00:23:23
So that's why, in fact, there
are those 10% of cases that

494
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
Lewis structures
don't work for.

495
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
All right, the second case of
exceptions to the octet rule

496
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
are when we have octet
deficient molecules.

497
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
So basically, this means we're
going to have a molecule that's

498
00:23:34 --> 00:23:38
stable, even though it doesn't
have a complete octet.

499
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
And these tend to happen in
group 13 molecules, and

500
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
actually happen almost
exclusively in group 13

501
00:23:44 --> 00:23:48
molecules, specifically
with boron and aluminum.

502
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
So, any time you see a Lewis
structure with boron or

503
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
aluminum, you want to just
remember that I should look out

504
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
to make sure that these might
have an incomplete octet, so

505
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
look out for that when
you see those atoms.

506
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
So, let's look at b f 3
as our example here.

507
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
And what we see for b f 3 is
the number of valence electrons

508
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
that we have are 24, because
the valence number of electrons

509
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
for boron is 3, and then 3
times 7 for each fluorine.

510
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
For total filled octets we need
32, so that means we need

511
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
8 bonding electrons.
 

512
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
So, let's assign two to each
bond here, and then we're going

513
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
to have two extra bonding
electrons, so let's just

514
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
arbitrarily pick a fluorine
to give a double bond to.

515
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
And then we can fill in
the lone pair electrons,

516
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
we have 16 left over.
 

517
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
So thinking about what the
formal charge is, if we want to

518
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
figure out the formal charge
for the boron here, what we're

519
00:24:46 --> 00:24:49
talking about is the valence
number for boron, which is 3,

520
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
minus 0 because there are no
lone pairs, minus 1/2 of 8

521
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
because there are eight
shared electrons.

522
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
We get a formal
charge of minus 1.

523
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
What is our formal charge since
we learned this on Monday for

524
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
thinking about the double
bonded fluorine in boron?

525
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
So, look at your notes and look
at the fluorine that has a

526
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
double bond with it, and I want
you to go ahead and tell

527
00:25:12 --> 00:25:32
me what that formal
charge should be.

528
00:25:32 --> 00:25:46
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on that.

529
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
OK, so 49%.
 

530
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
So, let's go look back at the
notes, we'll talk about why

531
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
about 50% of you are right, and
50% need to review, which I

532
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
totally understand you haven't
had time to do yet, your formal

533
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
charge rules from Monday's
class, there were other

534
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
things going on.
 

535
00:26:05 --> 00:26:08
But let's talk about how we
figure out formal charge.

536
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
Formal charge is just
the number of valence

537
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
electrons you have.
 

538
00:26:13 --> 00:26:14
So fluorine has 7.
 

539
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
You should be able to look
at a periodic table and see

540
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
that fluorine has seven.
 

541
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
What we subtract from that is
the number of lone pair

542
00:26:21 --> 00:26:25
electrons, and there are four
lone pair electrons on this

543
00:26:25 --> 00:26:28
double bonded fluorine,
so it's minus 4.

544
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
Then we subtract 1/2 of
the shared electrons.

545
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
Well we have a double bond
with boron here, so we have a

546
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
total of 4 shared electrons.
 

547
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
And when we do the subtraction
here, what we end up with is a

548
00:26:41 --> 00:26:46
formal charge plus 1 on the
double bonded fluorine.

549
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
Without even doing a
calculation, what do you

550
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
think that the formal charge
should be on you single

551
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
bonded fluorines?
 

552
00:26:52 --> 00:26:53
Good.
 

553
00:26:53 --> 00:26:56
OK, it should be 0 and it is 0.
 

554
00:26:56 --> 00:27:01
The reason it's zero in terms
of calculating it is 7 minus 6

555
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
lone pair electrons minus 1/2
half of 2 shared

556
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
electrons is 0.
 

557
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
The reason that you all told
me, I think, and I hope, is

558
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
that you know that the formal
charge on individual atoms

559
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
has to equal the total
charge on the molecule.

560
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
So if we already have a minus 1
and a plus 1, and we know we

561
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
have no charge in the molecule,
and we only have one type of

562
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
atom left to talk about, that
formal charge had better be 0.

563
00:27:25 --> 00:27:25
OK.
 

564
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
So this looks pretty good in
terms of a Lewis structure, we

565
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
figured out our formal charges.
 

566
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
These also look pretty good,
too, we don't have too

567
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
much charge separation.
 

568
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
But what actually it turns out
is that if you experimentally

569
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
look at what type of bonds you
have, it turns out that all

570
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
three of the b f bonds are
equal in length, and they all

571
00:27:44 --> 00:27:48
have a length that would
correspond to a single bond.

572
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
So, experimentally, we know we
have to throw out this Lewis

573
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
structure here, we have some
more information, let's think

574
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
about how this could happen.
 

575
00:27:57 --> 00:28:00
So this could happen, for
example, is if we take this two

576
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
of the electrons that are in
the b f double bond and we put

577
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
it right on to the fluorine
here, so now we have

578
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
all single bonds.
 

579
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
And let's think about what
the formal charge situation

580
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
would be in this case here.
 

581
00:28:13 --> 00:28:16
What happens here is now we
would have a formal charge of

582
00:28:16 --> 00:28:20
0 on the boron, we'd have a
formal charge of 0 on all of

583
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22
the fluorine molecules as well.
 

584
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
So, it turns out that actually
looking at formal charge, even

585
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
though the first case didn't
look too bad, this case

586
00:28:28 --> 00:28:28
actually looks a lot better.
 

587
00:28:28 --> 00:28:32
We have absolutely no formal
charge separation whatsoever.

588
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
It turns out again, boron and
aluminum, those are the two

589
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
that you want to look out for.
 

590
00:28:36 --> 00:28:39
They can be perfectly happy
without a full octet, they're

591
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
perfectly happy with 6 instead
of 8 in terms of electrons

592
00:28:44 --> 00:28:45
in their valence shell.
 

593
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
So that is our exception
the number two.

594
00:28:48 --> 00:28:51
We have one more exception and
this is a valence shell

595
00:28:51 --> 00:28:53
expansion, and this can be the
hardest to look out for,

596
00:28:53 --> 00:28:58
students tend to forget to look
for this one, but it's very

597
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
important as well, because
there are a lot of structures

598
00:29:00 --> 00:29:01
that are affected for this .
 

599
00:29:01 --> 00:29:04
And this is only applicable if
we're talking about a central

600
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
atom that has an n value or a
principle quantum number that's

601
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
equal to or greater than three.
 

602
00:29:11 --> 00:29:16
What happens when we have n
that's equal to or greater to

603
00:29:16 --> 00:29:19
three, is that now, in addition
to s orbitals and p orbitals,

604
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
what else do we have
available to us?

605
00:29:23 --> 00:29:24
D orbitals, great.
 

606
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
So what we see is we have some
empty d orbitals, which means

607
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
that we can have more than
eight electrons that fit

608
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
around that central atom.
 

609
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
If you're looking to see if
this is going to happen, do you

610
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
think this would happen with a
large or small central atom?

611
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
So think of it in terms
of just fitting.

612
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
We've got to fit more than
8 electrons around here.

613
00:29:47 --> 00:29:50
Yeah, so it's going to be,
we need to have a large

614
00:29:50 --> 00:29:53
central atom in order
for this to take place.

615
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
Literally, we just need to fit
everything around is probably

616
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
the easiest way to
think about it.

617
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
And what happens is it also
tends to have small atoms

618
00:30:02 --> 00:30:02
that it's bonded to.
 

619
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
Again, just think of it in
terms of all fitting in there.

620
00:30:06 --> 00:30:10
So, let's take an
example p c l 5.

621
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
The first example is the more
straightforward example,

622
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
because let's start to draw the
Lewis structure, and what we

623
00:30:15 --> 00:30:19
see is that phosphorous has
five chlorines around it.

624
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
So we already know if we want
to form five bonds we've

625
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
broken our octet rule.
 

626
00:30:23 --> 00:30:25
But let's go through and
figure this out and

627
00:30:25 --> 00:30:26
see how that happens.
 

628
00:30:26 --> 00:30:30
What we know is we need 40
valence electrons, we have

629
00:30:30 --> 00:30:34
those -- 5 from the
phosphorous, and we have 7 from

630
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
each of the chlorine atoms.
 

631
00:30:37 --> 00:30:39
If we were to fill out all
of those octets, that

632
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
would be 48 electrons.
 

633
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
So what we end up with when
we do our Lewis structure

634
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48
calculation is that we only
have 8 bonding electrons

635
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
available to us.
 

636
00:30:49 --> 00:30:51
So we can fill those in
between the phosphorous

637
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
and the chlorine, those
8 bonding electrons.

638
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
So, this is obviously
a problem.

639
00:30:59 --> 00:31:04
To make 5 p c l bonds we need
10 shared electrons, and we

640
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
know that that's the situation
because it's called p c l 5 and

641
00:31:07 --> 00:31:10
not p c l 4, so we can go right
ahead and add in that

642
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
extra electron pair.
 

643
00:31:13 --> 00:31:16
So we've used up 10 for
bonding, so that means what we

644
00:31:16 --> 00:31:19
have left is 30 lone pair
electrons, and I would not

645
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
recommend filling all of these
in your notes right now, you

646
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
can go back and do that, but
just know the rest end up

647
00:31:24 --> 00:31:27
filling up the octets for
all of the chlorines.

648
00:31:27 --> 00:31:30
So, in this first case where
you actually need to make more

649
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
than for bonds, you will
immediately know you need to

650
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
use this exception to the Lewis
structure octet rule, but

651
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
sometimes it won't
be as obvious.

652
00:31:39 --> 00:31:43
So, let's look at c r o 4, the
2 minus version here, so a

653
00:31:43 --> 00:31:47
chromate ion, and if we draw
the skeletal structure, we

654
00:31:47 --> 00:31:51
have four things that the
chromate needs to bond to.

655
00:31:51 --> 00:31:54
So, let's do the Lewis
structure again.

656
00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
When we figure out the valence
electrons, we have total, we

657
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
have 6 from the chromium, we
have 6 from each of the

658
00:32:01 --> 00:32:06
different oxygens, and where
did this 2 come from?

659
00:32:06 --> 00:32:07
Yup, the negative charge.
 

660
00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
So, remember, we have 2 extra
electrons hanging out in our

661
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
molecule, so we need
to include those.

662
00:32:12 --> 00:32:13
We have a total of 32.
 

663
00:32:13 --> 00:32:16
40 are needed to
fill up octets.

664
00:32:16 --> 00:32:20
So again, we have 8 bonding
electrons available, so we can

665
00:32:20 --> 00:32:24
go ahead and fill these in
between each of the bonds.

666
00:32:24 --> 00:32:27
What happens is that we then
have 24 lone pair electrons

667
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
left, and we can fill
those in like this.

668
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
And the problem comes
now when we figure out

669
00:32:34 --> 00:32:35
the formal charge.
 

670
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38
So, when we do that what we
find is that the chromium has a

671
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42
formal charge of plus 1, and
that each of the oxygens has

672
00:32:42 --> 00:32:44
a total charge of minus 1.
 

673
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
So we actually have a bit
of charge separation here.

674
00:32:47 --> 00:32:49
Without even doing a
calculation, what is the

675
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
total charge of these
that are added up?

676
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
OK, it's minus 2, that's right.
 

677
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
We know that the total charge
of each of the formal charges

678
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
has to add up to minus
2, because that's the

679
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
charge in our molecule.
 

680
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
We can also just calculate it
-- the chromate gives us a plus

681
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
2, then we have 4 times minus 1
for each of the oxygens,

682
00:33:07 --> 00:33:09
so we have a minus 2.
 

683
00:33:09 --> 00:33:11
So, we have some charge
separation here, and in some

684
00:33:11 --> 00:33:15
cases, if we're not at n equals
3 or higher, there's really

685
00:33:15 --> 00:33:17
nothing we can do about it,
this would be the best

686
00:33:17 --> 00:33:18
structure we can do.
 

687
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
But since we have these d
orbitals available, we can use

688
00:33:22 --> 00:33:25
them, and it turns out that
experimentally this is what's

689
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
found, that the length and the
strength are not single bonds,

690
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
but they're actually something
between a single bond

691
00:33:32 --> 00:33:33
and a double bond.
 

692
00:33:33 --> 00:33:37
So how do we get a 1 and 1/2
bond, for example, what's the

693
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
term that let's us do that?
 

694
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
Resonance.
 

695
00:33:40 --> 00:33:40
That's right.
 

696
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
So that's exactly
what's happening here.

697
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
So, if we went ahead and drew
this structure here where we

698
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
have now two double bonds and
two single bonds, that would

699
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
be in resonance with another
structure where we have two

700
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
double bonds instead to these
two oxygens, and now, single

701
00:33:58 --> 00:34:00
bonds to these two oxygens.
 

702
00:34:00 --> 00:34:02
We can actually also have
several other resonance

703
00:34:02 --> 00:34:04
structures as well.
 

704
00:34:04 --> 00:34:06
Remember, the definition of a
resonance structure is where

705
00:34:06 --> 00:34:09
all the atoms stay the same,
but what we can do is move

706
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
around the electrons -- we're
moving around those extra

707
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
two electrons that can
be in double bonds.

708
00:34:14 --> 00:34:17
So, why don't you tell me how
many other resonance structures

709
00:34:17 --> 00:34:27
you would expect to see
for this chromate ion?

710
00:34:27 --> 00:34:50
All right, let's take 10
more seconds on this.

711
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
All right.
 

712
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
This is good.
 

713
00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
I know this is a real split
response, but the right answer

714
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59
is the one that is indicated in
the graph here that it's four.

715
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
This takes a little bit of time
to get used to thinking about

716
00:35:02 --> 00:35:04
all the different Lewis
structures you can have.

717
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
So, you guys should all go back
home if you can't see it

718
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
immediately right now and try
drawing out those four other

719
00:35:10 --> 00:35:13
Lewis structures, for chromate,
there are four others.

720
00:35:13 --> 00:35:16
You'll probably get a chance to
literally do this example in

721
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
recitation where you draw out
all four, but it's even better

722
00:35:19 --> 00:35:22
to make sure you understand it
before you get to that point.

723
00:35:22 --> 00:35:25
So, we can go back
to the class notes.

724
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
So it turns out there's four
other Lewis structures, so

725
00:35:28 --> 00:35:30
basically just think about
all the other different

726
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
combinations where you can have
single and double bonds, and

727
00:35:33 --> 00:35:35
when you draw those out,
you end up with four.

728
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
So, for every single one of
these Lewis structures, we

729
00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
could figure out what the
formal charges are, and what we

730
00:35:40 --> 00:35:43
would find is that it's 0 on
the chromium, it's 0 for the

731
00:35:43 --> 00:35:46
double bonded oxygens, and it's
going to be negative 1 for

732
00:35:46 --> 00:35:48
the single bonded oxygens.
 

733
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
So, what you can see is that
in this situation, we end up

734
00:35:52 --> 00:35:55
having less formal charge
separation, and that's what

735
00:35:55 --> 00:35:58
we're looking for, that's
the more stable structure.

736
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
So any time you can have an
expanded octet -- an expanded

737
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
valence shell, where you have n
is equal to or greater than 3,

738
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
and by expanding and adding
more electrons into that

739
00:36:09 --> 00:36:12
valence shell, you lower
the charge separation,

740
00:36:12 --> 00:36:13
you want to do that.
 

741
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
I also want to point out, I
basically said there's 6

742
00:36:17 --> 00:36:19
different ways we can draw
this in terms of drawing all

743
00:36:19 --> 00:36:20
the resonance structures.
 

744
00:36:20 --> 00:36:23
You might be wondering if you
have to figure out the formal

745
00:36:23 --> 00:36:25
charge for each structure
individually, and the answer is

746
00:36:25 --> 00:36:28
no, you can pick any single
structure and the formal

747
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
charges will work out the same.
 

748
00:36:30 --> 00:36:32
So, for example, if you pick
this structure and your friend

749
00:36:32 --> 00:36:35
picks this structure, you'll
both get the right answer that

750
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
there's just the negative 1 on
the oxygens and no other formal

751
00:36:39 --> 00:36:42
charges in the molecule.
 

752
00:36:42 --> 00:36:42
All right.
 

753
00:36:42 --> 00:36:45
So those are the end of our
exceptions to the octet rule

754
00:36:45 --> 00:36:47
for Lewis structures, that's
everything we're going to

755
00:36:47 --> 00:36:49
say about Lewis structures.
 

756
00:36:49 --> 00:36:52
And remember, that when we talk
about Lewis structures, what

757
00:36:52 --> 00:36:55
they tell us is the electron
configuration in covalent

758
00:36:55 --> 00:36:58
bonds, so that valence shell
electron configuration.

759
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
So we talked a lot about
covalent bonds before we got

760
00:37:02 --> 00:37:05
into Lewis structures, and then
how to represent covalent

761
00:37:05 --> 00:37:07
bonds by Lewis structures.
 

762
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
So now I'll say a little bit
about ionic bonds, which are

763
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
the other extreme, and when you
have an ionic bond, what you

764
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
have now is a complete transfer
of either one or many

765
00:37:18 --> 00:37:20
electrons between two atoms.
 

766
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
So the key word for covalent
bond was electron sharing,

767
00:37:24 --> 00:37:27
the key word for ionic
bonds is electron transfer.

768
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
And the bonding between the two
atoms ends up resulting from an

769
00:37:31 --> 00:37:33
attraction that we're very
familiar with, which is the

770
00:37:33 --> 00:37:36
Coulomb or the electrostatic
attraction between the

771
00:37:36 --> 00:37:41
negatively charged and the
positively charged ions.

772
00:37:41 --> 00:37:42
So let's take an example.
 

773
00:37:42 --> 00:37:45
The easiest one to think about
is where we have a negative

774
00:37:45 --> 00:37:47
1 and a positive 1 ion.
 

775
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
So this is salt, n a c l --
actually lots of things are

776
00:37:51 --> 00:37:54
call salt, but this is what
we think of a table salt.

777
00:37:54 --> 00:37:57
So, let's think about what we
have to do if we want the form

778
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
sodium chloride from the
neutral sodium and

779
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
chlorine atoms.
 

780
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
So, the first thing that we're
going to need to do is we need

781
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
to convert sodium
into sodium plus.

782
00:38:08 --> 00:38:10
What does this process
look like to you?

783
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
Is this one of those
periodic trends, perhaps?

784
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
Can anyone name what
we're looking at here?

785
00:38:17 --> 00:38:18
Exactly, ionization energy.
 

786
00:38:18 --> 00:38:21
So, if we're going to talk
about the energy difference

787
00:38:21 --> 00:38:24
here, what we're going to be
talking about is the ionization

788
00:38:24 --> 00:38:28
energy, or the energy it takes
to rip off an electron from

789
00:38:28 --> 00:38:32
sodium in order to form
the sodium plus ion.

790
00:38:32 --> 00:38:37
So, we can just put right here,
that's 494 kilojoules per mole.

791
00:38:37 --> 00:38:39
The next thing that we want to
look at is chlorine, so in

792
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
terms of chlorine we need to go
to chlorine minus, so we

793
00:38:42 --> 00:38:44
actually need to
add an electron.

794
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
This is actually the reverse
of one of the periodic

795
00:38:47 --> 00:38:49
trends we talked about.
 

796
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
Which trend is that this
is the reverse of?

797
00:38:53 --> 00:38:54
Electron affinity, right.
 

798
00:38:54 --> 00:38:57
Because if we go backwards
we're saying how badly

799
00:38:57 --> 00:38:59
does chlorine want
to grab an electron?

800
00:38:59 --> 00:39:02
Chlorine wants to do this very
badly, and it turns out the

801
00:39:02 --> 00:39:05
electron affinity for chlorine
is huge, it's 349 kilojoules

802
00:39:05 --> 00:39:08
per mole, but remember, we're
going in reverse, so we need to

803
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
talk about it as negative
349 kilojoules per mole.

804
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
So if we talk about the sum of
what's happening here, what we

805
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
need to do is think about going
from the neutrals to the ions,

806
00:39:21 --> 00:39:24
so we can just add those two
energies together, and what we

807
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
end up with is plus 145
kilojoules per mole, in order

808
00:39:28 --> 00:39:33
to go from neutral sodium
in chlorine to the ions.

809
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
So, the problem here is that we
have to actually put energy

810
00:39:36 --> 00:39:39
into our system, so this
doesn't seem favorable, right.

811
00:39:39 --> 00:39:42
What's favorable is when we
actually get energy out and our

812
00:39:42 --> 00:39:45
energy gets lower, but what
we're saying here is that we

813
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47
actually need to put in energy.
 

814
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
So another way to say this
is this process actually

815
00:39:50 --> 00:39:51
requires energy.
 

816
00:39:51 --> 00:39:55
It does not emit energy, it
does not give off excess

817
00:39:55 --> 00:39:57
energy, it requires energy.
 

818
00:39:57 --> 00:40:00
So, we need to think about how
can we solve this problem in

819
00:40:00 --> 00:40:03
terms of thinking about
ionic bonds, and the answer

820
00:40:03 --> 00:40:04
is Coulomb attraction.
 

821
00:40:04 --> 00:40:07
So there's one more force that
we need to talk about, and that

822
00:40:07 --> 00:40:10
is when we talk about the
attraction between the

823
00:40:10 --> 00:40:13
negatively and the positively
charged ions, such that

824
00:40:13 --> 00:40:15
we form sodium chloride.
 

825
00:40:15 --> 00:40:18
So this process here has a
delta energy, a change in

826
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
energy of negative 589
kilojoules per mole.

827
00:40:22 --> 00:40:24
So that's huge, we're
giving off a lot of energy

828
00:40:24 --> 00:40:26
by this attraction.
 

829
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
So if we add up the net energy
for all of this process,

830
00:40:30 --> 00:40:35
all we need to do is add
negative 589 to plus 145.

831
00:40:35 --> 00:40:38
So what we end up getting is
the net energy change is going

832
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
to be negative 444 kilojoules
per mole, so you can see that,

833
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
in fact, it is very favorable
for neutral sodium and neutral

834
00:40:46 --> 00:40:53
chloride to form sodium
chloride in an ionic bond.

835
00:40:53 --> 00:40:56
And the net increase then,
is a decrease in energy.

836
00:40:56 --> 00:40:59
So, I just gave you the number
in terms of what that Coulomb

837
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
potential would be in
attraction, but we can I easily

838
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
calculate it as well using this
equation here where the energy

839
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
is equal to the charge on each
of the ions, and this is just

840
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
multiplied by the value of
charge for an electron divided

841
00:41:14 --> 00:41:19
by 4 pi epsilon nought times r,
are r is just the distance in

842
00:41:19 --> 00:41:22
terms of the bond length
we could talk about.

843
00:41:22 --> 00:41:24
So, let's calculate and make
sure that I didn't tell

844
00:41:24 --> 00:41:25
you a false number here.
 

845
00:41:25 --> 00:41:28
Let's say we do the calculation
with the bond length that

846
00:41:28 --> 00:41:30
we've looked up, which is 2 .
 

847
00:41:30 --> 00:41:33
3 6 angstroms for the
bond length between

848
00:41:33 --> 00:41:34
sodium and chloride.
 

849
00:41:34 --> 00:41:37
So we should be able to
figure out the Coulombic

850
00:41:37 --> 00:41:37
attraction for this.
 

851
00:41:37 --> 00:41:47
So, if we talk about the energy
of attraction, we need to

852
00:41:47 --> 00:41:52
multiply plus 1, that's the
charge on the sodium, times

853
00:41:52 --> 00:41:56
minus 1, the charge on the
chlorine, times the charge

854
00:41:56 --> 00:41:58
in an electron, 1 .
 

855
00:41:58 --> 00:42:04
6 0 2 times 10 the negative 19
Coulombs, and that's all

856
00:42:04 --> 00:42:12
divided by 4 pi, and then I've
written out epsilon nought in

857
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
your notes, so I won't
write it on the board.

858
00:42:14 --> 00:42:17
And then r, so r is
going to be 2 .

859
00:42:17 --> 00:42:23
3 6 and times -- what
is angstrom, everyone?

860
00:42:23 --> 00:42:26
Yup, 10 to the negative 10.
 

861
00:42:26 --> 00:42:30
So 10 to the
negative 10 meters.

862
00:42:30 --> 00:42:34
So, if we do this calculation
here, what we end up with is

863
00:42:34 --> 00:42:42
negative 9.774 times 10 to
the negative 19 joules.

864
00:42:42 --> 00:42:46
So that's what we have
in terms of our energy.

865
00:42:46 --> 00:42:49
That does not look the same
as what we saw -- yup,

866
00:42:49 --> 00:42:49
do you have a question?
 

867
00:42:49 --> 00:42:54
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

868
00:42:54 --> 00:42:56
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

869
00:42:56 --> 00:42:58
Luckily, although, I did not
write it in my own notes, I

870
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
did it when I put in my
calculator, thank you.

871
00:43:01 --> 00:43:03
So you need to square this
value here and then you

872
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
should get this value
right here, negative 9.77.

873
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
All right, so what we need to
do though is convert from

874
00:43:11 --> 00:43:13
joules into kilojoules per
mole, because that's

875
00:43:13 --> 00:43:14
what we were using.
 

876
00:43:14 --> 00:43:22
So if we multiply that number
there by kilojoules per mole --

877
00:43:22 --> 00:43:27
or excuse me, first kilojoules
per joule, so we have 1

878
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
joules in every kilojoule.
 

879
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
And then we multiply that by
Avagadro's number, 6.022

880
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
times 10 to the 23 per mole.
 

881
00:43:40 --> 00:43:48
What we end up with is negative
589 kilojoules per mole.

882
00:43:48 --> 00:43:51
So this is that same Coulombic
attraction that we saw

883
00:43:51 --> 00:43:53
in the first place.
 

884
00:43:53 --> 00:43:57
So, notice that you will
naturally get out a negative

885
00:43:57 --> 00:43:59
charge here, remember negative
means an attractive force in

886
00:43:59 --> 00:44:05
this case, because you have the
plus and the minus 1 in here.

887
00:44:05 --> 00:44:09
So we should be able to easily
do that calculation, and what

888
00:44:09 --> 00:44:12
we end up getting matches up
with what I just told you,

889
00:44:12 --> 00:44:14
luckily, and thank you for
catching the square, that's an

890
00:44:14 --> 00:44:17
important part in getting
the right answer.

891
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
So, experimentally then, what
we find is that the change in

892
00:44:21 --> 00:44:23
energy for this reaction
is negative 444

893
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
kilojoules per mole.
 

894
00:44:25 --> 00:44:28
If we look experimentally what
we see, it's actually a little

895
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
bit different, it's negative
411 kilojoules per mole.

896
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
So, in terms of this class,
this is the method that we're

897
00:44:36 --> 00:44:38
going to use, and we're going
to say this gets us close

898
00:44:38 --> 00:44:41
enough such that we can make
comparisons and have a

899
00:44:41 --> 00:44:43
meaningful conversations about
different types of ionic bonds

900
00:44:43 --> 00:44:46
and the attraction
between them.

901
00:44:46 --> 00:44:49
But let's think about where
this discrepancy comes from,

902
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
and before I do that I want to
point out, one term we use

903
00:44:53 --> 00:44:56
a lot is change in energy
for a reaction where, for

904
00:44:56 --> 00:44:58
example, you break a bond.
 

905
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
Remember that the negative
of the change in energy is

906
00:45:02 --> 00:45:04
what's called delta e sub d.
 

907
00:45:04 --> 00:45:07
We first saw this when
we first introduced the

908
00:45:07 --> 00:45:08
idea of covalent bonds.
 

909
00:45:08 --> 00:45:14
Do you remember what this term
here means, delta e sub d?

910
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
A little bit and some no's,
which this was pre-exam, I

911
00:45:17 --> 00:45:19
understand, you still need
to review those notes,

912
00:45:19 --> 00:45:21
it's dissociation energy.
 

913
00:45:21 --> 00:45:24
So you get a negative energy
out by breaking the bond.

914
00:45:24 --> 00:45:29
The dissociation energy means
how much energy that bond is

915
00:45:29 --> 00:45:32
worth in terms of strength, so
it's the opposite of the energy

916
00:45:32 --> 00:45:35
you get out of breaking the
bond -- or excuse me, the

917
00:45:35 --> 00:45:37
energy that you get out
of forming the bond.

918
00:45:37 --> 00:45:40
It's the amount of energy you
need to put in to break the

919
00:45:40 --> 00:45:42
bond is dissociation energy.
 

920
00:45:42 --> 00:45:44
It takes this much energy
to dissociate your

921
00:45:44 --> 00:45:44
bond, excuse me.
 

922
00:45:44 --> 00:45:45
All right.
 

923
00:45:45 --> 00:45:48
So, let's take a look here at
our predictions, so I just put

924
00:45:48 --> 00:45:51
them both ways so we
don't get confused.

925
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
The dissociation energy is 444.
 

926
00:45:53 --> 00:45:55
The change in energy
for forming the bond

927
00:45:55 --> 00:45:57
is negative 444.
 

928
00:45:57 --> 00:46:00
We made the following
approximations, which explain

929
00:46:00 --> 00:46:02
why, in fact, we got a
different experimental

930
00:46:02 --> 00:46:04
energy, if we look at that.
 

931
00:46:04 --> 00:46:06
The first thing is
that we ignored any

932
00:46:06 --> 00:46:07
repulsive interactions.
 

933
00:46:07 --> 00:46:12
If you think about salt, it's
not just two single atoms

934
00:46:12 --> 00:46:13
that you are talking about.
 

935
00:46:13 --> 00:46:16
It's actually in a whole
network or whole lattice of

936
00:46:16 --> 00:46:18
other molecules, so you
actually have some other

937
00:46:18 --> 00:46:21
chlorines around that are going
to be having repulsive

938
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
interactions with our chlorine
that we're talking about.

939
00:46:25 --> 00:46:27
We're going to ignore those,
make the approximation that

940
00:46:27 --> 00:46:30
those don't matter, at this
point, in these calculations.

941
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
And the result for that is
that we end up with a larger

942
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
dissociation energy than
the experimental value.

943
00:46:36 --> 00:46:38
That's because the bond is
going to be a little bit more

944
00:46:38 --> 00:46:42
broken than it was in our
calculation, because we do have

945
00:46:42 --> 00:46:44
these repulsive interactions.
 

946
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
The other thing that we did is
that we treated both sodium and

947
00:46:48 --> 00:46:51
the chlorine as point charges.
 

948
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
And this is what actually
allowed us to make this

949
00:46:53 --> 00:46:56
calculation and calculate the
Coulomb potential so easily,

950
00:46:56 --> 00:46:58
we just treated them as
if they're point charges.

951
00:46:58 --> 00:47:01
We're ignoring quantum
mechanics in this -- this is

952
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
sort of the class where we
ignore quantum mechanics, we

953
00:47:04 --> 00:47:06
ignored it for Lewis
structures, we're

954
00:47:06 --> 00:47:06
ignoring it here.
 

955
00:47:06 --> 00:47:10
We will be back to paying a
lot of attention to quantum

956
00:47:10 --> 00:47:13
mechanics in lecture 14 when we
talk about MO theory, but for

957
00:47:13 --> 00:47:16
now, these are approximations,
these are models where we don't

958
00:47:16 --> 00:47:18
take it into consideration.
 

959
00:47:18 --> 00:47:21
And I think you'll agree that
we come reasonably close such

960
00:47:21 --> 00:47:23
that we'll be able to make
comparisons between different

961
00:47:23 --> 00:47:24
kinds of ionic bonds.
 

962
00:47:24 --> 00:47:27
All right.
 

963
00:47:27 --> 00:47:29
So, the last thing I want to
introduce today is talking

964
00:47:29 --> 00:47:31
about polar covalent bonds.
 

965
00:47:31 --> 00:47:34
We've now covered
the two extremes.

966
00:47:34 --> 00:47:38
One extreme is complete total
electron sharing -- if we have

967
00:47:38 --> 00:47:41
a perfectly covalent bond,
we have perfect sharing.

968
00:47:41 --> 00:47:45
The other is electron transfer
in terms of ionic bonds.

969
00:47:45 --> 00:47:49
So when we talk about a polar
covalent bond, what we're now

970
00:47:49 --> 00:47:52
talking about is an unequal
sharing of electrons

971
00:47:52 --> 00:47:54
between two atoms.
 

972
00:47:54 --> 00:47:56
So, this is essentially
something we've seen before, we

973
00:47:56 --> 00:47:59
just never formally talked
about what we would call it.

974
00:47:59 --> 00:48:02
This is any time you have a
bond forming between two

975
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
non-metals that have different
electronegativities, so, for

976
00:48:06 --> 00:48:10
example, hydrogen
choride, h c l.

977
00:48:10 --> 00:48:13
The electronegativity for
hydrogen is 2.2, for

978
00:48:13 --> 00:48:15
chlorine it's 3.2.
 

979
00:48:15 --> 00:48:19
And in general, what we say is
we consider a difference in

980
00:48:19 --> 00:48:22
terms of a first approximation
if the difference in

981
00:48:22 --> 00:48:24
electronegativity
is more than 0.

982
00:48:24 --> 00:48:27
5, so this is on the Pauling
electronegativity scale.

983
00:48:27 --> 00:48:31
So what we end up having is we
sort of have a kind of, and

984
00:48:31 --> 00:48:34
what we call it is a partial
negative charge on the

985
00:48:34 --> 00:48:37
chlorine, and a partial
positive charge

986
00:48:37 --> 00:48:38
in the hydrogen.
 

987
00:48:38 --> 00:48:41
The reason we have that is
because the chlorine's more

988
00:48:41 --> 00:48:43
electronegative, it wants to
pull more of that shared

989
00:48:43 --> 00:48:45
electron density to itself.
 

990
00:48:45 --> 00:48:47
If it has more electron
density, it's going to have a

991
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
little bit of a negative charge
and the hydrogen's going to be

992
00:48:50 --> 00:48:53
left with a little bit
of a positive charge.

993
00:48:53 --> 00:48:56
So, we can compare this, for
example to, molecular hydrogen

994
00:48:56 --> 00:48:58
where they're going to have
that complete sharing, so

995
00:48:58 --> 00:49:02
there's not going to be a delta
plus or a delta minus, delta is

996
00:49:02 --> 00:49:05
going to be equal to zero
on each of the atoms.

997
00:49:05 --> 00:49:09
They are completely
sharing their electrons.

998
00:49:09 --> 00:49:13
And we can also explain this in
another way by talking about a

999
00:49:13 --> 00:49:16
dipole moment where we have a
charged distribution that

1000
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
results in this dipole,
this electric dipole.

1001
00:49:19 --> 00:49:22
And we talk about this using
the term mu, which is a

1002
00:49:22 --> 00:49:24
measurement of what
the dipole is.

1003
00:49:24 --> 00:49:28
A dipole is always written in
terms of writing an arrow from

1004
00:49:28 --> 00:49:31
the positive charge to
the negative charge.

1005
00:49:31 --> 00:49:33
In chemistry, we are always
incredibly interested in what

1006
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
the electrons are doing, so we
tend to pay attention to

1007
00:49:36 --> 00:49:37
them in terms of arrows.
 

1008
00:49:37 --> 00:49:40
Oh, the electrons are going
over to the chlorine, so we're

1009
00:49:40 --> 00:49:43
going to draw our arrow
toward the chlorine atom.

1010
00:49:43 --> 00:49:47
So, we measure this here, so
mu is equal to q times r, the

1011
00:49:47 --> 00:49:49
distance between the two.
 

1012
00:49:49 --> 00:49:52
And q, that charge is just
equal to the partial negative

1013
00:49:52 --> 00:49:57
or the partial positive times
the charge on the electron.

1014
00:49:57 --> 00:50:00
So this is measured in Coulomb
meters, you won't ever

1015
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
see a measurement of
electronegativity in Coulomb

1016
00:50:03 --> 00:50:08
meters -- we tend to talk about
it in terms of debye or 1 d, or

1017
00:50:08 --> 00:50:13
sometimes there's no units at
all, so the d is just assumed,

1018
00:50:13 --> 00:50:16
and it's because 1 debye is
just equal to this very tiny

1019
00:50:16 --> 00:50:18
number of Coulomb meters
and it's a lot easier to

1020
00:50:18 --> 00:50:21
work with debye's here.
 

1021
00:50:21 --> 00:50:25
So, when we talk about polar
molecules, we can actually

1022
00:50:25 --> 00:50:29
extend our idea of talking
about polar bonds to talking

1023
00:50:29 --> 00:50:30
about polar molecules.
 

1024
00:50:30 --> 00:50:32
So, actually let's start
with that on Monday.

1025
00:50:32 --> 00:50:35
So everyone have
a great weekend.
