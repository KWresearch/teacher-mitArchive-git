PROFESSOR: OK, so we're going to leave off where we were last time talking about 
buffers. And I'm a big fan of buffers, actually, and buffers are extremely useful in my 
research because they keep the p h of things constant. So if you're going to do any 
kind of biology research or biochemistry research, you need to know about buffers. 
And as I'll mentioned later, also your body needs to be buffered appropriately, you 
don't want a large changes in p h in your body or things won't function properly. So 
buffering is very important. 

So let's go over buffers. So if we talk about an acid buffer, that's something that's 
buffering on the acidic side of the p h range. And in that, you want to have play on 
both sides. So if you have a strong acid, it can be neutralized, the p h stays the 
same. If you had a strong base, that would be neutralized so the p h stays the same. 
So what happens, you have to have an acid and its conjugate base in the mixture to 
have a good buffer. 

So what the weak acid is going to do is it will transfer protons or hydrogen ions to 
hydroxide ions that are supplied by the strong base to neutralize that strong base 
that was added. So you need to have an acid in there that's capable of giving up a 
proton to neutralize the hydroxide ion that was added. You also need to have a 
conjugate base. The conjugate base is going to accept protons if an acid is added, 
thereby neutralizing the effect of that added acid. So again, you need a weak acid 
and its conjugate base, you need both to have a good buffer. 

So I've been talking about weak acids and weak conjugate bases, so why would a 
strong acid and the salt of its conjugate base not make a good buffer? What do 
strong acids do? They dissociate almost completely, and that's not going to do you 
any good. You want to be able to shift that equation both directions. So a strong acid 
goes to completion is going to drive it to the right, and for a good buffer you want to 
be able to switch things around that if you add a strong acid, then you neutralize 
that, you add a strong base, you neutralize it. So you need the conjugate to be 
effective as a base, and a strong acid has an ineffective conjugate base. It's not good 
as a base at all, so that won't work. So buffers are made up of weak acids and their 
conjugate bases, or weak bases and their conjugate acids. They need to be in the 
weak range or there's no buffering capacity. 

So let's look at a base buffer example. The only difference here is that a basic buffer 
is going to buffer on the basic end of the p h range. So here's an equation. We have 
a base in water forming a conjugate of that weak base and hydroxide ions. So let's 
think about what happens if a strong acid is added. Well if a strong acid is added, 

then this base, n h 3, can accept protons from the incoming acid and make more n h 
4 plus, thereby removing the strong acid from the solution and neutralizing the p h. 

If on the other hand a strong base is added, n h 4 plus or ammonium ions can 
donate the proton forming its conjugate base in water, and again, the p h remains 
about the same. So the base and its conjugate acid can both react, neutralizing the p 
h. 

So in the base buffer acid, a weak base, b, will accept protons supplied by the strong 
acid, removing a strong acid from the solution. The conjugate acid of that weak 
base, which again, would be a weak acid, can transfer protons to the hydroxide ions 
added by the strong base, again, neutralizing the effect there. 

So a buffer is a mixture of a weak acid base conjugate pair that will stabilize the p h 
serving as a source or a sink for the added protons. So that's how a buffer works. 

So, I mentioned buffering is very important. It's very important in your blood. Your 
blood is buffered in the range of p h 7 . 35 to 7 . 45, and you have a buffering pair 
and a conjugate acid base pair that's in your blood that does to work. So nature has 
its own buffering system design to keep the p h of your blood constant. 

Well what happens if the p h of your blood changes? So let me just tell you about 
one disease that can change the p h of your blood. This is from a vitamin B12 
dependent enzyme called methylmalonic coa mutase, and this enzyme is your friend. 
I think that most of you are excited about the idea of having all your fat go to 
energy, so you should be all fan of this enzyme. So it breaks down from fatty acids -
- you get methylmalonyl coa, which is converted to succinyl coa and goes into the 
citric acid cycle. But if this step is blocked, if there's some kind of genetic disease 
associated with that particular enzyme, you get a condition called methylmalonic 
aciduria. 

So this is excreted in the body, it can't be converted to the succinyl coa, so it has to 
be excreted from the body, and it has an acidic p h. And so when it's excreted, it will 
actually, there's a large amount of it, and it can change the p h of blood. So even 
though you have this buffering system, it can overwhelm the buffering system and 
cause a change in the p h, which can lead to neurological disorders and sometimes 
death. 

So they can look for this in newborns, they can do a test, and I was -- one of the 
tests is -- it's not in every state, but it is in Massachusetts, so my daughter, 
Samantha, had this test. But they can simply look at the urine of a newborn and look 
at the p h and whether any of this is being excreted. And some infants that have this 
condition can excrete like a gram of this acid a day. So it's really large quantities of 
acid that are excreted and it goes beyond the buffering capacity. 

So, I'm going to tell you a little story and it sort of emphasizes some of the 
importance of genetic research. So before the human genome project, scientists 
were trying to find the gene to figure out what was wrong with these patients that 
had this condition. And here are all the amino acids translated from the gene. This is 
not a small protein, that's a lot of amino acids. And they found that the problem was 
right here, or one of the main problems is right here. There's a glycine residue, 
which glycine is the smallest amino acid and that had been changed to something 
else and that led to the disease. 

Now I want you to imagine if you were parents of a small child and you found out 
your child had this condition and then you had heard that there were advances, they 
now know what caused it, and so, they went to the doctor and the doctor said, yes, 
your child, the DNA is wrong, and so let's substitute a different amino acid for glycine 
here. OK. What does that do for you? Like why is that a problem? Well, they didn't 
know why it was a problem, they just knew that it had the wrong amino acid in 
there. 

And so, the next step was to try to understand what was actually going on. So what 
happened in this case was that the vitamin B12 cofactor had changed its 
conformation when it bound to the protein. And instead of having this sort of loop 
structure here, it had more of a tail. So this base here had moved down, and so 
there was a different shape to the vitamin than had been expected. 

So when the first structure was solved of one of these enzymes, it found that here's 
kind of what the vitamin B12 looked like, it had this extended region which no one 
was expecting, and so that had to fit into the protein. So this is the domain of the 
protein that binds the vitamin, and it had a large hole, and you put these together 
and that's great, it fits and you have happy enzyme. Well, how do you create a hole 
-- nature supposedly abhors a vacuum, so how do you have this hole? Well, what 
nature did was it put the smallest amino acids there are, glycines, right along here to 
make room for this to fit together. 

So, what was happening in this genetic case is that the switch of a glycine to an 
argenine did this to the hole. So, what people were trying to do is treat these 
patients with extra B12, you give them injections of it, you have a lot more B12, and 
you want to the B12 to bind and get the activity back going again. But really, no 
matter how much vitamin B12 you added to it, it wasn't really going to do much 
good, it just wasn't going to fit. 

So instead, there was a suggestion that instead of giving the whole vitamin, perhaps 
you could just give a truncated version of the vitamin, which was commercially 
available, and that that might bind and restore activity of the protein. So this is what 
was suggested once you knew what the problem actually was. 

So this is just an example of a genetic disease, and it's not that common, but as I 
said, it is tested for here in Massachusetts. And how knowing something about what 
the problem is can lead to a potential solution. But for most of you, your blood is 
doing just fine, you don't have a genetic condition which is pumping too much acid 
into your bloodstream, so that nature's buffering capacity is working quite well. 

So buffers are important. It's great to have my important statements emphasized up 
there. We've been rehearsing at home. OK. So let's do a sample buffer problem. All 
right, suppose we have an acid, 0.1 moles of an acid, and 0.5 moles of its conjugate 
base added in the form of a salt. And so they're put into water and diluted to 1.0 
liter. And you're given information about the k a of the acid, 1 . 77 times 10 to the 
minus 4, and you're asked to calculate the p h. So what do you do? 

All right, first, it's always good to write the equation that you're talking about. And so 
you have acid in water forming hydronium ions and the conjugate base. So here, the 
acid is giving up a proton to the water, forming h 3 o plus and it's conjugate base. 

Now we want to think about what happens at equilibrium. So we know how many 
moles we have and we know what the total volume is. And in this table we should be 
using molarity, but the math here is pretty easy because we have 1 mole and 1 liter 
or 1, and 0.5 moles in 1 liter or 0.5 for molarity. And now at equilibrium what's going 
to happen, well, when this equilibrates some of this will go away and more of these 
are going to be formed. 

So we have minus x over here, plus x and plus x over there, and we add it all 
together you get 1 minus x plus x and 0.5 plus x. So the important thing to 
remember is in buffering problems, you have the acid and the conjugate. So we're 
used to seeing these tables where we only have something over here and it's all zero 
on the other side. But in a buffering problem, you have things on both sides from the 
very beginning. And that's a really important point, and that alone, if you can 
remember that, will get you a long way through this unit. So you remember that in a 
buffer you got to have both an acid in its conjugate base or a base in its conjugate 
acid. 

So here we're talking about an acid in water, it's an acidic buffer, and so we can use 
our k a value -- we want to know what the concentrations are at equilibrium to 
calculate our p h. So we can use our k a and we can set it up, so we have on the top 
products over reactants, and we we're not including water in this because it's dilute 
in solution and so it's not changing very much. And now we can plug in our values, 
so we have 0.5 plus x, x over 1 minus x. 

All right, now this is just written again from the last slide, we can try an 
approximation, which is it that x is small compared to 1 molar or 0.5 molar. And so 
we can get rid of the plus x and the minus x down here and just have one x term, 
which makes it simpler to solve, but we'll have to go back and check that 
approximation in a few minutes. 

So making that approximation, we can calculate x as 3 . 54 times 10 to the minus 4 
molar, and now we need to check that assumption. Well, you can probably guess it's 
going to be OK, because something times 10 to the minus 4 compared to 0.5 and 1, 
that's probably going to be OK that it's small. But our assumption here is that it 
needs to be less than 5%, and here it's 0.1%. So you could just take this value of x, 
divide it by the smaller of the two, 0.5 , times 100, and calculate the percent 
ionization. If it's less than 5% you're OK, if it's more you need to use the quadratic 
equation to solve the problem. 

So x here is our concentration of hydronium ion, which is great, because then we can 
easily calculate the p h. So p h again is minus log of the hydronium ion 
concentration, and so the p h here is 3 . 45. And again, significant figures, we'll be 
talking about this as we go through. The volume had two, it was 1 . liters, and so 
we're going to have two significant figures after the decimal point, because the 
volume was limiting insignificant figures. 

All right, now let's consider what happens if some strong acid had been added in the 
solution. So the volume is still going to be 1 liter, because the acid was added in 
before we went up to the 1 liter mark. 

So strong acids, they go to completion. So, if we added 0.1 moles of that strong 
acid, it will react with equal number of moles of the conjugate base to form the 

conjugate acid. So we can just do subtractions here. We don't have to worry about 
setting up any kind of equilibrium, we assume it goes completely. 

So for the conjugate base we had 0.5 moles before, and it's going to be reacting 
then with a strong acid, so 0.1 of those will react, leaving us with 0.4 moles of the 
conjugate, and that's in 1 liter. So now we have 0.4 molar. For the acid, we had 1 
mole to begin with, but now we formed more as they reaction has taken place, and 
so we have 0.1 more. Now we have 1 . 1 moles again in 1 liter. 

So now we can do the same thing again. So after this has happened, after we have 
added the strong acid, then a new equilibrium is going to be reached. And so we can 
plug in this table as well. So we have 1 . 1 now over here, and 0.4 on the other side. 
As equilibrium is approached, you lose some of the acid as it reacts with water and 
ionizes and you form more of the h 3 o plus and more of the conjugate. So we have 
1 . 1 minus x, x, and 0.4 plus x. 

So again, the trick here is just to remember that there is a reaction with a strong 
acid that has been added, and you need to figure out the new molarities, and then 
go back to your equilibrium table with those new molarities. 

So here we can set up with a k a again, and do the same problem that we did 
before. And so, we can make the assumption again that x is small, try it out and see 
if it works. X turns out to be 4 . 87 times 10 to the minus 4 molars -- so again, it's a 
small number. And so, it turns out to be 1 . -- less than 1% of 0.4 . If it's less than 
5% of the smaller number, you don't have to worry about the bigger number, and so 
your assumption is OK, you don't need to use the quadratic equation. And so, then 
we can calculate at the end that the p h is now 3 . 31, again, two significant figures 
after the decimal place because of the volume. So addition of 0.1 moles of a strong 
acid changed our p h from 3 . 45 to 3 . 31. So we buffered pretty well. There was a 
change in p h, we added acid and the p h did go down, but not by an enormous 
amount. And so, that's because this turned out to be a pretty decent buffer here, so 
we didn't have a really huge effect. 

So, those are -- that's an example of a buffer problem. 

So, let's think for a minute about designing a buffer. Suppose you wanted to create a 
buffer at a particular p h, what do you need to think about? Well, you need to think 
about the ratio of your acid to the conjugate, and you need to think about the p k a 
of the acid, and the p h that's desired. 

So here is a generic equation for an acid in water, so we have our acid, h a, in water 
forming hydronium ions and our conjugate base. And now we're going to do a little 
derivation to come up with an equation that would be useful to you in thinking about 
buffers and designing buffers. 

So, we can write a generic term for k a. K a equals products over reactants, and so 
we have our hydronium ions are conjugate base over our acid. And now we can take 
this term and rearrange it. So we can pull a hydronium ion concentration over to one 
side. And now we're going to take the logs of both sides, so we get the log of 
hydronium ion concentration, the log of k a, and the log of h a concentration over a 
minus concentration, and now we're going to multiply everything by negative sign, 
so we have minus logs of things. And I'm just going to move this now up to the top 
of the screen, and we have this equation. 

So what is minus log of hydronium ion concentration? P h. What's minus log of k a? P 
k a. So, we have p h equals p k a minus the log of a concentration of your acid over 
the concentration of your conjugate base. And these are equilibrium concentrations 
for that, because remember, we derived it from our equilibrium expression for k a. 
But a lot of times when you're working buffer problems, you know the concentrations 
that you added of these things, not necessarily the concentrations of equilibrium. 

And if we rewrite this expression in terms of the initial concentrations or original or o 
concentrations, then we have p h is approximately equal to p k a minus log of the 
initial concentrations of your acid over your conjugate base. And this is known as a 
Henderson Hasselbalch equation. And people love the Henderson Hasselbalch 
equation, and it can be incredibly useful to you in solving these problems. But I'm 
going to emphasize when it's OK to use it and when it's not OK to use it, because 
people try to apply it to everything, and it's for buffer problems, and people apply it 
to all sorts of things that are not buffer problems. So I want to make sure that it's 
clear when you can use it and when you can't use it. And it's fine to use it and you 
should use it when it's acceptable, but not at other times. It's one of the few 
equations in acid base, so people get very excited by it. 

All right, so remember that it's really equal when they're at equilibrium 
concentrations, and this is just an approximation that we're saying that those are 
initial concentrations. So when is it OK to say well, the equilibrium concentration is 
more or less the same as the initial concentration. And that's true when x, which is in 
this particular example your hydronium ion concentration, is small compared to your 
initial concentration of the acid and the conjugate base that you added to the buffer. 
So, and when x is small, then pretty much, the equilibrium concentration equals the 
initial concentration. So there's not really very much change if x is a really small 
number. 

So, a lot of the time this is true. Remember, we're making buffers from weak acids 
and weak conjugate bases, and the definition of a weak acid is that it only loses a 
tiny fraction of its protons. It only ionizes slightly in water. And a weak base typically 
only accepts a fraction of the protons it can accept. It's a weak base, so it's not doing 
a whole lot of chemistry there. So this approximation is good a lot of the time. So 
just you know when you can and can not use it, we're going to give a rule and say 
it's the same rule as before. When we say when x is small or your hydronium ion 
concentration is small compared to the acid or the conjugate base, when it's less 
than 5%, that's what we're going to call small, so the same rule we've been using all 
along. When x is small, this approximation works pretty well. And you can plug in 
your concentrations right there -- your initial concentrations not your equilibrium 
concentrations. 

All right, so let's use Henderson Hasselbalch and design a buffer system if we want a 
p h of 4 . 6. And a good rule to remember is that a buffering solution is most 
effective when it's plus or minus 1 away from the p k a. So that's a good thing too I 
keep in mind for research as well. If you're really far away from the p k a, it's not 
going to be a good buffering system, and this is a mistake the people make in the 
lab sometimes, so you may run into that in some of your laboratory courses. 

So we want a buffer about p h 4 . 6. So we can look at our ionization constants of 
acid, and of course, we're always doing everything at room temperature in this unit, 
and so we can look at what p k a's are of some weak acids, and acetate, acetate is 

an easy buffer to get your hands on, acetate is quite available, and it has a good p k 
a 4 . 75. So that's great, we can use that in designing our buffer. So, acetic acid has 
the right p k a, and we're all set, we can prepare a buffer. But we'll need to add the 
acid and the conjugate, and we need to know how much acid and how much of the 
conjugate to add. 

So we can use Henderson Hasselbalch equation for this. We're creating a buffer, and 
so this is an equation we can use for buffers. We know what p h we want, we know 
the p k a of the thing we're going to use, and we want to figure out how much of the 
acid to use and how much of the conjugate to use. We need to know the ratio of one 
to the other to set up our buffer ideally. So we can plug our numbers in and calculate 
that. 

So, we can rearrange this if you want so that the unknown is on one side and we 
have to p k a and the p h on the other side. And so, we have here our p k a minus 
our p h and we get . 15. Now we need to inverse log and come up with the ratio, and 
the ratio that we want is 1 . 4. So we want to have a ratio from our acid to the 
conjugate of 1 . 4. 

Well how much exactly are we going to add them, we know the ratio now, how much 
are we going to add? Well, you could use 1 . 4 molar and 1 molar, for example, that 
would have the correct ratio. But how do you know if that's going to be good? Well, 
the ratio is more important than the exact amounts, however, the amounts get to 
this issue of sort of the capacity of the buffer -- how resistant it is to changes in the 
p h. So if you use too low concentrations of both, it won't be all that resistant. So if 
you need to have a better buffering capacity, the higher concentrations that you 
should use. And you can use Henderson Hasselbalch then to calculate what sort of 
the minimum amount you use, the minimum amount to have that 5% rule work. 

So in the example I told you about this condition, the buffer in the blood was pretty 
good, but the acid with so much that it overwhelmed buffering capacity. So if there 
had been larger concentrations of the buffer, that would have certainly helped in that 
case. So the higher the concentrations you use, the more resistant to change. And 
that's the idea of buffering capacity. So, and if you use too low concentrations, then 
your Henderson Hasselbalch equation won't even be valid. So we can go back and 
calculate what is sort of the minimum concentrations we need to use for Henderson 
Hasselbalch to be valid to meet that 5% rule. So for a p h of 4 . 6, a hydronium ion 
concentration is a 2 . 5 times 10 to the minus 5. 

And so then if we work our equation backwards, we want to be less than 5%, so we 
have this over the concentration of either one of those times 100% gives you 5%. So 
the concentrations need to be greater than 5 times 10 to the minus 4 moles or you 
won't meet this 5% rule. So at least to be greater than that and they need to be in 
the right ratio. Other than that you're somewhat free to decide what you're going to 
do with that, and there may be other considerations involved if you're working with a 
certain concentration of protein, you might not want your buffer concentration to be 
too high, it might start interfering with enzyme assay, for example. And often buffers 
are somewhere around 100 millimolar, that's a pretty common concentration for 
buffers. 

All right, so this slide we're doing really well. So we talked about weak acids in 
water, weak bases in water, and I'm trying to convince you that these are the same 
as the salt and water problems. So we're going to talk much more about salt and 

water in a few minutes. And I told you about buffers, so we only have 2 more things 
to go. We need to talk about strong acids in water, and strong bases in water, and 
then you'll have all of the 5 types of problems to do the problem-set. And as I 
mentioned last time, it looks deceivingly short, the number of questions on them, 
but the titration problems are long. So don't leave those to the last minute or there 
will not be a whole lot of sleep involved. So just a word of warning from the past. 
Everyone looks and go, "Oh, this is an easy problem-set, there aren't many 
problems." So, titration problems do take a lot of time. So let's talk about titration, 
so that as soon as class is over today, you can go work on those questions on the 
problem-set. 

All right. So acid base titrations. How many of you in high school titrated an acid with 
a base? Large fraction of you, OK. So usually what titration problems are meant to 
do, that you have something known about an acid or a base, base say of known 
concentration, and and acid of unknown concentration or maybe unknown molecular 
weight, and you're titrating them out, titrating them together to find missing 
information. So you can determine concentration, sometimes you can determine a 
molecular weight. 

All right, so here's what a plot looks like and some of the key terms involved in acid 
base titrations. So you have a p h on one side, and then volume of either base or 
acid added on the other side. So p h versus a volume. And the actual experiment 
here, you have a base that you're dripping, one drip at a time supposedly into your 
strong acid. And then you're looking to figure out when you're going to reach the 
either equivalence point or the end point, these are basically the same terms. It's 
also called the stoichiometric point, and often equivalence point is used as a more 
theoretical amount of volume is added, where as end point is the experimentally 
measured. So we're going to be talking a lot about equivalence points, because we 
have no lab associated with this course, so everything will be theorectical in terms of 
these, but they should be the same. 

So, many times you will measure p h with the p h meter -- this just shows a p h 
meter. And for those of you who have done these experiments, this should look 
familiar. And for those of you who haven't, often what you're doing when you're 
dripping something in, you're waiting for an indicator dye to change color as an 
indication that you have reached the end point, and often you're adding, and it's 
clear, clear, clear for what seems to be forever, and just as you get incredibly 
impatient, you start adding it faster and you go all the way to this dark color. And 
what you want is this very, very, very light changed color that indicates the end 
point. So you usually go too slow and then go too fast and then have to do the 
experiment over again. 

Those of you who know how to calculate theoretical values could sit down and do a 
calculation first and then go really fast right until you get around this point and add it 
really slowly, and be done with lab sooner. So, we'll talk about how you do the 
theoretical value, which could save you a lot of time if you ever run across these labs 
in any future class. 

So, here are the two curves that you would see for either a strong acid with a strong 
base, or strong base with a strong acid. So if you're titrating a strong acid with a 
strong base, you're going to start down being very acidic, because all you have is 
your strong acid. And then as you add in base, the p h will go up. You'll reach this 

point -- s is for the stoichiometric point, we also call this, again, the equivalence 
point, and then it'll continue to go up and then start to level off a bit more up here. 

If you're going the other direction, you're starting with strong base, your p h is going 
to be high, and the p h will decrease as you add the acid. And then you get to the 
stoichiometric or equivalence point in the middle of this curve here. And then as you 
go down farther, more acidic, it starts to level off. So those are what the titration 
curves look like. 

So let's do an example. We're going to have a strong base being titrated with a 
strong acid first. And our strong base is n a o h, and our strong acid is h c l. So let's 
calculate the p h at the equivalence point. Well, let's just calculate the p h at 5 mils -
- I don't know whether it's equivalence point, actually. 5 mils of this have been 
added to the amount of base. So we have 25 mils of our strong base at 0.15 molar 
concentration, and we're adding 5 mils of our 0.34 molar acid. 

So what we want to do is figure out how many moles of base we had to start with. 
So how many moles of o h minus -- again, n a o h is a strong base, so however 
much n a o h you add, is the amount of o h minus you get, and so we just put in the 
number of liters times the concentration to get moles. We don't need any equilibrium 
table here. 

So then we want to figure out the amount of acid added when you're adding 5 mils 
of it. So again, h c l is a strong acid, so the amount of h c l added equals the amount 
of h 3 o plus, that's formed, goes to completion, and so we added 5 mils, the 
concentration was 0.34 molar, so we have 1 . 7 times 10 to the minus 3 moles. 

So now, the strong acid is going to react with the strong base, and we want to figure 
out how much of the base is left, how much hydroxide ion is left after it reacts with 
the hydronium ions. So it'll react 1:1, so we had 6 . 25 times 10 to the minus 3 
moles, and we added 1 . 7 times 10 to the minus 3 moles of the acid, so we're going 
to have 4 . 55 times 10 the minus 3 moles left. And now we can calculate the 
molarity here, so we have the number of moles and the new volume, so we had 25 
mils to the base to begin with. We've added 5 mils to the acid, so our new volume is 
30, and so we have our new concentration. 

And now we can calculate p h. First we'll calculate p o h, and then use 14 minus to 
get the new p h. So if you were making your own little titration curve, we could have 
volume of acid on one side and p h on the other side, and you have a point of 13 . 
18. That's how much we have after you have 5 mils added. So we didn't, in this 
curve, we have not measured the zero point, but we know what one point after 5 
mils of the acid has been added. 

So now let's go right to the equivalence point -- so the way I draw it should indicate 
that was not an equivalence point. So we want to figure out how much we need to 
add of the acid to reach the equivalence point. So the equivalence point or the 
stoichiometric point means that you add the same amount of moles of your titrate as 
you had, and so they're going to be equal to each other. So if you're adding acid to a 
strong base, you've added enough acid that you now have equal number of moles to 
the number of moles of base that you had to begin with. So we know we have 6 . 25 
times 10 to the minus 3 moles of the base were present. 

So at the equivalence point, you need to have that exact same number of moles of 
acid. So we know the concentration of the acid we have and the number of moles we 
need, and so we can calculate the volume, which is 18 . 4 millimeters, or 0.0184 
liters. So what would the p h then be of the equivalence point? We're titrating a 
strong acid with a strong base, what should the p h be? The p h should be 7. So 
somewhere around here we're going to be at 18, so you can just try to draw a curve, 
and here we have a p h of 7 when we've gone to about 18 . 4 milliliters added. 

So when you titrate a strong acid with a strong base, you form a salt that's neutral. 
Because the conjugates of a strong acid and a strong base are not basic or acidic. 
They're ineffective as acids or bases, so you're going to get a neutral salt. So if 
you're doing a problem with a strong acid and strong base, it's not a lot of 
calculations that need to be done at this point, you just need to recognize that your 
salt should be neutral. 

So now, we can talk about what happens if you add an extra milliliter of your acid, 
after you've reached that equivalence point, which is something that people probably 
have done in doing these titrations not meaning to, gone well beyond the 
equivalence point. 

So first we can find out the number of moles of the strong acid that we've added 
extra, so we added one mil of the strong acid, and so again, it goes to completion. 
The concentration, the acid, is 0.34 molar times our 1 mil, so we've added 3 . 4 
times 10 to the minus 4 extra moles of our acid, and so let's calculate then what the 
molarity is that we have added that was extra. 

And even if you don't have a calculator, we've helped you out. Let's just take 10 
more seconds. 

I think this is a first, isn't it? Did I mention it's a good idea to start the problem-set 
early. So the trick here was about the volume. So we had 25 mils to begin with, then 
we added 18 . 4 to get to the equivalence point, and then we're 1 mil beyond the 
equivalence point. And the tricks to these parts of the problems are to remember all 
the things that have been added to get to the volume. 

So the problem itself is not very tricky of having just an acid in water, but the one 
trick is in calculating the molarity, remembering all of the things that were added to 
get to this point. And so by the end of the problem-set this should be pretty familiar 
to you, but it's also something that you want to make sure that you check on an 
exam that you're not making any volume mistakes. 

So again, here are the things that you want to remember to add in in calculating 
this. And then, if you calculate the p h of that, you get a p h of 2 . 1106, so that's 
down somewhere in here. We've added 1 more mill, and we're at a p h of 2 . 1106, 
and this can be a check as well. If you forgot to add some of your volume, you might 
get a p h that doesn't make a lot of sense. So that can be a double check. Always 
ask yourself when you have a strong base and you're adding acid, before you've 
added very much, your p h should be basic. At the equivalence point of a strong 
acid, strong base titration, it'll be 7. And if you continue to add acid, then you should 
have a pretty low p h, you'll notice the curve drops off pretty fast. So it should be a 
dramatic change in p h by adding extra of your acid. 

So always check your work. OK, so let's stop there, and we're going to weak acid, 
weak base titrations next time.
