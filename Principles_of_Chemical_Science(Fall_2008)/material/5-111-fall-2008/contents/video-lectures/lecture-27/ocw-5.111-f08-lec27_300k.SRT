9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:25
PROFESSOR: OK, we have
the clicker question up.

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
We're going to have another
clicker competition today.

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:37
The defending champs,
there's Darcy's recitation.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:01:44
So, OK, let's just take
10 more seconds on this.

13
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
OK, not too bad, 74%.
 

14
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
So, in this problem, the trick
was just to look at the

15
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
equation and figure out what's
going on -- which element is

16
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
being reduced, and which
one is being oxidized.

17
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
So this is something that
you will be seeing on

18
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
the upcoming exam.
 

19
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
So we're going to talk about
that in a few minutes, but

20
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
first I want to answer the
question from last time.

21
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
So, first, let's just, I know
you've all been wondering

22
00:02:18 --> 00:02:26
about how vitamin B12
is reduced in the body.

23
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
So, let's take a
look at this now.

24
00:02:28 --> 00:02:38
So, if everyone can quiet
down, let's get started.

25
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
So, vitamin B12 is reduced
by a protein that's

26
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
called flavodoxin.
 

27
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
And flavodoxin is a protein
that has a cofactor which is

28
00:02:46 --> 00:02:53
a flavin, and that's also a
vitamin B, as it turns out,

29
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
they're both vitamin B's.
 

30
00:02:56 --> 00:03:03
So, vitamin B12 has a redox
potential or a standard

31
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
reduction potential
of minus 0 .

32
00:03:05 --> 00:03:11
5 2 6 volts, and that is
a very low number for

33
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
a biological system.
 

34
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
And flavodoxin has a
potential of minus 0.

35
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
2 3 volts.
 

36
00:03:19 --> 00:03:31
So, which of these things is
a better reducing agent?

37
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
So, which thing, you want to
think about reducing agent,

38
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
which thing would prefer to
be oxidized and reduce

39
00:03:37 --> 00:03:42
something else?
 

40
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
So, with the low negative
number, B12 is a better

41
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
reducing agent than flavodoxin,
and just based on these

42
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
numbers, vitamin B12 should be
reducing flavodoxin, not

43
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
the other way around.
 

44
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
So, how does this work then?
 

45
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
So, in your body right now, you
have a version of a flavodoxin

46
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
protein, and you of vitamin B12
attached to an enzyme,

47
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
methionine synthase, and for
that to be activated, it

48
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
needs to be reduced.
 

49
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
So how is this happening?
 

50
00:04:18 --> 00:04:23
So, let's consider whether
the reduction of B12 by

51
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
flavodoxin is spontaneous.
 

52
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
It happens in your body so
one might think that it is.

53
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
But let's look at that.
 

54
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
So, we can look at it the same
way you've looked at all the

55
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
other systems, we're talking
about batteries, electric

56
00:04:38 --> 00:04:42
chemical cells -- you can use
the same equations if it's

57
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
a biological system as you
can for any other system.

58
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
So we've seen this
equation before.

59
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
We've calculated changes in the
standard reduction potential

60
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
for a cell, and we talked about
e nought for reduction minus

61
00:04:55 --> 00:05:01
the e nought for oxidation, and
we can use that same equation.

62
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
So we can put it in in
the biological context.

63
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
The vitamin B12 is the thing
that's being reduced, and the

64
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
flavodoxin is the thing that's
being oxidized, that's the

65
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
reaction that happens.
 

66
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
So, we can plug
those values in.

67
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
So we have minus 0 .
 

68
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
5 2 6 volts, minus
a negative 0 .

69
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
2 3 volts, and if you put those
together, you get minus 0 .

70
00:05:26 --> 00:05:29
2 9 6 volts.
 

71
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
So is that going to be a
spontaneous reaction?

72
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
No, it's not going to be.
 

73
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
Your value for the e is
negative, which means what

74
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
is true about delta g?
 

75
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Positive, so it won't
be spontaneous.

76
00:05:47 --> 00:05:52
So, let's figure out how not
spontaneous it's going to be.

77
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
How much trouble are we all in?
 

78
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58
So we can use again, the same
equation that we used for

79
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
batteries that we've used in
this course -- just because

80
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
it's a biological system,
doesn't mean the

81
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
equation doesn't hold.
 

82
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
So our equation for delta g
nought minus n, the number of

83
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
moles of electrons times
Faraday's constant times

84
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
the change in the
standard potential.

85
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
So we can plug it in.
 

86
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
I can tell you it's a one
electron process -- flavodoxin

87
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
puts one electron into vitamin
B12, so we have minus 1 times

88
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
Faraday's constant times the
cell potential difference

89
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
you just measured,
which is minus 0 .

90
00:06:29 --> 00:06:35
2 9 6, and if you multiply
those out, then you get 28 .

91
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
6 kilojoules per mole positive.
 

92
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
That is a very big value --
that's not spontaneous and

93
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
it's not a small number
for a biological system.

94
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
So, why don't we all
have heart disease and

95
00:06:49 --> 00:06:49
megaloblastic anemia?
 

96
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Those are problems associated
when this particular

97
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
enzyme is not functioning.
 

98
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
So, what happens in this system
is what happens in a number

99
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
of biological systems.
 

100
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
How do you drive something
forward that is

101
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
not spontaneous?
 

102
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
And what you can do is put
energy into the system to drive

103
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
that non-spontaneous reaction.
 

104
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
And in this case, the energy
that's put into the system is

105
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
from a molecule called
s adenosylmethionine.

106
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
And the cleavage of s
adenosylmethionine has a delta

107
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
g nought of negative 37 .
 

108
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
6 kilojoules per mole.
 

109
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
So it's more favorable than
the reduction of B12 is

110
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
unfavorable, and so this
drives this system.

111
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
So, s adenosylmethionine is
your friend, it helps in the

112
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
body for B12 to be reduced so
that you can function

113
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
and be healthy.
 

114
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
So, many biological
systems work like this.

115
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
So what have we been calling
something, a cell, in which an

116
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
unfavorable reaction is driven
by applying some kind of energy

117
00:08:00 --> 00:08:11
or current, what
do we call that?

118
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
Two types of cells
we mentioned.

119
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
One that has a favorable, it
has a spontaneous reaction.

120
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
A cell that has a spontaneous
reaction is called what?

121
00:08:22 --> 00:08:22
Galvanic.
 

122
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
And the other kind is called?
 

123
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
Yup.
 

124
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
So, electrolitic cell.
 

125
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
So this is sort of the
biological equivalent of an

126
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
electrolitic cell where you
have s adenosylmethionine

127
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
cleavage coupled to an
unfavorable reaction to

128
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
drive that reduction
of B12 by flavodoxin.

129
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
And B12 has such a low
potential, that there

130
00:08:44 --> 00:08:47
really isn't anything
else that can reduce it.

131
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
It has one of the lowest
potentials known in a

132
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
biological system, so nature
said, OK, well, we're not going

133
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
to make something with a lower
potential to do this chemistry,

134
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
we'll have something else with
a higher potential, but will

135
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
drive the reaction because it's
going to be non-spontaneous.

136
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
So that's how this works.
 

137
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
So, today there's a long list
of topics, all of these are

138
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
pretty short and basically
constitute the introductory

139
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
material in this unit.
 

140
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
And we've jumped ahead,
this is in chapter 16.

141
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
So, I really like transition
metals, because I am a fan of

142
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
metals that are involved
in biological systems.

143
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
So, I just thought as part of
chemistry, I just want to sort

144
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
of review the kind of basic
areas of chemistry

145
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
for a minute.
 

146
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
This is not in your handout,
but just so you sort of

147
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
think about what are
all parts of chemistry.

148
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
There is organic chemistry --
does anyone know what organic

149
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
chemistry concerns itself with?
 

150
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
Carbon.
 

151
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
And then what we have known
as inorganic chemistry.

152
00:10:02 --> 00:10:07
Anyone know what that is?
 

153
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
Not carbon.
 

154
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
So, a lot of people who are
inorganic chemists study

155
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
transition metals, but it's
basically other things

156
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
besides carbon.
 

157
00:10:20 --> 00:10:25
And then one of the areas
that I like is bioinorganic

158
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
chemistry, and these are people
who study metals in biology.

159
00:10:31 --> 00:10:40
So, people who study metals in
biology, and we're also kind of

160
00:10:40 --> 00:10:46
referred to as, we're sort of
in a club, which

161
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
we call the MIB.
 

162
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
So, some of you -- and Will
Smith did a disservice --

163
00:10:53 --> 00:10:58
people now associate this with
hunting aliens, but in fact,

164
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
people who are in MIB are
associated with hunting for

165
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
metal ions in biological cells.
 

166
00:11:04 --> 00:11:09
So this is sort
of the true MIB.

167
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
And in an honor of this
discussion today, I am

168
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
wearing a teeshirt from
one of our meetings.

169
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
This is from the International
Congress on Bioinorganic

170
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
Chemistry, which we
refer to as ICBIC.

171
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26
And you notice that the clever
people who made this teeshirt

172
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
used the B from the
bioinorganic to make B12, which

173
00:11:31 --> 00:11:38
is a very popular vitamin in
the bioinorganic community.

174
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
So, metals in biology.
 

175
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
Carbon, carbon's a good
thing, amino acids are

176
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
good, I like proteins.
 

177
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
But often, when you take a
metal and attach it to a

178
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
protein, that protein can do
really cool chemistry --

179
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
really need oxidation
reduction chemistry.

180
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
So, here is part of the
periodic table that includes

181
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
many of these transition
metals that we're going

182
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
to be talking about.
 

183
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
And things that are in orange
here are metals that are very

184
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
important biologically.
 

185
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
Some of the things that are in
grey here are metals that are

186
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
used as probes or as drugs in
biological systems, and

187
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
some could be both.
 

188
00:12:22 --> 00:12:26
So, when you add a metal to a
protein you can do cool stuff.

189
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
What can you do?
 

190
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
Well, you can split nitrogen.
 

191
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
You learned that the triple
bond of nitrogen is pretty

192
00:12:32 --> 00:12:39
hard to break, but metals
in proteins can do it.

193
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
You've heard of hydrogen fuel
cells and things like that.

194
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
There's a protein called
hydrogenase that uses metals to

195
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
do chemistry with hydrogen.
 

196
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
You could you radical
based chemistry.

197
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
You can do a lot of really
great things when you have a

198
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
protein that has a metal in it.
 

199
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
So, let me introduce you to
some of the concepts and

200
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
terminology involved in this,
so we're going to have a metal

201
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
and the metal's going
to be bound to stuff.

202
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
So, one of the great features
of transition metals is their

203
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
ability to form complexes with
small molecules or ions.

204
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
They also, this applies to a
protein system in the case that

205
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
instead of small molecules, you
have amino acids of proteins it

206
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
can also form complexes with.
 

207
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
So, the way that they do this
is metals have often, they can

208
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
attract electron density,
usually a lone pair of

209
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
electrons from another
atom, and so they can form

210
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
what are called these
coordination complexes.

211
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
So, now we're going to review
for a minute, donor atoms,

212
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
they're called ligands, and we
can think about something that

213
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
we learned when we talked
about acids and bases, our

214
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
more broad definition.
 

215
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
So, donor atoms are ligands,
and ligands are what?

216
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
Lewis acids or Lewis bases,
and what do they do?

217
00:14:04 --> 00:14:43
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

218
00:14:43 --> 00:14:48
So most of you thought donor
atoms -- the answers that had

219
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
donate electrons did better, so
that was good reading of the

220
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
question, but they
are Lewis bases.

221
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
So Lewis bases donate
electron pairs.

222
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
So, here's some examples that
you will see of ligands

223
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
that we'll be talking
about in this unit.

224
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
You will become very familiar
with some of these as

225
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
you work problems.
 

226
00:15:14 --> 00:15:21
So they're typically donating
one lone pair of electrons.

227
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
So, acceptor atoms are the
transition metals themselves,

228
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
and so the transition metals
are acting as Lewis acids, and

229
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
so then they would be accepting
those lone pairs of electrons.

230
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
So, you can think about
coordination complexes as Lewis

231
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
acids and Lewis bases, or
acceptor atoms and donor

232
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
ligands or donor atoms.
 

233
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
So here are some examples of
transition metals that we're

234
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
going to see, so it's that sort
of d-block of the periodic

235
00:15:53 --> 00:15:59
table that we'll become very
familiar with in this unit.

236
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
So, then when you take your
acceptor atom and your donor

237
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
atom and you put them together,
you get what is known as

238
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
coordination complexes.
 

239
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
So, coordination complex is
just the metal or the Lewis

240
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
acid surrounded by the
ligands, or the Lewis

241
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
bases or the donor atoms.
 

242
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
And here is an example of
a coordination complex.

243
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
We have metal, we have cobalt
in the middle, and it's

244
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
surrounded by a series of
ligands, and these

245
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
are n h 3 ligands.
 

246
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
And so then our cobalt in the
center, our metal, is the

247
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
Lewis acid, and it's going
to be the acceptor atom.

248
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
And the n h 3 groups are our
Lewis bases, they're donor

249
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
atoms, see it's written with
those two electrons there, that

250
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
they're sharing their electrons
with the cobalt forming

251
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
this coordination complex.
 

252
00:16:52 --> 00:16:56
And in this scheme, we have the
bonds are just these straight

253
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
lines are in the plane, the
thick bonds coming out are

254
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
coming out toward you, and the
dashed lines going back

255
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
are going back into
the screen here.

256
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
So, let's talk about a
couple of definitions here.

257
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
We have something called
coordination number or CN

258
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
number, and this is simply
the number of ligands

259
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
bonded to the metal.
 

260
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
So the number is six,
there is six ligands.

261
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
Typically, the numbers will
range for these coordination

262
00:17:25 --> 00:17:33
complexes to two to 12, with
six being the most common.

263
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
So, here is some notation.
 

264
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
If you see this picture, you
should be able to write

265
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
a notation for it.
 

266
00:17:40 --> 00:17:45
And within a bracket, you would
write cobalt, and then you have

267
00:17:45 --> 00:17:48
your n h 3, six of them, so you
put that in a bracket and

268
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
indicate that there's
six n h 3 groups.

269
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
Then you have this overall
bracket here with

270
00:17:54 --> 00:17:55
a charge up above.
 

271
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
And so over here, we have this
little bracket plus 3, that

272
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
means that this whole
coordination complex has

273
00:18:01 --> 00:18:03
a charge of plus 3.
 

274
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
Because it has a positive
charge, sometimes coordination

275
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
complexes are associated
with counter ions.

276
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
So, you might see three
chloride minus 1 ions around

277
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
to counter that charge.
 

278
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
And if you did, you would see
the three chlorides on the

279
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
outside of the bracket.
 

280
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
So things inside of the bracket
are actually coordinated to the

281
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
metal, things outside the
bracket are counter ions.

282
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
And so that would be how
you would translate that

283
00:18:30 --> 00:18:35
particular notation.
 

284
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
All right, so, we're
back to geometry again.

285
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
As I said, everything you
learn in this course,

286
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
we're going to use again.
 

287
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
So, if you're forgetting some
material from units 1 and

288
00:18:46 --> 00:18:50
2, this would be a good
time to review those.

289
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
So, if we have this
coordination number of six

290
00:18:53 --> 00:19:14
things around, what kind of
geometry are we going to have?

291
00:19:14 --> 00:19:28
All right, 10 seconds.
 

292
00:19:28 --> 00:19:32
Yup, so we have
octahedral geometry.

293
00:19:32 --> 00:19:37
And here is an example of
our octahedral geometry.

294
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
So, let's just quickly run
through the rest of these.

295
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
You can yell out the answers,
either looking at your handout

296
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
or not looking at your handout.
 

297
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
The next one over
here, what is it?

298
00:19:51 --> 00:19:51
Right, trigonal bipyramidal.
 

299
00:19:51 --> 00:19:56
For a c n number of five, we
have another option shown over

300
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
here, what's that one called?
 

301
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
Square pyramidal.
 

302
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
For c n numbers of four,
there's two things that

303
00:20:03 --> 00:20:07
you'll commonly see, what's
the first one called?

304
00:20:07 --> 00:20:08
Square planar.
 

305
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
The second one?
 

306
00:20:10 --> 00:20:10
Tetrahedral.
 

307
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
For c n number of three,
what's that geometry called?

308
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
Trigonal planar.
 

309
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
And c n of two,
only one option.

310
00:20:20 --> 00:20:20
Linear.
 

311
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
All right, so let's just review
the angles as well, those are

312
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
not in your handouts, but you
can yell those out as well.

313
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
So what angle do we have
in an octahedral system?

314
00:20:33 --> 00:20:34
90.
 

315
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
There are two angles involved
if we have trigonal

316
00:20:37 --> 00:20:38
bipyramidal.
 

317
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
What's the angle from the
axial to the equatorial?

318
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
STUDENT: 90.
 

319
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
PROFESSOR: And what's the angle
from one equatorial atom to

320
00:20:46 --> 00:20:47
another equatorial atom?
 

321
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
So, we have 90 and 120.
 

322
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
What about in our square
pyramidal system, what

323
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
are the angles here?
 

324
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
90.
 

325
00:21:03 --> 00:21:10
What about square planar?
 

326
00:21:10 --> 00:21:10
90.
 

327
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
Tetrahedral?
 

328
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
Let's try that again
with more enthusiasm.

329
00:21:21 --> 00:21:22
Awesome, 109 .
 

330
00:21:22 --> 00:21:24
5.
 

331
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
Trigonal planar?
 

332
00:21:25 --> 00:21:29
120.
 

333
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
And finally, linear.
 

334
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
180.
 

335
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
So, we're going to use this
information again in this unit,

336
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
and of course, it'll be on the
final when we're talking about

337
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
Lewis structures and
hybridization and

338
00:21:46 --> 00:21:47
other things as well.
 

339
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
So this comes back in several
times, vsper theory, you

340
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
have this several times.
 

341
00:21:55 --> 00:21:58
OK.
 

342
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
So, another term that you hear
a lot when people are talking

343
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
about coordination complexes is
what's called the

344
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
chelate effect.
 

345
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
So, ligands that bind to a
metal at one point are called

346
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
unidentate or monodentate, and
that's from dent, which

347
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
is tooth, so one tooth.
 

348
00:22:21 --> 00:22:26
Now, if a ligand attaches
with two or more points

349
00:22:26 --> 00:22:30
of attachment, it can be
called a chelating ligand.

350
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
And this comes from the
Greek, chele is claw.

351
00:22:34 --> 00:22:38
So, if it's attaching with more
than one point of attachment,

352
00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
if the ligand is grabbing
on, it's like a claw and

353
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
that's called a chelate.
 

354
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
So, if you have two points
of attachment, that's

355
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
called bidentate.
 

356
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
And even if you've never had
a unit on transition metals

357
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
before, I bet that you
can answer this without

358
00:22:58 --> 00:23:00
me even telling you.
 

359
00:23:00 --> 00:23:05
What do you think
tridentate might be?

360
00:23:05 --> 00:23:06
Three.
 

361
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
Tetradentate?
 

362
00:23:08 --> 00:23:08
Four.
 

363
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
Hexadentate?
 

364
00:23:10 --> 00:23:11
Six.
 

365
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
So sometimes this would be a
little question on the final.

366
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
Please don't get this wrong,
this is my gift to you,

367
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
right, you knew it even
before I taught it.

368
00:23:19 --> 00:23:22
So, this should be something
that you can definitely get a

369
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
couple extra points
on on the final.

370
00:23:24 --> 00:23:29
All right, so, chelates bind
with more than one point of

371
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
attachment, and metal chelates
are unusually stable.

372
00:23:35 --> 00:23:40
And this property is due to
favorable and tropic factor, so

373
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
we're back to entropy, we're
back to thermodynamics.

374
00:23:43 --> 00:23:46
And this has to do with the
fact that when a chelate binds

375
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
a metal, it releases a lot of
water, and that makes the

376
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
chelate pretty stable.
 

377
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
So, let me give you some
examples of chelates, and then

378
00:23:56 --> 00:23:57
we're going to come back
and think about the

379
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
chelate effect again.
 

380
00:23:59 --> 00:24:06
Of course, you knew it, vitamin
B12 has a chelating ligand

381
00:24:06 --> 00:24:11
associated with it.
 

382
00:24:11 --> 00:24:16
So, cobalt is in the middle
of vitamin B12, and it has

383
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
a ring system around it.
 

384
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
And the ring system has these
nitrogens, the nitrogens are

385
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
the donor ligands to the
cobalt, and so this ring system

386
00:24:26 --> 00:24:31
is attaching at four points, so
it's a tetradentate ligand.

387
00:24:31 --> 00:24:34
There's also two other ligands
attached to vitamin B12,

388
00:24:34 --> 00:24:37
there's an upper ligand shown
here, which is 5 prime

389
00:24:37 --> 00:24:42
deoxyadenosine, and a
bottom ligand, which is a

390
00:24:42 --> 00:24:42
dimethylbenzamitisol ligand.
 

391
00:24:42 --> 00:24:49
So, let's take a look, this is
the cartoon, but let's look at

392
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
another model for this here.
 

393
00:24:51 --> 00:24:56
So, we have a ring system, we
have this upper ligand, and

394
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
then a lower ligand down here.
 

395
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
And so, the middle ring system
is a tetradentate chelate.

396
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
Overall, at the cobalt
metal, what is the

397
00:25:07 --> 00:25:11
geometry of this system?
 

398
00:25:11 --> 00:25:12
It's octahedral, right.
 

399
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
So we have this sort of square,
the middle part is square

400
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
planar, but the two upper and
lower ligands make the whole

401
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
thing an octahedral system.
 

402
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
So this is an example of
a naturally occurring

403
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
chelated complex.
 

404
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
So, this structure
is actually fairly

405
00:25:30 --> 00:25:31
complicated for a vitamin.
 

406
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
It's one of the most complex
vitamins that's known, and

407
00:25:35 --> 00:25:38
I thought I'd just mention
just a moment of history.

408
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
So, this structure was
determined by Dorothy Hodgkin

409
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
who was a crystalographer
in England.

410
00:25:45 --> 00:25:49
And she started working on this
in the late 1940's, and people

411
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
told her she was crazy, that
something this large could

412
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
never be solved by these
x-ray defraction techniques.

413
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
And, of course, now people are
solving today's structures of

414
00:25:59 --> 00:26:00
things like the ribosomes.
 

415
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
So, we've come a long way
with crystallography.

416
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
But she was one of the first
true believers that x-ray

417
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
crystallography was a
powerful technique.

418
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
And so, she went ahead, despite
what everyone said, and

419
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
determined this structure.
 

420
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
And for this work and for
some other things, she was

421
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
awarded a Nobel Prize.
 

422
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
So, this was a really
significant contribution in the

423
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
early 1950's and late 1940's.
 

424
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
She had graduate students
that she inspired.

425
00:26:28 --> 00:26:31
Some of them went on to become
famous crystalographers.

426
00:26:31 --> 00:26:34
Other ones were not so
successful -- crystallography's

427
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
hard and it's not for everyone.
 

428
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
She was actually known also,
Dorothy was, for her work in

429
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
the third world and her liberal
politics, but one of her

430
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
graduate students did not
agree with her politics, but

431
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
they were still friends.
 

432
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
So this is just a message that
as you go through your career,

433
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
Margaret Thatcher who is a
graduate student of Dorothy

434
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
Hodgkins, couldn't quite cut it
as a crystalographer, but for

435
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
some people, you haven't found
your true thing, and she was

436
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
able to find another
job, so I'm told.

437
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
So, just remember that if
you're not good at one thing,

438
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
there's something else
out there that you

439
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
might be good at.
 

440
00:27:17 --> 00:27:22
So, let me give you a second
example of a chelate.

441
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
This molecule is known as EDTA.
 

442
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
So this ligand has six points
that it can attach to a metal.

443
00:27:31 --> 00:27:35
So, it is six atoms the can
serve as these donor ligands.

444
00:27:35 --> 00:27:37
So, we have one up here, have
the little electrons and the

445
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
oxygen, another oxygen down
here, nitrogen, nitrogen,

446
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
another oxygen, another oxygen.
 

447
00:27:44 --> 00:27:49
So all of those six points
can coordinate to a metal.

448
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54
So here again is the free EDTA,
and here's a structure of

449
00:27:54 --> 00:27:59
EDTA bound to a metal, the
metal is abbreviated m.

450
00:27:59 --> 00:28:24
So, why don't you tell me what
the geometry is of that metal?

451
00:28:24 --> 00:28:39
All right, let's take
only 10 more seconds.

452
00:28:39 --> 00:28:41
Hoping for 90, we're
getting close, maybe

453
00:28:41 --> 00:28:42
by the end of today.
 

454
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
All right, yeah, so it's
octahedral geometry.

455
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
So we have upper ligands and a
lower ligand, two ligands

456
00:28:50 --> 00:28:55
coming out, two ligands going
back, and it's also a

457
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
hexadentate complex.
 

458
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
So we see we're coordinated
with the oxygen in red,

459
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
nitrogen in blue, around to the
other nitrogen in blue, another

460
00:29:02 --> 00:29:05
nitrogen in purple, another
nitrogen up here in

461
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
green and in blue.
 

462
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
So, EDTA, when EDTA binds to
a metal, it forms a very

463
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
stable metal complex.
 

464
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
And the reason for this
is that chelate effect,

465
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
and it's entropy.
 

466
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
So if we look, metals are often
coordinated by waters if

467
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26
they're just is solution.
 

468
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
But if you bind one molecule of
EDTA to the metal, it'll take

469
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
all of those six sites,
displacing all of

470
00:29:34 --> 00:29:35
these six waters.
 

471
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
So here, on this side, you have
one thing free in solution, and

472
00:29:39 --> 00:29:42
over here you have six
things that are free.

473
00:29:42 --> 00:29:45
So that's entrotropically
favorable, you have more

474
00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
entropy when you have lots
of more free things

475
00:29:48 --> 00:29:49
floating around.
 

476
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
So this has greater entropy.
 

477
00:29:51 --> 00:29:58
So, the chelate effect, then,
has to do with entropic effect,

478
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
that when you're binding a
metal with multiple points of

479
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
attachments, it's
releasing water.

480
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
So these are very stable.
 

481
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
And so, because of this
stability, they have a

482
00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
lot of important uses.
 

483
00:30:11 --> 00:30:14
What is one use you can think
of that you might have

484
00:30:14 --> 00:30:15
for such a thing?
 

485
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
When might you want to chelate
a metal out -- get metal out

486
00:30:20 --> 00:30:21
of something pretty quickly.
 

487
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
Yeah.
 

488
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28
Yeah, you can purify out a
metal out of water with this.

489
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
What about rushing to the
emergency room with something?

490
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
Yeah, lead poisoning, yup.
 

491
00:30:37 --> 00:30:40
So, sometimes you might want to
just purify your water, you

492
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43
might be happy with that, other
times you might really want

493
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
to have that metal out.
 

494
00:30:45 --> 00:30:50
So, every emergency room in the
United States, and probably

495
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
mostly around the world, will
have EDTA on hand in case

496
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
someone comes in with
lead poisoning.

497
00:30:57 --> 00:31:01
Do you know who's at the most
risk for lead poisoning,

498
00:31:01 --> 00:31:03
at least in this country?
 

499
00:31:03 --> 00:31:04
Kids.
 

500
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
And what do they do they
gives them lead poisoning?

501
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
Lead paint, yeah.
 

502
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
So, I don't know, most of you
are probably living on campus,

503
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
but if any of you move off
campus, and some people who are

504
00:31:15 --> 00:31:18
living maybe across the river
in fraternity houses, those

505
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
buildings are old and they
have had lead paint in at

506
00:31:21 --> 00:31:22
some point or another.
 

507
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
So this is a big problem,
actually, in the Boston area.

508
00:31:25 --> 00:31:28
So, if you have any toddlers
visiting you, you might want to

509
00:31:28 --> 00:31:32
make sure they're not eating
paint chips off any window

510
00:31:32 --> 00:31:33
sill or anything like that.
 

511
00:31:33 --> 00:31:38
Or if you do, have
some EDTA on hand.

512
00:31:38 --> 00:31:41
All right, one other thing,
some of you, once you start

513
00:31:41 --> 00:31:46
studying chemistry, it's always
fun/scary to start reading the

514
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
ingredients on food packages.
 

515
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
But you will discover that some
food that you eat will say

516
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
as an ingredient EDTA
added for freshness.

517
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
So, bacteria and fungi and
things like that need metals

518
00:32:02 --> 00:32:05
for growth, metals are very
important for life, and so

519
00:32:05 --> 00:32:08
you add a little EDTA and
it prevents things from

520
00:32:08 --> 00:32:10
growing on your food.
 

521
00:32:10 --> 00:32:14
So that's added for freshness.
 

522
00:32:14 --> 00:32:16
So you'll see it in food.
 

523
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
Another use that occasionally I
find MIT students are not as

524
00:32:21 --> 00:32:27
familiar with is in cleaning
bathtubs, so you want to

525
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
chelate out the calcium in tub
scum, and that's a

526
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
good use for EDTA.
 

527
00:32:34 --> 00:32:37
So, I always like to mention
how freshman chemistry

528
00:32:37 --> 00:32:40
information can make
you a lot of money.

529
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
So, I thought I'd tell you
a little story about a

530
00:32:42 --> 00:32:45
man named Robert Black.
 

531
00:32:45 --> 00:32:48
So one day, I think it might
have been a little before

532
00:32:48 --> 00:32:51
Thanksgiving, Mrs. Robert
Black, I don't know her first

533
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
name, said to her husband,
"We're having company, how

534
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
about you go clean the
bathtub?" Apparently, Robert

535
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
Black's wife had never
mentioned this to him before,

536
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
and he had, in fact,
never cleaned a bathtub.

537
00:33:07 --> 00:33:11
Also, I think that Robert
Black's wife was tired of

538
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
cleaning the bathtub, and
perhaps, had not done it

539
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
for, say, a very long time.
 

540
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
So, Robert Black went in there
and tried to scrub off the

541
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
scum, and it was actually
really challenging and he was

542
00:33:23 --> 00:33:26
very frustrating, and he said,
"I never want to

543
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
do that again."
 

544
00:33:28 --> 00:33:33
So, he went and developed a
product, a shower cleaner, that

545
00:33:33 --> 00:33:36
had all the ingredients of the
shower cleaners he was using,

546
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
except that he advertised it
slightly differently, and he

547
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
said "Every time you shower,
just spray a little bit on and

548
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
you'll never have to really
scrub again." because this will

549
00:33:47 --> 00:33:50
take care of it and avoid
scrubbing in the future, so a

550
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
little bit of spraying after
each shower avoids

551
00:33:53 --> 00:33:55
these problems.
 

552
00:33:55 --> 00:33:58
And the ingredients he had in
were all typical ingredients,

553
00:33:58 --> 00:34:00
including chelating agents.
 

554
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
You need a surfactant to break
up the water beads, and alcohol

555
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
to get rid of the oily stuff,
and the chelating agent for

556
00:34:08 --> 00:34:09
the calcium in the tub scum.
 

557
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
And the one he actually
used is EDTA.

558
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
So, as a result of a wife
saying to her husband, it's

559
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
your turn to clean the tub,
they now make $70 million

560
00:34:22 --> 00:34:24
dollars annually.
 

561
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
So, I think this is a lesson
that we can learn in many ways

562
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
that cleaning the tub is
something that everyone should

563
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
do at some point in their life,
and that the simple things you

564
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
learn in freshman chemistry
can, if applied correctly,

565
00:34:40 --> 00:34:42
make you a lot of money.
 

566
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
And I just want to encourage
you, again, that anything that

567
00:34:44 --> 00:34:47
I teach you that you use to
make a lot of money, I'll

568
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
remind you that I am
perfectly willing to have a

569
00:34:49 --> 00:34:51
cut of any of that.
 

570
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55
So, just something
to keep in mind.

571
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
So, one more thing that you
might have heard for EDTA.

572
00:35:00 --> 00:35:05
Have any of you heard, perhaps,
maybe watching television or a

573
00:35:05 --> 00:35:14
movie, about a use for EDTA?
 

574
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
Have any of you, perhaps,
seen a movie called Blade?

575
00:35:20 --> 00:35:23
How many of you have seen this?
 

576
00:35:23 --> 00:35:25
Not very many people.
 

577
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
Hmm, I think we're going to
have a separate course in

578
00:35:28 --> 00:35:34
vampire movies and TV.
 

579
00:35:34 --> 00:35:39
Anyway, Blade fights vampires,
and they have a special gun,

580
00:35:39 --> 00:35:42
and the special gun has
cartridges -- cartridges

581
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
are shown here.
 

582
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
And the cartridges have in
them -- anyone want to guess?

583
00:35:47 --> 00:35:49
EDTA, yes.
 

584
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
And the idea behind it, if you
shoot at a vampire, the vampire

585
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
turns instantaneously to dust,
and the idea behind it is that

586
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
vampires drink blood,
blood has what in it?

587
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
Iron.
 

588
00:36:04 --> 00:36:04
What chelates iron?
 

589
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
EDTA.
 

590
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
And, therefore, if you chelate
the iron out of blood, and a

591
00:36:10 --> 00:36:15
vampire's mostly blood, it just
instantaneously turns to dust.

592
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
So, actually, as chemistry
goes, it's kind of cool, yeah.

593
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
So, that's the final use that
I am aware of for EDTA.

594
00:36:25 --> 00:36:30
Some of you may
encounter some more.

595
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
All right, so
coordination complexes.

596
00:36:36 --> 00:36:39
Some of them can have isomers.
 

597
00:36:39 --> 00:36:42
They can have
geometric isomers.

598
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
And geometric isomers can have
vastly different properties.

599
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
And if you're interested in
biochemistry, this is something

600
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
that you'll be interested in,
because this can be

601
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
very important in
biological systems.

602
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
So, let me tell you about a
coordination complex that has

603
00:37:01 --> 00:37:06
platinum at the center, it has
two ammonia ligands and two

604
00:37:06 --> 00:37:12
chloride ligands, and it has
two ways that you can do it.

605
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
So, you can either put the
ammonia ligands on different

606
00:37:16 --> 00:37:19
sides or you can put
them on the same side.

607
00:37:19 --> 00:37:23
So, here we have two nitrogen
ligands over here, and

608
00:37:23 --> 00:37:25
I have these here.
 

609
00:37:25 --> 00:37:30
So, on one side, you have the
two nitrogen ligands, on the

610
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
other side two chlorides, or we
can have a transarrangement

611
00:37:36 --> 00:37:38
where they're across
from each other.

612
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
So you see, there's 2 different
ways to do it, on the same

613
00:37:41 --> 00:37:43
side or sort of across.
 

614
00:37:43 --> 00:37:45
So, cis or trans.
 

615
00:37:45 --> 00:37:52
Cisplatin is a potent
anti-cancer drug, transplatin

616
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
has no use that anyone's
been able to detect.

617
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
So it's the exact same
composition, but a different

618
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
arrangement of the atoms
coordinated to the

619
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
central metal.
 

620
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
So, why should it make a
difference, they have the same

621
00:38:05 --> 00:38:10
ingredients, why should one be
a potent anti-cancer drug and

622
00:38:10 --> 00:38:12
the other one be useless?
 

623
00:38:12 --> 00:38:16
Well, it's because of how
it interacts in the body.

624
00:38:16 --> 00:38:20
And so, one of the people who
have spent a lot of their

625
00:38:20 --> 00:38:24
career studying cisplatin is
Professor Steve Lippard, who's

626
00:38:24 --> 00:38:27
in the Chemistry Department
here, and he has determined

627
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
x-ray structures looking at
this, and done a number

628
00:38:30 --> 00:38:31
of other studies.
 

629
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
And so, here is a little
cartoon of cisplatin bound to

630
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
DNA, so the chlorides are
displaced when it binds, and so

631
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
they need to be on the same
side, otherwise it's

632
00:38:42 --> 00:38:44
not going to work.
 

633
00:38:44 --> 00:38:50
And when cisplatin binds to
DNA, then this will act

634
00:38:50 --> 00:38:54
to kill the cancer cells.
 

635
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58
So, the chlorides both need
to be on the same side

636
00:38:58 --> 00:38:59
so a combined DNA.
 

637
00:38:59 --> 00:39:02
If they're on other sides,
that's not going to interact

638
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
with DNA, and so it doesn't
have any known function.

639
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
So, geometric isomers, same
composition, but in different

640
00:39:11 --> 00:39:18
arrangements can have vastly
different properties.

641
00:39:18 --> 00:39:21
So you can have what are called
optical isomers or enantiomers,

642
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
and so these can our mirror
images of each other, but

643
00:39:25 --> 00:39:27
they're not superimposable.
 

644
00:39:27 --> 00:39:30
And so, when you have a mirror
image like this, it's called a

645
00:39:30 --> 00:39:34
chiral molecule, and this is a
term that you'll hear

646
00:39:34 --> 00:39:37
a lot when you take
organic chemistry.

647
00:39:37 --> 00:39:41
So, I have two mirror images
up here, so these are mirror

648
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
images, so the mirror plane
is between these molecules.

649
00:39:45 --> 00:39:48
But these molecules may look
the same in the mirror, but

650
00:39:48 --> 00:39:49
they're non-superimposable.
 

651
00:39:49 --> 00:39:54
So, they are, in fact,
different molecules, and they

652
00:39:54 --> 00:39:59
can have different properties
in a chiral environment.

653
00:39:59 --> 00:40:02
What do I mean by a
chiral environment?

654
00:40:02 --> 00:40:04
Well, the human body,
for example, is a

655
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
chiral environment.
 

656
00:40:08 --> 00:40:11
So that's why a lot of drugs,
people are wanting to make just

657
00:40:11 --> 00:40:14
one enantimer of the drug and
not the other, one enantiomer

658
00:40:14 --> 00:40:19
can have good properties,
the other one may not.

659
00:40:19 --> 00:40:24
All right, so let's do
some d-electron counting.

660
00:40:24 --> 00:40:26
This is the final thing
we need to talk about in

661
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
coordination complexes.
 

662
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
So we're going to refer to a
thing called the d-electron

663
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
count of the metal, which just
has to do with a group number

664
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
from the periodic table minus
the oxidation number of the

665
00:40:43 --> 00:40:46
metal, is going to tell
us the d-electron count.

666
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
So, if you haven't learned how
to do oxidation numbers yet,

667
00:40:50 --> 00:40:53
you need to know that for exam
3, and you need to know

668
00:40:53 --> 00:40:55
that for this unit.
 

669
00:40:55 --> 00:40:58
So, let's look at a few
examples of this, and

670
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
we'll put up our friend,
the periodic table.

671
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
So let's look at the complex
that we saw on the first page

672
00:41:07 --> 00:41:10
where we had -- in the
beginning of today's lecture

673
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
where we had cobalts with six n
h 3 ligands in a coordination

674
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
complex that had a
charge of plus 3.

675
00:41:20 --> 00:41:24
So here, we need to figure out
the oxidation number of the

676
00:41:24 --> 00:41:29
cobalt, and for this
particular group, the overall

677
00:41:29 --> 00:41:30
charge of that is 0.
 

678
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
We have three hydrogens at
plus 1, and we also have

679
00:41:35 --> 00:41:38
a nitrogen at minus 1.
 

680
00:41:38 --> 00:41:41
And so, overall
that charge is 0.

681
00:41:41 --> 00:41:46
So we have six things of 0,
and what does that leave

682
00:41:46 --> 00:41:49
for our cobalt charge?
 

683
00:41:49 --> 00:41:51
Plus 3.
 

684
00:41:51 --> 00:41:55
Because overall, it now
has to equal plus 3.

685
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
So, then our d count for
our electrons is going

686
00:42:00 --> 00:42:02
to be the group number.
 

687
00:42:02 --> 00:42:05
And for cobalt, what's
the group number?

688
00:42:05 --> 00:42:07
9.
 

689
00:42:07 --> 00:42:14
So minus 3 is 6, so this cobalt
in this complex is what's

690
00:42:14 --> 00:42:21
called a d 6 system.
 

691
00:42:21 --> 00:42:31
All right, let's look at a
couple other examples here.

692
00:42:31 --> 00:42:35
Let's look at nickel
with carbon monoxide

693
00:42:35 --> 00:42:40
ligands, four of them.
 

694
00:42:40 --> 00:42:47
What would nickel
be in this case?

695
00:42:47 --> 00:42:48
Someone said zero.
 

696
00:42:48 --> 00:42:49
That's right.
 

697
00:42:49 --> 00:42:54
So this is zero, and nickel
is zero, the overall

698
00:42:54 --> 00:42:56
charge is zero.
 

699
00:42:56 --> 00:43:03
So, our oxidation
number here is 0.

700
00:43:03 --> 00:43:09
So, our d count here, what's
the group number for nickel?

701
00:43:09 --> 00:43:10
10.
 

702
00:43:10 --> 00:43:14
10 minus 0 is 10.
 

703
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
So we have a d 10 system.
 

704
00:43:20 --> 00:43:24
So, I'm going to write another
example down and you're going

705
00:43:24 --> 00:43:28
to tell me the answer to this
one as a clicker question.

706
00:43:28 --> 00:43:42
So we have cobalt, two waters
-- three waters -- that's

707
00:43:42 --> 00:43:43
actually a mistake.
 

708
00:43:43 --> 00:43:45
It should be two.
 

709
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
Two waters, because it's going
to be six things -- this is not

710
00:43:50 --> 00:43:54
some kind of bizzaro
seven complex.

711
00:43:54 --> 00:43:58
So here's the correct, cobalt,
two waters, one ammonia,

712
00:43:58 --> 00:44:32
and three chlorides with an
overall charge of minus 1.

713
00:44:32 --> 00:44:34
All right, let's just take
10 seconds, since we're

714
00:44:34 --> 00:44:49
running out of time.
 

715
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
So that's right, we should
have a charge of plus 2 here.

716
00:44:53 --> 00:45:00
This is zero, 0 minus 3,
overall minus 1, so we

717
00:45:00 --> 00:45:01
have a plus 2 state.
 

718
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
We have 9 minus 2, which is
7, and it's a d 7 system.
