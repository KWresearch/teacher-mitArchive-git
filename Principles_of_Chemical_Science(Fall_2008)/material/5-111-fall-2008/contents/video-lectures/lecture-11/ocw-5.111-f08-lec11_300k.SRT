9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's get started.

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
Could everyone take 10
more seconds on the

11
00:00:26 --> 00:00:27
clicker question.
 

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:35
And as a reminder, hopefully I
don't need to remind any of

13
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
you, but exam 1 is on
Wednesday, so rather than our

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
clicker question being on
something from last class,

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
which is exam 2 material, let's
just make sure everyone

16
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
remembers some small topic from
exam 1 material, which is the

17
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
idea of angular nodes.
 

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
So I was hoping to see more
like 99% on this, but you

19
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
do still have two more
days before the exam.

20
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
Remember, we're talking about
angular nodes here, so you need

21
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
to read the question carefully.
 

22
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
For an angular node, we're just
talking about what the l value

23
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
is, so whatever l is equal to
is equal to the number of

24
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
angular nodes you have.
 

25
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
For an f orbital, what is the
quantum number l equal to?

26
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
Three.
 

27
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
Good, so everyone that
recognized that probably got

28
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
the right answer of three
angular nodes here.

29
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
So let's switch to
today's notes.

30
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Two more quick things about the
exam, the first is that just

31
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
remember on Wednesday, don't
come here, the exam is not

32
00:01:29 --> 00:01:30
here, don't come here.
 

33
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
It's in Walker, so make
sure you go to Walker.

34
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
And also, keep in mind
that I have office hours

35
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
today from 3 to 5.
 

36
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
All your TA's have either
already have their extra office

37
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
hours, or there are some that
will be going on tonight or

38
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
tomorrow, so keep those in mind
as your finishing up your

39
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
studying for the exam.
 

40
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
So, today we're moving
on, we're talking about

41
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
Lewis structures.
 

42
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
This is a really good topic
to do the class before an

43
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
exam because it's a little
bit of a lighter topic.

44
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
We remember that Lewis
structures are an idea that

45
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
are pre-quantum mechanics.
 

46
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
So that means that we don't
have to worry about things like

47
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
wave functions when we're
talking about Lewis structures,

48
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
but because they're so simple
to use and because they so

49
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
often predict the electron
configuration of molecules

50
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
accurately, we end up using
them all the time in chemistry,

51
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
so it's very valuable to know
how to draw them correctly and

52
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
to know how to work with them.
 

53
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
So we'll talk specifically
about drawing Lewis structures

54
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
and then about formal charge
and resonance, which are

55
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
within Lewis structures.
 

56
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
So remember, that when we
talked about Lewis structure,

57
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
the organizing principle behind
Lewis structures is the idea

58
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
that within the molecule the
atoms are going to arrange

59
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
their valence electrons, such
that each atom within the

60
00:02:43 --> 00:02:48
molecule has a complete
octet or full outer shell.

61
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
So this is the idea of the
octet rule that Lewis came

62
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
up with way back in 1902.
 

63
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
So, at the end of the class on
Friday, we saw that list of

64
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
eight steps that you always
need to go through when you

65
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
draw a Lewis structure.
 

66
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
Once you're doing this on your
own, especially, for example,

67
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
on exam 2, which is a ways down
the road, you won't be able to

68
00:03:09 --> 00:03:11
look at those steps, so you
need to make sure that you can

69
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
go through them without looking
at them, but for now we can

70
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
look at them as we are actually
learning how to draw the Lewis

71
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
structures, and rather just go
through them step-by-step, it's

72
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
more interesting to do
it with an example.

73
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
So let's hydrogen cyanide
as our first example.

74
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
So we have h c n.
 

75
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
So, in this example here, we
start with the first step --

76
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
the first step in any Lewis
structure is drawing the

77
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
skeletal structure.
 

78
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
So, essentially drawing how
the atoms are arranged

79
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
within our molecule.
 

80
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
And in this case we have three
choices here in terms of what's

81
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
going to be in the middle, so
we need to decide that first.

82
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
In terms of where different
atoms are in a molecule, if you

83
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
have a hydrogen atom or a
fluorine atom, you can pretty

84
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
much guarantee they're always
going to be terminal atoms.

85
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
By terminal I mean they're
only bonded to one thing.

86
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
So, for example, hydrogen or
fluorine they'll never be in

87
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
the middle, they'll always be
on the end of a molecule.

88
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
So that takes care of the
hydrogen, what about between

89
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
the carbon and the nitrogen?
 

90
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
In terms of picking a Lewis
structure that's going to be

91
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
the lowest energy, what you
want to do is put the atom with

92
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
the lowest ionization energy
in the center of your atom.

93
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
This should make sense because
if something has a low

94
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
ionization energy, that means
it's not very electronegative,

95
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
which means it's going to be a
lot happier giving up electron

96
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
density, which is essentially
what you're doing when you're

97
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
forming covalent bonds is
you're sharing some of

98
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
your electron density.
 

99
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
So, we keep the atoms with
the lowest ionization

100
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
energy in the center.
 

101
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
So, why don't you go ahead and
tell me, keeping that in mind,

102
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
which atom in terms of h c or n
would you expect to be in the

103
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
center of hydrogen cyanide?
 

104
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
And I put a periodic table
up there, just the part

105
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
you might need to look at.
 

106
00:04:53 --> 00:05:07
So this should be fast, so
let's take 10 seconds.

107
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
All right, good job everyone.
 

108
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
So most of you saw that carbon
should be in the center.

109
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Carbon should be in the center
because it has the lowest

110
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
ionization energy.
 

111
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
We know that ionization energy
is going to increase as we go

112
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
across the periodic table, so
that means carbon has a lower

113
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
ionization energy than
nitrogen, which is

114
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
right next to us.
 

115
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
So as I just said, we want to
put that one in the middle.

116
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
You got an extra hint here in
terms of the order, so even if

117
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
you had just forgotten what I
said, sometimes it's not a

118
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
terrible idea just to put it in
the order it's written, that

119
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
can give you a lot
of clues as well.

120
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
So, either of those ways of
figuring this out is the first

121
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
guess of what goes in the
middle will work pretty well.

122
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
So, let's go ahead and draw
our Lewis structure based on

123
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
the rest of the rules now
that we have a skeleton.

124
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
So our skeleton tells us that
carbon is in the middle, so

125
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
we'll put the h on one
side, and the n on

126
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
the other side there.
 

127
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
So, our second step, as we go
through our Lewis structure

128
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
rules, is to figure out how
many valence electrons we

129
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
have in our entire molecule.
 

130
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
So if we talk about hydrogen,
how many valence electrons

131
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
are we talking about?
 

132
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
1.
 

133
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
What about carbon?
 

134
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
I heard 4 and 6.
 

135
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
And remember, we're only
talking about valence

136
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
electrons, so the
outer-most shells.

137
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
So we're talking about four
valence electrons for carbon.

138
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
And then for nitrogen?
 

139
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
Lots of options I have to
choose from from these

140
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
answers, but it's 5.
 

141
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
So, if you can't immediately
know, and you don't all have

142
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
periodic tables in front of
you, so that's fine, but if you

143
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
have a periodic table in front
of you, you need to be able to

144
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
count valence electrons, so
work on that if it doesn't come

145
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
naturally to you in terms
of figuring that out.

146
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
So then in order to figure out
the complete number of valence

147
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
electrons in our molecule, we
just add 5 plus 4 plus 1.

148
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
So we end up having 10
valence electrons.

149
00:07:02 --> 00:07:09
Step three in our Lewis
structure rules is to figure

150
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
out how many electronis we
would need in order for every

151
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
single atom in our molecule to
have a full valence shell.

152
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
So, if we're talking about
hydrogen, that's our one

153
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
exception so far to
the octet rule.

154
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
So we actually only need two
electrons to fill up the

155
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
valence shell of hydrogen,
remember that's because all we

156
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
need to fill up is the 1 s.
 

157
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
However, for carbon and
nitrogen we need 8 each.

158
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
So in terms of total numbers
that we would need to complete

159
00:07:37 --> 00:07:40
our octets and fill our
valence shells, we would

160
00:07:40 --> 00:07:48
need 18 electrons.
 

161
00:07:48 --> 00:07:48
All right.
 

162
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
So let's bring down our
middle slide here.

163
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
So we have 18 electrons, and
the next thing that we need

164
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
to figure out is how many
bonding electrons we have.

165
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
So to figure out bonding
electrons, what we take is that

166
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
number 18, which is our total
number of electrons we need to

167
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
fill valence shells, and we
subtract it from our number of

168
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
valence electrons, which is 10.
 

169
00:08:11 --> 00:08:18
And what we find that we have
is 8 bonding electrons.

170
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
And hopefully on your paper,
you can actually reach your h c

171
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
n skeleton -- I think I should
probably re-draw mine here.

172
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
Because step five is that we
need to fill in our bonding

173
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
electrons, and we start it
with filling in two

174
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
electrons per bond.
 

175
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
So I'm just going to
re-draw my skeleton.

176
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
So, the first thing we do is
put two electrons between

177
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
h and c, and then two
electrons between c and n.

178
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
Remember, every time we have
two electrons that are being

179
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
shared, that's a single bond.
 

180
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
The next thing that we want to
do is figure out do we have

181
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
any bonding electrons left.
 

182
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
So let's see, we started with 8
bonding electrons, and we used

183
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
up only 4, so the answer is
yes, we have 4 bonding

184
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
electrons left.
 

185
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
So what we need to do is fill
in those extra bonding

186
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
electrons into our bonds.
 

187
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
Should I put an extra
pair of electrons here,

188
00:09:18 --> 00:09:19
does anyone think?
 

189
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
No.
 

190
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
The reason is because we
already have a full valence

191
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
shell for our hydrogen, it
doesn't want anymore electrons.

192
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
What about between the
carbon and nitrogen?

193
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
Yes.
 

194
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
Definitely, because both of
these are not anywhere near

195
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
filling up their octets yet.
 

196
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
So we can put actually all 4 of
our extra electrons in between

197
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
the carbon and the nitrogen.
 

198
00:09:39 --> 00:09:44
Now we have 6 things around
the nitrogen, and we have

199
00:09:44 --> 00:09:47
8 around the carbon.
 

200
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
So, what we do as our seventh
step is then figure out if we

201
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
have any extra valence
electrons left at all.

202
00:09:56 --> 00:10:01
So we started with 10 valence
electrons, we used up 8

203
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
of those electrons in
terms of making bonds.

204
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
So it turns out that we have
2 valence electrons left.

205
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
So we need to add those 2
valence electrons left as

206
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
lone pair electrons
in our structure.

207
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
So, which atom is in need of
those lone pair electrons?

208
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
The nitrogen.
 

209
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
The reason being that's
the only one that didn't

210
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
have a full octet yet.
 

211
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
So now we're done, actually
there is one more step,

212
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
which is to determine
the formal charge.

213
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
This is a good way to
actually check if your Lewis

214
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
structure is correct or not.
 

215
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
We haven't actually learned how
to calculate the formal charge

216
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
yet, we'll learn it soon.
 

217
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
So we won't do it for this
molecule, but we'll go back and

218
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
do it for some of our other
examples, and you can go back

219
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
and do it for this one.
 

220
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
The other thing is that
we can re-write our h

221
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
c n in terms of bonds.
 

222
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
So we know every time we have
two electrons, that's a bond.

223
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
So we have h, then we can
draw our bond as a line.

224
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
And then we have a triple
bond there because we have

225
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
3 pairs of electrons.
 

226
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
So it looks a lot less messy if
we just draw our Lewis

227
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
structure like this for h c n,
where we have h bonded to c

228
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
triple, bonded to n, and then a
lone pair on the

229
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
nitrogen there.
 

230
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
All right, so this is the same
procedure that we're going to

231
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
go through, regardless of what
kind of Lewis structure

232
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
we're going to draw.
 

233
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
What you'll actually find in
terms of asking your TAs about

234
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
the Lewis structure rules is
that sometimes they won't be as

235
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
good at them as you are, and
the reason is once you've drawn

236
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
enough of these structures, you
start to get a lot of chemical

237
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
intuition about what's right or
what's not right -- it just

238
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
looks wrong to you
if it's wrong.

239
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
So your TA might take a minute,
so be patient with them if they

240
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
see your structure and they say
oh, no, no, no, no that's

241
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
wrong, that's terrible, and
they don't immediately

242
00:11:46 --> 00:11:46
know why.
 

243
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
They might need to go through
the rules with you, you

244
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
might need to remind them.
 

245
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Hopefully, they'll all
study them again, so

246
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
this will be an issue.
 

247
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
But what really happens is as
you go on in chemistry, you

248
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
draw so many of these you can
just draw them without

249
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
following the rules.
 

250
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
Some of you might get almost to
that point, or you might be at

251
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
that point now, but I recommend
this for you and for me and for

252
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
the TAs, go through the rules
because there'll be cases where

253
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
it's a little bit tricky and
it's always much faster to have

254
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
gone through step-by-step, than
to try to just kind of hit or

255
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
miss figure out what's going
to be right or wrong.

256
00:12:19 --> 00:12:24
So, let's try another example
here, and let's try a case now

257
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
where instead of dealing with a
neutral molecule we have an

258
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
ion, so we have c n minus.
 

259
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
And what I'll mention to you
just in terms of the fact that

260
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
we're finally dealing with real
molecules, which is -- or

261
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
molecules that are made up of
more than one atom, which is

262
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
kind of exciting for me and
maybe for some other of you

263
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
that like to move into thinking
about what some of the

264
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
consequences of these
molecules reacting might be.

265
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
A lot of the examples that
we're going to give you in

266
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
terms of trying out your Lewis
structures will be molecule

267
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
that are used in organic
synthesis, or maybe they're

268
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
molecules that react in
interesting ways with

269
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
biomolecules in your body or
proteins in your body.

270
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
So, you already will have a
head start when you get on to

271
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
later classes, like organic
chemistry or if you're thinking

272
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
about biochemistry where being
able to draw the Lewis

273
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
structure allows you to think
about, eventually, the

274
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
reactivity of the molecule,
which becomes very interesting

275
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
in thinking about how you're
going to synthesize a more

276
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
complex molecule, or how that
molecule is going to interact

277
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
with an active site in
a protein in the body.

278
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
So, for example, just talking
about hydrogen cyanide or the

279
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
cyanide anion, these are both
molecules which are used

280
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
in organic synthesis, so
particularly the cyanide, anion

281
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
and salts of the cyanide anion.
 

282
00:13:41 --> 00:13:45
So either a potassium cyanide
or sodium cyanide, these are

283
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
used in synthesis in terms of
making carbon-carbon bonds.

284
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
So if you're trying to make a
more complicated organic

285
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
molecule, carbon-carbon bonds
are one of the most difficult

286
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
things to make an organic
chemistry, and it turns out

287
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
that c n minus is a very
reactive molecule, so it's a

288
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
good way, even though we'll go
over some drawbacks in a

289
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
second, it is a good way to
make carbon-carbon bonds.

290
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
It's very reactive.
 

291
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
And because, of course, we have
this carbon here what you

292
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
end up doing is adding a
carbon to your molecule.

293
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19
So, when you think about
cyanide, you might not think

294
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
about organic reagents.
 

295
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
Does anyone have something
else they think about when

296
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
they think about cyanide?
 

297
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
STUDENT: Death.
 

298
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
PROFESSOR: Death --
that's a good thought.

299
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Yes, cyanide and death, very
closely related as well.

300
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
Cyanide is incredibly
toxic, it's a poison.

301
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
That might be how you're
more familiar with cyanide.

302
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
So if you're working with
cyanide in the lab as potassium

303
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
cyanide or sodium cyanide,
those are what are called p h

304
00:14:44 --> 00:14:49
s's, or particularly hazardous
substances -- it's a rating for

305
00:14:49 --> 00:14:50
different kinds of chemicals.
 

306
00:14:50 --> 00:14:52
And what that means it's
there's all sorts of

307
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
precautions and procedures you
take that are special when

308
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
you deal with these.
 

309
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
They're kept away from
other chemicals.

310
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
You handle them very special in
terms of being extra careful in

311
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
a very high ventilation
area, in hoods is

312
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
how you handle them.
 

313
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
So, yes, they're very
poisonous, and in fact, there

314
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
are areas where you find this
toxic compound, cyanide.

315
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
Other than just in poisons and
in organic synthesis shells,

316
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
you might also find them in
some things we're more familiar

317
00:15:25 --> 00:15:26
with, such as almonds.
 

318
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
I don't know how many know
that there are trace , trace

319
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
amounts, of cyanide in almonds.
 

320
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
I don't know if there any big
almond eaters out there.

321
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
You don't have to worry, we're
definitely talking about

322
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
trace, trace amounts.
 

323
00:15:38 --> 00:15:39
It's not going to hurt you.
 

324
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
And actually, what we usually
eat are what are called sweet

325
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
almonds, and there aren't
actual cyanide in the sweet

326
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
almonds we eat, there's
precursors to cyanide, which

327
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
might not make you
more comfortable.

328
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
But the fact is there are
trace, trace amounts.

329
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
This is nothing that we need
to worry in our food supply.

330
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
However, some people
aren't so lucky.

331
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with the Cassava

332
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
plant, which is a kind of woody
shrub that's first been

333
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
cultivated in South America,
but it's grown throughout

334
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
Africa, the Caribbean, South
America still, many places

335
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
around the world, and this is a
major source of carbohydrates

336
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
for much of the world, because
Cassava root is very, very

337
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
rich in carbohydrates.
 

338
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
It's not the best form of food
in that they're actually very

339
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
poor in protein, and
unfortunately very,

340
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
very rich in cyanide.
 

341
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
So, these roots can
be very dangerous.

342
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
There's different types of the
root that you can get called

343
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
the bitter and the sweet.
 

344
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
Hopefully you would all
choose the sweet if two

345
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
are put in front of you.
 

346
00:16:40 --> 00:16:42
The bitter, of course,
are the ones that are

347
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
very high in cyanide.
 

348
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
If you eat these raw, which
they do in many places around

349
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
the world, if you eat a bitter
one, you could, in fact, get

350
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
enough cyanide to kill you.
 

351
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
And there are ways to prepare
these, so it's important --

352
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
this kind of thinking more
along the food science idea.

353
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
There's a way to actually grind
down and prepare the flower, so

354
00:17:00 --> 00:17:04
that you promote the enzymes
within the plant to breakdown

355
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
the cyanide precursors.
 

356
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
And if you put this in the
well-ventilated area, if you

357
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
prepare this outside, the h c n
gas will actually be released

358
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
into the air, so you're
safe, you can eat it later.

359
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
About 80% of the cyanide at
that point is gone, so it does

360
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
render the root much more safe.
 

361
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
But you do, in fact, have to
worry about long-term exposure,

362
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
cyanide poisoning in terms of
long-term effects in certain

363
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
populations that do get the
bulk of their carbohydrates

364
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
from this root, from the
root of the Cassava plant.

365
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
But in terms of us going to the
grocery store and thinking

366
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
about things, probably we're
all breathing sighs of relief.

367
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
I just told you almonds are not
a problem, no worries there.

368
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
We probably don't find any
forms of the Cassava plant ever

369
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
in the U.S. that are going to
have that high cyanide content,

370
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
so we should all be relieved.
 

371
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
Unless, of course, you're a
smoker, or you're thinking of

372
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
becoming a smoker, and then
maybe you should worry,

373
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
because this is one of the
advertisements that was

374
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
airing in terms of
anti-smoking campaign.

375
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
Hydrogen cyanide is
found in cigarettes.

376
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
So, if you're looking for
another reason to quit, if

377
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
you're looking for a reason
not to start smoking,

378
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
here's another good one.
 

379
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
As I said, it's a particularly
hazardous substance, this is

380
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
worked with in fume hoods.
 

381
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
You don't want to inhale
it, it's definitely

382
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
not recommended.
 

383
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
The way, in the simplest terms
that cyanide can kill you, is

384
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
it basically out-competes your
oxygen for the heme

385
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
in your blood.
 

386
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
So instead of carrying oxygen
to your cells, you're carrying

387
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
cyanide to your cells.
 

388
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
Obviously, the amounts that are
in cigarettes are not enough

389
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
that people are dropping dead
of cyanide poisoning, but still

390
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
it's not a good idea if you can
avoid eating or inhaling

391
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
cyanide -- you definitely want
to minimize your exposure.

392
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
And in terms of thinking about
it for organic chemistry or if

393
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
you're interested in thinking
about the mechanism maybe by

394
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
which it is toxic, a first step
would be to draw its

395
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
Lewis structure.
 

396
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
So, let's go ahead and make
sure we can draw that, if we

397
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
have interest either in the
area of organic chemistry or

398
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
biochemistry or biology here.
 

399
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
So in terms of the first step
of skeletal structure, this is

400
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
actually going to be easier
because we don't have a central

401
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
atom, we just have carbon
and nitrogen here.

402
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
Our next step is thinking
about valence electrons.

403
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
So we have 4 plus 5, but we're
actually not done yet, because

404
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
it's c n minus, so if we have
minus, we actually have an

405
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
extra electron in our molecule.
 

406
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
So we need to add 1 more.
 

407
00:19:40 --> 00:19:45
If instead we had a positive
ion, a cation, what we would

408
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
have to do is subtract 1.
 

409
00:19:47 --> 00:19:50
But here we're going to
add 1, so again, we have

410
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
10 valence electrons.
 

411
00:19:54 --> 00:19:57
And if we go on to step three
where we figure out how many we

412
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
would need for full octets,
it's just going to be 2

413
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
times 8, so we have 16.
 

414
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
And step four is going to have
us figure out how many bonding

415
00:20:09 --> 00:20:15
electrons we have, so we have
16 minus 10, is going to

416
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
be 6 bonding electrons.
 

417
00:20:21 --> 00:20:26
So, step five tells us to add
2 electrons between each

418
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
atom, so we add two there.
 

419
00:20:32 --> 00:20:35
And step six asks us, well,
do we have any bonding

420
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
electrons left?
 

421
00:20:36 --> 00:20:40
So how many bonding
electrons do we have left?

422
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
Yup, so we do, we have 4 left.
 

423
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
We started with 6,
we only used 2.

424
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
This is very easy molecule
because we know exactly where

425
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
to put them without even having
to think, we only have one

426
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
option, and we'll make a triple
bond between the carbon

427
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
and the nitrogen.
 

428
00:20:56 --> 00:21:00
So, seven asks us if we have
any valence electrons left, and

429
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
how many valence electrons
do we have left?

430
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
Yeah, so also 4.
 

431
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
We started with 10 valence
electrons, we used up 6 of

432
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
those as bonding electrons, so
we have 4 left, which will

433
00:21:12 --> 00:21:14
be lone pair electrons.
 

434
00:21:14 --> 00:21:19
So, in order to fill our octet,
what we do is put two on the

435
00:21:19 --> 00:21:23
nitrogen and two on the carbon.
 

436
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
So, in terms of finishing our
Lewis structure, we're actually

437
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
not done yet here, even though
we have full octets, and we've

438
00:21:30 --> 00:21:34
used up all of our valence
electrons, and the reason is

439
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
because it's c n minus, so we
need to make sure that that's

440
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
reflected in our Lewis
structure, so let's put it in

441
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
brackets here, and
put a minus 1.

442
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
And also I wanted to mention in
terms of checking your Lewis

443
00:21:46 --> 00:21:49
structures, regardless of what
they are, you should always go

444
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
back and say how many valence
electrons did I have -- I had

445
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
10, and then count 2, 4, 6, 8,
10, because you always need to

446
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
make sure you have the same
number of valence electrons

447
00:21:59 --> 00:22:02
that you calculated in
your actual structure.

448
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
That'll catch a lot of just
silly mistakes for you if you

449
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
go back and see it and you
don't have all of that.

450
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
Let's re-draw this, so it looks
a little bit neater, where we

451
00:22:11 --> 00:22:16
have a triple bond in the
middle instead, and again, we

452
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
need our negative
1 charge there.

453
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
And our eigth step in the
process, again, is formal

454
00:22:23 --> 00:22:32
charge, which we will
talk about very soon.

455
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
All right.
 

456
00:22:33 --> 00:22:35
So let's try one more example
of drawing Lewis structures

457
00:22:35 --> 00:22:38
before we talk about
formal charge.

458
00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
And the last example that we're
going to talk about is thionyl

459
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
chloride, so it's s o c l 2.
 

460
00:22:45 --> 00:22:47
This is another good step
forward, because now we

461
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
actually have four different
atoms in our molecule.

462
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
I'll tell you a little about
thionyl chloride as well.

463
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
This is another organic
chemistry reagent, it's also

464
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
used extensively in the
pharmaceutical industry.

465
00:23:01 --> 00:23:03
And what it's used is to
convert one type of group,

466
00:23:03 --> 00:23:07
what's called a carboxylic acid
into another type of very

467
00:23:07 --> 00:23:10
reactive intermediate, which is
called an acid chloride.

468
00:23:10 --> 00:23:13
So I show that here, so in
green, you have what's called a

469
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
carboxcylic acid group, a c o o
h, which gets converted by s o

470
00:23:18 --> 00:23:23
c l 2 to a c double bond o
c l or an acid chloride.

471
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
This is the very
reactive intermediate.

472
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
You'll learn a lot more about
this if you take organic

473
00:23:27 --> 00:23:30
chemistry, but, In fact, you
can then go on and make a bunch

474
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
of other different kinds of
very interesting molecules.

475
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
So, for example, this is the
synthesis of novacaine.

476
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
This is what's used in industry
to actually make novacaine.

477
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
Has anyone had a
novacaine procedure?

478
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
Yes.
 

479
00:23:42 --> 00:23:47
I've had it also many
times, you usually get

480
00:23:47 --> 00:23:49
novacaine for cavities.
 

481
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
There's some alternatives
that are used now as well.

482
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
It's also used as a local
anesthetic for other types

483
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
of small procedures.
 

484
00:23:55 --> 00:23:58
So, this is, in fact, what's
used to make novacaine

485
00:23:58 --> 00:23:59
in industry.
 

486
00:23:59 --> 00:24:02
You'll notice that a lot of
different kinds medications do

487
00:24:02 --> 00:24:05
you have chlorine in them,
you'll see that c l group.

488
00:24:05 --> 00:24:08
So, for example, you might be
familiar with Wellbutrin

489
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
here, this is a type of
anti-depressant that a lot of

490
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
people use right now that are
taking anti-depressants.

491
00:24:14 --> 00:24:19
It's on the market, very
popular in terms of your

492
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
choices right now as an option
as an anti-depressant.

493
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
Also, Lunesta.
 

494
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
This was very big in an ad
campaign at least last year,

495
00:24:27 --> 00:24:30
I'm not sure if it still is,
with the little butterfly.

496
00:24:30 --> 00:24:31
This is the structure of
Lunesta, and you see

497
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
the c l in it as well.
 

498
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
I just wanted to point out that
although you see these chlorine

499
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
atoms in these drugs, what you
almost never see is an acid

500
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
chloride -- in fact, I don't
think I've ever seen an

501
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
acid chloride in a final
pharmaceutical product or drug

502
00:24:47 --> 00:24:50
that we take, and the reason is
because they're so reactive

503
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
that you wouldn't want to have
that in something you digest.

504
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
So just keep in mind when you
do see the chlorine in these

505
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
drugs, it's very different
from the acid chloride.

506
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
So, for example, Wellbutrin, it
is very unlikely that it would

507
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
have thionyl chloride in order
to make it, and if thionyl

508
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
chloride was used at some point
in the synthesis, it was not to

509
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
put that chlorine atom on, it
was to put something else on.

510
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
But in terms of drugs that
don't look like maybe this

511
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
compound was used in the
synthesis, many of them might

512
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
have used thionyl chloride,
because it generates such a

513
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
nice reactive intermediate
that you can go on and make a

514
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
bunch of different compounds
from that intermediate.

515
00:25:28 --> 00:25:28
All right.
 

516
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
So let's think about how to
draw the Lewis structure for

517
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
thionyl chloride -- oh,
actually, let me let you tell

518
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
me how we should start
this Lewis structure.

519
00:25:37 --> 00:25:40
So, which atom would you expect
to be in the center of a Lewis

520
00:25:40 --> 00:25:50
structure for thionyl chloride?
 

521
00:25:50 --> 00:25:50
All right.
 

522
00:25:50 --> 00:25:59
Let's take 10 seconds on that.
 

523
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
Looks like we have some fast
thinking here, a lot of last

524
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
minute answers coming in.
 

525
00:26:03 --> 00:26:04
OK.
 

526
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
We have a split decision, so --
you know what, actually, let's

527
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
think about this for a second.
 

528
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
So hopefully, it was a time
issue in terms of looking at

529
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
the periodic table, because
let's have you tell me what

530
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
are we looking for here?
 

531
00:26:22 --> 00:26:22
Yeah.
 

532
00:26:22 --> 00:26:22
OK.
 

533
00:26:22 --> 00:26:25
We're looking for the
lowest ionization energy.

534
00:26:25 --> 00:26:28
So, this one can be tricky
because oxygen looks like it's

535
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
in the middle because of the
way it's written, but we need

536
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
to start by looking at the
lowest ionization energy.

537
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
So, if we look on the periodic
table, comparing, for example,

538
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
s to o, if we have s it's below
o, what happens to ionization

539
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
energy as we go down a table?
 

540
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
It decreases.
 

541
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
If you're still not completely
up on the periodic trends, that

542
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
is stuff that's going to be on
the first exam, so make sure

543
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
that you're able to do this
without taking too much

544
00:26:54 --> 00:26:55
time to think about it.
 

545
00:26:55 --> 00:26:58
We would expect the ionization
energy to decrease, that means

546
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
that sulfur has our lowest
ionization energy.

547
00:27:00 --> 00:27:01
All right.
 

548
00:27:01 --> 00:27:05
So, let's go ahead and draw
our Lewis structure here

549
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
with sulfur in the middle.
 

550
00:27:08 --> 00:27:13
So, we can put our sulfur in
the middle, and then it doesn't

551
00:27:13 --> 00:27:16
really matter how we draw the
rest of it, where we put our c

552
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
l's versus where we
put our oxygens.

553
00:27:18 --> 00:27:23
We'll just put them in some
way around our sulfur atom.

554
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
So that's our step one.
 

555
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
For our step two, what we need
is number of valence electrons.

556
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
So we have 2 for each
of the chlorine.

557
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
How many valence electrons
are in chlorine?

558
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
All right.
 

559
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
So it's 7 that are in chlorine,
it's the same as fluorine or

560
00:27:42 --> 00:27:46
any of the others in that row
or in that group rather.

561
00:27:46 --> 00:27:51
2 times 7, plus we have 6 in
the sulfur, and oxygen is

562
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
right above sulfur,
so that also has 6.

563
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
So we end up having 26
valence electrons that

564
00:27:59 --> 00:28:01
we're dealing with here.
 

565
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
Our step three is to figure out
how many bonding electrons that

566
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
we need, or excuse me, how many
total electrons that we need to

567
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
fill up our octets, so
that's just going to be 4

568
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
times 8, which is 32.
 

569
00:28:15 --> 00:28:20
And then we take 32 minus 26.
 

570
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
So what we end up with in terms
of our bonding electrons

571
00:28:25 --> 00:28:27
is going to be 6
bonding electrons.

572
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
So we can go right ahead
and fill these in.

573
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
1 2, 3 4, 5 and 6.
 

574
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
And that was step five.
 

575
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
Step six is thinking about
do we have any bonding

576
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
electrons left?
 

577
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
Nope, we used them all up.
 

578
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
So we don't need to put
any more bonds in there.

579
00:28:46 --> 00:28:51
And step seven is how many
electrons do we have left

580
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
over that are going to
go into lone pairs?

581
00:28:54 --> 00:28:55
How many?
 

582
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
20.
 

583
00:28:56 --> 00:29:01
26 minus 6, so that tells
us 20, and these are all

584
00:29:01 --> 00:29:02
going to be lone pairs.
 

585
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
Well, we're talking about a
pretty high number here, so to

586
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
make counting easier, we'll
just say 10 lone pairs, because

587
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
20 lone pair electrons is the
same thing as 10 lone pairs.

588
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
And all we need to do is
go over here now and

589
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
fill up our octets.
 

590
00:29:16 --> 00:29:23
So oxygen gets 3 pairs, and
each chlorine gets 3 pairs,

591
00:29:23 --> 00:29:26
so now we're up to 9 pairs.
 

592
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
And what we have left here
is the sulfur, which

593
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
will also get a pair.
 

594
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
So, if you look at all of
these, we have full octets for

595
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
all of them, and if we count up
all of the valence electrons,

596
00:29:39 --> 00:29:44
it's going to be equal
to our number 26 here.

597
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47
And the last thing we do for
any of our structures to check

598
00:29:47 --> 00:29:50
them and figure out are these
valid or not valid, are these

599
00:29:50 --> 00:29:54
good Lewis structures is to
check the formal charge.

600
00:29:54 --> 00:29:56
So now that we have enough
practice drawing Lewis

601
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
structures, let's talk about
actually figuring out

602
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
this formal charge.
 

603
00:30:02 --> 00:30:05
So when we talk about formal
charge, basically formal charge

604
00:30:05 --> 00:30:10
is the measure of the extent to
which an individual atom within

605
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14
your molecule has either
gained or lost an electron.

606
00:30:14 --> 00:30:18
So as we said when we first
introduced covalent bonds, it's

607
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
a sharing of electrons, but
it's not always an

608
00:30:21 --> 00:30:22
equal sharing.
 

609
00:30:22 --> 00:30:24
Sometimes we have a very
electronegative atom that's

610
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
going to take more of its equal
share of electron density.

611
00:30:29 --> 00:30:32
So for example, that might have
a formal charge of negative 1,

612
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
because to some extent it has
gained that much electron

613
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
density that it now has a
formal charge that's negative.

614
00:30:40 --> 00:30:44
So, when we think about any
type of formal charges, we have

615
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
to assign these based on a
formula here, which is

616
00:30:48 --> 00:30:50
very easy to follow.
 

617
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
Formal charge equals v
minus l minus 1/2 s.

618
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
It's even easier to follow
if we know what all

619
00:30:57 --> 00:30:59
of those stand for.
 

620
00:30:59 --> 00:31:04
So, f c, I think you all
know is formal charge.

621
00:31:04 --> 00:31:10
Does anyone have a guess for v?
 

622
00:31:10 --> 00:31:12
Everyone has a guess, great.
 

623
00:31:12 --> 00:31:14
Valence electrons.
 

624
00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
What about l?
 

625
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
Lone pairs.
 

626
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
So, lone pair electrons,
actually, not lone

627
00:31:23 --> 00:31:25
pairs themselves.
 

628
00:31:25 --> 00:31:28
And then s?
 

629
00:31:28 --> 00:31:28
Good.
 

630
00:31:28 --> 00:31:30
That's a tricky one,
shared electrons.

631
00:31:30 --> 00:31:35
All right.
 

632
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
So this means we can actually
calculate this for any molecule

633
00:31:39 --> 00:31:41
that we've drawn the Lewis
structure for, because we

634
00:31:41 --> 00:31:44
actually do need to draw the
Lewis structure before we know,

635
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
for example, how many of each
of these we have, or at

636
00:31:47 --> 00:31:50
least go through the rules.
 

637
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
And what's important to keep in
mind about formal charge is if

638
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
we have a neutral atom, such as
we did in thionyl chloride

639
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
here, the sum of the individual
formal charges on individual

640
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
atoms within the molecule
have to equal 0.

641
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
So if we add them all up, there
should be no net charge on

642
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
the molecule, if the
molecule is neutral.

643
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
So, if we think about the
second case here where we have

644
00:32:15 --> 00:32:18
c n minus, now we're talking
about a molecule with a

645
00:32:18 --> 00:32:20
net charge of negative 1.
 

646
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
So that means if we add up all
of the formal charges within

647
00:32:23 --> 00:32:26
the molecule, what we would
expect to see is that they

648
00:32:26 --> 00:32:29
sum up to give a net
charge of negative 1.

649
00:32:29 --> 00:32:33
So we can do this for any final
charge we have, if we a

650
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
molecule that has a charge of
plus 2, then all of the formal

651
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
charges should add up
to plus 2 and so on.

652
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
So, let's just figure this out
for some of the examples we

653
00:32:44 --> 00:32:45
did, so for the cyanide anion.
 

654
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
So, if we want to figure out
the formal charge on the

655
00:32:49 --> 00:32:51
carbon, we need to take
the number of valence

656
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
electrons, so that's 4.
 

657
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
We need to subtract the lone
pair, what number is that?

658
00:32:58 --> 00:32:59
It's 2.
 

659
00:32:59 --> 00:33:03
And then 1/2 of the number
of shared electrons.

660
00:33:03 --> 00:33:06
So, shared electrons are the
ones that are shared between

661
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
the carbon and the nitrogen, so
we have 6 shared electrons, and

662
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
we want to take 1/2 of that.
 

663
00:33:12 --> 00:33:16
So we end up with a formal
charge on carbon of negative 1.

664
00:33:16 --> 00:33:18
We can do the same
thing for nitrogen.

665
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
So in terms of nitrogen that
starts off with a valence

666
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
number of 5, again we have 2
lone pair electrons in the

667
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
nitrogen, and again, we have
6 electrons that are shared.

668
00:33:29 --> 00:33:31
So what we see is that
the formal charge on

669
00:33:31 --> 00:33:34
the nitrogen is 0.
 

670
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
Also, formal charges can be
checked, as I just said.

671
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
Negative 1 plus 0 should add up
to negative 1, if in fact,

672
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
we're correct for
the c n anion.

673
00:33:43 --> 00:33:48
And it does, so we know that
we're probably on target in

674
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
terms of calculating
our formal charge.

675
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
So, let's think about our
second example -- actually our

676
00:33:53 --> 00:33:55
third, but the second one we're
going to talk about in terms of

677
00:33:55 --> 00:33:58
formal charge, which
is thionyl chloride.

678
00:33:58 --> 00:34:01
So why don't you tell me what
the formal charge should be on

679
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
the sulfur atom of
thionyl chloride?

680
00:34:03 --> 00:34:38
All right.
 

681
00:34:38 --> 00:34:53
Let's take 10 more seconds.
 

682
00:34:53 --> 00:34:56
OK, so the majority got it.
 

683
00:34:56 --> 00:35:00
So hopefully next time we do a
formal charge question, we'll

684
00:35:00 --> 00:35:01
get everyone back up to speed.
 

685
00:35:01 --> 00:35:04
But we've just introduced it,
so let's go back to the class

686
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
notes and explain why this
is the correct answer.

687
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
So if we look at sulfur,
what we need to do is take

688
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
the valence electrons in
sulfur, and there are 6.

689
00:35:13 --> 00:35:16
By looking at the periodic
table it's right underneath

690
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
oxygen, so those both
have 6 valence electrons.

691
00:35:19 --> 00:35:24
There are 2 lone pair electrons
on sulfur -- we only have 2

692
00:35:24 --> 00:35:29
lone pairs -- or 1 lone pair,
2 lone pair electrons.

693
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
And then we end up having 6
shared electrons, 2 from each

694
00:35:32 --> 00:35:35
of the bonds, so we end up
with a formal charge

695
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
on sulfur of plus 1.
 

696
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
If we go to the oxygen atom,
now we're talking about

697
00:35:42 --> 00:35:45
starting with 6 in terms of
valence electrons again, but

698
00:35:45 --> 00:35:50
instead of 2, you can see we
have 6 lone pair electrons

699
00:35:50 --> 00:35:53
around the oxygen minus 1/2
of 2, so we have minus

700
00:35:53 --> 00:35:55
1 is our formal charge.
 

701
00:35:55 --> 00:35:58
And if we talk about chlorine,
and both of the chlorines are

702
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
the same in this case, we start
with a valence number of 7 for

703
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
chlorine, and then we subtract
6, because it had 6 lone

704
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
pair electrons around each
of the chlorine atoms.

705
00:36:09 --> 00:36:14
Then minus 1/2 of 2, because
we only have one bond or

706
00:36:14 --> 00:36:16
2 electrons in a bond.
 

707
00:36:16 --> 00:36:19
So again, we should be able to
check all of our formal charges

708
00:36:19 --> 00:36:23
and make sure they add up to 0,
which they do, and that makes

709
00:36:23 --> 00:36:25
sense, because we have a
neutral atom in terms

710
00:36:25 --> 00:36:28
of thionyl chloride.
 

711
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
Another thing to mention in
terms of thinking about if you

712
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
have a good or a bad Lewis
structure, is that when you

713
00:36:34 --> 00:36:37
figure out the formal charge on
each of the atoms, it's the

714
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
more electronegative atoms that
you would expect to have that

715
00:36:40 --> 00:36:42
negative charge, and that
should make sense to you

716
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
because electronegative atoms
want to have electron density,

717
00:36:46 --> 00:36:49
they want to pull in electron
density to them, so it would

718
00:36:49 --> 00:36:51
make sense that they have more
of it, which would give

719
00:36:51 --> 00:36:53
them a negative charge.
 

720
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
So, if we compare the sulfur to
the oxygen, the oxygen it turns

721
00:36:58 --> 00:37:01
out is more electronegative and
that is what holds the negative

722
00:37:01 --> 00:37:04
charge in this molecule.
 

723
00:37:04 --> 00:37:07
Another thing I want to point
out, and for some of you just

724
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
ignore what I'm saying, if you
haven't thought about oxidation

725
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
number, if you haven't heard of
that before, don't worry we'll

726
00:37:13 --> 00:37:15
get to it in the second half
with Professor Drennan.

727
00:37:15 --> 00:37:17
But for those of you from high
school that have learned about

728
00:37:17 --> 00:37:20
oxidation number and maybe are
starting to think about it when

729
00:37:20 --> 00:37:23
you look at these molecules,
formal charge is -- it's not

730
00:37:23 --> 00:37:26
the same thing as oxidation
number, so separate those

731
00:37:26 --> 00:37:27
two things in your head.
 

732
00:37:27 --> 00:37:29
We'll get to oxidation number
in the second half of this

733
00:37:29 --> 00:37:35
course, but it's not in any way
the same idea as formal charge.

734
00:37:35 --> 00:37:35
All right.
 

735
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
So formal charge can actually
help us out when we're trying

736
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
to decide between several Lewis
structures that look like they

737
00:37:41 --> 00:37:44
might be comparable in terms of
which might be the lower energy

738
00:37:44 --> 00:37:46
or the more stable structure.
 

739
00:37:46 --> 00:37:48
The examples we've done
so far have been pretty

740
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
straightforward, so we haven't
needed to use formal charge to

741
00:37:51 --> 00:37:53
make this kind of decision.
 

742
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
But we could, for example, look
at a case where we have several

743
00:37:57 --> 00:37:59
different structures that look
pretty good, and the one we

744
00:37:59 --> 00:38:03
want to determine as being the
lowest energy structure is the

745
00:38:03 --> 00:38:06
one in which the absolute
values of the formal charges

746
00:38:06 --> 00:38:09
are going to be lower, so
essentially that they have

747
00:38:09 --> 00:38:11
less charge separation.
 

748
00:38:11 --> 00:38:13
Those are going to be the
more stable or the lower

749
00:38:13 --> 00:38:16
energy structures.
 

750
00:38:16 --> 00:38:18
So, for example, let's
look at thiocyanate

751
00:38:18 --> 00:38:22
ion, we have c s and n.
 

752
00:38:22 --> 00:38:25
What we've learned so far is as
a first approximation, what we

753
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
want to do is put the atom
with the lowest ionization

754
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
energy in the middle here.
 

755
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
So let's compare those
ionization energies.

756
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
We have 10 90 for carbon,
1,000 for sulfur, and

757
00:38:37 --> 00:38:39
1,400 for nitrogen.
 

758
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
So, thinking about ionization
energy, which atom would

759
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
you put in the middle here?
 

760
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
So, a lot of people I
hear are saying sulfur,

761
00:38:49 --> 00:38:50
and that's right.
 

762
00:38:50 --> 00:38:52
So, in terms of ionization
energy, we would expect to

763
00:38:52 --> 00:38:53
see sulfur in the middle.
 

764
00:38:53 --> 00:38:56
So if we went through and drew
out our Lewis structure

765
00:38:56 --> 00:38:59
following each of our steps,
what we would get is this as

766
00:38:59 --> 00:39:02
our Lewis structure here, and
we could figure out all

767
00:39:02 --> 00:39:03
of the formal charges.
 

768
00:39:03 --> 00:39:05
But what I'm going to tell you
already is this is a case

769
00:39:05 --> 00:39:08
where, in fact, it's an
exception to the idea that the

770
00:39:08 --> 00:39:11
lowest energy structure has the
lowest ionization energy in the

771
00:39:11 --> 00:39:14
middle, and we can figure
this out when we look

772
00:39:14 --> 00:39:15
at formal charge.
 

773
00:39:15 --> 00:39:18
It's always a good first
approximation, because you need

774
00:39:18 --> 00:39:20
to start somewhere in terms of
drawing Lewis structures, but

775
00:39:20 --> 00:39:23
then if you go and figure out
the formal charge and you just

776
00:39:23 --> 00:39:26
have lots of charge separation
or very high charges, like a

777
00:39:26 --> 00:39:30
plus 2 and a minus 2 and a
minus 1 all different places in

778
00:39:30 --> 00:39:32
the atom, what it should tell
you is maybe there's

779
00:39:32 --> 00:39:33
a better structure.
 

780
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
So, let's think of all of the
combinations that we could have

781
00:39:36 --> 00:39:38
in terms of this molecule.
 

782
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
So in one case, we could
actually put carbon in the

783
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43
middle, in one place, we could
put sulfur in the middle, and

784
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
in one case we could
put nitrogen.

785
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
And then we can go ahead and
let's quickly write out what

786
00:39:47 --> 00:39:49
the formal charges for
all of these will be.

787
00:39:49 --> 00:39:53
So in our first structure, we
would find for the nitrogen we

788
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
have a formal charge 5 minus 4
minus 2, because we're starting

789
00:39:57 --> 00:40:00
with 5 valence electrons,
so that is a formal

790
00:40:00 --> 00:40:03
charge of minus 1.
 

791
00:40:03 --> 00:40:08
For the carbon, we start with 4
valence electrons, we have 0

792
00:40:08 --> 00:40:11
lone pair electrons minus 4,
and we end up with a

793
00:40:11 --> 00:40:14
formal charge of 0.
 

794
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
For the sulfur, we start off
with 6 valence electrons, minus

795
00:40:18 --> 00:40:23
4 lone pair electrons, minus 2,
taking in account our bonding

796
00:40:23 --> 00:40:26
electrons, so we end up
with a formal charge of 0.

797
00:40:26 --> 00:40:28
All right, so this
looks pretty good.

798
00:40:28 --> 00:40:30
We don't actually have
much charge separation

799
00:40:30 --> 00:40:31
in this case here.
 

800
00:40:31 --> 00:40:34
Let's take a look at the
lowest ionization energy

801
00:40:34 --> 00:40:35
in the center case.
 

802
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
And what you find out if you do
these calculations, is that you

803
00:40:39 --> 00:40:42
have a negative 1 for your
formal charge on nitrogen, you

804
00:40:42 --> 00:40:47
have a negative 2 for your
formal charge on carbon, and

805
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
you have a positive 2 for your
formal charge on sulfur.

806
00:40:51 --> 00:40:53
If we look at our last
structure here where we have

807
00:40:53 --> 00:40:56
nitrogen the middle, we can
also figure out all those

808
00:40:56 --> 00:40:59
formal charges, and in this
case we have plus 1 on the

809
00:40:59 --> 00:41:04
nitrogen, we have minus 2 on
the carbon, and then we end up

810
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
with a 0 on the sulfur there.
 

811
00:41:08 --> 00:41:10
So let's go to a
clicker question.

812
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
If we call this structure a, b,
and c -- you can look on your

813
00:41:14 --> 00:41:16
notes, it also says structure
a, b, and c on your notes,

814
00:41:16 --> 00:41:19
so you didn't need to have
just memorized that slide.

815
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
But I want you to tell me in
terms of thinking about formal

816
00:41:23 --> 00:41:25
charge, which Lewis structure
would you predict to

817
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
be the most stable?
 

818
00:41:29 --> 00:41:43
And this should be fast, so
let's take 10 seconds on this.

819
00:41:43 --> 00:41:44
Okay, great.
 

820
00:41:44 --> 00:41:47
So let's go back to
our notes here.

821
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
And the reason that this should
be so fast is we already did

822
00:41:49 --> 00:41:51
all the calculations for
the formal charges.

823
00:41:51 --> 00:41:54
So what we see is that
structure a is the most stable

824
00:41:54 --> 00:41:57
because we have the least
separation of charge in

825
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
the case of structure a.
 

826
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
And you can do this any time
if you have Lewis structures

827
00:42:03 --> 00:42:04
that you're choosing between.
 

828
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
You won't always draw out
every single possibility

829
00:42:08 --> 00:42:09
that you have to start with.
 

830
00:42:09 --> 00:42:12
Often a good thing to start
with is to put the lowest

831
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
ionization energy atom in the
middle, and if you don't have

832
00:42:14 --> 00:42:18
charge separation then go with
that structure, but if you

833
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
do find you have a lot of
separation, such as the case in

834
00:42:20 --> 00:42:23
negative 2, positive 2, and
minus 1, then you want to say

835
00:42:23 --> 00:42:26
wait a second, this is really
bad in terms of formal charge,

836
00:42:26 --> 00:42:30
let me go ahead and see what
other options I have here.

837
00:42:30 --> 00:42:36
So, we can also get into a case
where we have similar values in

838
00:42:36 --> 00:42:39
terms of absolute values of
formal charge between two

839
00:42:39 --> 00:42:42
different molecules we're
deciding between in

840
00:42:42 --> 00:42:43
their Lewis structures.
 

841
00:42:43 --> 00:42:45
And in this case, the
tie-breaker goes to the

842
00:42:45 --> 00:42:48
molecule in which the negative
charge is on the most

843
00:42:48 --> 00:42:51
electronegative atom.
 

844
00:42:51 --> 00:42:53
So, let's look at an
example of this here.

845
00:42:53 --> 00:42:57
So we could say, for example,
this molecule here, this -- now

846
00:42:57 --> 00:42:59
we're dealing with a lot of
different atoms in the

847
00:42:59 --> 00:43:01
molecule, much more complicated
than the initial case of the

848
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
cyanide ion where
we only had two.

849
00:43:04 --> 00:43:06
So, how do we figure out first
how to draw the skeletal

850
00:43:06 --> 00:43:09
structure of this
molecule here?

851
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13
And one thing I want to tell
you to start out with is

852
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
something about this
c h 3 group here.

853
00:43:17 --> 00:43:23
Any time you see a c h 3,
this means a methyl group.

854
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
And if you draw out what a
methyl group is -- hopefully

855
00:43:27 --> 00:43:35
you won't have to spell it --
then what you have is a carbon

856
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
in the middle with three
hydrogens around it, and then

857
00:43:40 --> 00:43:43
it can only be bonded
to one other thing.

858
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
So any time you see c h 3 here,
remember that that's methyl and

859
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
that's going to be
a terminal group.

860
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
So, you already have a hint
that methyl groups are never

861
00:43:51 --> 00:43:54
in the middle, they always
have to be on the outside.

862
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
So that's a good start for us
putting together a skeletal

863
00:43:57 --> 00:43:59
structure for this
compound here.

864
00:43:59 --> 00:44:01
The other tip I'm going to give
you is any time you see a chain

865
00:44:01 --> 00:44:05
molecule, by chain I just
mean many different atoms

866
00:44:05 --> 00:44:06
written out in a row.
 

867
00:44:06 --> 00:44:10
A convention is that typically
you will put a terminal atom.

868
00:44:10 --> 00:44:13
We know that h is always
terminal, it's always on the

869
00:44:13 --> 00:44:15
end, never in the center.
 

870
00:44:15 --> 00:44:19
Right after the molecule
that it's attached to.

871
00:44:19 --> 00:44:22
So, for instance, this would
suggest to us by the way it's

872
00:44:22 --> 00:44:25
written, that the hydrogen is
attached to the nitrogen

873
00:44:25 --> 00:44:27
and not the oxygen.
 

874
00:44:27 --> 00:44:31
So, if we use those two tips to
try to figure out a structure,

875
00:44:31 --> 00:44:34
a skeletal structure, we would
get this structure here if we

876
00:44:34 --> 00:44:36
write out the full
Lewis structure.

877
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41
We could I think well, maybe
this isn't written out in terms

878
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
of that convention, which
sometimes it's not, so let's

879
00:44:44 --> 00:44:46
also try writing it, such that
we have the hydrogen and

880
00:44:46 --> 00:44:48
the oxygen atom there.
 

881
00:44:48 --> 00:44:50
So that would give us
this structure here.

882
00:44:50 --> 00:44:53
So notice a difference in these
structures, is this has an n h

883
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
bond whereas this
has an o h bond.

884
00:44:57 --> 00:45:01
And if we were to think about
which one of these is better,

885
00:45:01 --> 00:45:04
it turns out that it's the same
in terms of formal charges,

886
00:45:04 --> 00:45:05
so that doesn't help us out.
 

887
00:45:05 --> 00:45:08
So we need to go to this second
case where we're instead

888
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
going to think about
electronegativity, and we want

889
00:45:11 --> 00:45:13
to think about which atom is
the most electronegative.

890
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
So, in this case, we see that
our formal charge is negative

891
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
on the nitrogen, in this case
it's negative on oxygen.

892
00:45:22 --> 00:45:25
Which of those two is
more electronegative?

893
00:45:25 --> 00:45:26
The oxygen.
 

894
00:45:26 --> 00:45:28
So you should be able to look
at your periodic table and

895
00:45:28 --> 00:45:31
see this, or also I've
written the trend here.

896
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
So that means that the more
stable molecule is going to be

897
00:45:35 --> 00:45:38
this molecule here, which
actually puts the negative

898
00:45:38 --> 00:45:41
charge on be more
electronegative atom.

899
00:45:41 --> 00:45:46
So this is our lower
energy structure.

900
00:45:46 --> 00:45:49
So, these are the different
ways that we can actually go

901
00:45:49 --> 00:45:51
ahead and use formal charge
when we're choosing between

902
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
different types of
Lewis structures.

903
00:45:53 --> 00:45:56
So one last concept that I
want introduces is this

904
00:45:56 --> 00:45:58
idea of resonance.
 

905
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
And resonance is the idea that
sometimes one single Lewis

906
00:46:01 --> 00:46:04
structure does not adequately
describe the electron

907
00:46:04 --> 00:46:09
configuration around a given
molecule, so instead you need

908
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
to draw two different Lewis
structures to describe

909
00:46:12 --> 00:46:13
that more appropriately.
 

910
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
So, let's quickly go through
the Lewis structure for ozone.

911
00:46:17 --> 00:46:19
I have the skeletal structure
written up there, I've

912
00:46:19 --> 00:46:22
written it twice and you'll
see why in a minute.

913
00:46:22 --> 00:46:24
It's easy to write the skeletal
structure, because it's all

914
00:46:24 --> 00:46:26
oxygen, we don't have to worry
about what's going to

915
00:46:26 --> 00:46:27
go in the middle.
 

916
00:46:27 --> 00:46:30
In this case, we're going to
have 3 times 6 for valence

917
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
electrons -- 6 valence
electrons for each oxygen,

918
00:46:33 --> 00:46:37
so we have 18 total
valence electrons.

919
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
So, in order to fill up our
shell, what we need is 3

920
00:46:41 --> 00:46:44
times 8 or 24 electrons.
 

921
00:46:44 --> 00:46:49
This leaves us with 24
minus 18, or 6 bonding

922
00:46:49 --> 00:46:51
electrons left.
 

923
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
So what we can do is
fill that in here.

924
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
Clearly, we put 2 for each
bond, and now we end

925
00:46:58 --> 00:47:01
up having 2 remaining
bonding electrons left.

926
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
So here is where our
question comes, because

927
00:47:04 --> 00:47:04
where do we put it?
 

928
00:47:04 --> 00:47:08
There's absolutely nothing that
tells us which atoms we should

929
00:47:08 --> 00:47:11
put it between, because
they're both oxygen-oxygen.

930
00:47:11 --> 00:47:15
So, let's just arbitrarily put
it between these two in this

931
00:47:15 --> 00:47:19
case here, but actually there's
no reason we couldn't also put

932
00:47:19 --> 00:47:21
it between oxygen b and c, so
I'm going to draw

933
00:47:21 --> 00:47:25
another structure where
we have it here.

934
00:47:25 --> 00:47:28
So in terms of remaining
valence electrons we have 12,

935
00:47:28 --> 00:47:31
so we can finish off each of
our Lewis structures, so that's

936
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
our first structure there, and
our second structure there.

937
00:47:35 --> 00:47:37
We could also figure out the
formal charges, and obviously

938
00:47:37 --> 00:47:40
the formal charges between
these two atoms, they're going

939
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
to be identical, we're only
dealing with oxygen atoms here.

940
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
So, we need to think about what
this means -- which is the more

941
00:47:47 --> 00:47:50
stable structure, because we
have two different

942
00:47:50 --> 00:47:50
structures here.
 

943
00:47:50 --> 00:47:54
In this case we have a double
bond between a and b, and in

944
00:47:54 --> 00:47:56
this case we have it
between b and c.

945
00:47:56 --> 00:48:00
So, presumably, if we follow
our rules so far only one of

946
00:48:00 --> 00:48:02
these should be correct.
 

947
00:48:02 --> 00:48:05
And again, if we figure out the
formal charges, let's go

948
00:48:05 --> 00:48:09
through this quickly, we get 0
plus 1 and negative

949
00:48:09 --> 00:48:11
1 for structure 1.
 

950
00:48:11 --> 00:48:16
We get negative 1 plus 1
and 0 for structure 2.

951
00:48:16 --> 00:48:18
So as I said, they're going
to be identical in terms of

952
00:48:18 --> 00:48:21
making the decision that way.
 

953
00:48:21 --> 00:48:23
And what it turns out is
experimental evidence

954
00:48:23 --> 00:48:26
tells us that these two
structures are equivalent.

955
00:48:26 --> 00:48:28
And by that what we mean is
that they're absolutely

956
00:48:28 --> 00:48:31
identical, and it turns out
that this here is not a double

957
00:48:31 --> 00:48:34
bond, it's not a single bond
either, it's actually

958
00:48:34 --> 00:48:35
something in between.
 

959
00:48:35 --> 00:48:38
So if we look at its length,
it's actually shorter than a

960
00:48:38 --> 00:48:41
single bond, but longer
than a double bond.

961
00:48:41 --> 00:48:44
Or if we look at how strong it
is, it's actually stronger than

962
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
a single bond, but weaker
than a double bond.

963
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
And we find the same thing for
these two atoms here, it's not

964
00:48:50 --> 00:48:54
actually a double bond, it's
somewhere between a single

965
00:48:54 --> 00:48:56
bond and a double bond.
 

966
00:48:56 --> 00:48:59
So this is a case where we have
resonance structures, or we

967
00:48:59 --> 00:49:01
call this a resonance hybrid.
 

968
00:49:01 --> 00:49:04
So the reality of the situation
is that it's a combination

969
00:49:04 --> 00:49:06
between these 2 structures.
 

970
00:49:06 --> 00:49:08
And an important thing to
remember when we talk about

971
00:49:08 --> 00:49:12
resonance hybrids is that the
structure it's not 1/2 the time

972
00:49:12 --> 00:49:16
this structure, and 1/2 of the
time this structure, it's

973
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
actually some combination or
some average between

974
00:49:19 --> 00:49:20
the two structures.
 

975
00:49:20 --> 00:49:22
But since in drawing Lewis
structures we don't have a way

976
00:49:22 --> 00:49:26
to represent that -- actually,
in some cases you do, you can

977
00:49:26 --> 00:49:30
draw a dotted line that means a
1 and 1/2 bond, but most in

978
00:49:30 --> 00:49:33
most cases, we just draw out
both resonance structures, and

979
00:49:33 --> 00:49:35
the way that we say it's a
resonance structure is that we

980
00:49:35 --> 00:49:38
put it in the brackets and
we put an arrow between it.

981
00:49:38 --> 00:49:40
So, when you think about
resonance structures, some

982
00:49:40 --> 00:49:43
students tend to just get
confused and be picturing this

983
00:49:43 --> 00:49:45
flickering back and forth.
 

984
00:49:45 --> 00:49:49
A good example to keep in
mind is the idea of a mule.

985
00:49:49 --> 00:49:54
So most of you know, hopefully,
that a mule is a combination

986
00:49:54 --> 00:49:57
of a donkey and a horse.
 

987
00:49:57 --> 00:50:00
A mule is not spending 1/2 of
its time as a donkey, and 1/2

988
00:50:00 --> 00:50:04
of its time as a horse, we
don't see it flickering back

989
00:50:04 --> 00:50:07
and forth between the two,
that's not what we see.

990
00:50:07 --> 00:50:10
Instead what we see is it's an
average, it's part like a

991
00:50:10 --> 00:50:12
horse, it's part like a donkey.
 

992
00:50:12 --> 00:50:17
So if we want to put that in
chemical terms, we want to make

993
00:50:17 --> 00:50:20
sure we put these in brackets
here, and remember, this is the

994
00:50:20 --> 00:50:23
resonance arrow, it's not a
reaction arrow, it's a

995
00:50:23 --> 00:50:25
resonance arrow, so make
sure you mark it up

996
00:50:25 --> 00:50:27
correctly like that.
 

997
00:50:27 --> 00:50:30
When we talk about resonance
structures, the key word is

998
00:50:30 --> 00:50:33
that the electrons
are de-localized.

999
00:50:33 --> 00:50:36
So they're not just
between two atoms here.

1000
00:50:36 --> 00:50:38
Now, for example, in our
structure with ozone it's

1001
00:50:38 --> 00:50:41
between all three atoms.
 

1002
00:50:41 --> 00:50:44
And the final point I want to
make today, and this is very,

1003
00:50:44 --> 00:50:47
very important, so make sure
that you do understand this.

1004
00:50:47 --> 00:50:50
When we talk about resonance
structures, we're talking about

1005
00:50:50 --> 00:50:54
cases that have the same
arrangement of atoms, the key

1006
00:50:54 --> 00:50:57
is the atoms are the same, and
the thing that is different is

1007
00:50:57 --> 00:51:00
the arrangement of
electrons here.
