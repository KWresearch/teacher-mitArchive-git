9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
As you're settling in, why
don't you take 10 more seconds

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
to answer the clicker question.
 

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
This is the last question we'll
see in class on the

13
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
photoelectric effect, so
hopefully we can have a very

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
high success rate here to show
we are all ready to move on

15
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
with our lives here.
 

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
OK, good.
 

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
So, most of you did get
the answer correct.

18
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
For those of you that didn't,
you, of course, can ask your

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
TA's about this in recitation,
they'll always have a

20
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
copy of these slides.
 

21
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
But just to point out the
confusion can be we've

22
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
actually switched what
the question is here.

23
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
What the information we gave
was the work function, which is

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
what we've been giving before,
but now we gave you the kinetic

25
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
energy of the ejected electron,
so you just need to rearrange

26
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
your equation so now you're
solving for the incoming

27
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
energy, which would mean
that you need to add those

28
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
two energies together.
 

29
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
So, hopefully everyone that
didn't get this right, can look

30
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
at it again and think about
asking it's just asking the

31
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
question in a different
kind of a way.

32
00:01:21 --> 00:01:21
All right.
 

33
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
So, we can switch over
to the class notes.

34
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
So today, we're going
to start talking about

35
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
the hydrogen atom.
 

36
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
Now that we have our
Schrodinger equation for the

37
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
hydrogen atom, we can talk
about it very specifically in

38
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
terms of binding energies and
also in terms of orbitals.

39
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
And we talked about on
Wednesday the conditions that

40
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
allowed us to use quantum
mechanics, which then enable

41
00:01:43 --> 00:01:45
us to have the Schrodinger
equation, which we can apply,

42
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
and part of that is the wave
particle duality of

43
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
light and matter.
 

44
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
So there was a good question in
Wednesday's class about the de

45
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
Broglie wavelength and if it
can actually go to infinity.

46
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
So I just wanted to address
that quickly before we move on,

47
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
and actually address another
thing about dealing with

48
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
wavelengths of particles
that sometimes comes up.

49
00:02:08 --> 00:02:16
So, the question that we had in
last class, was if we have

50
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
actually a macroscopic
particle, and the velocity

51
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
let's say starts to approach
zero, shouldn't we have the

52
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
wavelength go to infinity, even
if we have a magic board, and

53
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
even if the mass
is really large.

54
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
So, in most cases, you would
think that as the velocity gets

55
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
very tiny, the mass is still
going to be large enough to

56
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
cancel it out and still make it
such that the wavelength is

57
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
going to be pretty
small, right.

58
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
Because if we think about the
h, Planck's constant, here

59
00:02:47 --> 00:02:52
that's measured in 10 to the
negative 34 joules per second.

60
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
So, we would actually need a
really, really, really tiny

61
00:02:54 --> 00:02:59
velocity here to actually
overcome the size of the mass,

62
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
if we're talking about
macroscopic particles, to have

63
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
a wavelength that's going
to be on the order.

64
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
So, let's say we're talking
about the baseball, have a

65
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
wavelength of the baseball
that's on the order

66
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
of the baseball.
 

67
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
So, if we kind of think about
the numbers we would need, we

68
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
would actually need a velocity
that approached something

69
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
that's about 10 to the negative
30 meters per second.

70
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
So first of all, that's
pretty slow here.

71
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
It's going to be hard to
measure anyway, and in fact, if

72
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
we're talking about something
going 10 to the negative 30,

73
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
and we're going to observe it
using our eyes, so you using

74
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
visible light to observe
something going this slow,

75
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
we're actually not going to be
able to do it because we're

76
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
limited by the wavelength of
light to see how precise we

77
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
can measure where the
actual position is.

78
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
So let's say we have the
wavelength of light somewhere

79
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
on the order of 10 to the
negative 5 meters, being the

80
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
wavelength of light, we're only
going to be able to measure the

81
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
velocity because of the
uncertainty principle

82
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
to a certain degree.
 

83
00:03:58 --> 00:04:05
And it turns out it's three
orders of magnitude that -- the

84
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
uncertainty is three orders of
magnitude bigger than the

85
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
velocity that we're actually
trying to observe to get to a

86
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
point where we could see the
wavelength, for example, for

87
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
even a baseball that
is moving this slow?

88
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
So that the more complete
answer to the question is that

89
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
no, we're never going to be
able to observe that because of

90
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
the uncertainty principle it's
not possible to observe a

91
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
velocity that's this slow
for a macroscopic object.

92
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32
So, hopefully that kind of
clears up that question.

93
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
And, of course, when the
velocity actually is zero, this

94
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
equation that the de Broglie
has put forth is valid for

95
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
anything that has momentum, so
if something does not have any

96
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
velocity at all, it actually
does not have momentum, so you

97
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
can't apply that
equation anyway.

98
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
And another thing that came up,
and it came up in remembering

99
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
as I was writing your problem
set for this week, which will

100
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
be posted sometime this
afternoon, your problem set 2,

101
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
is when we're talking about
wavelengths of particles, and

102
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
for specifically for electrons
sometimes, you're asked to

103
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
calculate what the energy is.
 

104
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
And I just want to remind
everyone, so this is a separate

105
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
thought here, that we often use
the energy where energy is

106
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
equal to h c divided
by wavelength.

107
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
So if we're talking about, for
example, we know the wavelength

108
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
of an electron and we're trying
to find the energy or vice

109
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
versa, is this an equation
we can use to do that?

110
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
What do you think?
 

111
00:05:31 --> 00:05:31
No.
 

112
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Hopefully you're
going to say no.

113
00:05:33 --> 00:05:37
And the reason is, and this
will come up on the problems

114
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
and a lot of students end up
using this equation, which is

115
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
why I want to head it off and
mention it ahead of time, we

116
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
can't use an equation because
this equation is very

117
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
specific for light.
 

118
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
We know it's very specific for
light because in this equation

119
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
is c, the speed of light.
 

120
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
So any time you go to use this
equation, if you're trying to

121
00:05:54 --> 00:05:57
use it for an electron, just
ask yourself first, does

122
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
an electron travel at
the speed of light?

123
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
And if your answer is no, your
answer will be no, then you

124
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
just know you can't use
this equation here.

125
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
So instead you'd have to maybe
if you start with wavelength,

126
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
go over there, and then figure
out velocity and do something

127
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
more like kinetic energy equals
1/2 n b squared to get there.

128
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
So this is just a heads
up for as you start

129
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
your next problem set.
 

130
00:06:21 --> 00:06:21
All right.
 

131
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
So jumping in to having
established that, yes,

132
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
particles have wave-like
behavior, even though no,

133
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
they're not actually photons,
we can't use that equation.

134
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
But we can use equations that
describe waves to describe

135
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
matter, and that's what we're
going to be doing today.

136
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
We're going to be looking at
the solutions to the

137
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
Schrodinger equation for a
hydrogen atom, and specifically

138
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
we'll be looking at the binding
energy of the electron

139
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
to the nucleus.
 

140
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
So we'll be looking at the
solution to this part of

141
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
the Schrodinger equation
where we're finding e.

142
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Then we'll go on, after we've
made all of our predictions for

143
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
what the energy should be, we
can actually confirm whether or

144
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
not we're correct, and we'll do
this by looking at photon

145
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
emission and photon absorption
for hydrogen atoms, and we'll

146
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
actually do a demo with that,
too, so we can confirm it

147
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
ourselves, as well as matching
it with the observation

148
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
of others.
 

149
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
And if we have time, we'll move
on also to talking about the

150
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
other part of the solution to
the Schrodinger equation, which

151
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
is psi or this wave
function here.

152
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
And remember I said that
wave function is just a

153
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
representation of the particle,
particularly when we're talking

154
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
about electrons -- we're
familiar with the term

155
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
orbitals. psi is just a
description of the orbital.

156
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
So, we'll start with an
introduction to that if

157
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
we got to it at the end.
 

158
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
So, to remind you, when we look
at the Schrodinger equation

159
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
here, we have two parts to it,
so when we solve the

160
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Schrodinger equation, we're
either finding psi, which as I

161
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
said, is a wave function
or an orbital.

162
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57
And in addition to finding psi,
we can also solve to find e or

163
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
to find the energy for any
given psi, and these are the

164
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
binding energies of the
electron to the nucleus.

165
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
And the most important thing
about using the Schrodinger

166
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
equation and getting out our
solutions for potential

167
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
orbitals and potential energies
for an electron with the

168
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
nucleus, is that what we find
is that quantum mechanics, and

169
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
quantum mechanics allowing us
to get to the Schrodinger

170
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
equation, allows us to
correctly predict and confirm

171
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
our observations for what we
can actually measure are

172
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
indeed the energy levels.
 

173
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Here we're talking about a
hydrogen atom and that's

174
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
what we'll focus on today.
 

175
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
And it's incredibly precise
and we're able to make the

176
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
predictions and match
them with experiment.

177
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Also, when we're looking at the
Schrodinger equation, it allows

178
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
us to explain a stable hydrogen
atom, which is something that

179
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
classical mechanics did
not allow us to do.

180
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
So here's the solution for a
hydrogen atom, where we have

181
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
the e term here is equal to
everything written in green.

182
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
We've got a lot of constants in
this solution to the hydrogen

183
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
atom, and we know what
most of these mean.

184
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
But remember that this whole
term in green here is what is

185
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
going to be equal to that
binding energy between the

186
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
nucleus of a hydrogen
atom and the electron.

187
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
So, let's go ahead and define
our variables here, they

188
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
should be familiar to us.
 

189
00:09:17 --> 00:09:23
We have the mass, first of
all, m is equal to m e, so

190
00:09:23 --> 00:09:29
that's the electron mass.
 

191
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
We also have e, which is
going to be the charge

192
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
on the electron.
 

193
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
In addition to that, we have
that epsilon nought value,

194
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
remember that's the
permittivity constant in a

195
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50
vacuum, and basically that is
what we use as a conversion

196
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
factor to get from units.
 

197
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
We don't want namely coulombs
to units, we want that will

198
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
allow us to cancel out
in this equation.

199
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
And finally we have Planck's
constant here, which

200
00:09:59 --> 00:10:03
we're all familiar with.
 

201
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
So, what actually happens when
people work with the solution

202
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
to the Schrodinger equation for
a hydrogen atom is that they

203
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
don't always want to deal with
all these constants here, so we

204
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
can actually group them
together and use them as a

205
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
single new constant, and this
new constant is the

206
00:10:20 --> 00:10:21
Rydberg constant.
 

207
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
And the Rydberg constant
is actually equal to 2 .

208
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
1 8 times 10 to the
negative 18 joules.

209
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
So when we pull out all of
those constants and instead use

210
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
the Rydberg constant, what it
allows us to do is really

211
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
simplify our energy equation.
 

212
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
So now we have that energy
is equal to the negative

213
00:10:41 --> 00:10:46
of the Rydberg constant
divided by n squared.

214
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
So, what we have left in our
equation is only one part that

215
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
we haven't explained yet,
and that is that n value.

216
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
And it turns out that when you
solve the Schrodinger equation,

217
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
you find that there are only
certain allowed values

218
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
of this integer n.
 

219
00:10:59 --> 00:11:07
And those allowed values range
anywhere from n equals 1, you

220
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
can have n equal that 2, 3, and
it goes all the way

221
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
up to infinity.
 

222
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
But the important part is that
there are only certain allowed

223
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
values, so for example,
you can't have 1 .

224
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
5 or 2 .
 

225
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
3, there are only these
interger numbers.

226
00:11:22 --> 00:11:34
And this n here is what we call
the principle quantum number.

227
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
And what we find is when we
apply n and plug it in to our

228
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
energy equation, is that what
we see is now we don't just

229
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
have one distinct answer, we
don't just have one possible

230
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
binding energy of the
electron to the nucleus.

231
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
We're going to find that we
actually have a whole bunch of

232
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
possible, in fact, an infinite
number of possible energy

233
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
levels, and that's easier to
see on this energy

234
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
diagram here.
 

235
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
So, let's start with n
equals 1, since that's, of

236
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
course, the simplest case.
 

237
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
So, if we have n equals 1, we
can plug it into our energy

238
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
equation here, and find that
the binding energy, the e sub

239
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
n, for n equals 1, it's just
going to be equal to the

240
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
negative of the Rydberg
constant, so we can actually

241
00:12:18 --> 00:12:22
graph that on an energy diagram
here, and it's going to be down

242
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
low at the bottom because
that's going to be, in fact,

243
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
the lowest or most negative
energy when n equals 1.

244
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
But we saw from our equation
that there's more than just one

245
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
possible value for n, so we
could, for example, have n

246
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
equals 2, n equals 3, all the
way up to n equaling infinity.

247
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
So what this tells us here is
that this is not necessarily

248
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
the binding energy of the
electron in a hydrogen atom,

249
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
it's also possible that it
could, for example, have this

250
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
energy, it could have this
energy up here, it could have

251
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
some energy way up here.
 

252
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
So we have this infinite number
of possible binding energies.

253
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
But the really important point
here is that they're quantized.

254
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
So it's not a continuum of
energy that we can have, it's

255
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
only these punctuated points
of energy that are possible.

256
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
So as I tried to say on the
board, we can have n equals 1,

257
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
but since we can't have n
equals 1/2, we actually can't

258
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
have a binding energy that's
anywhere in between these

259
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
levels that are indicated here.
 

260
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
And that's a really important
point for something that comes

261
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
out of solving the Schrodinger
equation is this quantization

262
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
of energy levels.
 

263
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
And thanks to our equation
simplified here, it's very easy

264
00:13:32 --> 00:13:35
for us to figure out what
actually the allowed

265
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
energy levels are.
 

266
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
So for n equals 2, what would
the binding energy be?

267
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Someone shout it out.
 

268
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
Yup.
 

269
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
So, I think the compilation of
the voices that I heard was

270
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
negative r h over 2 squared.
 

271
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
We can do the same thing for 3,
negative r h over 3 squared is

272
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
going to be our binding energy.
 

273
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
For 4, we can go all the way up
to infinity, and actually when

274
00:14:01 --> 00:14:05
we get to the point where it's
infinity, what we find is

275
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
the binding energy at that
point is going to be zero.

276
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
And when we get to infinity,
what that means is that we now

277
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
have a free electron, so now
the electron has totally

278
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
separated from the atom.
 

279
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
And that makes sense because
we're at the point where

280
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
there's no binding energy
keeping it stable.

281
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
You'll also know that all of
these binding energies here

282
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
are negative, so the negative
sign indicates that it's low.

283
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
It's a more negative energy,
it's a lower energy state.

284
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
So whenever we're thinking
about energy states, it's

285
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
always more stable to be more
low in an energy well, so

286
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
that's why it makes sense that
it's favorable, in fact, to

287
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
have an electron interacting
with the nucleus that

288
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
stabilizes and lowers
the energy of that

289
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
electron by doing so.
 

290
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
So, we actually term this n
equals 1 state gets a special

291
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
name, which we call the ground
state, and it's called the

292
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
ground state because it is, in
fact, the lowest to the

293
00:15:05 --> 00:15:05
ground that we can get.
 

294
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
It's the most negative
and most stable energy

295
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
level that we have.
 

296
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
And when we think about kind of
in a more out practical sense

297
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
what we mean by all of these
binding energies, another way

298
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
that we can put it is to give
it some physical significance,

299
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
and the physical significance
of binding energies is that

300
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
they're equal to the negative
of the ionization energies.

301
00:15:30 --> 00:15:34
So, for example, in a hydrogen
atom, if you take the binding

302
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
energy, the negative of that is
going to be how much energy you

303
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
have to put in to ionize
the hydrogen atom.

304
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
So, if, for example, we were
looking at a hydrogen atom in

305
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
the case where we have the n
equals 1 state, so the electron

306
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
is in that ground state, the
ionization energy, it makes

307
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
sense, is going to be the
difference between the ground

308
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
state and the energy it takes
to be a free electron.

309
00:15:58 --> 00:16:02
When we graph that on our chart
here, it becomes clear that

310
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
yes, in fact, the ionization
energy is just the negative of

311
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
the binding energy, so we can
just look over here and

312
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
figure out what our
ionization energy is.

313
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
So when we're talking about the
ground state of a hydrogen

314
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
atom, our ionization energy is
just the negative of the

315
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
Rydberg constant, so
that easy, it's 2 .

316
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
1 8 times 10 to the
negative 18 joules.

317
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
So, that should make a lot of
sense intuitively, because it

318
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
makes sense that if we need to
ionize an atom, we need to put

319
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
energy into the atom in order
to eject that electron, and

320
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
that energy we need to put in
better be the difference

321
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
between where we are now and
where we have to be to

322
00:16:39 --> 00:16:44
be a free electron.
 

323
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
So in most cases when we talk
about ionization energy, if we

324
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
don't say anything specific to
the state we're talking about,

325
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
you should always assume that
we are, in fact, talking

326
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
about the ground state.
 

327
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
So, oftentimes you'll just be
asked about ionization energy.

328
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
If it doesn't say anything
else we do mean n equals 1.

329
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
But, in fact, we can also talk
about the ionization energy

330
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
of different states of the
hydrogen atom or of any atom.

331
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
So, for example, we could talk
about the n equals 2 state, so

332
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
that's this state here, and
it's also what we could call

333
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
the first excited state.
 

334
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
So we have the ground state,
and if we excite an electron

335
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
into the next closest state,
we're at the first excited

336
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
state, or the n equals 2 state.
 

337
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
So, we can now calculate the
ionization energy here. it's an

338
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
easy calculation -- we're just
taking the negative of the

339
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
binding energy, again that
makes sense, because it's this

340
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
difference in energy here.
 

341
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
So what we get is that the
binding energy, when it's

342
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
negative, the ionization
energy is 5 .

343
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
4 5 times 10 to the
negative 19 joules.

344
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
So we should be able to think
about these binding energies

345
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
and figure out the ionization
energy for any state

346
00:17:51 --> 00:17:52
that were asked about.
 

347
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
So if we can switch over to
a clicker question here

348
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
and we'll let you do that.
 

349
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
And what we're asking you to
do is now tell us what the

350
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
ionization energy is of a
hydrogen atom that is in

351
00:18:05 --> 00:18:21
its third excited state.
 

352
00:18:21 --> 00:18:21
All right.
 

353
00:18:21 --> 00:18:36
Let's take 10 more
seconds on that.

354
00:18:36 --> 00:18:36
OK.
 

355
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
Interesting.
 

356
00:18:37 --> 00:18:40
Usually the majority is
correct, but actually what you

357
00:18:40 --> 00:18:43
did was illustrate a point that
I really wanted to stress and

358
00:18:43 --> 00:18:46
there's no better way to stress
it then to get it incorrect,

359
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
especially when it doesn't
count, it doesn't hurt so bad.

360
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
So, if you want to switch back
over to the notes, we'll

361
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
explain why, in fact, the
correct answer is 4.

362
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
So the key word here is that
we asked you to identify

363
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
the third excited state.
 

364
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
So, what white is n equal to
for the third excited state?

365
00:19:06 --> 00:19:07
4 OK.
 

366
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
So that explains probably most
of the confusion here and you

367
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
just want to be careful when
you're reading the problems

368
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
that that's what you
read correctly.

369
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
I think everyone would now get
the clicker question correct.

370
00:19:18 --> 00:19:23
So, the third excited state, is
n equal to 4, because n equals

371
00:19:23 --> 00:19:26
2 is first excited, 3 is second
excited, 4 is third

372
00:19:26 --> 00:19:28
excited state.
 

373
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
So now we can just take the
negative of that binding

374
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
energy here, and I've just
rounded up here or 1 .

375
00:19:34 --> 00:19:37
4 times 10 to the
negative 19 joules.

376
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
So, I noticed that a few, a
very, very small proportion of

377
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
you, did type in selections
that were negative

378
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
ionization energies.
 

379
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
And I'll just say it right now
you can absolutely never have a

380
00:19:48 --> 00:19:50
negative ionization energy,
so that's good to

381
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
remember as well.
 

382
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
And intuitively, it should
make sense, right, because

383
00:19:54 --> 00:19:57
ionization energy is the amount
of energy you need to put in to

384
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
eject an electron from an atom.
 

385
00:20:00 --> 00:20:02
So you don't want to put in a
negative energy, that's not

386
00:20:02 --> 00:20:05
going to help you out, you need
to put in positive energy to

387
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
get an electron out
of the system.

388
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
So that's why you'll find
binding energies are always

389
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
negative, and ionization
energies are always going to be

390
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
positive, or you could look at
the equation and see it

391
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
from there as well.
 

392
00:20:17 --> 00:20:18
All right.
 

393
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
So, using the equation we'd
initially discussed, the

394
00:20:21 --> 00:20:26
negative r sub h over n
squared, we could figure out

395
00:20:26 --> 00:20:29
all of the different ionization
energies and binding energies

396
00:20:29 --> 00:20:32
for a hydrogen atom, and it
turns out if we change the

397
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36
equation only slightly to add a
negative z squared in there,

398
00:20:36 --> 00:20:40
so, negative z squared times
the Rydberg constant over n

399
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
squared, now let's us calculate
energy levels for absolutely

400
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
any atom as long as this one
important stipulation, it

401
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
only has 1 electron in it.
 

402
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
So basically we're dealing with
hydrogen atoms and then we're

403
00:20:52 --> 00:20:55
going to be dealing with ions.
 

404
00:20:55 --> 00:20:58
So, for example, a
helium plus 1 ion has 1

405
00:20:58 --> 00:21:01
electron at z equal 2.
 

406
00:21:01 --> 00:21:06
A lithium 2 plus ion has 1
electron, it has z equals 3, so

407
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
if we were to plug in, we would
just do z squared up

408
00:21:08 --> 00:21:11
here, or 3 squared.
 

409
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
Terbium 64 plus, another
1 electron atom.

410
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
What is z for that?
 

411
00:21:17 --> 00:21:17
Yup.
 

412
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
65.
 

413
00:21:19 --> 00:21:23
So again, terbium 64 plus, not
an ion we probably will run

414
00:21:23 --> 00:21:27
into, but if we did, we could,
in fact, calculate all of the

415
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
energy levels for it using
this equation here.

416
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
And the difference between the
equation, the reason that that

417
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
z squared comes in there is
because if you go back to your

418
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
notes from Wednesday, and you
look at the long written out

419
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
form of the Schrodinger
equation for a hydrogen atom,

420
00:21:43 --> 00:21:47
or any 1 electron atom, you see
the last term there is a

421
00:21:47 --> 00:21:50
coulomb potential energy
between the electron

422
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
and the nucleus.
 

423
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
So, of course, when we have a
charge on the nucleus equal to

424
00:21:55 --> 00:21:58
1, as we do in a hydrogen atom,
the z is equal to 1, so it

425
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
drops out there, but normally
we would have to include the

426
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
full charge on the nucleus,
which is equal to z or the

427
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
atomic number times
the electron.

428
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
So even if we strip an atom of
all of its electrons, we still

429
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
have that same amount of
positive charge in the nucleus.

430
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
So, this allows us to look at a
bunch of different atoms, of

431
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
course, limited to the fact
that it has to be a

432
00:22:20 --> 00:22:23
1 electron atom.
 

433
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
So, now that we can calculate
the binding energies, we can

434
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
think about is this, in fact,
what matches up with what's

435
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
been observed, or, in fact,
could we predict what we will

436
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
observe in different kinds of
situations now that we know how

437
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
to use the binding energy, and
hopefully we can and we will.

438
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
So one thing we could do is we
could look at the different

439
00:22:46 --> 00:22:50
wavelengths of light that are
emitted by hydrogen atoms that

440
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
are excited to a higher state.
 

441
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
So what we'll do in a
few minutes here is try

442
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
this with hydrogen.
 

443
00:22:56 --> 00:23:03
So we'll take h 2 and we'll run
-- or actually we'll have h 2

444
00:23:03 --> 00:23:05
filled in an evacuated
glass tube.

445
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
When we increase the potential
between the 2 electrodes that

446
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
we have in the tube -- we
actually split the h 2 into the

447
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
individual hydrogen atoms,
and not only do that, but

448
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
also excite the atoms.
 

449
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
So when you just run across an
atom in the street, you can

450
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
assume it's going to be in its
most stable ground state,

451
00:23:22 --> 00:23:25
that's where the electron would
be, but when we add energy to

452
00:23:25 --> 00:23:28
the system, we can actually
excite it up into all different

453
00:23:28 --> 00:23:32
sorts of higher states -- n
equals 6, n equals 10, any

454
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
of those higher states.
 

455
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
But that only happens
momentarily, because, of

456
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
course, if you have an energy
in a higher energy level, it's

457
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
going to want to drop back
down to that lower or

458
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
more stable level.
 

459
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
And when it does that it's
going to give off some energy

460
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
equal to the difference
between those two levels.

461
00:23:48 --> 00:23:52
And that will be associated
with a wavelength if it

462
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
releases the energy in
terms of a photon.

463
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
So that's what we'll look
at in a few minutes.

464
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
There's some important things
to point out about what

465
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
is happening here.
 

466
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
Just to visualize exactly what
we're saying, what we're saying

467
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
is when we have an energy in a
higher energy level, so let's

468
00:24:07 --> 00:24:11
say energy level, this initial
level high up here, and it

469
00:24:11 --> 00:24:15
drops down to a lower final
level, what we find is that the

470
00:24:15 --> 00:24:19
photon that is going to be
emitted is going to be emitted

471
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
with the exact energy, and the
important term here

472
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
is the exact.
 

473
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
That is the difference between
these two energy states.

474
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
That makes sense because we're
losing energy, we're going to a

475
00:24:32 --> 00:24:34
level lower level, so we can
give off that extra in

476
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
the form of light.
 

477
00:24:36 --> 00:24:38
And we can actually write the
equation for what we would

478
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
expect the energy for
the light to be.

479
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
So this delta energy here is
very simply the energy of

480
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
the initial state minus the
energy of the final state.

481
00:24:49 --> 00:24:52
This is a little bit generic,
we're not actually specifying

482
00:24:52 --> 00:24:55
the states here, but we could,
we know we can calculate the

483
00:24:55 --> 00:24:57
energy from any of the states.
 

484
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
So, for example, let's say we
excited the hydrogen atom such

485
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
that the electron was starting
in the n equals 6 state,

486
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
so that's our n initial.
 

487
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
And we drop down to the n
equals 2 state, or the

488
00:25:09 --> 00:25:11
first excited state.
 

489
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
Then we would be able to change
our equation to make it a

490
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
little bit more specific and
say that delta energy here is

491
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
equal to energy of n equals
6, minus the energy of

492
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
the n equals 2 state.
 

493
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
When we talk about that
frequency of light that's going

494
00:25:28 --> 00:25:31
to be emitted, it's not too
commonly that we'll actually

495
00:25:31 --> 00:25:32
talk about it in
terms of energy.

496
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
A lot of times we talk about
light in terms of its frequency

497
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
or it's wavelength, but that's
OK, because we know how to

498
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
convert from energy to
frequency, so we can do that

499
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
here as well, where our
frequency is just our energy

500
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
divided by Planck's constant,
and since here we're talking

501
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
about a delta energy, we're
going to talk about the

502
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
frequency as being equal
to delta energy over h.

503
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
Or we can say the frequency is
going to be equal to the energy

504
00:26:00 --> 00:26:05
initial minus the energy final
all over Planck's constant.

505
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
So this means that we can go
directly from the energy

506
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
between two levels to the
frequency of the photon

507
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
that's emitted when you
go between those levels.

508
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
What we can also do is say
something about the wavelength

509
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
as well because we know the
relationship between energy

510
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
and frequency and wavelength.
 

511
00:26:22 --> 00:26:25
So, in the first case here,
let's say we go from a high

512
00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
level to a low level, let's
say we go from five to one.

513
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
If we have a large energy
difference here, are we

514
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
going to have a high
or low frequency?

515
00:26:36 --> 00:26:36
Good.
 

516
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
A high frequency.
 

517
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
If we have a high frequency,
what about the wavelength,

518
00:26:40 --> 00:26:43
long or short?
 

519
00:26:43 --> 00:26:43
All right.
 

520
00:26:43 --> 00:26:44
Good.
 

521
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
So we should always be
able to keep these

522
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
relationships in mind.
 

523
00:26:47 --> 00:26:50
So, similarly in a case where
instead we have a small energy

524
00:26:50 --> 00:26:54
difference, we're going to have
a low frequency, which means

525
00:26:54 --> 00:27:01
that we're going to have
a long wavelength here.

526
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
So now we can go ahead
and try observing some

527
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
of this ourselves.
 

528
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
So what we're actually going to
do is this experiment that I

529
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
explained here where we're
going to excite hydrogen atoms

530
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
such that they're electrons go
into these higher energy

531
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
levels, and then we're going to
see if we can actually see

532
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
individual wavelengths that
come out of that that

533
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
correspond with the
energy difference.

534
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
So, our detection devices are a
little bit limited here today,

535
00:27:30 --> 00:27:34
we're actually only going to be
using our eyes, so that means

536
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
that we need to stick with
the visible range of the

537
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
electromagnetic spectrum.
 

538
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
Actually that simplifies
things, because that really

539
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
cuts down on the number of
wavelengths that we're going

540
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
to be trying to observe here.
 

541
00:27:44 --> 00:27:47
So it turns out that in the
visible range, when you figure

542
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
out the differences between
energy levels, in hydrogen

543
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
atoms, there's only 4
wavelengths that fall in the

544
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
visible range of the spectrum.
 

545
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
So hopefully, when we turn out
the lights, we're going to turn

546
00:27:58 --> 00:28:03
on this lamp here, which has
hydrogen in it and we're going

547
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
to excite that hydrogen.
 

548
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
You'll see light coming out,
but it's, of course, going to

549
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
be bulk light -- you're not
going to be able to tell the

550
00:28:11 --> 00:28:12
individual wavelengths.
 

551
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
So what our TAs, actually if
they can come down now, are

552
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
going to pass out to you is
these either defraction

553
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
goggles, or just a little
plate, and you're going to be

554
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
splitting that light into its
individual wavelengths.

555
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
And the glasses, there aren't
enough to go around for all of

556
00:28:30 --> 00:28:32
you, so that's why
there's plates.

557
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
And though glasses do look way
cooler, the plates work a

558
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
little better, so either you or
your neighbor should try to

559
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
have one of the plates in
case one of you can't

560
00:28:39 --> 00:28:40
see all the lines.
 

561
00:28:40 --> 00:28:49
So our TAs will pass
these around for us.

562
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
And I also want to point out,
it's guaranteed pretty much

563
00:28:53 --> 00:28:56
you'll be able to see these
three here in the visible range

564
00:28:56 --> 00:28:59
-- you may or may not be able
to see, sometimes it's hard to

565
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
see that one that's getting
near the UV end of our

566
00:29:03 --> 00:29:04
visible spectrum.
 

567
00:29:04 --> 00:29:14
So we won't worry if
we can't see that.

568
00:29:14 --> 00:29:24
I'll take one actually.
 

569
00:29:24 --> 00:29:53
Can you raise your hand if
you if you still need one?

570
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
All right, so TA's walk
carefully now, I'm going to

571
00:29:56 --> 00:29:58
shut the lights down here.
 

572
00:29:58 --> 00:30:10
All right, so we do still have
some little bits of ambient

573
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
light, so you might see a
slight amount of the

574
00:30:12 --> 00:30:14
full continuum.
 

575
00:30:14 --> 00:30:17
But if you look through your
plate, and actually especially

576
00:30:17 --> 00:30:20
if you kind of look off to the
side, hopefully you'll be

577
00:30:20 --> 00:30:25
able to see the individual
lines of the spectrum.

578
00:30:25 --> 00:30:27
Is everyone seeing that?
 

579
00:30:27 --> 00:30:28
Yeah, pretty much.
 

580
00:30:28 --> 00:30:29
OK.
 

581
00:30:29 --> 00:30:30
Can anyone not see it?
 

582
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
Does anyone need -- actually
I can't even tell if

583
00:30:32 --> 00:30:33
you raise your hand.
 

584
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
So ask your neighbor if you
can't see it and get one of the

585
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
plates if you're having trouble
seeing with the glasses.

586
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
So this should match up with
the spectrum that we saw.

587
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
And actually keep those
glasses with you.

588
00:30:46 --> 00:30:49
We'll turn the light back
on for a second here.

589
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53
And hydrogen atom is what we're
learning about, so that's

590
00:30:53 --> 00:30:54
the most relevant here.
 

591
00:30:54 --> 00:30:58
But just to show you that each
atom does have its own set of

592
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
spectral lines, just for fun
we'll look at neon also so you

593
00:31:02 --> 00:31:17
can have a comparison point.
 

594
00:31:17 --> 00:31:17
All right.
 

595
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
So, this is probably a familiar
color having seen many neon

596
00:31:20 --> 00:31:28
lights around everywhere.
 

597
00:31:28 --> 00:31:31
So you see with the neon is
there's just a lot more lines

598
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
in that orange part of the
spectrum then compared to the

599
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
hydrogen, and that's really
what gives you that neon

600
00:31:39 --> 00:31:41
color in the neon signs.
 

601
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
That's the true color of a neon
being excited, sometimes neon

602
00:31:45 --> 00:31:49
signs are painted with
other compounds.

603
00:31:49 --> 00:31:50
All right, does everyone
have their fill of

604
00:31:50 --> 00:31:51
seeing the neon lines?
 

605
00:31:51 --> 00:31:53
STUDENT: No.
 

606
00:31:53 --> 00:31:56
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
take two more seconds

607
00:31:56 --> 00:32:01
to look at neon then.
 

608
00:32:01 --> 00:32:02
All right.
 

609
00:32:02 --> 00:32:08
So our special effects portion
of the class is over.

610
00:32:08 --> 00:32:10
And what you see when we see it
with our eye, which is all the

611
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
wavelengths, of course, mixed
together, is whichever those

612
00:32:13 --> 00:32:15
wavelengths is most intense.
 

613
00:32:15 --> 00:32:18
So, when we looked at the
individual neon lines, it was

614
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
the orange colors that was most
intense, which is why we were

615
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
seeing kind of a general orange
glow with the neon, which is

616
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
different from what we
see with the hydrogen.

617
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
All right, so we can, in fact,
observe individual lines.

618
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
There's nothing more exciting
to see with your glasses

619
00:32:37 --> 00:32:38
on, while you look nice.
 

620
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42
You can take those off if you
wish to, or you can try to just

621
00:32:42 --> 00:32:46
be splitting the light in the
room until the TAs grab your

622
00:32:46 --> 00:32:48
glasses, either is fine.
 

623
00:32:48 --> 00:32:51
It turns out that we are far
from the first people, although

624
00:32:51 --> 00:32:53
it felt exciting, we did
not discover this for the

625
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
first time here today.
 

626
00:32:56 --> 00:32:57
In fact, J.J.
 

627
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
Balmer, who was a school
teacher in the 1800s, was the

628
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
first to describe these lines
that could be seen

629
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
from hydrogen.
 

630
00:33:07 --> 00:33:11
And he saw the same lines that
we saw here today, and although

631
00:33:11 --> 00:33:16
he could not explain, even
start to explain why you saw

632
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
only these specific lines and
not a whole continuum

633
00:33:19 --> 00:33:20
of the light.
 

634
00:33:20 --> 00:33:22
Right, we already have an idea
because we just talked about

635
00:33:22 --> 00:33:24
energy levels, we know there's
only certain allowed energy

636
00:33:24 --> 00:33:27
levels, but at the time
there's no reason J.J.

637
00:33:27 --> 00:33:30
Balmer should have known this,
and in fact he didn't, but he

638
00:33:30 --> 00:33:33
still came up with a
quantitative way to describe

639
00:33:33 --> 00:33:34
what was going on.
 

640
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
He came up with this equation
here where what he found was

641
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
that he could explain the
wavelengths of these different

642
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
lines by multiplying 1 over 4
minus 1 over some integer

643
00:33:47 --> 00:33:51
n, and multiplying it
by this number, 3 .

644
00:33:51 --> 00:33:55
29 times 10 to the 15 Hertz,
and he found that this was

645
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
true where n was some integer
value -- 3, 4, 5, or 6.

646
00:34:00 --> 00:34:11
So he could explain it
quantitatively in terms of

647
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
putting an equation with it,
but he couldn't explain what

648
00:34:14 --> 00:34:15
was actually going on.
 

649
00:34:15 --> 00:34:19
But we, having learned about
energy levels, having had the

650
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
Schrodinger equation solved for
us to understand what's going

651
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
on, can, in fact, explain
what happened when we saw

652
00:34:26 --> 00:34:28
these different colors.
 

653
00:34:28 --> 00:34:31
So, what we know is happening
is that were having transitions

654
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
from some excited states to a
more relaxed lower, more stable

655
00:34:37 --> 00:34:39
state in the hydrogen atom.
 

656
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
And it turns out what we can
detect visibly with our eyes is

657
00:34:43 --> 00:34:46
in the visible range, and that
means that the final

658
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
state is n equals 2.
 

659
00:34:49 --> 00:34:52
Because you see how n equals 1
is so much further away, and

660
00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
actually that's not to scale,
it's actually much, much

661
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
further down in the energy
well, such that the energy of

662
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
the light is so great that it's
going to be in ultraviolet very

663
00:35:02 --> 00:35:04
high energy, high
frequency range.

664
00:35:04 --> 00:35:07
So we can't actually see
any of that, it's too high

665
00:35:07 --> 00:35:08
energy for us to see.
 

666
00:35:08 --> 00:35:11
So everything we see is going
to be where we have the final

667
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
energy state being n equals 2.
 

668
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
So if we think about, for
example, this red line here,

669
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
which energy state or which
principle quantum number

670
00:35:23 --> 00:35:30
do you think that our
electron started in?

671
00:35:30 --> 00:35:30
STUDENT: Three.
 

672
00:35:30 --> 00:35:31
PROFESSOR: Good.
 

673
00:35:31 --> 00:35:33
So, it's going to be in 3,
because that's the shortest

674
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37
energy difference we can have,
and the red is the longest

675
00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
wavelength we can see -- those
2 are inversely related,

676
00:35:40 --> 00:35:42
so it must be n equals 3.
 

677
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
What about the kind of
cyan-ish, blue-green one?

678
00:35:47 --> 00:35:50
Yup. so n equals
4 for that one.

679
00:35:50 --> 00:35:53
Similarly we can go on,
match up the others.

680
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
So n equals 5 for the
bluish-purple and the

681
00:35:56 --> 00:35:58
violet is n equals 6.
 

682
00:35:58 --> 00:36:01
And again, that matches up,
because the violet, or getting

683
00:36:01 --> 00:36:06
really close to the UV range
here has the longest energy, so

684
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
the highest frequency, and
that's going to be the shortest

685
00:36:09 --> 00:36:11
wavelength and we can see here
it is, in fact, the shortest

686
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
wavelength that we
can actually see.

687
00:36:15 --> 00:36:18
So, we can see if we can
come up with the same

688
00:36:18 --> 00:36:19
equation that J.J.
 

689
00:36:19 --> 00:36:24
Balmer came up with by actually
starting with what we know and

690
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
working our way that way
instead of coming up from the

691
00:36:26 --> 00:36:29
other direction, which he
did, which was just to

692
00:36:29 --> 00:36:31
explain what he saw.
 

693
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
So, if we start instead with
talking about the energy

694
00:36:33 --> 00:36:36
levels, we can relate these to
frequency, because we already

695
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
said that frequency is related
to, or it's equal to the

696
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
initial energy level here minus
the final energy level there

697
00:36:44 --> 00:36:47
over Planck's constant
to get us to frequency.

698
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
And we also have the equation
that comes out of Schrodinger

699
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
equation that tell us exactly
what that binding energy is,

700
00:36:55 --> 00:36:57
that binding energy is just
equal to the negative of the

701
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
Rydberg constant
over n squared.

702
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
So that means that our
frequency is going to equal, if

703
00:37:05 --> 00:37:10
we plug in e n into the initial
and final energy here, 1 over

704
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
Planck's constant times
negative r h over n initial

705
00:37:14 --> 00:37:19
squared, minus negative r
h over n final squared.

706
00:37:19 --> 00:37:22
So we have an equation that
should relate how we can

707
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
actually calculate the
frequency to what J.J.

708
00:37:27 --> 00:37:29
Balmer observed.
 

709
00:37:29 --> 00:37:32
We can simplify this equation
by pulling up the r h and

710
00:37:32 --> 00:37:35
getting rid of some of these
negatives here by saying the

711
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
frequency is going to be equal
to the Rydberg constant divided

712
00:37:38 --> 00:37:44
by Planck's constant all times
1 over n final squared -- this

713
00:37:44 --> 00:37:46
is just to switch the signs
around and get rid of some

714
00:37:46 --> 00:37:53
negatives -- minus 1
over n initial squared.

715
00:37:53 --> 00:37:56
We can plug this in further
when we're talking about the

716
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
visible part of the light
spectrum, because we know that

717
00:38:00 --> 00:38:04
for n final equals 2, then that
would mean we plug in 2 squared

718
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
here, so what we
get is 1 over 4.

719
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
So this is our final equation,
and this is actually called the

720
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
Balmer series, which was named
after Balmer, and this tells us

721
00:38:13 --> 00:38:18
the frequency of any of the
lights where we start with an

722
00:38:18 --> 00:38:21
electron in some higher energy
level and we drop down to an

723
00:38:21 --> 00:38:23
n final that's equal to 2.
 

724
00:38:23 --> 00:38:25
So it's a more specific version
of the equation where we

725
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
have the n final equal to 2.
 

726
00:38:28 --> 00:38:31
And it turns out that actually
we find that this matches up

727
00:38:31 --> 00:38:36
perfectly with Balmer's
equation, because the value of

728
00:38:36 --> 00:38:39
r h, the Rydberg constant
divided by the Planck's

729
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
constant is actually -- it's
also another constant, so we

730
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
can write it as this kind of
strange looking cursive r here.

731
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
Unfortunately, this is also
call the Rydberg constant, so

732
00:38:49 --> 00:38:50
it's a little bit confusing.
 

733
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
But really it means the Rydberg
constant divided by h,

734
00:38:55 --> 00:38:57
and that's equal to 3 .
 

735
00:38:57 --> 00:38:59
29 times 10 to the
15 per second.

736
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
So if you remember what the
equation Balmer found was this

737
00:39:04 --> 00:39:06
number multiplied by this here.
 

738
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
So, we found the exact same
equation, but just now starting

739
00:39:10 --> 00:39:12
from understanding the
difference between

740
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
energy levels.
 

741
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
So, sometimes you'll find the
Rydberg constant in different

742
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
forms, but just make sure you
pay attention to units because

743
00:39:21 --> 00:39:23
then you won't mess them up,
because this is in inverse

744
00:39:23 --> 00:39:26
seconds here, the other Rydberg
constant is in joules, so

745
00:39:26 --> 00:39:29
you'll be able to use what you
need depending on how you're

746
00:39:29 --> 00:39:33
using that constant.
 

747
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
So in talking about the
hydrogen atom, they actually

748
00:39:37 --> 00:39:42
have different names for
different series, which means

749
00:39:42 --> 00:39:46
in terms of different n
values that we end in.

750
00:39:46 --> 00:39:48
So we talked about what we
could see with visible light,

751
00:39:48 --> 00:39:51
we said that's actually
the Balmer series.

752
00:39:51 --> 00:39:54
So anything that goes from a
higher energy level to 2 is

753
00:39:54 --> 00:39:57
going to be falling within the
Balmer series, which is in the

754
00:39:57 --> 00:40:00
visible range of the spectrum.
 

755
00:40:00 --> 00:40:03
We can think about the
Lyman series, which

756
00:40:03 --> 00:40:05
is where n equals 1.
 

757
00:40:05 --> 00:40:08
We know that that's going to be
a higher energy difference, so

758
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
that means that we're going
to be in the UV range.

759
00:40:12 --> 00:40:15
We can also go in the
opposite direction.

760
00:40:15 --> 00:40:18
So, for example, when n equals
3, that's called the Paschen

761
00:40:18 --> 00:40:21
series, and these are named
after basically the people that

762
00:40:21 --> 00:40:24
first discovered these
different lines and

763
00:40:24 --> 00:40:27
characterized them, and this is
in the near IR range.

764
00:40:27 --> 00:40:31
And again, the n equals 4
is the Brackett series,

765
00:40:31 --> 00:40:33
and that's an IR range.
 

766
00:40:33 --> 00:40:36
I think there's names for
even a few more levels up.

767
00:40:36 --> 00:40:39
You don't need to know those,
but just because it's a special

768
00:40:39 --> 00:40:42
case with the hydrogen atom,
they do tend to be named -- the

769
00:40:42 --> 00:40:45
most important, of course,
tends to be the Balmer series

770
00:40:45 --> 00:40:47
because that's what we can
actually see being emitted

771
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
from the hydrogen atom.
 

772
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
So, now we should be able to
relate what we know about

773
00:40:55 --> 00:41:00
different frequencies and
different wavelengths, so Darcy

774
00:41:00 --> 00:41:06
can you switch us over to
a clicker question here?

775
00:41:06 --> 00:41:09
And we can also talk about the
difference between what's

776
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
happening when we have
emission, and we're going to

777
00:41:13 --> 00:41:14
switch over to absorption.
 

778
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
So, we just talked about
emission, so before we head

779
00:41:17 --> 00:41:20
into absorption, if you can
answer this clicker question in

780
00:41:20 --> 00:41:23
terms of what do you think
absorption means having just

781
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
discussed hydrogen
emission here?

782
00:41:27 --> 00:41:31
So we have four choices in
terms of initial and final

783
00:41:31 --> 00:41:33
energy levels, and also what it
means in terms of the electron

784
00:41:33 --> 00:41:36
-- whether it's gaining
energy or whether it's going

785
00:41:36 --> 00:41:39
to be emitting energy?
 

786
00:41:39 --> 00:41:42
So, why do you take 10
seconds on that, we'll

787
00:41:42 --> 00:41:54
make it a quick one.
 

788
00:41:54 --> 00:41:55
All right, great.
 

789
00:41:55 --> 00:41:58
So already just from knowing
the emission part, we can

790
00:41:58 --> 00:42:00
figure out what absorption
probably means.

791
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
Absorption is just the opposite
of emission, so instead of

792
00:42:04 --> 00:42:10
starting at a high energy level
and dropping down, when we

793
00:42:10 --> 00:42:14
absorb light we start low and
we absorb energy to bring

794
00:42:14 --> 00:42:17
ourselves up to an n
final that's higher.

795
00:42:17 --> 00:42:21
And instead of having the
electron giving off energy as

796
00:42:21 --> 00:42:23
a photon, instead now the
electron is going to take in

797
00:42:23 --> 00:42:29
energy from light and move
up to that higher level.

798
00:42:29 --> 00:42:31
So now we're going to be
talking briefly about

799
00:42:31 --> 00:42:33
photon absorption here.
 

800
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
So again, this is just stating
the same thing, and it could

801
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
take in a long wavelength
light, which would give it just

802
00:42:41 --> 00:42:44
a little bit of energy, maybe
just enough to head up one

803
00:42:44 --> 00:42:48
energy level or two, or we
could take in a high energy

804
00:42:48 --> 00:42:51
photon, and that means that the
electron is going to get

805
00:42:51 --> 00:42:56
to move up to an even
higher energy level.

806
00:42:56 --> 00:43:00
And again, we can talk about
the same relationship here, so

807
00:43:00 --> 00:43:02
it's a very similar equation to
the Rydberg equation that we

808
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
saw earlier, except now what
you see is the n initial and

809
00:43:06 --> 00:43:08
the n final are swapped places.
 

810
00:43:08 --> 00:43:12
So instead now we have r h over
Planck's constant times 1 over

811
00:43:12 --> 00:43:17
n initial squared minus
n final squared.

812
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
And what you want to keep in
mind is that whatever you're

813
00:43:20 --> 00:43:23
dealing with, whether it's
absorption or emission, the

814
00:43:23 --> 00:43:25
frequency of the light is
always going to be a positive

815
00:43:25 --> 00:43:27
number, so you always want to
make sure what's inside these

816
00:43:27 --> 00:43:29
brackets here turns
out to be positive.

817
00:43:29 --> 00:43:32
So that's just a little bit of
a check for yourself, and it

818
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
should make sense because
what you're doing is you're

819
00:43:36 --> 00:43:39
calculating the difference
between energy levels, so you

820
00:43:39 --> 00:43:42
just need to flip around which
you put first to end up with a

821
00:43:42 --> 00:43:44
positive number here, and
that's a little bit of a check

822
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
that you can do what yourself.
 

823
00:43:48 --> 00:43:51
So let's do a sample
calculation now using this

824
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
Rydberg formula, and we'll
switch back to emission, and

825
00:43:55 --> 00:43:57
the reason that we'll do that
is because it would be nice to

826
00:43:57 --> 00:44:01
actually approve what we just
saw here and calculate the

827
00:44:01 --> 00:44:04
frequency of one of our lines
in the wavelength of one

828
00:44:04 --> 00:44:05
of the lines we saw.
 

829
00:44:05 --> 00:44:09
So what we'll do is this
problem here, which is let's

830
00:44:09 --> 00:44:11
calculate out what the
wavelength of radiation would

831
00:44:11 --> 00:44:17
be emitted from a hydrogen atom
if we start at the n equals 3

832
00:44:17 --> 00:44:22
level and we go down to
the n equals 2 level.

833
00:44:22 --> 00:44:29
So what we need to do here is
use the Rydberg formula, and

834
00:44:29 --> 00:44:32
actually you'll be given the
Rydberg formulas in both forms,

835
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
both or absorption and emission
on the exams. if you don't want

836
00:44:38 --> 00:44:41
to use that, you can also
derive it as we did every time,

837
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
it should intuitively make
sense how we got there.

838
00:44:44 --> 00:44:47
But the exams are pretty short,
so we don't want you doing that

839
00:44:47 --> 00:44:49
every time, so we'll save the 2
minutes and give you the

840
00:44:49 --> 00:44:52
equations directly, but
it's still important to

841
00:44:52 --> 00:44:53
know how to use them.
 

842
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
So, we can get from these
energy differences to frequency

843
00:44:57 --> 00:45:04
by frequency is equal to r sub
h over Planck's constant times

844
00:45:04 --> 00:45:12
1 over n final squared minus
1 over n initial squared.

845
00:45:12 --> 00:45:16
So let's actually just simplify
this to the other version of

846
00:45:16 --> 00:45:19
the Rydberg constant, since
we can use that here.

847
00:45:19 --> 00:45:24
So kind of that strange cursive
r, and our n final is 2, so

848
00:45:24 --> 00:45:30
1 over 2 squared minus n
initial, so 1 over 3 squared.

849
00:45:30 --> 00:45:33
So, our frequency of light
is going to be equal

850
00:45:33 --> 00:45:40
to r times 5 over 36.
 

851
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
But when we were actually
looking at our different

852
00:45:43 --> 00:45:46
wavelengths, what we associate
mostly with color is the wave

853
00:45:46 --> 00:45:49
length of the light and not the
frequency of the light,

854
00:45:49 --> 00:45:52
so let's look at
wavelength instead.

855
00:45:52 --> 00:45:57
We know that wavelength
is equal to c over nu.

856
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
We can plug in what we have for
nu, so we have 36 c divided by

857
00:46:03 --> 00:46:10
5, and that cursivey Rydberg
constant, and that gives us 36

858
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
times the speed of light, 2 .
 

859
00:46:12 --> 00:46:23
998 times 10 the 8 meters per
second, all over 5 times 3 .

860
00:46:23 --> 00:46:31
29 times 10 to the
15 per second.

861
00:46:31 --> 00:46:34
So, what we end up getting when
we do this calculation is

862
00:46:34 --> 00:46:39
the wavelength of light,
which is equal to 6 .

863
00:46:39 --> 00:46:44
57 times 10 to the negative
7 meters, or if we convert

864
00:46:44 --> 00:46:49
that to nanometers, we
have 657 nanometers.

865
00:46:49 --> 00:46:52
So does anyone remember
what range of light 657

866
00:46:52 --> 00:46:55
nanometers falls in?
 

867
00:46:55 --> 00:46:56
What color?
 

868
00:46:56 --> 00:46:57
STUDENT: Red.
 

869
00:46:57 --> 00:46:59
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
in the red range.

870
00:46:59 --> 00:47:00
So that's promising.
 

871
00:47:00 --> 00:47:05
We did, in fact, see red in our
spectrum, and it turns out that

872
00:47:05 --> 00:47:08
that's exactly the wavelength
that we see is that we're

873
00:47:08 --> 00:47:10
at 657 nanometers.
 

874
00:47:10 --> 00:47:15
So it turns out that we can, in
fact, use the energy levels to

875
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
predict, and we could if we
wanted to do them for all of

876
00:47:18 --> 00:47:20
the different wavelengths of
light that we observed, and

877
00:47:20 --> 00:47:22
also all the different
wavelengths of light that can

878
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
be detected, even if we
can't observe them.

879
00:47:26 --> 00:47:29
All right, so that's what we're
going to cover in terms of the

880
00:47:29 --> 00:47:32
energy portion of the
Schrodinger equation.

881
00:47:32 --> 00:47:36
I mentioned that we can also
solve for psi here, which is

882
00:47:36 --> 00:47:40
the wave function, and we're
running a little short on time,

883
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
so we'll start on Monday with
solving for the wave function.
