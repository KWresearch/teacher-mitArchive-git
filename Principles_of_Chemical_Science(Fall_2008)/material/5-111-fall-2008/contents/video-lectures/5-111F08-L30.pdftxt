PROFESSOR: OK, everyone, pay attention to the clicker question. If you haven't 
responded, now's a good time to click in your response. All right, let's just take 10 
more seconds. OK, we can do better than this. 

So, tetrahedral complexes. Do you recall tetrahedral complexes with angles of what 
between the ligands? 109 . 5. The ligands' negative point charges aren't facing any 
of the d orbitals perfectly. They're a little bit closer to the orbitals that are 45 
degrees off-axis, so those three are the most repelled. But they're not really directly 
hitting any of them. So that's in contrast with the octahedral system or square 
planar where the ligands negative point charges are headed directly toward some of 
the d orbitals. So because the ligands in a tetrahedral case are not headed directly 
toward any of the d orbitals, there is not a huge amount of crystal fields splitting, so 
that's small. 

And so, when the splitting is small, then you tend to have high spin systems. So you 
put in all of the electrons singly to the fullest extent of the orbital as possible before 
you pair. And so, since you put them in singly for the fullest extent possible before 
you pair them up, that will lead to a high spin system, which is the maximum 
number of unpaired electrons. 

So today is then the last lecture on transition metals, and we've been talking about 
crystal field theory, and today we're going to talk about colors and crystal field 
theory. So, colors, there are a lot of beautiful colors in nature, and some of the 
beautiful colors you find in nature have to do with transition metals or other liganded 
states. So, we're going to start with an example of how colors can change, how a 
molecule's color can depend on its oxidation state, how a molecule's color can 
depend on its liganded state. So, Dr. Taylor is going to be doing this for you --
should we do it the demo and then look at the questions or do the questions first? 
Demo first? 

PROFESSOR: OK. 

PROFESSOR: So, here are some of the reactions up on the Powerpoint that you're 
going to be looking at, and as the reaction proceeds, there's going to be changes in 
oxidation state, and also changes in ligand in state, and that will lead to changes in 
color. 

[DEMONSTRATION] 

PROFESSOR: So, how would you describe that first color? Any predictions? Have any 
of you seen this before, what's going to happen next? 

[DEMONSTRATION] 

PROFESSOR: So this is called an oscillating clock reaction, so as it runs through, it 
cycles between the different colors. So, that should happily keep going, and we can 
consider what's happening. So here's the overall reaction here and it can be divided 
into two components. So, why don't you tell me, what is happening to iodide in that 
first reaction, and there it is again. All right, so let's take 10 more seconds. Very 
good. 

So, if you looked up here, you see that you have minus 2 for the oxygen, three of 
them, minus 6, and it needs to equal minus 1, so you have plus 5. And then over 
here, we again have plus 1 minus 2, and so that has to be plus 1. So that was 
actually a quiz question, but you score three points if you answered, even if you got 
it wrong, but we could have had that four points, most people got that right anyway. 
But if you answered, you get an extra few points on that one. 

All right, so very good. That's what's happening to iodide. Now you notice that in this 
reaction h o i is being produced, and then in the second step it's being consumed. 
This later reaction can be divided, then, into two additional reactions. And one of the 
reactions, you can tell me again what is happening, what is being oxidized and what 
is being reduced in this part of the reaction. OK, let's take 10 more seconds. 
Excellent. Even a little higher than before. All right, so you figured out that this was 
the plus 1, this is minus 1, and they're both going to 0. So you have oxidation and 
reduction going on all involving iodide in that reaction. 

OK, so as the reaction was proceeding, you could see that it started out with clear 
and then it went to sort of amber color, and that was the i 2, the clear was i minus, 
and the sort of darker blue color that you saw is the complex with starch in the 
reaction. So that both of these guys have colors independent, but then when they're 
liganded to something else, the color is different. And that's very true with 
coordination complexes that the metal by itself will be strongly influenced by what 
the ligands are. And depending on what type of ligands it has, it can have a really 
entirely different color than it had before. 

So, today we're going to talk about why that's true, and how you can predict colors 
based on what type of ligand is bound to a transition metal. 

So, a lot of transition metals have really beautiful colors, and my laboratory studies 
metals bound to proteins, and often the proteins will have really beautiful colors 
because of the metal cofactor involved, and that's one of the things that I liked about 
that particular area of study is just how beautiful these proteins can be. So, the color 
given off depends on the nature of the metal, and depends on the nature of the 
ligand. And so we can use crystal field theory, which again, is a very simplified 
theory, to try to predict or explain the observed colors. And so again, this is not 
always very precise, but given, if you're told information out of color, you can 
rationalize why that would be true, and you can also predict at least a range of color 
that you would have under certain circumstances. 

So, let's take a look at this more. So the ligands again, have the ability to split those 
d orbitals. And when we're talking about for metals, it's all about the d orbitals. And 

we talked already about strong field ligands and weak field ligands, and we're going 
to talk more about that today, but this time in terms of color. So a strong field 
ligand, as we discussed, creates a big splitting in the d orbital energy, whereas weak 
field ligand, like the first question you had today with tetrahedral complexes, there's 
usually a weak field there, so we have a small energy separation between the d 
orbitals. 

So here is something that you actually have to memorize -- there's not much 
memorization in this course, but you do need to memorize these six ligands in terms 
of their ability to split d orbitals. So, on the side, we have three that are strong field 
ligands, cyanide, c o, and ammonia, and so those are going to be strong field, so 
they're going to have big splitting energy, and so they'll tend to be low spin. Then we 
have three that are sort of in between that are intermediate field -- water, hydroxide 
and f minus. 

And so, in comparing, those are intermediate, so you're going to be asked questions 
such as how does that compare to a weak field, how does that compare to a strong 
field. And then our weak field ligands or a lot of our halides down here, i minus, b r 
minus, c l minus. And so those are weak field ligands, so you'll have a small splitting, 
so they'll tend to be in high spin complexes. 

So let's take a look at some examples. So we talked about iron before in complexes, 
and now we can consider two cases where we have iron plus 3, so the same metal in 
the same oxidation state, but it has different ligands. It So in one case you have a 
high spin system with six water ligands, and then the other in a low spin system with 
six cyanide ligands. So first, before you do anything else with this, you always have 
to think about what the d count is. So, to do the d count, we're going to look at 
where iron is in the periodic table, and we're going to see it's in group 8. And then, 
we'll have 8 minus 3, the oxidation number is d 5 system. 

So now we have two diagrams here, one has a big splitting, one has a small splitting, 
and why don't you fill in for me in a clicker question, what the high spin system 
would look like. OK, let's just take 10 more seconds. Very good. I think that's one of 
our highest numbers in a while. 

That's right, so we're going to fill to the fullest extent possible before we pair any of 
the electrons. So again, here we put in electrons down here, and then go up here, 
because the splitting is small, so it doesn't take that much energy to put an electron 
in the upper orbitals, it takes more energy to pair the electrons for this weak field 
system. And so, this is a high spin case, we have a maximum number of unpaired 
electrons. 

So, over here when we have a much bigger splitting energy, it's going to take a lot 
more energy to put electrons up there, and so we're going to fill up all of these 
orbitals down here until we have to put an electron up there. So, if we do that, put in 
the three, and now we're going to pair, because it takes less energy to pair than it 
does to put an electron up there, so we do four and five. And so then here is our 
system where we have a strong field, and so here's a weak field and it's going to be 
high spin, maximum number of unpaired electrons, here we have the strong field 
and it'll be low spin, the minimum number of unpaired electrons. And we're doing 
this, again, because we know that cyanide is a strong field ligand, whereas water is 
an intermediate field ligand, it's a lot weaker than cyanide. 

OK, now we can continue doing some of the things that we've done before. So just to 
review this material, we can write the d n electron configurations. What are the 
orbitals called that are down here? Yup, t 2 g. And how many electrons do we have 
there? three. And then the e g system up here with two electrons. And over here 
what do we have? Yup, t 2 g to the 5. So, a review, electron configurations, these 
are just shorthand notations, which tell people what these diagrams look like. 

Then, we also talked about this before. So, what does this term stand for? Crystal 
field stabilization energy, right. So now why don't you tell me what it is for the high 
spin system. OK, let's just take 10 more seconds. Yup, zero. So if we look at that, we 
have three electrons down here, so that's minus 2/5, two electrons up here, which is 
plus 3/5, so 3 times minus 2/5 is minus 6/5, plus 6/5 gives you 0. So here is a case 
where you really don't have much stabilization. It would be equivalent then, so 
there's zero stabilization because you have three electrons down and two up. 

All right, so what about the low spin system now? So if we can look at that, what are 
we going to have for this system? So, we have 5 times minus 2/5 or minus 10/5, 
and we also have two pairing energy terms there, which we can write in, because 
there are two sets that are paired. 

So this is mostly review on what we've had before, and we haven't talked about 
some of these things in a little while, so we go over it again, and now we're going to 
take it a next step and think about what sort of wavelength would be absorbed if 
you're going to promote some of these electrons to unfilled orbitals. So what about 
the light absorbed by these octahedral coordination complexes? So, if you remember 
back to the beginning of the course, a physics course or high school, a substance 
absorbs photons of light if the energy of the photons match the energy required to 
excite those electrons to a higher energy level. And so now we are doing some 
review from the first part of the course, which is always good. 

As I mentioned, everything kind of comes together and we need to go over 
everything for the final, but there's also connections between all the different parts 
of the semester. So this should look familiar to you. So, the energy of the absorbed 
light equals Planck's constant times the frequency of that light. But now we can 
make that equal to another term, a term we've been talking about in this unit, and 
that is our octahedral crystal field splitting energy. Because the energy that's going 
to be required to bump an electron from here to here is that energy, that splitting 
energy. So that's going to be equal to this term here. 

OK, so what does this mean in terms of the wavelengths of lights absorbed by 
different coordination complexes. So we can think about that. So if you have high 
frequency of light is absorbed, the wavelength of the absorbed light is going to be 
short. And we know that relationship -- again, think back to the beginning of the 
course and also probably to physics and to high school, we know a very handy 
equation for telling us about the relationship of frequency and wavelength of light, so 
we have the speed of light equals the wavelength times the frequency. So if you 
have a high frequency of light absorbed, the absorbed wavelength is going to be 
short. 

So, let's look at a couple of examples, the example here, going back to our example. 
So we had this high spin system with water, and now I'm telling you that the 
splitting energy is 171 kilojoules per mole, and when you have cyanide as your 
ligand, your splitting energy is 392 kilojoules per mole. Again, this was a stronger 

field ligand, so we have a bigger splitting energy. And this was an intermediate field 
ligand, certainly weaker than cyanide, so this has a smaller splitting energy. 

So, from these values now, we can calculate the wavelength of absorbed light. So for 
the high spin system first, we can rearrange these equations, which you know well, 
to come up with the rearranged equation, the wavelength equals Planck's constant 
times the speed of light, and divided by e, and this time our e is that crystal field 
splitting energy. So we can put in these terms. So we have Planck's constant times 
the speed of light over our octahedral field splitting energy, oh, but then we have 
some other terms here. Now one thing that you have to pay attention to in this unit 
is your units. So, splitting energies are often given in kilojoules per mole, whereas 
you often see Planck's constant in joules, so we want to make sure that we convert 
one or the other, and here it's set up to convert the kilojoules to joules. And also, we 
want our final unit, we're talking about wavelengths, in meters or nanometers, so we 
need to get rid of this mole term, and we use Avagadro's number to do that. 

So now we should be able to cancel our units and get the correct units. So we should 
be able to cancel the seconds over here, and we should also be able to go in and 
cancel our moles. We should be able to cancel the joules and the kilojoules out, and 
that should leave us just with this over here, which is meters. So this is 7 . times 10 
to the minus 7 meters. Does that make sense in terms of a wavelength of light? 
Because that would convert to what nanometers? 700 nanometers. So if you do 
something strange and you forget Avagadro's number, you're going to come up with 
a very interesting wavelength. So that's a good way to check to make sure that 
you've done the problem correctly. So, 700 nanometers, anyone remember what 
light that is, what color that corresponds to? Red, so it's absorbing red light. 

All right, so now let's just do the same thing for the low spin system with the cyanide 
ligand, and we're going to plug in our 392 here, and we get 305 over here. And so, 
that is a much shorter wavelength of light. So again, light absorbed for the 
compound with water, 700 nanometers, and the compound of iron with cyanide, 305, 
and so we're absorbing a red light over with the water compound, and sort of purple 
or violet light is being absorbed in the cyanide complex. And we're talk in a minute 
about the light that is being transmitted, which is complementary to the color of the 
light absorbed. So by knowing something about splitting energies, by knowing 
something about the types of ligands, then you can know something about colors. 

So now, for another example, we're going to look at the different colors of two 
chromium complexes. So first, what is the oxidation number of chromium in the 
water complex here? What is it? And what about over here with n h 3 ligands. Plus 3. 
So, plus 3 and plus 3. And what is our d count? You know where chromium is, in 
what group? Six. 6 minus 3 is 3, so we have a d 3 system. What does c n mean 
again? Coordination number, so what is that for both of these? Six. So there's Six 
things coordinated to the chromium, and so we have, again, an octahedral system. 
And what type of ligand is water? Intermediate. And what about n h 3? Strong. So 
this is strong, and water is and intermediate ligand, and certainly, it is weaker than n 
h 3. So, we expect one system over here for a strong ligand, and then something 
that's weaker than that strong ligand. 

All right, so here are two diagrams, one with a big splitting energy, and one with a 
smaller splitting energy. Are the diagrams going to look same or different? The 
same. Because we only have three electrons, so they're going to be the same. In 
both cases, we put in the three electrons in the lowest orbitals, and then there's no 

decision to be made, because there isn't that fourth electron, so we don't have to 
decide which place to put this. 

So these diagrams are going to look the same, and before when we were doing this 
in this unit, we said OK, we're done, they look the same. But now, we realize that 
these are really not the same compounds and that they're going to have different 
properties, even though their diagrams are going to look the same. Because the 
energy that it's going to take to excite an electron here is much smaller than over 
here, and that's going to result in a different wavelength of light being absorbed in 
these two different cases, which will mean a different wavelength of light being 
transmitted. So, again, here we have a weaker field and here we have a stronger 
field. 

So again, we can go through and think about these two cases. So when we have a 
smaller term here, that means a lower energy -- this is a splitting energy, and so 
we'll have a lower frequency. When we have a larger case or higher energy, we have 
a higher frequency. Again, if you have a lower frequency absorbed, we have a longer 
wavelength absorbed, and in this case, the higher frequency translates into a shorter 
wavelength absorbed. 

The color of the transmitted light is complementary to the color of the absorbed 
light. So now we can think about -- I always want to ask, when do people learn 
about complementary colors? Is that 6th grade, earlier? I don't really remember, but 
I think it's pretty early on. And people always ask me, are you going to have that on 
the equation sheet, or do I have to actually remember my complementary colors? 
And I tell people that I will put some version of this on, so you don't have to review 
your kindergarten notes for this class, if that's when you learned it. It's pretty early, 
I don't know when it is exactly. 

So, the color of the light is going to be complementary about -- this is very 
approximate. So here, if the transmitted light is shorter because we have this 
weaker splitting, then we are expecting we're going to have this shorter wavelength, 
the transmitted light, and experimentally, if you make this compound you'll see it's 
violet. In this other case, we have a stronger field ligand, and so you have a larger 
energy, higher frequency absorbed, shorter wavelength absorbed, then you're going 
to have a longer wavelength from your transmitted light. And that this compound, if 
you make it, is actually yellow. 

So if we go back to our colors for a minute, you see that when you have the shorter 
wavelength, we have a violet, and that is a short wavelength. And in this case for the 
strong field ligand, we are going to have transmitted light of a longer wavelength 
and it's yellow. So it's the same oxidation state of chromium, it's the same -- it's an 
octahedral complex, six ligands in both cases, same octahedral crystal field 
diagrams, but yet one compound has a violet color, and the other one has a yellow 
color. 

All right, so one can also be asked to calculate a crystal field splitting energy in 
kilojoules per mole, given the appropriate information. So we've looked at when a 
splitting energy is given, and we've been asked to calculate wavelength absorbed, 
you can also be asked to go in the other direction. And so here we have another 
chromium complex to work with. And we're told that the wavelength of the most 
intensely absorbed light is 740, and so what would you predict the color of this to 
be? It would be greenish. So that would be what you would predict. Again, chemistry 

is an experimental science, but based on having a complementary color to the one 
absorbed, that would be a guess. 

All right, so we can actually calculate the frequency of the light absorbed. So we 
were given the wavelength, and use speed of light, and plug in your wavelength and 
you can come up with a frequency, 4.05 times 10 to the 14 per second. Then we can 
calculate from that the crystal field splitting energy, and so we use Planck's constant, 
and we have our frequency, and we calculate 2 . 6 8 times 10 to the minus 19 
joules. Am I done with the problem? What does the problem ask for? It asks for it in 
kilojoules per mole, and so, we're not done, we need to convert to kilojoules per 
mole. And I'm making this point, because often this is where people lose points on 
the final exam, and that's not where you want to lose points. You want to lose them 
on a really hard problem, not on something like this. 

So, most of the time you're asked for kilojoules per mole, so make sure that if that's 
what asked for, that's what you provide. So here, we can just do the conversion of 
units, and then we're going to use Avagadro's number to give us that per mole. And 
so, this translates into a 160 kilojoules per mole, which you might recognize is more 
similar to the other numbers that you saw for octahedral crystal field splitting 
energy. 

All right. Sadly, there are some coordination complexes that do not have colors. Why 
would that be? Why would something not have a color? It has d orbitals, it's a 
transition metal. So what would be true about all of the d orbitals? Yeah, so one 
example, is if they're all full, and that is the most common thing that we see, so it's 
not possible to have a d to d transition in the visible range. 

So there are a number of examples of metals who have this situation. Zinc and 
cadmium are two of the most common that give you problems in biological systems. 
So why is this? Well, that's because they're over here in group twelve. But their most 
common oxidation states are plus 2. So, if you have 12 minus 2 you have a d 10 
system, and that's the case for both of these systems here. And so all the d orbitals 
are filled. 

Now, zinc is a really important metal in biological systems, and because it has all 
these d orbitals filled, it doesn't have a color. And so it's very hard to tell if an 
enzyme molecule has zinc. And I think one of the problems that you have on this 
problem-set talks about how zinc is important in a biological system by altering the p 
k a of a residue that coordinates to it. And that's often its job, and so biochemists 
are often faced with the problem of trying to figure out if their protein has zinc, but 
they have no color of the protein, also they might try to look for a paramagnetic or 
diamagnetic system. They're not -- you know if they see a paramagnetic system, 
they say oh, unpaired electrons, we know we must have metal involved, but there's 
no sort of spectroscopic probe for zinc. 

And so, often someone will determine a crystal structure, and it'll be a huge surprise 
that there's zinc associated with this protein. Do you think there's a lot of proteins 
that use cadmium as of part of their mechanism? What do you know about 
cadmium? Yeah, cadmium is poisonous. Old barbecue grills were sometimes, they 
used to coat things with cadmium on a barbecue grill. Yeah, that was not very smart. 
So, cadmium poisoning is a problem, and people have been trying to figure out the 
mechanism of that, but again, it's hard to study cadmium because it has no 
spectroscopic signal. 

All right, so getting back now to just kind of review over what we've talked about in 
terms of colors. So we have our weak field ligands, again, you need to memorize 
what they are. You have your intermediate field ligands, which you need to 
memorize, and also your strong field ligands. So these weak field ligands are going 
to have a small splitting energy, and that means that in terms of how the complex 
absorbs, low energy, low frequency, long wavelength, and that the color transmitted 
will be complementary. And usually what this means is that it'll be sort of in the end 
of the spectra, so it's often hard to say well, red will definitely be green. So it's not a 
perfect agreement, but you can usually say well, it's probably going to be in the 
blue-violet or green end. So in sort of one part of the spectra. 

Strong field ligands, again, have a huge splitting energy. So you're going to have big 
energy, high frequency, short wavelength, and so it's going to transmit, then, in the 
complementary, so it should be in the yellow, orange or red end. And you will be 
asked in some of the problems, in again, problem-set 9 due Wednesday, and you 
should be able to finish that up pretty quickly tonight after this lecture, and there are 
some problems on this. 

So, for cobalt complexes, you get pretty much the entire range of colors. So I'm just 
going to end with one more biological example. And here are some pictures of actual 
colors, and so this is cobalt coordinated to vitamin B12. So one ligand gives you this 
brilliant red color, another gives you an orange color, and a third ligand gives you a 
pink color. So you can tell the oxidation state of vitamin B12 by the colors of the 
molecule. 

All right. Now you have all the information to finish your problem-set, and that's the 
end of transition metals. On Wednesday we start kinetics.
