PROFESSOR: OK. Let's get started. Can you go ahead and take 10 more seconds on 
this first clicker question here? OK. So it looks like most of you got that the electron 
configuration that we're writing here is for copper. So I'm actually going to give the 
benefit of the doubt that the people that didn't get it right were rushing to get out 
their clickers and didn't have time to think it all the way through. Remember that 
when we're talking about 4 s 1, 3 d 10, that's one of those exceptions where a 
completely filled d orbital is more stable than we would expect. So, that's actually 
the electron configuration we have when we're talking about copper and some other 
exceptions in the periodic table that you're going to be looking at. 

So, hopefully, if you were to go back and look you could see that this is, in fact, 
copper. We're actually going to do one more clicker question to get started with 
today, and as we do, I'll explain something we're going to be trying today, which is a 
little bit of a friendly competition in terms of answering the clicker questions 
correctly. So we've tagged each of your numbers to your actual recitation, so we can 
see today which recitation actually is going to be doing the best in terms of clicker 
questions, who's going to get the most correct today. 

So, you may or may not know this about your TAs, but this is a pretty competitive 
group of TAs we have this year, and they like to brag about how smart their 
recitation is, how good questions they're getting in the recitation section. So, do your 
TA proud today and see if you can be part of the recitation that gets the most correct 
in terms of a percentage. And at the end of class we'll announce which recitation that 
is, we'll also make sure to give you a little bit of a prize if you are, in fact, in that 
recitation. So we have extra incentive to get these clicker questions right. 

So, in this one we're selecting the correct electronic configuration for an ion. So, why 
don't you go ahead and take 10 more seconds on this second clicker question for our 
intro. 

OK. So, it looks like we have a little bit of a mixed consensus here. Let's go over this 
question. And I know there's a lot to talk about about this competition, but let's just 
get into listening mode here and talk about how we can figure out what the correct 
electron configuration is for this ion. Remember, ions are a little bit different. The 
first thing we need to do is write the electron configuration for the atom itself, and 
then we need to take an electron away. So here we're talking about v plus 1, so if we 
were to write it just for the neutral electron itself, we would find that the electron 
configuration is argon, that's the filled shell in front of it. Then 4 s 2 and 3 d 3. So 
this would be for the actual filled, the completely neutral atom. 

But remember what we said, which was when we talked about, this is at the end of 
class on Friday, we said that it turns out that even though 3 d is higher in energy 
when it's not filled, once we fill it with an electron, these 2 orbitals actually switch 
place in terms of energy. So if we were to write this in terms of energy, we would 
actually have to rewrite it has 3 d 3, and then 4 s 2. So, which orbital would we take 
an electron out of if we were ionizing this atom here? The s. So, we would actually 
take an electron out of the s, which gives us 3 d 3 and then 4 s 1. 

So, it's a little bit of a trick when you're dealing with ions. The best suggestion is just 
to write it out completely for the neutral atom, and then you want to take an 
electron out of the highest orbital. It makes sense that it's going to come out of the 
highest occupied atomic orbital, because that's going to be the lowest amount of 
energy that's required to actually eject an electron. 

All right. So let's go to today's notes. And actually before we start into today's topics, 
I want to remind everyone and hopefully you all do remember that our first exam is 
coming up and it's coming up in exactly a week, so it'll be a week from today, next 
Wednesday. And on Friday in class, at the beginning of class, I'll go over just in all 
the detail you could possibly imagine everything you need to know logistically for the 
exam -- where it is, what you do, what kind of calculators you can bring, which by 
the way are any calculator. So you'll get all of that information on Friday. So don't 
worry if you have some questions right now. I just want to let you know that. 

The other thing I want to let you know is that instead of having a new problem-set 
that you'll be assigned this Friday, what we'll do instead is we'll give you some 
practice problems, and these will be just more of the same type of problems that you 
saw before but that's another chance to try them out more. These won't be graded, 
you don't have to turn them in, it's just to give you some extra practice if you want 
while you're studying for the exam. 

We'll also post an exam from a previous year so you can actually see exactly what 
the format's going to look like. So when you go into the exam a week from today, 
it'll all look really familiar, you'll be comfortable with the format and you can just 
dive right in and start answering the questions. So you'll have all that information 
and we'll get it to you on Friday. 

The other quick thing I want to say is that I do have office hours today from 3 to 5, 
so feel free to stop by if you have questions about problem-set 3 that you're finishing 
up. And also, for those of you that did sign up for the pizza forum tonight, that's 
going to be at 5 o'clock, it's in room 56-502, so we'll see some of you tonight for that 
as well. 

All right. So, let's move on to what we're talking about today. What we're going to 
start with is discussing photoelectron spectroscopy, which is a spectroscopy 
technique that will give us some information about energy levels in multielectron 
atoms. We'll then take a turn to talking about the periodic table, we'll look at a 
bunch of periodic trends, including ionization energy, electron affinity, 
electronegativity and atomic radius. And then, if we have time at the end, we'll 
introduce one last topic, which is isoelectronic atoms and ions. 

I also want to note that the end of the material today, so this last topic here, that's 
the end of the material that's going to be on this first exam. So whether we finish it 
today, or more likely when we finish it up on Friday, once we get passed 

isoelectronic atoms, that's it, that's all you need to study for this first exam. So from 
that point on it'll be exam 2 material, so depending on how you like to come 
compartmentalize your information, you can separate that in your brain in terms of 
what you're trying to learn right now versus what you can put off until a little bit 
later. 

So, let's start with talking about photoelectron spectroscopy. This actually relates 
very closely to what we discussed in class on Friday before the long weekend, and 
what we were talking about is the energy levels of multielectron atoms. So what we'll 
start with today is talking about the technique that's primarily used to actually 
experimentally figure out what these different energy levels are. And this is called 
photoelectron spectroscopy, and essentially what it is is very similar conceptually to 
what we were talking about way back in the first couple lectures when we were 
talking about the photoelectric effect. 

Because here what we have is some atom that we're studying, in the case, it's going 
to be a gas, and we hit it with a photon that has some incident energy. So e sub i, 
some energy that the photon comes in with, and if it has sufficient energy to eject an 
electron, it will do that, and our electron will be ejected with a certain kinetic energy, 
which is going to be whatever energy is left over from the initial energy we put in 
minus what was taken up in order to actually ionize or eject the electron. 

So, you can see how this can directly give us different ionization energies for any 
atom that we're interested in studying. For example, with neon we can think about 
all of the different orbital energies we could be looking at. In the first case, so here is 
the electron configuration of neon. So we can think about what is our most loosely-
bound electron, what's that highest energy orbital, and it's going to be the 2 p 
orbital, that's going to be what's highest in energy. So if we're going to eject an 
electron using a minimum amount of energy, that's where it's going to come from. 
So, you can imagine, that we'll actually probably have a lot of kinetic energy left 
over if we put a lot of energy in in the first place. We're only using up a little bit to 
eject the electron, then we'll have a lot left over. 

So, one difference between photoelectron spectroscopy and, for example, the 
photoelectric effect is that in this case, we're not just looking at one energy level, 
which is what we were looking at from the surface of a metal, now we're talking 
about this gaseous atom. So we can actually pop an electron or eject an electron 
from any single orbital that is occupied within the atom. So, for example, it's not just 
the 2 p that we could actually take an electron from, we could also think about 
ejecting an electron from the 2 s orbital. Now this, of course, is going to take more 
energy because a 2 s is lower, it has has a more negative binding energy than the 2 
p, but that's OK as long as we put in enough energy, but what we're going to find is 
the kinetic energy coming out with the electron is actually going to be a little bit less, 
right, because we had to use up more energy to eject the electron, so we don't have 
as much left over. 

There's actually one more orbital that we could talk about if we're talking about this 
sample case of neon, which is a 1 s orbital, and if we're talking about a 1 s orbital, 
now we're going to be even lower in energy still, so that means the minimum energy 
required to eject an electron is going to be at its highest, so that means the energy 
that we have left over that turns into kinetic energy for the electron, is now going to 
be really quite small. 

And what happens when you irradiate one of these atoms that you're studying with 
this light is in photoelectron spectroscopy, you want to make sure that you put in 
enough energy to actually ionize any single electron that you have in the atom. So 
the way that we really make sure this is done is that we use x-rays. So you know 
that x-rays are higher frequency than UV light, for example, that means it's also 
higher energy than UV light, and if you think back to our photoelectric effect 
experiments, do you remember what type of light we were usually using for those? 
Does anyone remember? 

Yeah. It was UV light that we used. Well, we can't guarantee with UV light we'll have 
enough energy to eject every single electron, so that's why when we use x-rays, 
they're higher energy, you can pretty much be guaranteed we're going to eject all of 
those electrons there. 

So I said that this technique was used to experimentally determine what the 
different binding energies or the different ionization energies are for the different 
states in a multielectron atom. Another way to say states is to talk about different 
orbitals. So we can do this directly as long as we have certain types of information. 

The first that we need to know the energy of the photon that's incident on our 
gaseous atom. The second piece of information we need to know is what actually the 
kinetic energy is of the ejected electron, and that's something we can just measure 
by measuring its velocity. 

So we can use an equation to relate the incident energy and the kinetic energy to 
the ionization energy, or the energy that's required to eject an electron. This should 
all sound incredibly familiar, like I'm just repeating myself in terms of photoelectric 
effect, because essentially that's what I'm doing, and that's one reason we spent so 
much time and did so many problem-set problems on the photoelectric effect. 

So what we're saying here is the incident energy, so the energy coming in, is just 
equal to the minimum energy that's required to a eject an electron. When we talked 
about the photoelectric effect, that was called the work function. In this case, it's 
called the ionization energy, plus whatever kinetic energy we have left over in the 
electron. So if we want to solve for ionization energy, we can just rearrange this 
equation. Our ionization energy is going to be equal to the incident energy coming 
in, minus the kinetic energy of the electron. 

So, let's take a look at the different kinetic energies that would be observed in a 
spectrum for neon where we had this incident energy here. And it turns out that the 
first kinetic energy that we would see or the highest kinetic energy, would be 12 32 
electron volts. So if that's the case doing a quick little calculation, what would the 
ionization energy be for a 2 p electron in neon? 

Yup, 22. So, basically all we did was take 12 54, subtract 12 32, and we got 22 
electron volts. 

We can do the same thing for the other observed kinetic energy. So, for example, in 
the second case, we say that we see 12 06 in terms of the kinetic energy. Same sort 
of subtraction problem, what do we have for the ionization energy of the 2 s 
electron? 

Good, quick math. All right, so 48 electron volts. And let's look at the final kinetic 
energy that we'd observe in this spectrum, which is 384 electron volts, so what is 
that third corresponding ionization energy? 

I couldn't quite hear, but I have a feeling everyone said 870 electron volts. 

So, we can actually kind of visualize what we would see if we were looking at a 
photoelectron spectrum. And what we would see if we were graphing, for example, 
increasing kinetic energy, is we would see 1 line corresponding to each of these 
energies of electrons that we see coming out. And, of course, each of those electrons 
correspond to an electron coming out of a particular orbital. So in the case of 12 32, 
that is our highest kinetic energy, that means it's our lowest ionization energy -- it's 
the smallest amount of energy it takes to pop an electron out of that orbital. So 
that's why we see the 2 p here, the 2 s is 12 06, and it makes sense that what we 
see as the greatest ionization energy, which is also the smallest kinetic energy is 
that 1 s orbital. Remember, because that 1 s orbital is all the way down in terms of if 
we're thinking about an energy diagram, we're all the way down here, so we have a 
huge amount of energy we have to put into the system in order to eject an electron. 

So what I want to point out when you're kind of looking at these numbers here, what 
the significance is, look at that huge difference between what the ionization energies 
are for what we call those valence electrons, those outer shell electrons, versus the 
ionization energy for the 1 s orbital -- those are core electrons there. 

So we can think about something I mentioned last time, which is when we're 
thinking about chemistry and what's really interesting in terms of chemical reactions, 
it's mostly valence electrons we're talking about, those are the ones that tend to be 
involved in chemical reactions. It makes a lot of sense when we look at it 
energetically, because if we think about a 1 s core electron, that's going to be held 
really, really tightly to the nucleus. We see that we have to put this huge energy in 
to actually get a 1 s electron ejected, so it makes a lot of sense that we wouldn't 
want to pay that energy cost in a normal chemical reaction. And we don't -- we very 
rarely would see these core electrons actually being involved in any type of a 
reaction. 

All right, so one thing that I want to point out, which I said many, many times on 
Friday, and this is perhaps the last time I'll say it, but one last time is we can think 
about why we only see a line for the 2 p orbital, versus we don't see separate lines 
for a 2 p x, a 2 p y, and a 2 p z. Remember, we need those three quantum numbers 
to completely describe the orbital. Why do we just see one for all the p's? And the 
reason is that the energy of the orbitals, depend on two quantum numbers, and 
that's quantum number n, and quantum number l. M does not actually have an 
effect, in this case, on the energy of the orbital. So that's why we're not seeing 
separate lines in this spectrum. 

All right. So let's go ahead and try an example here in thinking about photoelectron 
spectroscopy. So, let's say we're looking at an element and we have an emission 
spectra, and we know that it has five distinct different kinetic energies in that 
spectrum. We might be asked, for example, to determine what all of the different 
elements could be that would produce a spectrum that gave us 5 different lines. 

So the first thing that we want to do, if we're thinking about something like this, is 
just to determine exactly what orbitals are causing the five different lines that we're 

seeing in the spectrum. So, if we're talking about five different orbitals and we're 
talking about a ground state atom, we know that we just need to start at the bottom 
and work our way out up. So, our first orbital that an electron must be coming from 
is the 1 s. What comes after that? 2 s. All right, then what? 2 p. After that? 3 s. 
Next? 3 p, and that's 1, 2, 3, 4 -- that gives us five different options, five different 
orbitals, five different energies right there. So, then all we need to do to determine 
which elements that corresponds to is take a look at our periodic table. So we want 
to look at any element that has a 3 p orbital filled, but that does not then go on and 
have a 4 s, because if it had the 4 s filled then we would actually see six lines in the 
spectrum. 

So that is relevant for all of these atoms here, so we actually have several different 
possibilities. It could be aluminum, silicone, phosphorous, sulfur, chlorine or argon. 
Any one of these different elements could actually produce a photoelectron 
spectroscopy spectrum that has five distinct lines. If I went on and told you what the 
different incident light was, and what the electrons were ejected with, and then you 
could look up the ionization energy for the particular different elements, you should 
be able to actually determine exactly which element it is, but just with the 
information given, we can only narrow it down to these choices here. 

So let's actually let you try another example of solving a problem that has to do with 
one of the spectrums. So, let's turn to another clicker question here. Remember, 
your answer holds great weight in terms of the state of the TA bragging for next 
week. So, how many distinct, so again, we're talking about distinct kinetic energies, 
would be displayed if you're talking about a spectrum for the element hafnium, and 
I'll tell you here that it has a z of 72, so you don't have to spend two minutes 
searching your periodic table. The period of table's on the back page of your notes if 
you don't see that there. 

All right. It looks like a lot of you are done, so let's take 10 more seconds here. Part 
of the challenge is speed, too, how quickly you can get these answers in terms of 
getting them in on time. So let's see what we say. All right. So I think I can safely 
say that most people had the right idea and were counting quickly, though I have a 
feeling that some people who wrote 13 might have forgotten about those 4 f, the 4 f 
electrons. So, remember when you're looking at your periodic table, don't forget 
about the lanthinides, sometimes they come into play. 

So it's actually 14, and the way that we got that answer was we just wrote out or 
just looked at your period table, figured out all of the different orbitals that you could 
have in terms of the principle quantum number, and then the l quantum number, 
and then write them all down -- it turns out to be 14, so that's what the answer is. 

So, it looks like this is good, because we'll have some separation in terms of not 
everyone's going to get 100% in terms of recitations here, which is what we're going 
for. 

All right. So let's turn our attention to a new topic, which is thinking a little bit about 
the periodic table, and also talking about periodic trends. And there's a lot we can 
explain by talking about what we see in the periodic table in terms of what different 
trends are in grouping different elements in different spots within the periodic table. 

So, here we have a picture of Dmitri Mendeleev, who is one of the scientists 
responsible for first compiling the periodic table. You'll notice I have what's a very 

flattering picture of him up here, and if you haven't done the reading yet you might 
not think this is particularly flattering, but if you look at the picture of him in the 
book, you'll notice I chose a very flattering picture of Dmitri up here, and here he's 
pondering putting these elements together in a periodic table. And he actually did 
this in the late 1800's, back before even all of the elements that we know today were 
discovered, really only about 60% or so, 70% were discovered then that we now 
know today. But still, he was able to put together a periodic table. 

And what he did what he actually grouped things in terms of their chemical 
properties. So the way that we like to think of things now is in terms of electron 
configurations, right, but at the time that wasn't really understood. So, instead, it 
was amazing he was able to group things in terms of the properties that he saw. So, 
for example, if he was talking about the group one metals, lithium, sodium, 
potassium -- he noticed these were all very soft reactive metals, those were grouped 
together. Versus looking at, for example, helium or neon or argon, these are all inert 
gases, inert meaning essentially do not react, those were grouped together in the 
periodic table. 

So basically, at the time he was just going on size and then traits, but what we 
actually know today is that we can also order things in the periodic table by electron 
configuration. In fact, that is the most logical way for us to look at it now. So, for 
example, if we're actually thinking about electron configuration and we look at 
lithium, sodium and potassium, these all have one valence electron. So basically, 
that means one electron in an s orbital in their outer-most most shell. So that 
explains why they're so reactive, they're all very willing to give up that 1 s orbital 
and then drop to a lower energy level. 

In contrast, helium, neon, and argon all have filled shells. That also explains why 
they're very stable. They're not going to want to add on another electron, because 
then it'll have to jump a very large energy level and start filling in another shell -- go 
from n equals 2, to n equals 3, and n equals 4, and so on. 

So it turns out that we can really know a lot just by looking at the periodic table. You 
will never in this class have to memorize anything about the periodic table. 
Depending on what kind of chemistry you go in to, you might accidentally memorize 
parts of the table, which is fine, but what you really want to know how to do is know 
how to use the periodic table. But you actually need to keep a few caveats in mind 
as you do this, which is the fact that trends predict a lot of chemical properties, but 
they can't predict everything in terms of biological properties. And after the periodic 
table was developed in the late 1800's, people didn't understand this quite as well, 
they took things a little more literally. They thought, for example, if you could do 
something with one element, if you looked at an element very close to it, it would be 
similar enough that you could maybe replace it with that. 

Today we know, for example, if you can put one certain kind of element in your 
mouth or eat that, it doesn't necessarily mean you want to put the element next to it 
and your mouth as well, that might not be safe. But this is things we've learned as 
the years have gone past. 

So, let's just take a quick example to show how not completely you can use these 
periodic trends, that there are limits. So if we consider lithium, potassium, and 
sodium, they're all together in the same group on the periodic table, knowing what 
we do about biology we can immediately think of sodium and potassium, or even just 

knowing what you know about table salt, for example, that these are two elements 
that we find, and particularly in the ion form in very high concentrations in our body. 
For example, sodium in our blood plasma is almost to the point sometimes of 100 
millimol or that's very, very concentrated. Similarly, we find it in table salt, we're 
taking it in all the time, the same with potassium, think of bananas, were always 
eating potassium. Not so with lithium. I don't think too many people and here are 
probably taking lithium. It turns out there's actually no natural function known in the 
body for lithium. So there's nothing naturally going on unless we were to introduce it 
ourselves in our body that we know of, at least, that involves lithium. 

But this did not stop people, for example, in the late 1800's, early 1900's, and, in 
fact, in 1927 a new soft drink was put on to the market and they wanted to make a 
lemon-lime soft drink, these were very popular in the early 1900's, and to get sort of 
that lemony flavor, they decided to use citric acid, so that's a good idea, that gives 
that soury taste. And they wanted to use a soluble salt of citric acid, so they could 
have used sodium, they could have used potassium. But, you know why not do 
something a little special, little different, and they decided instead to use lithium. So, 
here we have this soda with lithium citrate, some of you might be familiar with this, 
soda is called 7-Up. So, 7-Up no longer has lithium in it, but from 1927 to 1950 it 
did, and, in fact, not only did they not try to hide the fact that there's lithium in the 
soda, this they used as a really special marketing technique, they really pointed out 
this is something that stands out about our soda, this is something special. There's a 
lot of good things about lithium. I don't know if you can see, probably not, what's 
written on here, so let me point out to you a few things. 

Lithium, slenderizing, that's great to see in a soda. Other nice things about lithium in 
your soda, it dispells hangovers, takes the ouch out of grouch. That's very nice. So 
basically, you get a lot of benefit supposedly from this 7-Up soda from the 1920's or 
so. And this went on and was unregulated for some time, but at some point the Food 
and Drug Administration did take a step in, so here's a case where they did do 
something important -- that's not what I mean at all -- where they did take the step, 
they do many things that are important, often not quickly enough. Here's a --
actually here it did take 25 years, but they did, they did eventually step on before we 
started drinking 7-Up. And what they said was, look, you can't put this in, we're 
starting to notice it does some strange things. Because it was in the 1950's or so, 
maybe the late 1940's, that people started to discover lithium, even though it had no 
natural function, it did do something in our bodies. Does anyone know what was 
lithium's used for? 

Yeah, it's an anti-psychotic drug, so, for example, some people with bipolar disorder 
even today still take it, it works really well for some people, for other people it 
doesn't work so well. But anyway, this isn't really something you want to have in 
your soda, so they did take it out eventually. Another side effect if you take too 
much lithium is death, so that's no good to have in sodas either, and it might not 
have been as big a deal back in the 1920's, but you can imagine with supersizing 
today, this might be a bigger problem. 

So anyway, when we talk about periodic trends, it doesn't always match up. This was 
eventually taken out, and actually just for your interest, there was no overlap 
between the time when cocaine was in Coca Cola and lithium was in 7-Up, so there 
was a few years difference between those two times, but it's amazing to think about 
what does go into processed foods. 

And the other thing to point out, which I don't know if this is true or not, but does 
anyone know -- well that's part's true, does anyone know what the atomic mass of 
lithium is? Yes, it's 7. So, I don't know if this is true or not, but I wonder if that's 
where the actual name 7-Up came from. So, even though we don't have the lithium 
anymore, we still keep that atomic number 7 around. 

All right. So that is an anti-example of using periodic trends. So let's go to some 
actual real examples, which might come more in handy for this class. So it's going to 
keep in mind the limitations, so let's start off with talking about ionization energy. 

Now this is a good place to start, because we are very familiar with ionization 
energy, we've been talking about it in a lot of different forms for quite a while -- it's 
that minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom. And specifically, 
when we talk about ionization energy, it's assumed that what we mean is actually 
the first ionization energy. So, you can imagine, we could talk about any of the 
different electrons, or we could talk about taking out an electron and taking out 
second electron. Whenever you hear the term ionization energy, make sure you keep 
in mind that unless we say otherwise, we're talking about that first ionization energy. 
And we know what that's equal to, this is something we've been over and over, 
ionization energy is simply equal to the negative of the binding energy. So negative 
e, which is sub n l, because it's a function of n and l in terms of quantum numbers. 

So, let's think about kind of differentiating, however, between first ionization energy 
or just ionization energy, and other types such as second or third ionization energy, 
and let's take boron as an example here. 

So, if we want to think about what the first ionization energy is of boron, what you 
want to do is write out the electron configuration, because then you can think about 
where it is that the electron's coming out of. The electron's going to come out of that 
highest occupied atomic orbital, that one that's the highest in energy, because that's 
going to be the at least amount of energy it needs to eject something. So what we'll 
end up with is boron plus, 1 s 2, 2 s 2, and what we say is the delta energy or the 
change in energy as the same thing as saying the energy of the products minus the 
energy of our reactant here, and we just call that the ionization energy -- that's how 
much energy we have to put into the system to eject an electron. And again, this is 
just the negative, the binding energy, when we're talking about the 2 p orbital. 

So, this is first ionization energy, let's think about second ionization energy. So, 
second ionization energy simply means you've already taken one electron out, now 
how much energy does it take for you to take a second electron out. So in the case 
of boron here, what we're starting with is the ion, boron 1 s 2, 2 s 2, and now we're 
going to pull one more electron out. The highest occupied orbital is now the 2 s 
orbital, so we're going to end up with boron 2 plus 1 s 2, 2 s 1, plus the electron 
coming out of there. And what we say when we talk about the delta energy is that 
this is going to be equal to i e 2, or the second ionization energy, or we could say the 
negative of the binding energy of a 2 s electron in b plus. so it's important to note 
that it's not in b, now we're talking about b plus, because we've already taken an 
electron out here. 

So, similarly if we start talking about our third ionization energy, this is going to be 
going from b plus 2, to 1 s 2, 2 s 1. Now we're going to pull that second electron out 
of the 2 s, so we end up with boron plus 3, and then the configuration is just 1 s 2, 
plus our extra electron here. 

So, what we call this is the third ionization energy, or the negative of the binding 
energy, again of the 2 s orbital, but now it's in boron plus 2 to we're starting with. 

So, this raises kind of an interesting question in terms of what the difference is 
between these two cases, and we're talking about numbers of energy. So let's 
address this by considering another example, which should clarify what the 
difference is between these ionization energies. So let's think about the energy 
required now to remove a 2 s electron, let's say we're removing it from boron plus 1 
versus neutral boron. 

So, in the case of boron plus 1, what we are starting with is the ion, so we're starting 
with a 2 s electron, and then we're going to 2 s 1 here. And what we call the binding 
energy is negative 2 s in b plus -- this is what we saw on the last slide. And the 
second case here looks a lot more like what we saw when we were talking about 
photoelectron spectroscopy, because here we want to remove a 2 s electron, but it's 
actually not the highest occupied orbital, so that's not the one that would naturally 
come out first, but let's say we're hitting it with high energy light sufficient to knock 
out all the different electrons, and one that we end up knocking out is this 2 s here. 
So if we think about what that delta energy is, we call that the ionization of the 2 s, 
that's different from saying second ionization energy. And that's going to be equal to 
the negative the binding energy of 2 s in b, in neutral boron. 

So, my question to you is are these two energies equal? No. All right, good answer. 

So, we can think about why is it that these are not equal. In both cases we're taking 
an electron out of the 2 s orbital. And it turns out that if we're talking about a 2 s 
orbital in an ion, that means it doesn't have as many electrons in it, so what we're 
going to see is less sheilding. There are fewer electrons around to shield some of 
that nuclear charge. So what we're going to see is less sheilding, which means that it 
will actually feel a higher z effective. 

So even though they're both 2 s electrons, in one case it's going to think its feeling 
more pull from the nucleus, and it, in fact, will be, than in the other case, and if its 
feeling a higher z effective, then it's actually going to require more energy to remove 
that electron, right, it's being pulled in closer and more tightly to the nucleus, you 
have to put in more energy to rip it away from that very close interaction. 

So, that's the difference in thinking about different types of ionization energy, so it 
can get a little bit confusing with terminology if you're just looking at something 
quickly, so make sure you look really carefully about what we're discussing here. If 
you see a problem that asks you, for example, the third ionization energy versus 
taking a second electron out of the 2 s in a photoelectron spectroscopy experiment, 
those are two very different things. 

So, let's make sure everyone kind of has this down, let's do another clicker question 
here. And in this case we're going to look at silicone, and we'll say if you can point 
out to me which requires the least amount of energy. So, which has the smallest 
energy that you have to put in in order to eject this electron? Will it be if you take a 
3 s electron from neutral silicone, if you take a 3 p electron from the neutral atom, 
or if you take a 3 p from the ion? So this you should be able to know pretty quickly, 
so let's just take 10 seconds here. 

All right, great. So most of you see that, in fact, the energy that's going to be the 
least that we need to put in is in case 2 here. Let's compare case 2 and 3, since this 
where some people seem to have gotten confused. In case 2, we're taking it out of --
oh, it's kind of hard to compare case 2 and 3 when we can't see it anymore. In case 
2, we're taking the 3 p out of the neutral atom, whereas in case 3, we're taking it 
out of the ion. Remember in the ion, we're going to have less electrons around to 
counteract the pull from the nucleus. So we're going to feel a higher z effective in 
the case of the ion compared to the neutral atom. If we have a higher z effective, it's 
pulled in tighter, we have to put in more energy in order to eject an electron, so it 
turns out that that's why case 2 is actually the lowest energy that we need to put in. 
The z effective is lower, so we have to put less energy in to get an ion out. 

So, let's take a look at this in terms of periodic trends -- that's our topic here, we're 
talking about periodic trends. So as we go across the row, and this is my beautiful 
picture of a periodic table here. As we go across the row what happens is that the 
ionization energy actually increases, and we can think about logically why it is that 
that's happening. 

As we go across the row, what we have happening is that the z or the atomic charge 
-- I'm not talking about z effective here, I'm just talking about z -- the z is increasing 
as we go across a row, that's easy to see. But we're still in the same shell, so we still 
have the same n value as we go all the way across a row in the periodic table. So, in 
general what we're going to see is that what happens to z effective if we have z 
increasing but we're in the same shell here. Would it increase or decrease z 
effective? 

All right. Kind of mixed thoughts here. So it turns out that it increases, and the 
reason is because the predominant thing that's going on here is that z is increasing. 
So the z is increasing, and what goes along with it is that the z effective is 
increasing, because it turns out that while we're in the same n, even though we 
know that energy depends on both the n and the l in terms of quantum numbers, 
while we're in the same n, the distance from the nucleus, it's pretty close, it's not 
hugely different. So the factor that predominates is that we're actually increasing z. 
That's why we see z effective increase, and that's why we see ionization energy 
increase. 

As we go down a column, what happens is that the ionization energy decreases. We 
can also think about this in terms of z effective. This is because even though z, the 
atomic number is still increasing, we are also getting further away from the nucleus. 
So, remember when we talk about Coulomb force, what's holding the nucleus and 
the electron together, there's 2 things we need to think about. The first is this the z 
effective, or how much charge is actually in the nucleus that's felt, or the I guess we 
would say the z, how much the charge is on the nucleus that holds it close together. 
But the second factor is how far away we are from the nucleus. So, if we're really 
close to the nucleus, that's when z effective is high, but if we get really far away, 
then z effective is going to get low, because even though we have the same charge 
in the nucleus, the z effective gets lower. 

So this is not even thinking about the other electron shielding, just if we think of the 
fact, all we need to think about is that the effect of going to a further away n actually 
dominates as we go down the table. We're getting further away from the nucleus 
because we're jumping, for example, from the n equals 2 to the n equals 3 shell, or 
from the n equals 3 to the n equals 4 shell. And when you're switching n's, you're 

actually getting quite a bit farther away. That's why in the earlier models of the 
atom, they're not horrible to sometimes think about just each n value as a little ring 
around. It's not complete and it's not accurate, but it's OK to kind of think of it in 
terms of how far we're getting away from the nucleus. So, as we go down a column, 
we see ionization energy's going to decrease. 

So, this means we have the general trends down, so we should be able to look at 
actual atoms in our periodic table and graph them and see that they match up with 
our trends. So here we have that graphed here, we have atomic number z graphed 
against ionization energy, so, let's fill in what the actual atoms are here, and we can 
see in general, yes, we're following the trend. For row one, we're increasing, as we 
should, across the row. Let's look at row two also. Well, we're generally increasing 
here, we'll talk about that more in a minute. And also in a row three, yeah, we're 
generally increasing, there's some glitches here, but the general trend holds true. 

Similarly we see as we go down the table, so as we're going from one row to the 
next row, so, for example, between helium and lithium, we see a drop; the same 
with neon to sodium, we see a drop here. 

So it looks like we're generally following our trend, that's a good thing. But hopefully, 
you will not be satisfied to just make a general statement here when we do have 
these glitches. So you can see, for example, we have several places where instead of 
going up as we go across the row, we actually go down in ionization energy a little 
bit. So between b e, and b, between n and o, magesium and aluminum, and then 
phosphorous and sulfur, what we see here is that we're kind of going down, or quite 
specifically, we are going down. 

So, let's take a look at one of these rows in more detail to think about why this 
might be happening, and it turns out the reason that these glitches occur are 
because the sub shell structure predominates in certain instances, and that's where 
these glitches take place. So I've sort of just spread out what we have as the second 
row here, graphed against the ionization energy. So, let's consider specifically where 
these glitches are taking place. 

So, let's look at the first one between beryllium and boron here. And the glitch that 
doesn't make sense just through periodic trends, is that it turns out that the 
ionization energy of boron is actually less than the ionization energy up beryllium. So 
I put the electron configurations and actually drew it on an energy diagram here, so 
we can actually think about why this might be happening. 

So what is this, which element did I chart here? Which one is that, the boron or the 
beryllium? I couldn't tell what you said, sorry. So, I'm going to assume that was 
beryllium, and then it turns out that if that's beryllium, the other one must be boron. 

So, we have beryllium in the first case here, it has four electrons, that's how we 
know it's beryllium, boron has five electrons. So, just looking at putting in the 
electrons, filling up the energy diagram here, we should be able to see a little bit 
why this is happening. And the reason is simply because the energy that we gain in 
terms of moving up in z, so from going to z equals 4 to z equals 5, is actually 
outweighed by the energy it takes to go into this new shell, to go into this new sub 
shell. So to jump from the 2 s to the 2 p, takes more energy than we can actually 
compensate with by increasing the pull from the nucleus. 

So, it turns out that in this case, and any time that we see we're going from a 2 s to 
2 p, filling in of electrons, we actually see that little bit of glitch in ionization energy. 
So it's shown here for the second row, but it's actually also going to be true for the 
third row. The same thing when you're going from filling in the 2 s to putting that 
first electron into the 2 p. 

So that explains one of our glitches here, but we have another glitch, and that 
second glitch comes between nitrogen and oxygen. So, these sound more different, 
so I think I'll be able to distinguish. Which element is shown here? Yeah, nitrogen. 
So, nitrogen is shown here, we know that because it has 7 electrons. In this case, 
we're talking about 8 electrons, which is oxygen. So if we're comparing the 
difference between these 2 now, what you'll notice is that in nitrogen we have all 
half-filled 2 p orbitals, and now, once we move into oxygen, we actually have to add 
1 more electron into 1 of the 2 p orbitals. There's no more 2 p orbitals to put it into, 
so we're going to actually have to double up. So now we're putting 2 electrons into 
the same p orbital, that's not a problem, we can do it, it's not a huge energy cost to 
do that. But actually there is a little bit of an energy cost into doubling up into a 
single orbital, because, of course, it takes energy when you create more electron 
repulsion, that's not something we want to do, but we have to do it here, and it 
turns out that that effect predominates over, again, the energy that we gain by 
increasing the atomic number by one. 

So, our two glitches we see when we go from the 2 p, or from 2 s to start filling the 
2 p, and then we also get another glitch when we've half-filled the 2 p, and now 
we're adding and having to double up in one of those p orbitals. Again, we see the 
same effect as we go into different rows as well. 

So let's talk about another periodic trend, this one is called electron affinity. Electron 
affinity is actually the ability of an atom, or we could also talk about an ion to gain 
electrons. So it's the affinity it has for electrons, it's how much it likes to get an 
electron. We can write out what it is for any certain atom or ion x, so it's just x plus 
an electron gives us x minus. We have the minus because we're adding a negative 
charge from the electron. 

So, basically any time we have a really high positive number of electron affinity, it 
means that that atom or ion really wants to gain another electron, and it will be very 
stable and happy if it does so. So let's look at an example of chlorine here. 

So chlorine, if we talk about it in terms of electron affinity, we would be writing that 
we're actually gaining an electron here, and getting the ion, c l minus. And the 
change in energy for this reaction is negative 349 kilojoules per mole. So if we have 
a negative change in energy for any reaction as it's written, what that actually 
means is we're giving off energy as the reaction proceeds. So, in other words, this c l 
minus is actually lower in energy than the reactants were. So that's why we're giving 
off extra energy. We saw a similar thing as we saw electrons move from different 
levels. We can think of it in the same type of way when we're talking about actual 
reactions happening. 

So, if we have energy that's released, would you say that the chlorine ion is more or 
less stable than the chlorine atom? Who thinks it's more stable, show of hands? All 
right, who thinks it's less stable? Very good. So it turns out it is, in fact, more stable. 
It's more stable because you actually -- this happens spontaneously, you actually get 
energy out of the reaction as this happens. And we haven't talked about reactions at 

all yet, so you don't need to worry about the specifics of that exactly, but just that if 
you have this negative change in energy, you have a more stable product than you 
do reactant. 

So, we were talking, however, about energy in terms of electron affinity, so we can 
actually relate electron affinity to any reaction by saying if we have this reaction 
written as here where we're gaining an electron, we say that electron affinity is just 
equal to the negative of that change in energy. 

So, for example, for the chlorine case, we would say that the electron affinity for 
chlorine is actually positive 349 kilojoules per mole. That's a very large number, it's 
all relative, so you don't necessarily know it's large without me telling you or giving 
you other ions to compare to, but chlorine does have a very large affinity, meaning 
it's really likes getting an electron and becoming a chlorine ion. 

One major difference between electron affinity and ionization energy is that when we 
talked about ionization energy, remember ionization energy always has to be 
positive. We will never have a case where ionization energy is negative. Electron 
affinity, however, can be either negative or it can be positive. So let's look at a case 
where it's actually going to be negative. 

So, if we took the case of nitrogen, if we add an electron to nitrogen and go to n 
minus, we find that the change in energy is 7 kilojoules per mole. This means in 
order to do that we actually have to put 7 kilojoules per mole of energy into the 
reaction to make it happen. So this is not going to be a favorable process, we're 
going to find that the electron affinity is actually a negative 7 kilojoules per mole for 
nitrogen. So this means nitrogen has low electron affinity, it doesn't actually want to 
gain an electron. So, that also tells us that the n minus ion is less stable than the 
neutral atom itself. 

So, we can think about trends in electron affinity just like we did for ionization 
energy, and what we see is a similar trend. Electron affinity increases as we go 
across a row in the periodic table, and it decreases as we go down a column. I left 
out the noble gases here because they do something a little bit special, and actually, 
I'm going to give you one last clicker question today to see if you can tell me what 
you think noble gases do. To answer this question you just really want to think about 
what does electron affinity means. It means how much a certain atom actually wants 
to get an electron. So do you think noble gases would have a high positive electron 
affinity, a low positive, or negative electron affinity? So, let's take 10 seconds on 
that. 

All right. Great. So most of you recognize, if we switch back to the notes, that they 
do have a negative electron affinity. This should make sense to you, because they 
don't, in fact, want to gain another electron, because that would mean that electron 
would have to go into a new value of n, a new shell, and that's really going to 
increase the energy of the system. So they'd much rather just stay the way they are 
and not have another electron come on, and it turns out that halogens have the 
highest electron affinities.
