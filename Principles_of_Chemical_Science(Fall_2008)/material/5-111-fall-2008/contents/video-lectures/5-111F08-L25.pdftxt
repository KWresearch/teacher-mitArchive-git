PROFESSOR: So, you have now 10 seconds, go ahead and click in your answer. OK. 
We have a little bit of a mixed response here. So for those of you coming in late, I'm 
going to give you a second chance, and we say now what if the p k a was 4. 
Everything else is the same, but the p k a is now 4 -- what would the answer be? 
OK, go ahead and click in your response for a p k a of 4, everything else being the 
same. OK, let's do 10 seconds. Interesting. More people got that right. So it's the 
same answer for a p k a of 3 as a p k a of 4, but it gave people the opportunity to 
think about that a little more and see what their neighbors had voted and make a 
decision based on that. And so more people came up with the right answer. 

So let's consider now for a minute why this is true. So if you can switch to my lecture 
notes, I have a couple of slides on this that are not in your handout but that are 
related to things we've talked about. So just a brief sort of reminder of where we 
were with acid based titrations. So, we last time talked about what's happening at 
different points of the p h curve, and introduced this concept of 1/2 equivalence 
point where the p h equals the p k a, where you have equal number of moles of 
molecules that are pronated as depronated. And another way to sort of think about 
this whole thing is that in the beginning at p h's that are lower than the p k a, you 
have more pronated molecules. And if p h is much above the p k a, you have more 
depronated molecules. 

So, we can think about things that way. So let's think about the last question that I 
asked where are have a p k a of 4. So, if you gave someone a sample of molecules 
where the p h was equal to the p k a of the molecule, you'd be giving them a sample 
where there would be equal amounts of pronated and depronated. But instead, if you 
gave a sample where the p h is much above the p k a, then you're going to be giving 
them a sample that's mostly depronated. 

And I emphasize about using, in terms of titrations, using Henderson Hasselbalch for 
buffer, but it also can be applied to thinking about this type of problem. And so you 
can be thinking about what sort of ratio are you going to get of your pronated to 
depronated when you have given a particular p k a and a particular p h. And so, if 
the p h is really very far above the p k a, then you're going to be largely depronated, 
and here's the math for these two numbers. If you're at a p h that's really below the 
p k a, then your molecules are going to be pronated. And so, you're going to be 
thinking about this kind of thing when you get to organic chemistry, and also 
biochemistry. Biochemists spend a lot of time thinking about the p k a's of amino 
acid side chains, and there are often mechanisms that people propose of how an 
enzyme works, and they're proposing that some residue is going to play a role as a 
catalytic acid or a base in an enzyme mechanism. 

And often people are proposing things that really just don't make much sense in 
terms of the p k a of that molecule, that they're proposing, that it's going to be 
giving off a proton, but given the p h of the enzyme in the body and given the p k a, 
it wouldn't be pronated. So how is it going to give off something it's not going to 
have. So these are the kinds of questions people talk about in biochemistry, and if 
you're in a biochemistry seminar and someone's talking about something like this, 
there will probably be a hand go up in the audience and say "What do you think the 
p k a is of that amino acid that you're proposing that role in this enzyme 
mechanism?" And there have been people who are pretty high profile who've gotten 
themselves in trouble over p k a issues. 

So now, you should all be ready to raise your hand in those seminars and say "What 
do you think the p k a is of that residue?" So, you'll be hearing about p k a's later, 
and the thing that makes me very excited is that some other people who are taking 
chemistry here, may not be as aware of the sort of biological role of p k a's. Now you 
know something, you've had some of these in your problem-sets, and so when you 
go into those advanced classes and there's a discussion of p k a, you'll raise your 
hand and impress my colleagues with your tremendous knowledge of p k a's. So I'm 
very excited about that. And please send me an email when you get extra points 
because of knowledge of p k a's. I want to collect that information and use it for evil 
purposes. No. But anyway, you can think about p k a's of molecules now, which will 
be very handy to you later on. 

So it's not just -- some people tell me, if I promise never to titrate a weak acid with 
a strong base, do I have to take that part of the test? Well, you know it's not just 
about acid based titrations. Some of the things you learn in that are actually relevant 
to other things that most of you will see later in your career. 

All right. So, I love enzymes, enzymes are great, I'm a biochemist. Acid base is very 
important in biochemistry. And the other thing that is very important in biochemistry 
is oxidation reduction. So, in these two units that we're doing now that'll be on the 
third exam, you're learning a lot of the basic principles that apply to how enzymes 
work. And so we started last time talking about some rules. Rules of assigning 
oxidation number. So this is sort of the very basic knowledge that you need to know 
to go on and do oxidation reduction problems. And here are those rules, and now 
let's see look at some examples of how we're going to apply these rules. 

So, first let's look at a compound that has lithium and oxygen in it. All right. What do 
I know about lithium's oxidation number? What's it going to be? Plus 1. So, things in 
group 1 are going to be plus 1, and I have 2 of them. So we're going to be using one 
of those rules up there to assign it. What about oxygen? What's oxygen going to be 
in this molecule? Minus 2. So it's not in a peroxide here, so it'll be minus 2. And then 
we have plus 2 minus 2 is equal to 0, and that's good, because there's no charge on 
this particular molecule, so all of the oxidation numbers should add up to 0. That's 
also one of our rules. 

All right, so let's look at p c l 5. So, what we know about oxidation number of 
chloride? What are you guessing? Minus 1. What's the exception to that? When it's 
with what? When it's with oxygen it can be different. All right, so there's 5 of those. I 
haven't told you anything about phosphorous, but what can you guess it's going to 
be? 

STUDENT: 5. 

PROFESSOR: I love that enthusiasm, good. So, it will be 5, and so overall, we're 
going to add up to 0. So you won't always have a rule about everything in your 
molecule, but you'll be given something that you can get a handle on and then 
predict what the other thing is going to be. So let's do a couple more. 

So, what about h n o 3? So let's start with oxygen -- you told me about oxygen, 
what's oxygen going to be here? 

STUDENT: Negative 2. 

PROFESSOR: Negative 2 and there's 3 of those. And we need to have this all add up 
to again. So, what about hydrogen? 

STUDENT: Plus 1. 

PROFESSOR: Plus 1. What's the exception to that rule? When its with a metal. So 
what does that leave for nitrogen? Plus 5. And that will all add up. All right, so you're 
very good at this, so let's bring in that clicker competition, and you can tell me about 
this molecule. All right, 10 seconds. 

Excellent -- not necessarily for the competition since most people got it right, but I 
love seeing people get it right. So, 2 times plus 1 minus 2 is 0, so we know our 
states here. And I'll just tell you another thing you can do in doing these problems, if 
you recognize that something is often seen has a unit here, you can also think about 
this as h plus and n o 3 minus, and you would get the same answers to the problem. 
So, if it's a little complicated and you want to break it apart, you can do that too, 
you'll get the same answers there. 

All right, so as I said, in this unit it's a lot of adding and subtracting, so this part is 
not too complicated, but you just have to be paying attention and doing your math, 
simple math, correctly. All right, so we looked at some examples. So now we're 
going to give some definitions. What is oxidation? What happens when something is 
oxidized? Yup. So, when you oxidize something, electrons are lost. What happens 
when you reduce something? 

STUDENT: Gain electrons. 

PROFESSOR: You gain electrons. Most people are good with those definitions. Here 
are some that give people a little bit more trouble. Oxidizing agent. So it is an agent 
of oxidation, so it accepts -- an oxidation agent is something that wants to oxidize 
something else, so it gets reduced itself. So it's an agent of oxidation. It runs around 
trying to oxidize other things, but it itself is going to get reduced, and then you can 
probably figure out what a reducing agent is, it's an agent of reduction. And so it 
itself will be oxidized. It'll try to reduce something else. It'll run around trying to 
reduce something, trying to give off its electrons, donate its electrons so that it can 
be oxidized. 

So, keep these definitions in mind, because you're going to be using them a lot in 
this unit. 

So now we're going to use them, we're going to look at a reaction, and we're going 
to think about what's being oxidized and what is being reduced. And this particular 
type of reaction, a disproportionation reaction, the same element can be both 
oxidized and reduced. So let's break this down into two equations. In every reaction 
there's going to be an oxidation and a reduction, and so you can write those 
separately. And poor sodium, sodium is getting kind of a jip. A lot in these last few 
units in acid base, and here again, it's a spectator ion here, so it doesn't even make 
it into the equation. And it was ineffective as a conjugate acid, it hasn't really been 
doing very much recently. But that's OK. 

All right, so let's look at what's going on here and try to figure out what's happening 
in terms of what's being reduced and what's being oxidized. So let's start over here, 
let's think about what the oxidation numbers are in this particular molecule. So what 
would be true about oxygen here and chloride. What do we know about this 
combination of things in terms of oxidation numbers? So let's start with chloride, 
what's that going to be here? So, we have a minus 2 here. And the whole thing is 
going to be minus 1, and so what is that about chloride? Plus 1, right. 

So this is one of the exceptions. Chloride is usually minus 1, except when it's with 
oxygen, and here we have an overall charge of the molecule of minus 1, so it all has 
to add up to minus 1 and it does. 

All right, so now let's do that side. So what's going on here? Are they going to be 
similar or different? Let's start with the oxygen, what's that going to be? So we have 
three negative 2's. It's not a peroxide, so it's negative 2 for oxygen. The overall has 
to be equal to minus 1, so what is chloride here? Plus 5, right. So that's unusual, but 
that's what it is. So we use our rules. Chloride is usually minus 1, except when it's 
with oxygen, and then it can be something different. 

So, here chloride's going from plus 1 to plus 5, so what's happening to it? Is it being 
oxidized or reduced? Yup. So it's going from plus 1 to plus 5, so we have an 
oxidation going on. So to tell whether something is an oxidation or not, you need to 
figure out what the oxidation numbers are and then see what's changing in the 
course of that reaction. 

All right, so down here, we've already done this one, so we can put that down here. 
So we have minus 2 for oxygen, overall minus 1, and so chloride is plus 1 again. And 
what's the oxidation number on the other side for chlorine? Minus 1. I just have to 
look, and so that's minus 1. So here we're going from plus 1 to minus 1, so what is 
that? That's a reduction. And if we had figured out that they're both oxidations and 
something we would have done incorrectly, because in these reactions you're going 
to have oxidations and reductions. So, here, and this is disproportionation. So, you 
have chloride in one state, and in another, it's undergoing a reduction. OK, so that's 
how you sort of think about what's happening in these types of reactions. 

So now we need to balance reactions. And this is very important in getting the 
correct answer to the later problems, and so we'll go through an example of how 
you're going to balance. You need to think about whether it's an acidic solution or 
basic solution, and we'll talk about that at the end. 

So, first here, we can look at the two 1/2 reactions going on, we have iron, we have 
chromium, and so we're going to look at those separately. So here is the first one, 
and let's think about what's happening over here. So, what would our oxidation 

number of the oxygen be here? What is happening to it? So, figure out what the 
oxidation numbers are of the chromium on one side, you know what it is on the 
other side, and then tell me what's happening to it. I hear some murmuring. People 
in one recitation aren't helping out people in the other recitation, are they? All right. 
Do you need more times? You good? You clicked in? Let's do 10 seconds. 

OK. People did pretty well on that one. Let's look at the answer to that. So, let's go 
back to my Powerpoint. And so, oxidation number for oxygen here, minus 2. The 
overall charge on that is minus 2. So you have to figure out what the math equals 
there. And so, if you run through the math, then you see that you're going from a 
plus 6 to a plus 3 state, so we have a reduction. OK, 75% did that, got that, good. 

So, most of you should be able to get this one now, iron plus 2 to iron plus 3. Just 
yell it out, what is that? Yeah. So here we have our oxidation. 

Now let's balance this. And I left some nice blanks in your notes, but not so many 
that you won't be able to keep up and you should feel free to yell out the answers 
and we'll go through balancing this pretty quickly. 

So there's a couple of different rules. I'll just say some books have things differently. 
If you can get the right answer, you can use whatever procedure you want. I have 
found in the past that this particular procedure a lot of people find to be the easiest. 
So I'll teach you this one, but you're free to use whichever ones work well for you. 

All right, so the first thing we want to do is balance all elements that are not oxygen 
or hydrogen. To make it equal on both sides, we're going to do oxygen and hydrogen 
later. But what do we need to do up here to balance our non-oxygens? We need to 
add a what? A 2. So we need to add a 2 over here, two chromiums here, two on the 
other side. What about for iron? Nothing. All right, so that was pretty simple. Now, in 
this procedure you add water to balance the oxygens. So, what are we going to do 
up here. How many waters do we need to add? So we need to add 7 waters. And the 
bottom one, bottom one's pretty easy so far, we don't have to do anything. So, go 
ahead and write in your 7 waters. 

Next step is we're going to balance the hydrogens that we just added, and we can 
balance here with h plus, and I say here's one place that books are different. Some 
of them balance in the more sort of technically correct way with hydroium ions, but 
then your oxygens get unbalanced again, so it's OK to use the simpler approach, and 
just balance with h plus. So how many h plusses do we need to add to balance the 
top part? Yup, so we need to add 14 over here. Again, the bottom one, nothing to 
do. Pretty simple. 

Now we need to balance the charge, so we just added h plusses, so we just added 
some charge to this, and now we have to balance the overall charge, so you want 
the charge on one side of the equation to be equal to the charge on the other side of 
the equation. So how many electrons are we going to have to add to this top 
equation to balance the charge? I heard the answer. 6. So we have to add 6. I told 
you, this unit involves adding and subtracting in your head, and you always want to 
check your work when you're doing this on an exam, because it's really sad when 
you lose points for something that is adding and subtracting. So you want to make 
sure that you don't lose points on these on an exam. 

So what about the bottom -- finally we get to do something with the bottom one, 
what do we do? So, we add how many electrons? 1, right. OK, so now our charge is 
balanced. 

So now, we want to multiply up one of the 1/2 reactions so that the electrons are 
going to cancel, and so what do we have to multiply by the bottom equation so that 
the electrons cancel with the first? 6. So we have 6, 6, and 6. And now, we're going 
to add those together and make the appropriate cancellations. So here is our overall 
equation -- we have the 6 electrons, the 14 protons, we have our chromium oxide 
compound, we have the 6 iron 2 plusses, on the other side, the 2 chromium 3 
plusses, the 7 waters, the 6 iron 3 plusses, and the 6 electrons. So, we should be 
able to cancel the electrons, so we cancel those out. And now we want to double 
check that, in fact, it's balanced. Again, this is very important to do on the test, it's 
really easy to make some kind of math mistake, but you should be able to figure it 
out at this point. It won't be balanced if you've made a math mistake. So there 
should be 14 hydrogens over here, 14 over there, 2 chromiums, 2 chromiums, you 
have 7 oxygens here, 7 oxygens there, 6 irons, 6 irons. And the charge also should 
be balanced on both sides. So you can double check that and if it's good, then you're 
done. And this was in acidic solution, so we should have again this number and a 
charge of plus 24 on each side, double check, make sure it's correct. 

So, that was acidic solution and we ended up with an equation that had h plusses in 
it. You can also be asked to do it in basic solution, and again, books have different 
approaches here. What I like to do is the simplest thing, which is to use the same 
steps all the way up to here to get your same answer that you had for the acidic 
solution, and then neutralize it at this point. So, adjust the p h in quotes by adding 
hydroxide ions to both sides, and so, if we have 14 h plusses here, we can add 14 o 
h's on one side, and 14 o h minus on the other side. And then we can add those guys 
together. So we have now 14 waters over here. And we have still our 7 waters on 
this side, and then the 14 hydroxides on this side. And now, we should be able to 
cancel out some of those waters. So, we had 14 over here, 7 over here, so we can 
just have 7 on this side. And now we have an equation that looks like it's in basic 
solution. So instead of having h plus, which you would have in acid, you have 
hydroxide for basic solution. 

So you can follow the same rules. Again, some books do it differently. I think this is 
the simplest way to do it, the least likely to make those kind of adding and 
subtracting errors. So those are sort of the fundamentals you need for this unit. You 
need to figure out oxidation numbers, looking at the composition of a molecule, and 
you need to be able to balance equations. When you can do that, you can go on to 
do other things. So, at this point -- oh, let me just say, those are the two answers 
there, so you can see acid and then in base. 

So, at this point then, I want to try to do a little demo to show you that when you do 
do oxidation reduction reactions, cool things can happen. So, it's more exciting, 
perhaps, in real life when oxidation happens than on paper. So I'm going to turn it 
over now to Dr. Taylor and Dr. Patti Christie who's here to help us with this demo. 
And they will -- go for it. 

PROFESSOR: OK, so this is mostly visual, there's not too much we'll need to say. 
Basically what we're going to do for you is oxidize magnesium. So we have a source 
of oxidation, which is going to be carbon dioxide, which is dry ice, and what we put 
inside the dry ice is solid magnesium. So we're going to set the magnesium on fire, 

and then put the oxidating agent on top of it, and you can see the rest of what's 
going to happen there. And you can actually also determine if this is an exothermic 
or an endothermic reaction while you're at it. 

[EXPERIMENTING] 

[APPLAUSE] 

PROFESSOR: Thanks to my helpers. 

All right. So oxidation reduction reactions can be quite interesting, and don't try that 
at home. 

So, we're going to continue on now, you know the basics and we're going to talk 
about electric chemical cells. We're going to introduce Faraday's law, and a thing I 
love to do, is come back to my friend Gibb's free energy. So, thermodynamics is all 
over the place in chemistry and you can't get very far away from it. So hopefully, by 
the end of the class today, we'll come back to free energy. 

All right, so what is an electric chemical cell. It's any device in which electric current, 
which is a flow of electrons through a circuit, is either produced by a spontaneous 
reaction, or used to bring about a non-spontaneous reaction. And so a battery is 
technically a collection of cells in a series, so that the voltage that each cell produces 
is the sum, the battery has the sum of the voltages of each cell. 

So, let's take a look at what some of these might look like. Here's a little cartoon of a 
simple version. We have a beaker -- 2 beakers with different solutions in them, 2 
electrodes, a salt bridge across, and as electrons transfer through this, you can read 
a current on an amp meter here, you can read some kind of voltage coming off. And 
so, I like to talk about how good you guys have it at MIT with the Web and handouts 
and everything and how students in the old days at MIT, if they're going to do their 
problem-sets at night, first they had to build a battery to get electricity to be able to 
see. So you guys have it easy, you have these electric lights and all this fancy stuff 
now here. 

So, let's sort of break apart sort of a components. Here is my beautiful picture that I 
drew of this system, that's why I show you a better cartoon first. So this is a beaker 
that you -- here's one beaker with one solution on this side, here is the other beaker. 
So we have two electrodes put in, we have a salt bridge, and then we have a wire 
across where we can measure voltage. 

So, let's think about what is happening on each side. So in one beaker you're going 
to have an oxidation reduction, and in the other beaker you're going to have a 
reduction. So if we think about what's happening over here, you could have a zinc 
system, is oxidized from zinc to zinc plus 2. And so, this is sort of a view of what 
would be happening at the electrode, you have zinc solid or zinc 0, and you've also 
have zinc plus 2 in solution. And so, as you take a zinc solid atom, going into zinc 
plus 2, you can have an oxidation reaction. And here would be the equation going 
down. So zinc solid to zinc plus 2 with two electrons. 

Those electrons can go through to our other beaker on this other side, and so here 
we have a copper solid electrode or a cathode in this case, and we have copper plus 
2 in solution, which is being reduced to copper solid, and so we're plating on to our 

electrode on this side. And so, here we have the reduction reaction, copper 2 with 
two electrons going to copper solid. 

So our oxidation is happening at an electrode called the anode. The reduction is 
happening in an electrode called the cathode. And as these reactions occur, you're 
changing the charge on either side. So, you have this salt bridge, and so to 
neutralize the change in charge, you would have negative ions come down here, 
because we're producing more plus 2. And on the other side potassium is going in as 
we're going from copper plus 2 to copper solid, again, to balance this change in 
charge that's occurring. So those are the basic components of a simple 
electrochemical cell. 

So, we could talk about the cell -- here's some nomenclature that represents the cell. 
So, the one that I just showed you, you have one electrode, a zinc solid, and we also 
have zinc plus 2 in solution. You have a single line between the solid and the zinc 
plus 2 ions in solution, that indicates there's a phase boundary, so you're changing 
phase from solid to aqueous. Then if you see two little lines that tells you, okay, one 
part of the reaction's in one beaker, the other part is in the other beaker, that 
represents the salt bridge which separates out the two 1/2 reactions. And then on 
this side, we're going from copper 2 in solution, single line which indicates the phase 
boundary, to a copper solid over here. 

So the amount of charge that goes through the system, it depends -- and how much 
of the zinc that is consumed or the copper that is deposited, is proportional to that 
charge, the number of electrons that go through the system, and this is called 
Faraday's law. 

So let's look at what is happening a little bit here, so we have a little movie that 
shows the oxidation reaction. So in green is the electrode, and then here are the 
water molecules, and let's look at what happens when there's this oxidation. So here 
things are floating around, and there go the electrons. And this pops off into 
solutions, so if this is zinc, so then as this is happening, we have a zinc plus 2 now, 
it's aqueous. There go electrons, we have our oxidation. Here comes off zinc plus 2 
floating around, there's another zinc plus 2 that just came off. And so our electrode 
here is being consumed as this oxidation occurs. I think it's really cool, the electrons, 
you can see them as this green going along in this movie. So, this is a little thing to 
think about what's happening. 

So what's happening at the cathode, we have a reduction. So if we have our copper 
ions are going to plate onto our electrode. So here in blue is the electrode, and again 
the water molecules, here's a little copper 2 in solution. And when it gets electrons 
and gets reduced, it's going to start plating, so let's take a look at that. 

So, here's -- oh, there comes the electrons. And so now it becomes part of the 
electrode there, the electrons come in, and so you're building up, you're adding, your 
plating on to your electrode. Now it got its electrons, it got reduced, got reduced 
again, and it becomes solid, and plates onto the electrode. And we see the electrons 
coming in. 

So again, the amount of current that flows, the number of electrons that flow are 
going to be proportional to the chemistry that's happening at the two electrodes. So 
you can figure out how much zinc would be consumed, how much of the zinc solid 
electrode could be consumed, and how much copper would be deposited on the 

copper electrode for a particular amount of current. So say we have 1 amp of current 
for 1 hour, what are we going to do to our system? So we can calculate this out, so 
we use this equation to find out how much charge is going to pass through the 
system, we have this term q, the magnitude of charge and it's in Coulombs, those 
are our units, and that's equal to the current in amps, and just for unit conversion, 
amps are Coulombs per second, so that's very convenient because we're going to 
take the current and times second, so times time. And so if we work that out, we 
had 1 amp and we had 1 hour, so we're going to have 3,600 Coulombs that are our 
magnitude of our charge. 

So once we know that, we can convert, using Faraday's constant from charge into 
moles of electrons that had to pass through the system to generate that kind of 
current. And here is our friend Faraday's constant, and so that's in Coulombs per 
mole. And so, we can we can convert the number of Coulombs into the number of 
moles of electrons that were passed through the system with that amount of current, 
1 amp for 1 hour. 

Now, how is this going to relate to the zinc consumed or the copper deposited? So 
we know the total number of moles that passed through the system. And so, then we 
have to think about for every 1 mole of zinc that was consumed, how many moles of 
electrons went through the system? So why don't you yell out and tell me what you 
think that is. What do you think? 2, right. So we are going from zinc solid to zinc 
plus 2. So, we need to do -- to consume one, we need two electrons. So then we can 
look up the atomic weight of zinc and calculate the number of grams. 

We can do the same with copper. So for one mole of copper deposited, how many 
moles of electrons needed to pass through the system? two, right. And then we look 
up the atomic weight, which is very similar, and actually with significant figures, it's 
the same amount, which won't be true for most things. 

All right, so these problems are not too complicated. So let me just tell you a little bit 
more about types of electrodes that can be used. It's not always true that you have 
to use electrodes that are going to be consumed or have species deposited on them. 
You can use an inert electrode, such as a platinum electorate, and here is an 
example of that. So here, this cell has a platinum electrode, and the reaction that's 
happening, you have actually two things in solution instead of going from a solid to a 
solution. So this is just another example of a type of cell. 

So let's think about, then, what equations we would write for this chemistry and 
what's going on. So over here at the cathode, what happens at a cathode, oxidation 
or reduction? I'm hearing somewhat of a consensus. That's correct. Reduction. That's 
the thing you're going to need to memorize, it'll be important in doing problems later 
on. So, what is the reduction reaction that you imagine would be happening if you 
have copper plus 2 and copper solid? So, if you're reducing it, you're going to be 
reducing copper plus 2 with two electrons to copper solid. So, same reaction we saw 
before. 

So what about over here. This is the anode, which has the oxidation reaction going 
on, and what oxidation reaction can you imagine happening with chromium plus 3 
and chromium plus 2. What's going to what? So, you're going from plus 2 to plus 3 
with one electron here. So that would be the oxidation reaction. 

So let's think about how we would actually write this down then. So the notation for 
this type of cell, we're going to have a platinum that indicates the electrode, a single 
line that indicates a phase boundary. And in solution, you have the chromium plus 2, 
chromium plus 3, those are both aqueous, so they have a comma between them. So 
this is on one side in one of the beakers, so that's the reaction at the anode. And 
then we have a bar here that indicates a salt bridge. And then in the other beaker, 
we would have the copper plus 2 and the copper solid, separated by a single line, 
because there's a phase boundary between the aqueous and the solid. And then here 
are our two equations. At the anode, we have copper plus 2. Aqueous going to 
copper plus 3 aqueous in an electron at the cathode. We have copper plus 2 aqueous 
and two electrons going to copper solid. So those are our two equations and how we 
would write that down. 

Another example of an electrode is a hydrogen electrode. And this is very common. 
In fact, most potential standard reduction potentials, or as they're also known, 
oxidation reduction potentials are measured against a standard hydrogen electrode, 
and it'll be abbreviated s h e. And so, if you see it was measured against s h e, you 
will now know what that means. So that's a standard hydrogen electrode. 

So there's a couple of different variations. It can be used at the cathode or at the 
anode. And so, if you're using it at the cathode, h plus is reduced, and at the anode, 
h 2 is oxidized. And often you have a platinum system there as well, for the standard 
hydrogen, so platinum is commonly used in a standard hydrogen electrode. 

So, let's just sort of look at a little picture of this. So here, we may have like a glass 
cylinder here, we're pumping in h 2 gas. And here you can see it sort of bubbling 
down. We may have a solution of hydrochloric acid, which would have a lot of h plus 
in it, and so this would be a hydrogen electrode on one side, the other side may have 
something more common or something that we saw before with the zinc solid and 
the zinc in solution. 

So since on this side we have the cathode, of we can write about the h plus aqueous, 
a bar for the phase transition to h 2 gas, and then we indicate that there's also a 
platinum electrode going on here. And the other side is what we saw before, the zinc 
solid and the zinc plus 2. So you're just introducing different types of electrodes that 
you may be seeing in this particular unit. And again, you want to remember what 
reaction's going on at the cathode, and at the anode. 

All right, so just very briefly, I will mention cell potential, which has many different 
names -- cell voltage, EMF it's often called. And so the flow of electrons generates a 
potential difference between the electrodes in the current. And this can be related 
back to our friend, delta g. So in this equation you have this potential difference 
that's generated by the flow of the electrons, and that times Faraday's constant 
times the number moles of electrons, and if you have a negative sign here, that's 
equal to the free energy of the cell. So we can relate that back. 

And a little bit of information. We have the standard terms as well. We can have the 
delta e nought, the cell potential, cell voltage, you'll see many names for this. And 
that's when the products and reactants are in their standard states. The units we're 
talking about here are in volts, sometimes you'll see things reported in millivolts as 
well. And let's end with one final clicker question, and then we can announce our 
clicker winner for today. OK, 10 seconds. Most people should get this right.
