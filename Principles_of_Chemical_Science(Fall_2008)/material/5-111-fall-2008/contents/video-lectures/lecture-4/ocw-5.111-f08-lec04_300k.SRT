9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

10
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
Let's get started.
 

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Why doesn't everyone go ahead
and take ten more seconds

12
00:00:25 --> 00:00:37
on the clicker question.
 

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
All right, and let's
see how we did.

14
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
Alright, excellent job,
86% of you, that's right.

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
What we had just done a clicker
question on is discussing light

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
as a particle and the
photoelectric effect, so we're

17
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
going to finish up with
a few points about the

18
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
photoelectric effect today.
 

19
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
And then we're going to try a
demo to see if we can convince

20
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
ourselves that the kind of
calculations we make work out

21
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
perfectly, and we'll do a test
up here about half

22
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
way through class.
 

23
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
And we'll also talk about
photon momentum as another

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
example of light behaving
up as a particle.

25
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
After that, we'll move on to
matter as a wave, and then the

26
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
Schrodinger equation, which is
actually a wave equation that

27
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
describes the behavior of
particles by taking into

28
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
account the fact that
matter also has these

29
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
wave-like properties.
 

30
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
So, starting back with the
photoelectric effect -- yes.

31
00:01:27 --> 00:01:27
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
 

32
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
class last time [INAUDIBLE]
 

33
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
notes.
 

34
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.
 

35
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
Can one of the TAs maybe come
up and hand around anyone

36
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
that didn't get notes?
 

37
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
We have not yet perfected the
art of entering and exiting

38
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
this classroom yet, we're
still working on that.

39
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
Raise your hand if you need
notes and we'll make sure

40
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
we get those to you.
 

41
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
All right, so where we left off
with the photoelectric effect

42
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
was when we first introduced
the effect, we were talking

43
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
about it in terms
of frequencies.

44
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
So, for example, we were
talking about a threshold

45
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
frequency as in a minimum
frequency of light that you

46
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
need in order to eject an
electron from a metal surface.

47
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
What Einstein then clarified
for us was that we could also

48
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
be talking about energies, and
he described the relationship

49
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
between frequency and energy
that they're proportional, if

50
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
you want to know the energy,
you just multiply the frequency

51
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
by Planck's constant.
 

52
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
So, now we can talk about it in
different terms, for example,

53
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
talking about e sub i, which is
the incident energy or the

54
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
energy of the light that comes
in, or talking about work

55
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
function here, and that's just
another way to say

56
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
threshold energy.
 

57
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
So, the work function's the
minimum amount of energy that's

58
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
required in order to eject an
electron, and most of you

59
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
understand this relationship
here, which is a little bit cut

60
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
off, but it is all the way on
in your notes, and that is what

61
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
you saw the clicker question on
-- how you can figure out, for

62
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
example, the kinetic energy of
the ejected electron by looking

63
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
at the difference between how
much energy you put in and how

64
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
much energy is required to
eject that electron

65
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
in the first place.
 

66
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
So, in this class we'll be
talking about energy a lot, and

67
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
it's often useful to draw some
sort of energy diagram to

68
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
visualize the differences in
energy that we're discussing.

69
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
So, we do this here for the
photoelectric effect, and in

70
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
terms of the photoelectric
effect, what we know the

71
00:03:15 --> 00:03:19
important point is that the
incoming photon has to be equal

72
00:03:19 --> 00:03:23
or greater in energy then the
work function of the metal.

73
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
So here we have energy
increasing on the y-axis, and

74
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
you see this straight line at
the bottom here is lower down

75
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
on the graph, and that's the
energy of a bound electron, so

76
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
that's going to be a
low stable energy.

77
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
But we see if we have a free
electron, as we do in this

78
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
dotted line here, that's
going to be a higher

79
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
energy that's less stable.
 

80
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
So, if we want to go from that
stable state to that less

81
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
stable state, we need to put in
a certain amount of energy to

82
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
our system, and that's what we
define as the work function

83
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
here -- that difference between
the free electron and the

84
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
electron bound to the metal.
 

85
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
So, the most basic case to
understand, which is what we

86
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
just saw is a case where we
have the incident energy coming

87
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
in, and that incident energy is
greater than the work function,

88
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
and in that case what we see is
that we have an electron

89
00:04:12 --> 00:04:13
that is ejected.
 

90
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
That makes sense and it also
makes sense that this little

91
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
extra bit here, that's the
amount of energy that we have

92
00:04:19 --> 00:04:21
that goes into the kinetic
energy of the electrons.

93
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
So, that's how we could
also graph figuring out

94
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
the kinetic energy.
 

95
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
So, in the second case what we
have is what happens if we have

96
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
the incident energy at some
amount that's less than the

97
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
work function, and in this case
we're showing 1/2 of

98
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
the work function.
 

99
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
So in this case, we don't have
enough energy to eject an

100
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
electron, so, an electron
is not ejected.

101
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
And that's pretty clear, too,
and the question I want to

102
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
pose to you is instead
the third case here.

103
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
So in the third case what I'm
showing is that we have -- now

104
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
we're not just talking about 1
photon, we're talking about 3

105
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
photons -- let's say we shoot
them all at the same time at

106
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
our metal, each of them having
some energy that's let's

107
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
say 1/2 the work function.
 

108
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
So, just to take a little bit
of an informal survey, who

109
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
thinks here that we will
have an electron that is

110
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
ejected in this case?
 

111
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
So a couple hands, all right.
 

112
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
And what about who thinks
that we will not have

113
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
enough energy here?
 

114
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
All right.
 

115
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
We've got a big majority, and
both are logical ways of

116
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
thinking, but it turns out that
the majority is correct, which

117
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
is not always the case,
but the electron is not

118
00:05:32 --> 00:05:33
ejected in this case.
 

119
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
And the reason for this, and
this is a very important point

120
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
about the photoelectric effect,
and the point here is that the

121
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
electrons here are acting as
particles, you can't just add

122
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
those energies together.
 

123
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
One individual particle is
being absorbed by the metal

124
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
and exciting an electron.
 

125
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
So, having other particles
around that have the same

126
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
energy that you could
technically add up if you were

127
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
adding them up like a wave, you
can't do the same thing with

128
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
particles, they're
all separate.

129
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
So, the take-home message is
whether you have three photons

130
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
or 3,000,000 photons that
you're shooting at your metal,

131
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
if you're not at that minimum
frequency or that minimum

132
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
energy that you need,
nothing is going to happen.

133
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
So, you might ask then well
what is the significance of

134
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
shooting different amounts
of photons at a metal?

135
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
Is there any significance at
all, for example, in the number

136
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
of photons that are hitting the
metal or being absorbed

137
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
by the metal.
 

138
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
And there is a relationship
here, and that is that the

139
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
number of photons absorbed
by the metal are related to

140
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
the number of electrons
ejected from the metal.

141
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
So, in this figure here what
I'm actually showing is these

142
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
little sunshines, which
let's say are each one

143
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
individual photon.
 

144
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
So we had six photons going in,
so the maximum number of

145
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
electrons that we're going to
have coming out is also six

146
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
because the maximum scenario
that we could have that would

147
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
maximize the number of
electrons is that each one of

148
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
those photons comes in, excites
an electron, ejects it from

149
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
the surface of the metal.
 

150
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
It's important to note, of
course though, it's not just

151
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
the number, it's really
important that the energy of

152
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
each one of these individual
photons is, of course, greater

153
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
than the work function
of the metal.

154
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
So, that's, in fact, it's that
number of photons that we're

155
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
talking about when we refer to
the intensity of light, and

156
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
the intensity of light is
proportional to that number,

157
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
because when we talk about
intensity, really we're talking

158
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
about the amount of energy that
a stream of particles, a stream

159
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
of photons, has per second.
 

160
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
So, if we have a high
intensity, we're talking about

161
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
having more photons per second,
and it's important to know also

162
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
what that does not mean.
 

163
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
So it does not mean that we
have more energy per photon.

164
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
This is a really
important difference.

165
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
Intensity, if we increase the
intensity, we're not increasing

166
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
the energy in each photon,
we're just increasing the

167
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
number of photons that we're
shooting out of our laser,

168
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
whatever our light source is.
 

169
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
And when we talk about
intensity in terms of units, we

170
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
usually talk about watts, so if
you change your lightbulb,

171
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
usually you see the intensity
in terms of watts.

172
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
But in terms of SI units, which
become much more useful if

173
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
you're actually trying to use
intensity in a problem and

174
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
cancel out your units, we're
just talking about joules per

175
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
second is what intensity is.
 

176
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
So at this point, you should be
able to have all the background

177
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
you need on the photoelectric
effect to solve any type of

178
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
problem that we throw at you,
and you see three on this

179
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
problem set, and we'll probably
give you one more on your next

180
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
problem set, and the reason we
ask you so many questions about

181
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
the photoelectric effect is
because it actually is very

182
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
similar to ionization energy
that we'll talk about later,

183
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
also problems dealing with
photoelectron spectroscopy.

184
00:08:52 --> 00:08:57
So, we want to make sure that
this is something the entire

185
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
class is 100% solid on.
 

186
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Sometimes the questions are
worded quite differently, so I

187
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
just want to sum up here the
different ways they

188
00:09:04 --> 00:09:05
could be worded.
 

189
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
For example, if we talk about
photons, of course, we also

190
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
just mean light, sometimes we
refer to this as

191
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
electromagnetic radiation, and
there's several ways that you

192
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
might be asked this in a
problem or that you might be

193
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
asked to answer.
 

194
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Sometimes we might just
directly tell you the energy of

195
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
the photon -- that's probably
the easiest scenario, because

196
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
when we think about work
functions those are usually

197
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
reported in energy.
 

198
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
So since that's the easiest
scenario, you can probably be

199
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
sure it's not going to be too
frequently that you're just

200
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
given the energy, right,
that might be too easy.

201
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
So really what we'll probably
do is instead either give you

202
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
the wavelength or the
frequency and you'll

203
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
go ahead and calculate
the energy from there.

204
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
In terms of talking about the
electrons, I wanted to point

205
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
out that in the book and other
places you might see electrons

206
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
referred to as photoelectrons.
 

207
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
That's sometimes confusing
for people, because it seems

208
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
like okay, is it a photon
or is it an electron.

209
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
I just want to clarify
that it is an electron.

210
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
It's called this just because
it's an electron that results

211
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
when an electron absorbs a
photon's worth of energy, so

212
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
thus it's a photoelectron.
 

213
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
And if we talk about electrons
or photoelectrons, again we can

214
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
describe it in terms of energy,
we can talk about velocity, and

215
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
from there, of course, you can
figure out the energy from 1/2

216
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
m v squared, and actually we
can also describe the electron

217
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
in terms of wavelength.
 

218
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
So you don't actually know this
yet from this class, you'll

219
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
know it by the end of the
class that electrons can, in

220
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
fact, have a wavelength.
 

221
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
So once we cover it, it will
then be fair game to ask these

222
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
photoelectron spectroscopy or
these photoelectric effect

223
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
questions using the
wavelength of the electron.

224
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Also to point out, a lot of
times you'll see electron volts

225
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
instead of joules, this is the
conversion factor here just so

226
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
you all have it in your notes.
 

227
00:10:58 --> 00:10:58
All right.
 

228
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
So let's test what we, in fact,
know about the photoelectric

229
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
effect, and before we do that
actually, we're going to

230
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
calculate what we would
predict, so when we do the demo

231
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
it will be meaningful and we
can tell whether we're

232
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
successful or not.
 

233
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
So hopefully we will
be successful.

234
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17
And as I point this out, we now
know how to do any kind of

235
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
photoelectric effect problem,
also this means you should be

236
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
able to go back to Monday's
notes where we filled in all

237
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
those graphs, which were what
different scientists were

238
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
observing when they were
measuring either the frequency

239
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
or the intensity of light that
was irradiating different types

240
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
of metals, and also the number
of electrons ejected, and the

241
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
kinetic energy of those
electrons ejected.

242
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
You should be able to maybe
print out a blank copy of those

243
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
notes from the website and fill
in all those graphs -- not

244
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
for memorizing them, but now
just understanding how the

245
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
photoelectric effect works.
 

246
00:11:51 --> 00:11:51
All right.
 

247
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
So let's do an in-class
problem, and this will

248
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
be done with zinc.
 

249
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
We have a zinc plate up here,
and we're going to -- in a

250
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
minute I'll describe how we
can probe if electrons

251
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
are coming off of it.
 

252
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
But we're going to irradiate
it with two different

253
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
light sources.
 

254
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
We have a UV lamp right here,
which is centered at a

255
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
wavelength of 254 nanometers.
 

256
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
And then since we have my red
laser pointer, we will also try

257
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
with the red laser pointer,
which is centered at

258
00:12:19 --> 00:12:22
wavelength of 700 nanometers.
 

259
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
So, there are a few questions
that we need to answer first.

260
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
So we want to see, do we expect
to eject electrons off of this

261
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
metal surface, or do we expect
that we don't have

262
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
enough energy?
 

263
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
So that means we're going to
need to figure out what is the

264
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
energy per photon that's
emitted by that UV light.

265
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Also, what's the energy per
photon of this red laser

266
00:12:41 --> 00:12:45
pointer, and then it's also
worth trying a calculation

267
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
dealing with intensity.
 

268
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
So let's also try calculating
the numbers of photons that

269
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
would be emitted by this laser
pointer, if, for example, we

270
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
were to use it for 60 seconds
and this were a one

271
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
milliwatt laser.
 

272
00:12:58 --> 00:13:03
So, let's do some of these
calculations starting first

273
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
with what is the energy per
photon, and let's start

274
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
with the UV lamp.
 

275
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
So we know that energy is equal
to Planck's constant times nu,

276
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
but what we know about the lamp
is its wavelength, or the

277
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
light that's emitted.
 

278
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
We know that nu is equal
to c over wavelength.

279
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
So we can figure out the energy
of each photon emitted by our

280
00:13:30 --> 00:13:39
UV lamp by saying e is equal
to h c over wavelength.

281
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
So let's just plug in
these numbers here.

282
00:13:41 --> 00:13:48
That means our energy is equal
to 6.626 times 10 to the

283
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
-34 joules times seconds.
 

284
00:13:52 --> 00:13:59
And then we have c, the speed
of light, 2.998 times 10 to

285
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
the 8 meters per second.
 

286
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
And we want to divide all of
that by our wavelength, and

287
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
to keep our units the
same we'll do meters.

288
00:14:08 --> 00:14:18
So that's 254 times
10 to the -9 meters.

289
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
So hopefully if some of you
have your calculators with you,

290
00:14:21 --> 00:14:26
you can confirm the answer that
I got, which is that the energy

291
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
is 7.82 times 10 to
the -19 joules.

292
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
So, remember what we're talking
about here is the amount of

293
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
energy that's in each photon.
 

294
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
So if we think about the work
function for zinc, and the work

295
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
function for zinc is 6.9 times
10 to the -19 joules, do we

296
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
expect that when we shine our
UV light on the zinc, we'll

297
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
be able to eject electrons?
 

298
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
What do you think?
 

299
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
Yes.
 

300
00:14:55 --> 00:14:55
Good.
 

301
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
OK, anyone disagree?
 

302
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
No, OK and that's correct,
because each photon of light

303
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
actually has more energy than
is needed to eject an electron.

304
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
So, we would expect to see
electrons ejected with

305
00:15:12 --> 00:15:17
the UV light source.
 

306
00:15:17 --> 00:15:25
So let's now think about using
instead the amount of energy

307
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
per photon in that
red laser pointer.

308
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
So again, we know that energy
is equal to h c divided by

309
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
wavelength, and energy is equal
to -- you have written out in

310
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
your notes what the actual
value for h c is, but now our

311
00:15:41 --> 00:15:48
wavelength is 700 times
10 to the -9 meters.

312
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
And what we end up with for
the energy then is 2.84

313
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
times 10 to the -19 joules.
 

314
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
All right.
 

315
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
So please raise your hand now
if you think there'll be

316
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
sufficient energy to eject
electrons from the

317
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
metal surface?
 

318
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
And raise your hands if
you think there won't be.

319
00:16:11 --> 00:16:11
OK.
 

320
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Good hand raising technique.
 

321
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Yes.
 

322
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
In fact, there is not enough
energy in a single photon to go

323
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
ahead and eject an electron
from this zinc surface.

324
00:16:23 --> 00:16:31
So our last question we ask is
what's the total number of

325
00:16:31 --> 00:16:36
photons emitted if we give this
given intensity for 60 seconds?

326
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
So, keep in mind that one
milliwatt is just the same

327
00:16:39 --> 00:16:44
as saying 1 times 10 to
the -3 joules per second.

328
00:16:44 --> 00:16:52
So we have 1 times 10 to the -3
joules per second, and we want

329
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
to multiply that by -- or
cancel out how much energy we

330
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
have per photon, first of all,
so how much energy do we have

331
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
per photon if we're talking
about the red laser pointer?

332
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
Right.
 

333
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
So this value right here.
 

334
00:17:08 --> 00:17:16
So for every photon we
have 2.84 times 10

335
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
to the -19 joules.
 

336
00:17:18 --> 00:17:23
We're saying let's do
this for 60 seconds.

337
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
So what we end up with for the
number of photons in this laser

338
00:17:27 --> 00:17:34
beam of light is 2.1 times
10 to the 17 photons.

339
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
So this gives you a little bit
of an idea of just how many

340
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
individual photons there are
in a laser beam of light.

341
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
This is a huge
number of photons.

342
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
So the question is
does this matter?

343
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
How about if we shoot
this many photons?

344
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
Does it make any difference
at all in terms of whether

345
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
we can eject an electron?
 

346
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
No, it actually doesn't.
 

347
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
It is an impressive number, it
is very, very large, but it

348
00:17:57 --> 00:17:58
doesn't make a difference.
 

349
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
So we see that we do not eject
electrons in the case of the

350
00:18:02 --> 00:18:07
laser pointer, even if we have
this intensity, even for 60

351
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
seconds -- it is still not
related to the energy of an

352
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
individual photon, so we
won't see an effect.

353
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
All right.
 

354
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
So let's hope that we can
confirm our predictions here

355
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
by actually doing it, and
Professor Drennen well help me

356
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
out by loading up our device
with electrons, and I'll

357
00:18:26 --> 00:18:32
explain exactly what our set up
here is as she does that.

358
00:18:32 --> 00:18:35
So basically what we have
is this zinc plate here.

359
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
So that's what we want to load
up with electrons, and then

360
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
see if we can remove some.
 

361
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
But that's a little bit hard,
we aren't all that good at

362
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
seeing electrons with our
eyes, so we need to think

363
00:18:46 --> 00:18:47
of a way to do this.
 

364
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
So what she's going to do is
start loading up the electrons,

365
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
and you see this wand here move
slowly, and it takes a while to

366
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
do it, start become
perpendicular.

367
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
The reason for that is because
all of this is connected,

368
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
so we're moving electrons
everywhere in the system.

369
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
And since we have two bars that
are together like this, once

370
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
they're both loaded up with
electrons there's going to be

371
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
negative charges that repel, so
the electrons will want to get

372
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
as far away as possible, and
they're on their slow way to

373
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
doing that, to getting as
far away from each

374
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
other as possible.
 

375
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
And if we do, in fact, hit it
with light to get the electrons

376
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
off, it will go back to the
straight up in position, or

377
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
if it gets knocked hard
enough it does that, too.

378
00:19:34 --> 00:19:36
Sometimes it's easier
actually not touch it to

379
00:19:36 --> 00:19:42
the metal, I should have--
 

380
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
TA: It's hard to see if
it's moving or not.

381
00:19:48 --> 00:19:53
PROFESSOR: So, our technology
TA is also our paper TA.

382
00:19:53 --> 00:19:53
Darcy will hold up
the yellow paper.

383
00:19:53 --> 00:19:55
Right, there we go, now we're
making a little progress.

384
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
TA: It was moving before,
you just couldn't see it.

385
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
PROFESSOR: So, does anyone have
any questions about the set up

386
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
here, does it make sense what
we're looking for the bar to go

387
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
back once we make
some progress.

388
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
This demo works wonderfully in
the winter months in Boston

389
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
when we will all be full
of static at all times.

390
00:20:15 --> 00:20:18
We're still close enough to the
summer that the air is not just

391
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
filling us up with extra static
electricity, so it's a little

392
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
more challenging here.
 

393
00:20:23 --> 00:20:25
We'll try to make this
happen only once.

394
00:20:25 --> 00:20:50
I think that's probably,
if we can get one more.

395
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
So, it works, I think it's just
getting too much [INAUDIBLE].

396
00:20:52 --> 00:21:09
Sometimes it helps to not
actually hit the metal,

397
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
just put it next to
the -- there we go.

398
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
I wonder if there's some UV
light out of this new lighting

399
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
set up in our classroom here.
 

400
00:21:16 --> 00:21:29
That would be a little tricky.
 

401
00:21:29 --> 00:21:29
All right.
 

402
00:21:29 --> 00:21:32
I think this -- if this sticks.
 

403
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
Yeah, it's the pressure
of the paper.

404
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
I think that's good enough,
we'll be able to see.

405
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
If you can keep showing that,
though, Darcy, we'll try

406
00:21:38 --> 00:21:39
different scenarios and
I'll try not to put

407
00:21:39 --> 00:21:42
laser in your eye.
 

408
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
Actually you can look down as
well as an added precaution.

409
00:21:47 --> 00:21:48
OK, let's try it with that.
 

410
00:21:48 --> 00:21:49
That's enough then.
 

411
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
So, the first thing we're going
to try is with the red laser

412
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
pointer, because that we are
expecting not to have an

413
00:21:54 --> 00:21:56
effect, and that will prevent
Professor Drennen from having

414
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
to charge up our
apparatus again.

415
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
So, Darcy will look down at
this moment and we will hit

416
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
this with the laser pointer,
and what we see is nothing

417
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
is happening at all.
 

418
00:22:08 --> 00:22:10
OK, good.
 

419
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
Control one working.
 

420
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
So now very carefully take
our UV light source --

421
00:22:15 --> 00:22:20
Darcy again will divert
her eyes and her skin.

422
00:22:20 --> 00:22:37
Let me make sure this
is actually on.

423
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
OK, so we've got UV light here,
and let's see what we can see,

424
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
and we lose electrons, if
that's what's happening.

425
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
And it often doesn't go all the
way, because actually this

426
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
device gets stuck right there.
 

427
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
So let's charge it up again and
see if we can check again.

428
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
But did you see movement?
 

429
00:22:57 --> 00:23:08
Are you buying our story here?
 

430
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
This is actually very
representative of when you do

431
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
research in the laboratory, you
will find often things do not

432
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
work quite exactly as they
worked 20 minutes ago when you

433
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
just checked it in your
office, for example.

434
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
And sometimes it's a matter of
factors that you need to figure

435
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
out what it is, and maybe it's
that there's extra light in

436
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
the room we don't know about.
 

437
00:23:31 --> 00:23:32
It might just be -- so, we
did get it back to the

438
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
starting position.
 

439
00:23:33 --> 00:23:40
Next time maybe we'll
charge it up before class.

440
00:23:40 --> 00:23:41
All right.
 

441
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
So we kind of saw what was
happening here, you saw

442
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
it move a little bit.
 

443
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
They'll keep trying to get it
going, but maybe we should move

444
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
on with our lives here while
this is happening, and we'll

445
00:23:53 --> 00:23:55
click it back at the end, and
if we have a nice set up at any

446
00:23:55 --> 00:23:58
point, I'll just stop and we'll
go back and we'll

447
00:23:58 --> 00:24:01
look at it again.
 

448
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
Since, I think that's just not
going to happen right now.

449
00:24:05 --> 00:24:16
So let's switch, actually,
back to our notes.

450
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
So, ideally what we did see
was, in fact, it does have

451
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
enough energy with the UV lamp,
it wasn't a dramatic shift you

452
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
saw because we didn't start
very high and then it went

453
00:24:25 --> 00:24:26
to that stuck point.
 

454
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
But luckily we had the control
of the red laser pointer

455
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
where nothing moved at all.
 

456
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
So hopefully you're convinced
that your predictions worked

457
00:24:33 --> 00:24:38
well and you are able to
predict what's going on when

458
00:24:38 --> 00:24:43
you're looking at the
photoelectric effect.

459
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
So, it turns out that the
photoelectric effect is not the

460
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
only evidence for the fact that
light has these particle-like

461
00:24:50 --> 00:24:51
characteristics.
 

462
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
And one thing that Einstein put
forth is he figured if well,

463
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
what we're saying is that light
is, in fact, a stream of

464
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
particles, each one of those
particles or photons must,

465
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
therefore, have a momentum.
 

466
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
And that's really neat to think
about, because photons, of

467
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
course, are massless particles,
they have no mass, so it's neat

468
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
to think about something that
has no mass, but that actually

469
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
does have a momentum.
 

470
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
And the relationship that he
put forth is that the momentum

471
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
is equal to Planck's constant
times nu divided by the speed

472
00:25:22 --> 00:25:25
of light, or it's often more
useful for us to think about

473
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
it in terms of wavelength.
 

474
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
So, since the speed of light
equals lambda nu, we can

475
00:25:29 --> 00:25:34
say that momentum is equal
to h divided by lambda.

476
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
And there was experimental
evidence that came along that

477
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
supported this, and this is
called the Compton scattering

478
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
experiment, and this was done
by Arthur Compton, and

479
00:25:42 --> 00:25:47
basically what he did was he
took x-ray light, which had

480
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
some frequency, which was a
very high frequency because it

481
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
was x-rays, and he shot it at
a stationary electron.

482
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
And what he was able to observe
was that the electrons

483
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
scattered and now had some
momentum, and that both the

484
00:25:59 --> 00:26:06
frequency, and therefore, the
momentum of the light that he

485
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
shot in, went down once
it was scattered.

486
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
So what he's showing here is,
first of all, that the light

487
00:26:13 --> 00:26:16
has some momentum and when
it hits an electron it can

488
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
actually transfer some of that
momentum to the electron.

489
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
So the transfer of momentum
from a photon to an electron is

490
00:26:25 --> 00:26:28
what was being observed, and it
was seen as completely separate

491
00:26:28 --> 00:26:31
evidence to the photoelectric
effect that, yes, in fact,

492
00:26:31 --> 00:26:37
light is behaving in these
particle-like ways.

493
00:26:37 --> 00:26:40
So up to this point, before it
was really established that

494
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
yes, light is like a particle
sometimes, there was this very

495
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
strong distinction between what
is light and what is matter.

496
00:26:49 --> 00:26:52
And the distinction was when
we're talking about light,

497
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
light is a wave, and when we're
talking about matter, well,

498
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
matter is a particle.
 

499
00:26:56 --> 00:26:59
And these behave completely
separate, they don't overlap at

500
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
all in terms of behavior, but
then, of course, with the

501
00:27:02 --> 00:27:05
photoelectric effect with
Compton's scattering, what we

502
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
see is that, oh actually,
sometimes photons behave

503
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
as if they're particles.
 

504
00:27:11 --> 00:27:14
So now this relationship's
beginning to get a little bit

505
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
fuzzy in terms of what is the
difference between how we

506
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
treat light and matter.
 

507
00:27:19 --> 00:27:23
And actually, this was taken a
step further by Louis de

508
00:27:23 --> 00:27:28
Broglie who in his PhD thesis,
as part of his work as a

509
00:27:28 --> 00:27:33
graduate student, put forth the
idea that, OK, Einstein says,

510
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
and everyone agrees that, in
fact, light is particle-like at

511
00:27:37 --> 00:27:42
times, and light, in fact, of
course has a wavelength, and if

512
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
it has a wavelength we're
saying that it can

513
00:27:44 --> 00:27:45
have momentum.
 

514
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
And what de Broglie said is
well, if it's true that light,

515
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
which has a wavelength can have
momentum, then it must also be

516
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
true that matter, which has
momentum, also has

517
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
a wavelength.
 

518
00:27:58 --> 00:28:01
And you can look at this
in two different ways.

519
00:28:01 --> 00:28:04
One is that he's just
re-arranged an equation here

520
00:28:04 --> 00:28:09
and gotten both his PhD thesis
and a Nobel Prize, but I think

521
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
the more representative way to
think about this is the real

522
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
revolutionary idea that he put
forth, which is that matter can

523
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
actually behave as a wave.
 

524
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
And in terms of equations that
we use, it's sometimes easier

525
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
to plug in the fact, since
momentum is equal to

526
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
mass times velocity.
 

527
00:28:26 --> 00:28:29
We can know the wavelength
of any matter -- and he's

528
00:28:29 --> 00:28:31
not limiting this, for
example, to electrons.

529
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
What de Broglie is saying we
can know the wavelength of any

530
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
matter at all, as long as we
know its mass and

531
00:28:37 --> 00:28:38
it's velocity.
 

532
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
And Einstein credited de
Broglie, which is a fair

533
00:28:41 --> 00:28:44
statement of lifting a corner
of the great veil, because

534
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
really there was this
fundamental misunderstanding

535
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
about what the difference was
between matter and light, and

536
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
the reality is that they can
both be like-particles

537
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
and they can both show
characteristics of waves.

538
00:28:57 --> 00:29:01
So I mentioned, however, that
in terms of de Broglie's work.

539
00:29:01 --> 00:29:05
This was Nobel Prize worthy,
absolutely, but it was

540
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
also his PhD thesis.
 

541
00:29:07 --> 00:29:09
So, we can think about what
would happen if we're on his

542
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
thesis defense, we're on his
thesis committee, we would need

543
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
to think of some pretty mean,
hard, nasty questions to be

544
00:29:16 --> 00:29:18
asking de Broglie about this
theory -- that's what happens

545
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
when you defend your thesis.
 

546
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
This is necessary, it's hard
to find holes in a Nobel

547
00:29:23 --> 00:29:24
Prize worthy idea.
 

548
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
But let's just try maybe one of
the basic questions they could

549
00:29:27 --> 00:29:30
ask, and they can say, all
right, de Broglie, so you say

550
00:29:30 --> 00:29:34
that all matter, absolutely all
matter has wave-like behavior.

551
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
Why is it that we're never
observing this, for example,

552
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
why is it the table doesn't
defract as we bring

553
00:29:39 --> 00:29:40
it through the door?
 

554
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
Why don't we see the influence
of the wave-like behavior

555
00:29:45 --> 00:29:47
on every day matter?
 

556
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
So it turns out that he could
have picked anything to explain

557
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
this, and hopefully done
out the calculation, and

558
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
we'll do this ourselves.
 

559
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
And the example we'll pick is
considering, for example,

560
00:29:58 --> 00:29:59
a Matsuzaka fastball.
 

561
00:29:59 --> 00:30:05
So, many of you are new to the
Boston area, now I still

562
00:30:05 --> 00:30:08
realize, and I want to let you
know it's not required that you

563
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
be a Red Sox fan to be at MIT.
 

564
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
We do encourage it, however,
and in general, I find you

565
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
don't have to give up that old
team, you can keep your old

566
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
team, even if it's teams I
won't name, just keep

567
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
them to the side.
 

568
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
And you can join on to the Red
Sox nation on top of that, and

569
00:30:28 --> 00:30:30
part of being a good Red
Sox fan is knowing the

570
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
statistics of your team.
 

571
00:30:32 --> 00:30:34
For example, if we're talking
about a pitcher, like

572
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
Matsuzaka, we might want to
know the speed of his

573
00:30:37 --> 00:30:38
average fastball.
 

574
00:30:38 --> 00:30:39
We might want to know his ERA.
 

575
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
If you're really into it and
you're at MIT, maybe you want

576
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
to know the wavelength of
these average fastballs.

577
00:30:47 --> 00:30:50
So, let's go ahead
and look at that.

578
00:30:50 --> 00:30:52
So, if we're trying to figure
out the wavelength of a

579
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
Matsuzaka fastball, we need to
consider the velocity first,

580
00:30:56 --> 00:30:58
which is 42 miles per hour.
 

581
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
We don't usually do our
chemistry calculations in miles

582
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
per hour, so let's switch that
to 42 meters per second, so

583
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
it's -- sorry, it's
94 miles per hour.

584
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
And we can use the de Broglie
relationship that wavelength

585
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
should be equal to h
over mass times volume.

586
00:31:15 --> 00:31:19
And we can put up here Planck's
constant -- and I want to make

587
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
note that instead of writing
joules per second, I actually

588
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
wrote out with a joule is.
 

589
00:31:24 --> 00:31:28
A joule is a kilogram meter
squared per second squared.

590
00:31:28 --> 00:31:31
Occasionally, you'll find you
need to cancel out units,

591
00:31:31 --> 00:31:33
because, of course, you're
always doing unit analysis as

592
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
you solve your problems, and
sometimes you'll need to

593
00:31:36 --> 00:31:38
convert joules to kilogram
meters square per

594
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
second squared.
 

595
00:31:40 --> 00:31:45
We divide that by the mass, so
0.12 kilograms, that's the mass

596
00:31:45 --> 00:31:49
of a regulation baseball for
the major leagues, and the

597
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
velocity of the baseball
is 42 meters per second.

598
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
So, we can cross out our units
doing our unit analysis.

599
00:31:55 --> 00:32:00
The seconds cross out, the
kilograms cross out, one of the

600
00:32:00 --> 00:32:02
meters crosses out from the
top, so we're left with

601
00:32:02 --> 00:32:04
an answer in meters.
 

602
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
It's always good when we're
looking for a wavelength that

603
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
our answer is in a unit
of length, that's a

604
00:32:09 --> 00:32:10
good sign already.
 

605
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
And what we find out is the
wavelength of a Matsuzaka

606
00:32:12 --> 00:32:20
fastball is 1.1 times
10 to the -31 meters.

607
00:32:20 --> 00:32:24
So, this is really small,
this is undetectably small.

608
00:32:24 --> 00:32:28
And especially when we consider
it, what tends to be important

609
00:32:28 --> 00:32:31
is the size of wavelength
in relationship to

610
00:32:31 --> 00:32:32
its environment.
 

611
00:32:32 --> 00:32:37
So 1.1 times 10 to the -31
meters is not, in fact, a

612
00:32:37 --> 00:32:40
significant number when we're
comparing it, for example, to

613
00:32:40 --> 00:32:43
the length of a ball, or the
size of the baseball field.

614
00:32:43 --> 00:32:46
So that would probably be de
Broglie's answer for why, in

615
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51
fact, we're not observing the
wavelength behavior of material

616
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
on a day-to-day life.
 

617
00:32:54 --> 00:32:59
So, that's for Matsuzaka, and
even if you don't memorize all

618
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
the wavelengths for
all the pitchers.

619
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
I would expect, whether you're
a Red Sox fan or not, you to be

620
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
able to look at a list of
different pitchers and their

621
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
average velocity for their
fastball, and tell me who

622
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
has the longest or the
shortest wavelength.

623
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
You should all be able to
know that relationship.

624
00:33:15 --> 00:33:19
So why don't we go to a clicker
question here, and see

625
00:33:19 --> 00:33:22
if you can tell us this.
 

626
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
So we have 4 different pitchers
we're showing here -- they

627
00:33:26 --> 00:33:27
all have different strengths.
 

628
00:33:27 --> 00:33:30
It's not always how fast you
throw the fastball, sometimes

629
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
it's your different styles or
the different ways that you

630
00:33:35 --> 00:33:36
decide when to throw what.
 

631
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
So, first we have Matsuzaka
at 94 miles per hour.

632
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
So, click one if you think
that he's going to have

633
00:33:43 --> 00:33:44
the longest wavelength.
 

634
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
Tim Wakefield on the DL right
now throws a lot slower,

635
00:33:48 --> 00:33:51
because he has that tricky
knuckle ball, he doesn't

636
00:33:51 --> 00:33:53
need to throw as fast.
 

637
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
Then we have Beckett who
can get up 96 just on

638
00:33:56 --> 00:33:57
a regular old day.
 

639
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
And Timlin who is about
91 miles per hour,

640
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
one of our relievers.
 

641
00:34:03 --> 00:34:05
So, why don't you take
ten seconds to do that.

642
00:34:05 --> 00:34:10
If you can't decide, Timlin is
my favorite ever, so that would

643
00:34:10 --> 00:34:14
be a good back up choice if
you forgot the relationship

644
00:34:14 --> 00:34:23
between wavelength and the
relationship between speed.

645
00:34:23 --> 00:34:25
It looks like, in fact,
people did not forget that

646
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
relationship, and only
1% of you humored me.

647
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
So, let's see what the correct
answer is, and it is, in fact,

648
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
Wakefield, right, because
there's an inverse relationship

649
00:34:37 --> 00:34:40
between how fast a particle is
going and what its

650
00:34:40 --> 00:34:41
wavelength is.
 

651
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
So, in terms of wavelength,
Wakefield has the largest

652
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
wavelength, but in terms of
being significant, we're

653
00:34:49 --> 00:34:51
still not even close.
 

654
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
It's still undetectably small.
 

655
00:34:52 --> 00:34:52
Yes.
 

656
00:34:52 --> 00:35:00
STUDENT: Why doesn't wavelength
go to infinity as it stops,

657
00:35:00 --> 00:35:05
like a standing [INAUDIBLE].
 

658
00:35:05 --> 00:35:06
PROFESSOR: As it stops.
 

659
00:35:06 --> 00:35:07
So, let's think.
 

660
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
I would think that it would
approach inifinity, and I would

661
00:35:11 --> 00:35:13
need to think about it and get
back to you in terms of why we

662
00:35:13 --> 00:35:15
don't actually hit it and
see something with an

663
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
infinite wavelength.
 

664
00:35:18 --> 00:35:20
I'm sure there's some upper
limit as there are to most

665
00:35:20 --> 00:35:22
things, like if we think of
wavelengths and different types

666
00:35:22 --> 00:35:27
of light, there is so large
that you can get, but you would

667
00:35:27 --> 00:35:31
be approaching that level.
 

668
00:35:31 --> 00:35:32
All right.
 

669
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
So we can switch back actually
to our notes here --

670
00:35:36 --> 00:35:37
oh, do we have--?
 

671
00:35:37 --> 00:35:38
OK.
 

672
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
We're going to just try
this one more time just

673
00:35:40 --> 00:35:41
so you can see it.
 

674
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
It'll still likely get stuck in
that spot, but we'll just show

675
00:35:44 --> 00:35:51
you one more time the effects
of the UV light, and actually

676
00:35:51 --> 00:35:53
we'll throw in an extra
trick here, too.

677
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
We know that UV light gets
absorbed by glass, so

678
00:35:56 --> 00:35:58
it shouldn't be able to
go through the glass.

679
00:35:58 --> 00:36:03
So first if Professor Drennen
can try it through the glass,

680
00:36:03 --> 00:36:05
and we see nothing's happening.
 

681
00:36:05 --> 00:36:11
Let's move the glass away.
 

682
00:36:11 --> 00:36:12
All right.
 

683
00:36:12 --> 00:36:13
[APPLAUSE]
 

684
00:36:13 --> 00:36:20
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

685
00:36:20 --> 00:36:21
Good.
 

686
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
So we can fully believe what
our calculations were now,

687
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
which is a nice thing to do.
 

688
00:36:26 --> 00:36:29
Let's go back to considering
the wavelengths of

689
00:36:29 --> 00:36:30
different objects.
 

690
00:36:30 --> 00:36:33
We considered a baseball,
but let's also think

691
00:36:33 --> 00:36:35
about now an electron.
 

692
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
And an electron is something
where, in fact, we might be

693
00:36:39 --> 00:36:43
able to, if we calculate it
and see how that works out,

694
00:36:43 --> 00:36:46
actually observe some of
its wave-like properties.

695
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
So, if we do this calculation
for an electron, saying it

696
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
moves at 10 to the 5 meters per
second, then what we end up

697
00:36:54 --> 00:36:59
with for a wavelength is 7
times 10 to the -9 meters.

698
00:36:59 --> 00:37:02
A lot of times we talk about
these kind of distances either

699
00:37:02 --> 00:37:05
in nanometers or in angstroms
so we can say this

700
00:37:05 --> 00:37:06
is 70 angstroms.
 

701
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
So this is, first of all, even
just on an absolute scale, this

702
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
is way, way larger than the
wavelengths we're talking

703
00:37:13 --> 00:37:15
about for baseball.
 

704
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
In addition, if we compare this
to the diameter of an atom,

705
00:37:19 --> 00:37:21
which is on the order of
somewhere between one and ten

706
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
angstroms, now we're seeing
that, in fact, this wavelength

707
00:37:25 --> 00:37:28
is significantly larger
than its environment.

708
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
So certainly we would expect
to see that it has an effect

709
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
in terms of seeing its
wave-like properties.

710
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
And this was experimentally
validated, hopefully,

711
00:37:41 --> 00:37:44
even more clearly than
our experiment here.

712
00:37:44 --> 00:37:47
And at first this was done by
Davidson and Germer, and they

713
00:37:47 --> 00:37:53
were American scientists who
tried defracting electrons

714
00:37:53 --> 00:37:54
from a nickel crystal.
 

715
00:37:54 --> 00:37:57
They did this in Bell
Laboratories, and they

716
00:37:57 --> 00:37:59
found that, in fact, the
electronis did defract.

717
00:37:59 --> 00:38:00
And G.P.
 

718
00:38:00 --> 00:38:02
Thompson showed a
similar thing.

719
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
What he did was he defracted
electrons through a very thin

720
00:38:05 --> 00:38:14
gold foil, and this is a
picture -- oops, that is not.

721
00:38:14 --> 00:38:14
OK.
 

722
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
It is a picture from your book
here showing the defraction

723
00:38:19 --> 00:38:22
pattern of an electron going
through that gold foil.

724
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
So, you can see that, in fact,
it's confirmed that an electron

725
00:38:27 --> 00:38:31
can have both wavelength
and particle-like behavior.

726
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
And it turns out that Davidson
and Thompson shared a Nobel

727
00:38:35 --> 00:38:38
Prize for this discovery
of seeing the wave-like

728
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
behavior of electrons.
 

729
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
So, this is actually kind of
neat to point out, because

730
00:38:44 --> 00:38:45
we all remember J.J.
 

731
00:38:45 --> 00:38:48
Thomson from our second
lecture, and J.J.

732
00:38:48 --> 00:38:52
Thomson got a Nobel Prize
in 1906 for showing that

733
00:38:52 --> 00:38:54
electrons exist in that
they are particles.

734
00:38:54 --> 00:38:55
And it turns out that G.P.
 

735
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
Thompson, well, that's his son,
so we can actually think of

736
00:38:59 --> 00:39:01
this -- and I'm sure this
wasn't the case, but I like to

737
00:39:01 --> 00:39:04
think of it as a little
bit of child rebelling

738
00:39:04 --> 00:39:05
against the father.
 

739
00:39:05 --> 00:39:08
So, the father gets a Nobel
Prize for showing that an

740
00:39:08 --> 00:39:11
electron is a particle, and
the son says, well, what

741
00:39:11 --> 00:39:12
can I do to top that?
 

742
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
I'm going to show
the exact opposite.

743
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
I'm going to say that an
electron's a wave no matter

744
00:39:17 --> 00:39:19
how much my father says
differently, and I'm going

745
00:39:19 --> 00:39:22
to get a Nobel Prize
for that, and he does.

746
00:39:22 --> 00:39:25
But the nice part of the
story is, it turns out

747
00:39:25 --> 00:39:26
they're both right.
 

748
00:39:26 --> 00:39:29
An electron is a particle, but
an electron's also a wave.

749
00:39:29 --> 00:39:32
So, father and son, happy
ending, they both have

750
00:39:32 --> 00:39:33
their Noble prizes.
 

751
00:39:33 --> 00:39:39
So, what happens now that
we, in fact, know that

752
00:39:39 --> 00:39:40
matter is a wave?
 

753
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43
Well, this allows us to try
to go back and explain some

754
00:39:43 --> 00:39:46
phenomena that over the years,
mounting evidence was building

755
00:39:46 --> 00:39:48
that couldn't be explained.
 

756
00:39:48 --> 00:39:51
So, for example, when people,
and we'll talk about this

757
00:39:51 --> 00:39:54
next class, were looking at
different characteristics

758
00:39:54 --> 00:39:57
spectra of different atoms,
what they were seeing is that

759
00:39:57 --> 00:40:00
it appeared to be these very
discreet lines that were

760
00:40:00 --> 00:40:05
allowed or not allowed for the
different atoms to emit, but

761
00:40:05 --> 00:40:07
they had no way to explain this
using classical physics.

762
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
And it turns out that the
Schrodinger equation is an

763
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
equation of motion in which
you're describing a particle

764
00:40:17 --> 00:40:20
by describing it as a wave.
 

765
00:40:20 --> 00:40:23
So you're basically having a
wave equation for a particle,

766
00:40:23 --> 00:40:25
and for our purposes we're
talking about a very

767
00:40:25 --> 00:40:26
particular particle.
 

768
00:40:26 --> 00:40:29
What we're interested
in is the electron.

769
00:40:29 --> 00:40:31
So basically describing
electrons by their

770
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
wave-like properties.
 

771
00:40:35 --> 00:40:38
And this is Erwin Schrodinger,
and this is the equation that

772
00:40:38 --> 00:40:43
he put forth where we have h
hat psi being equal to e psi.

773
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
So, let's explain
what these are.

774
00:40:47 --> 00:40:52
So this symbol here is actually
what we call a wave function.

775
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
That doesn't mean a whole lot
in itself, it will mean more in

776
00:40:55 --> 00:40:57
about two lectures from now.
 

777
00:40:57 --> 00:40:59
But right now, what I want you
to be thinking of a wave

778
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
function as is just some
representation of an electron.

779
00:41:03 --> 00:41:06
So, it's some way of
describing an electron.

780
00:41:06 --> 00:41:09
Specifically, we'll talk more
about this, it's talking about

781
00:41:09 --> 00:41:12
different orbitals, it's the
spatial part of an orbital.

782
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
But before we get to that, in
terms of thinking just think,

783
00:41:15 --> 00:41:17
OK, this is representing my
particle, this is representing

784
00:41:17 --> 00:41:20
my electron that's what
the wave function is.

785
00:41:20 --> 00:41:24
This e term here is the energy,
or in our case when we talk

786
00:41:24 --> 00:41:28
about an electron in a hydrogen
atom, for example, the binding

787
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
energy of that electron
to the nucleus.

788
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
So, e is binding energy.
 

789
00:41:35 --> 00:41:38
And h with the carrot or the
hat here, well, that carrot or

790
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
hat tell us it must be an
operator, and this is called

791
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
the Hamiltonian operator.
 

792
00:41:44 --> 00:41:48
So when you operate on the wave
function, what you end up with

793
00:41:48 --> 00:41:51
is getting the binding energy
of the electron, and the

794
00:41:51 --> 00:41:55
wave function back out.
 

795
00:41:55 --> 00:41:59
When we need to describe the
wave function term a little bit

796
00:41:59 --> 00:42:02
more specifically so we can
describe, for example, the

797
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
position of the electron, and I
just want to mention that we do

798
00:42:06 --> 00:42:09
have two choices if we're
trying to describe this, we

799
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
could use cartesian
coordinates, or we could use

800
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
polar coordinates where we're
either talking about x y z

801
00:42:15 --> 00:42:17
or r theta and phi.
 

802
00:42:17 --> 00:42:20
So, I just want to point out
that when you look at wave

803
00:42:20 --> 00:42:23
functions, we are going to be
using those spherical polar

804
00:42:23 --> 00:42:26
coordinates, and the reason is
because a very important

805
00:42:26 --> 00:42:28
interaction here is the
interaction between the

806
00:42:28 --> 00:42:31
electron and the nucleus, which
we want to describe the

807
00:42:31 --> 00:42:33
distance of in terms of r.
 

808
00:42:33 --> 00:42:36
So, you can see, it's much
easier to describe that as

809
00:42:36 --> 00:42:40
one term, r here, instead
of using both y and z.

810
00:42:40 --> 00:42:43
Another reason I wanted to
point this out in terms of the

811
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
polar coordinates that we're
using, is I think they're

812
00:42:46 --> 00:42:48
actually flipped from
what you're used to

813
00:42:48 --> 00:42:49
seeing in physics.
 

814
00:42:49 --> 00:42:53
Sometimes different disciplines
have different conventions,

815
00:42:53 --> 00:42:55
which can be very confusing
because the whole point of

816
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
what's happening now is there's
so much interplay between

817
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
different disciplines, but
still I think this might be one

818
00:43:01 --> 00:43:06
remaining one where in our case
theta is that distance from z,

819
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
that angle there, where phi is
this distance or angle

820
00:43:10 --> 00:43:11
from the x-axis.
 

821
00:43:11 --> 00:43:13
So just keep it in mind
that it's flipped.

822
00:43:13 --> 00:43:17
It turns out we won't really
using it, needing to identify

823
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
it on the graph so
much in chemistry.

824
00:43:20 --> 00:43:22
We'll be using the solutions,
so you shouldn't have a

825
00:43:22 --> 00:43:24
problem, but I wanted to
point it out so it does not

826
00:43:24 --> 00:43:27
look too strange to you.
 

827
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
In terms of the Schrodinger
equation, we now can

828
00:43:30 --> 00:43:33
write it in terms of our
polar coordinates here.

829
00:43:33 --> 00:43:38
So we have the operation on the
wave function in terms of r,

830
00:43:38 --> 00:43:41
theta, and phi and remember
this e is just our binding

831
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
energy for the electron, and we
get back out this

832
00:43:44 --> 00:43:46
wave function.
 

833
00:43:46 --> 00:43:50
So, you might ask, this looks
pretty simple up here, right,

834
00:43:50 --> 00:43:52
just with that h hat.
 

835
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
It turns out, we can
write it out fully.

836
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
It's three different second
derivatives in terms of the

837
00:43:57 --> 00:44:00
three different parameters.
 

838
00:44:00 --> 00:44:02
It's a little bit complicated.
 

839
00:44:02 --> 00:44:05
You won't have to solve it in
this class, you can wait till

840
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
you get to 18.03 to start
solving these types of

841
00:44:07 --> 00:44:10
differential equations, and
hopefully, you'll all want the

842
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
pleasure of actually solving
the Schrodinger equation

843
00:44:14 --> 00:44:15
at some point.
 

844
00:44:15 --> 00:44:19
So, just keep taking chemistry,
you'll already have had 18.03

845
00:44:19 --> 00:44:22
by that point and you'll have
the opportunity to do that.

846
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
What I want to point out also
is that this h hat, the

847
00:44:26 --> 00:44:29
Hamiltonian operator written
out for the simplest case we

848
00:44:29 --> 00:44:32
can even imagine, which is a
hydrogen atom where we only

849
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
have one electron that we're
dealing with, and of

850
00:44:35 --> 00:44:36
course, one nucleus.
 

851
00:44:36 --> 00:44:38
So you can imagine it's just
going to get more and more

852
00:44:38 --> 00:44:43
complicated as we get to other
types of atoms, and of course,

853
00:44:43 --> 00:44:44
molecules from there.
 

854
00:44:44 --> 00:44:46
So, we just want to appreciate
that what we'll be using in

855
00:44:46 --> 00:44:49
this class is, in fact, the
solutions to the Schrodinger

856
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
equation, and just so you can
be fully thankful for not

857
00:44:53 --> 00:44:56
having to necessarily solve
these as we jump into the

858
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59
solutions and just knowing that
they're out there and you'll

859
00:44:59 --> 00:45:02
get to solve it at some point,
hopefully, in your careers.

860
00:45:02 --> 00:45:04
So, we'll pick up with that,
with some of the solutions

861
00:45:04 --> 00:45:07
and starting to talk
about energies on Friday.

862
00:45:07 --> 00:45:08
