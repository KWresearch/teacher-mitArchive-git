5.111 Lecture Summary #29 
Transition Metals 
Topic: Crystal Field Theory Continued, and Magnetism 

Chapter 16 p 631-637 

Magnetism

Compounds possessing unpaired electrons are paramagnetic (attracted by magnetic field); those

in which the electrons are paired are diamagnetic (repelled by magnetic field).


Crystal Field Theory: Octahedral Case (See Lecture #28)

Crystal Field Theory: Tetrahedral Case

The tetrahedral crystal field splitting energy (∆T) is smaller than for octahedral complexes

because the point charges are not directed at any orbital set.

Geometry of tetrahedral complexes result in greater orbital destabilization for dyz, dxz, dxy  than for 
dx  -y
2  and dz
2 (opposite of octahedral).  There is more repulsion between the ligand negative point 
2 
charges and the d-orbitals that are 45° off axis (dyz, dxz, dxy) than there is between the ligand 
negative point charges and the d-orbitals that are on axis (dz
2  and dx  -y
2).  dyz, dxz, dxy  have the 
2
same energy with respect to each other (degenerate). dz
2  and dx  -y
2 have the same energy with 
2
respect to each other (degenerate).

Again, ∆T is smaller than ∆o  because the point charges are not directed at any orbital set in a 
tetrahedral crystal field.  Because ∆T is small, many tetrahedral complexes are high spin.  You 
can assume that they are all high spin. 

Because the overall energy in the tetrahedral crystal field is maintained, t2  orbitals (dxy, dxz, and 
dyz) go up in energy by 2/5, and the e orbitals (dx  -y
2  and dz
2) go down in energy by 3/5.

(Square planar crystal field) 

The overall energy of the square planar crystal field is maintained as well, but the relative 
energies of each of the d-orbitals are more complicated and you are not expected to know them. 

Putting it all together: If a Ni2+  (d8) center in an enzyme is found to be diamagnetic, does it have 
square planar, tetrahedral, or octahedral geometry?
