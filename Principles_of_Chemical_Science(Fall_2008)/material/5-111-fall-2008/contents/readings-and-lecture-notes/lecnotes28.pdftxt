Today’s material 

Crystal field and ligand field theories were developed to explain the special properties of 
coordination complexes of transition metals. 

Basic idea behind theories: 
When a metal ion with a given formal oxidation number is placed at the center of a 
coordination sphere defined by a set of ligands, the energy levels of the d orbitals housing 
the metal electrons are altered from those in the free metal ions. 

Crystal field theory is based on an ionic description of the metal-ligand bond. 

Ligand field theory includes covalent as well as ionic aspects of coordination.  It is a more 
powerful description of transition metal complexes.  It is, however, beyond the scope of this 
course.  (Take 5.03 if you are interested in this topic). 

Crystal Field Theory considers ligands as negative point charges and considers the repulsion 
between the negative point charges and the d-orbitals.

Ligand (L) point charges are directed toward the dz

a large repulsion.  The dz

Ligand point charges are directed in between dxy, dxz, and dyz  orbitals (not directly toward them). 
The dxy, dxz, and dyz  orbitals are stabilized relative to dz
2 orbitals, and they are stabilized

by the same amount (i.e. dxy, dxz, and dyz  orbitals are degenerate).

average energy of d orbitals with

(Spherical crystal field) 

∆o is the overall splitting between eg  and t2g  orbitals = octahedral field splitting energy 
("o" in ∆o is for octahedral) 

Because the overall energy is maintained, the energy of the three t2g  orbitals are lowered by (2/5) 
∆o and the energy of the two eg  orbitals are raised by (3/5) ∆o relative to the spherical crystal field.

(c) draw octahedral crystal field splitting diagram 

There are two possible octahedral crystal field splitting diagrams for Mn3+: one for the case 
where the magnitude of ∆o  is greater than the pairing energy (PE), and one for the case where it 
is less.  Pairing energy is the energy of the electron-electron repulsion.

∆o is small (weak octahedral field), 
(∆o<PE).  Electrons are placed singly with 
parallel spins to the fullest possible extent in 
both t2g  and eg  orbitals. 
This arrangement of electrons gives 
the maximum number of unpaired 
electrons (high spin). 

∆o is large (strong octahedral field) 
( ∆o >PE). Electrons are paired in lower 
energy t2g  orbitals.  eg  orbitals are not 
occupied until t2g  orbitals are filled. 
This arrangement of electrons gives 
the minimum number of unpaired 
electrons (low spin). 

NOTE: Mn3+  in [Mn(H2O)6]Cl3  is high spin, why? We will come back to this.
