I.  FREEE ENERGY OF FORMATION, ∆Gf  (continued from Lecture #17) 
∆Gfº is a measure of a compound’s stability relative to its elements.


If ∆Gfº <  0, a compound is thermodynamically _________________ relative to its elements.

If ∆Gfº >  0, a compound is thermodynamically _________________ relative to its elements.


∆Gfº = 124 kJ/mol

6C(gr) + 3H2(g) → C6H6(l) 
C6H6(l) → 6C(gr) + 3H2(g) 
∆Gº = –124 kJ/mol

The reverse reaction spontaneous, but very, very slow!


Free energy tells whether or not a reaction will happen spontaneously, but tells us 
______________ about the rate of the reaction (for rate information we need kinetics). 

To calculate ∆G° for a reaction… 
∆Gr° = Σ∆Gf°(products) - Σ∆Gf°(reactants) 
∆Gr° = ∆Hr° – T∆Sr° 
OR 

II.  EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON SPONTANEITY 
Consider the decomposition of sodium bicarbonate at 298 versus 450. K. 
2NaHCO3(s) → Na2CO3(s) + CO2(g) + H2O(g) 
∆Sº = ________ kJ/(K•mol) 
∆Hº = 135.6 kJ/mol 
∆Gr° = ∆Hr° – T(∆Sr°)

At T = 298K 

∆Gº = ________-298(________) = ________ kJ/mol 
The reaction is ______________________ at room temperature. 

But at baking temperatures of 350ºF or 450.K 
∆Gº = 135.6 – ________ (0.334) = ________ kJ/mol 
The reaction is ______________________ at baking temperature. 
•	 When ∆Hº and ∆Sº have same sign, it is possible to control spontaneity with T. 
•	 Assuming  that  ∆Hº  and  ∆Sº  are  independent  of  T,  a  reasonable  first-order 
assumption, then ∆Gº is a _____________ function of T. 

∆Gº = ∆Hº – T∆Sº 

Calculate T* (at which ∆Gº = ____) for the decomposition of sodium bicarbonate. 
∆Gº = ∆Hº – T∆Sº 
0 = ∆Hº – T*∆Sº 
T*  = _____________ 
T*  = ___________________ = __________ 

Consider the plot of temperature dependence when both ∆Hº and ∆Sº are negative,

∆Gº = ∆Hº – T∆Sº

∆Gº < 0 at ________


∆Hº > 0  ∆Sº < 0  _______________ spontaneous 

∆Gº > 0 at ________


∆Hº > 0  ∆Sº > 0  _______________ spontaneous 

∆Gº < 0 when T ____ T*


∆Hº < 0  ∆Sº < 0  _______________ spontaneous 

∆Gº < 0 when T ____ T*


III. THERMODYNAMICS IN BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS 
A) ATP-COUPLED REACTIONS 
Many biological reactions are non-spontaneous, meaning they require energy to 
proceed in the forward direction. 
The hydrolysis of ATP (ATP → ADP), a spontaneous process, can be ______________ 
to a non-spontaneous reaction to drive the reaction forward. 

The resulting ∆Gº of the coupled reaction is the sum of the individual ∆Gº values. 
First, let’s calculate the ∆Gº for ATP hydrolysis at 310 K (body temperature). 
∆S° = +22 J/K•mol 
∆H° = -24 kJ/mol (from Lecture #17)

Note:  the  calculated  free  energies  are  under  standard  conditions.  This  is  an 
approximation since these molecules are NOT under standard conditions in cells. 

Example of an ATP-coupled reaction: the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-P. 
Adding  a phosphate  (P)  group  to glucose gives  the glucose  a negative  charge, which
prevents  the  glucose  molecule  from  diffusing  back  out  of  the  cell  through  the
“greasy” cell membrane.

∆Gº  = +17 kJ/mol for glucose to glucose-6-P 
∆Gº  = ________ kJ/mol for ATP hydrolysis 
An enzyme couples the glucose-to-glucose-6-P reaction to ATP hydrolysis. 
The net change in free energy = 

If ATP hydrolysis is spontaneous, why is it not occurring unregulated in the cell? 
KINETICS!  A  reaction  can  be  thermodynamically  spontaneous,  but  kinetically  very
very slow.

B) HYDROGEN BONDING 
A hydrogen bond  is an  electrostatic  interaction between a hydrogen atom  in a polar
bond  (typically  a H-F, H-O  or H-N  bond)  and  a  “hydrogen-bond donor”,  a  strongly 
electronegative atom.
