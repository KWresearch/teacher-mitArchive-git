Case 2.  Octet deficient molecules 
 

Some  molecules  are  stable  with  an  incomplete  octet.  Group  13  elements  ____  and 
_____ have this property. 

Consider BF3

FCB = 3 – 0 – (½)(8) = -1 

FCFDB = 7 – ____ – (½)(____) = _______ 

FCF = 7 – ____ – (½)(____) = _______ 

assign two electrons per bond. 

24 – 8 = 16 lone pair electrons  


But experiments suggest that all three B-F bonds have the same length, that of a 
______________ bond. 

F 
F  B  F 

FCB = 3 – 0 – (½)(6) = 0 
FCF = 7 – 6 – (½)(2) = 0 

The formal charges are more favorable for this structure. 

Case 3.  Valence shell expansion 
 

Elements  with  n  =  or  >  3  have  empty  ____  - orbitals,  which  means  more  than  eight 
electrons can fit around the central atom. 

Expanded  valence  shells  are  more  common  when  the  central  atom  is  ______  and  is 
bonded to small, highly electronegative atoms such as O, F, and Cl.

II.  IONIC BONDS 
Ionic bonds involve the complete _____________ of (one or more) electrons from one 
atom to another with a bond resulting from the electrostatic attraction between the 
cation and anion. 

Consider the formation of NaCl from the neutral atoms, Na and Cl. 

Na (g) 
Cl + e– 

Na+ (g) + e– 
Cl– (g) 

∆E = ______ = 494 kJ/mol 
∆E = – EA = _____ kJ/mol 

Na (g) + Cl (g) 

Na+ (g) + Cl– (g) 

∆E = + ________ kJ/mol 

∆E = IENa + (– EACl) = 145 kJ/mol 

Problem: Na (g) + Cl (g) ⇒ Na+ (g) + Cl– (g) has a positive ∆E.  It ___________ energy. 

Solution: Coulomb attraction. 
Na+ (g) + Cl– (g) 
NaCl (g) 
Net change in energy for the overall process: 

∆E = – 589 kJ/mol 

Na (g) + Cl (g) 

NaCl (g) 

∆E = __________ kJ/mol 

The mutual attraction between the oppositely-charged ions releases energy. The net 
energy change for the formation of NaCl is a decrease in energy. 

We can calculate the Coulomb attraction based on the distance between the two ions 
(assume here that the ions are point charges): 

U(r)  = 

z 1z 2e 2 
4πε0r 

for 2 unlike charges,
z = charge numbers of the ions and
e = absolute value of the charge of an e- (1.602 X 10-19 C) 

Calculate U(r) for Na+ and Cl-.  NaCl has a bond length (r) = 2.36Å.

Convert to kJ/mol 

U(r) = -9.774 x 10-19 J x _________ x _______________ = 

Simple ionic model predicts: 

∆E = -∆Ed = - 444 kJ/mol 

Experiments measure: 

∆E = -∆Ed = - 411 kJ/mol 

ignored repulsive interactions. Result:_________ ∆Ed than experimental value. 

The discrepancy results from the following approximations:

III.  POLAR COVALENT BONDS 
Perfectly-ionic  and  perfectly-covalent  bonds  are  the  two  extremes  of  bonding.  In 
reality, most bonds fall somewhere in the middle. 

A  polar  covalent  bond  is  an  ____________  sharing  of  electrons  between  two  atoms 
with different electronegativities (χ). 

Consider H-Cl versus H-H (Pauling electronegativity values are given): 

H – Cl 

χH = 2.2 

χCl = 3.2 

Hδ+– Clδ– 

where δ is fraction of a full charge (e) that is asymmetrically distributed. 

H – H 

H2 is a “perfectly” covalent bond, δ = 0.

Dipole moment 

Asymmetric  charge  distribution  results  in  an  electric  dipole,  two  unlike  charges 
separated by a finite distance. 

(cid:71)
We can quantify charge separation by defining a dipole moment,  µ .
