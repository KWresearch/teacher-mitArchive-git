Le Chatelier's Principle - when a stress is applied to a system in equilibrium, the equilibrium tends to 

adjust to minimize the effect of the stress.


Increasing the temperature can cause reaction to shift in endothermic direction.

increase temperature, easier to overcome 
Ea,r.  Equilibrium shifts toward reactants in 
the exothermic reaction. 

most molecules have enough energy to overcome small barriers 
increasing temperature allows more molecules to overcome larger barriers 

Recall, a large Ea  means that the rate constant is very sensitive to changes in temperature. 

Big Ea  - increasing the temperature makes a _______ difference 

Small Ea  - increasing the temperature does not make much of a difference.

Kinetics of Catalysis 

35.2 

A catalyst is a substance that takes part in a chemical reaction and speeds it up, but doesn't undergo any 
permanent change itself. 

Catalysts, therefore, don't appear in the overall balanced equation. 

energy barrier 
without catalysts 

energy barrier 
with catalysts 

Catalysts typically act by 
reducing the activation energy 
barrier, both for the forward and
reverse reactions. 

Catalysts stabilize the 
activated complex or the 
transition state.

Catalysts have no effect on the thermodynamics of the reaction. 

Free energy, ∆G, is a state function, independent of path, therefore the equilibrium constant is 
______________________ by the presence of a catalyst. 

An inhibitor is the opposite of a catalyst.  It slows the rate of a reaction, typically by increasing the 
activation energy. 

Types of Catalysts 

Homogeneous catalysts: reactants and catalysts are in the same phase 
Example: chlorofluocarbons catalyze the depletion of O3  (all gas phase) 

35.3 

Heterogeneous catalysts: different phase 
Example: catalytic converter 
Solid metals (platinum, palladium, and rhodium) catalyze oxidation of hydrocarbons and CO gases and 
the reduction of nitrogen oxide gases to reduce pollution. 

Catalysts of Life: enzymes 

An enzyme is a large protein molecule (typically 20,000 g/mol or more) that is capable of carrying out 
a specific reaction or series of reactions.

Enzyme catalysis

Reactant molecules are called substrates.


Substrates bind to an active site on the enzyme.

At high [S], adding more substrate 
_______________ change the rate much. 
Rates level off. Enzyme is saturated.
All active sites on enzyme are filled. 

At low [S], adding more substrate 
_____________the rate significantly.
Lots of free enzyme is available.

Definition of Km  ≡ concentration of [S] for which the rate is half-maximal. 

Example: The conversion of CO2  in blood to HCO3  and H3O+  is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic 
-
anhydrase. The Michaelis-Menten constants for this enzyme and substrate are Km  = 8 x 10-5  M and 
k2  = 6 x 105 s-1. What is the maximum reaction rate if the enzyme concentration is 5 x 10-6  M? 

Enzyme Inhibition

If an inhibitor is bound in the active site, then substrate can't bind.

Many pharmaceutical drugs work by blocking the action of enzymes.  Enzymes catalyze reactions by 
stabilizing the "transition state" of the reaction.  Compounds that resemble the _______________ 
should bind more tightly to the enzyme than reactants or products.  These compounds can therefore 
serve as enzyme inhibitors (drugs). 

Example: Protease inhibitors are used in treatment of HIV.  Enzymes that cleave peptide bonds are 
called proteases.  Overall mechanism of peptide bond cleavage - a type of displacement reaction: 
Molecules with a stable tetrahedral atom at cleavage site will resemble the transition state and could 
bind more tightly to the enzyme than substrate does.

Knowledge of reaction mechanism can lead to design of new therapeutic treatments.  Interesting and 
important question - why doesn't this compound block all proteases? A second consideration is 
specificity.  Tight binding is just one facet of drug design. Also must consider specificity and delivery.
