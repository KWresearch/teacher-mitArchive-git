Acid/Base Equilibrium Continued

From Friday’s handout 

23.1 

Acid buffer action: The weak acid, HA, transfers protons to OH- ions supplied by strong base.

The conjugate base, A-, of the weak acid accepts protons from the H3O+  ions supplied by a strong acid.


A strong acid and the salt of its conjugate base don't make a good buffer. Why?


Base Buffer Example: NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4
+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

When strong acid is added, NH3  accepts protons from incoming acid to make NH4
+  donates a proton to form NH3  and H2O.  pH remains the same.

Base buffer action: The weak base, B, accepts protons supplied by strong acid.

The conjugate acid, BH+, of the weak base transfers protons to the OH- ions supplied by a strong base.


A buffer is a mixture of weak conjugate acids and bases that stabilize the pH of a solution by providing 

a source or sink for protons.


Sample Buffer Problem: Suppose 1.00 mol of HCOOH and 0.500 mol of NaHCOO are added to water 
and diluted to 1.0 L. Calculate the pH. (Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4)

Now - what  if 0.100 mol of a strong acid (HCl) had been included in the 1.0 L solution. 
Because 0.100 mol of HCl reacts with equal number of moles of HCOO- to form equal moles of 
HCOOH: 
For HCOO-, 0.500 mol - 0.100 mol = 0.400 mol 
For HCOOH, 1.00 mol + 0.100 mol = 1.10 mol 

[HCOO-] = 0.400 mol/1.0 L =0.400 M 
[HCOOH] = 1.10 mol/1.0 L =1.10 M

pH = 3.31


So addition of 0.10 mol of strong acid only changed pH from 3.45 to 3.31


Designing a Buffer 

One must consider the relationship between the ratio of [HA] to [A-], the pKa, and the desired pH. 

HA (aq) + H2O 

H3O+  (aq) + A- (aq) 

[H3O+][A -]

Ka =

The values of [HA] and [A-] in the equation are at equilibrium. However, a weak acid HA typically 
loses only a tiny fraction of its protons, so [HA] is negligibly different from the molarity of the acid

used to prepare the buffer.  Likewise, only a tiny fraction of the weakly basic anions of A- accept 
protons, so [A-] is negligibly different from the molarity of A- used to prepare the buffer.

Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation 

initial 
This assumption is valid when [H3O+] is small compared to [HA] and [A-] (i.e. less than 5%). 

Example: Design a buffer system with pH 4.60.

A buffer solution is most effective in the range of pKa  ±1

Acetic acid is suitable with a pKa  of 4.75

[CH3COOH]0

[CH3COO-]0 

=  100.15  = 1.4


The ratio is more important than the amounts used.  However, the amounts used do affect the capacity 
of the buffer to resist changes in pH.  Higher concentrations = more resistance to change. 

If you use too low concentrations, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation won’t be valid. 
For pH 4.60, [H3O+] is 2.5 x 10-5.

Today’s material 

[HA] and [A-] need to be > 5.0 x 10-4 M


Acid Base Titrations 
An acid-base titration is the addition of a volume of base of known concentration to acid of unknown 
concentration (or addition of acid to base).  This technique can be used to determine the concentration 
of an acid or base. 

Titrations involving a strong acid and a strong base 
In a titration of a strong acid with a strong base, or a strong base with a strong acid, the pH changes 
slowly initially, changes rapidly through pH 7 at the equivalence point and then changes slowly again.

Equivalence (stoichiometric, S) point = the theoretical volume at which the amount of base added 

equals the amount of acid that was originally present.

End point = the experimentally measured volume at which the indicator changes color.

Endpoint should equal equivalence point.


Calculating points on a pH curve.

Example: a strong base (0.250 M NaOH) is titrated with a strong acid (0.340 M HCl)

1. Calculating the pH before the equivalence point when 5.00 mL of 0.340 M HCl (aq) is added to 
25.00 mL of 0.250 M NaOH (aq) 

A). Calculate moles of OH- present. (Base is strong so amount of NaOH added = amount of OH-
formed.) 
0.02500 L x 0.250 mol/L = 6.25 x 10-3  moles 

B). Calculate moles of H3O+  supplied by titrant.  (Acid is strong so HCl added =  H3O+  formed.) 
0.00500 L x 0.340 mol/L = 1.70 x 10-3  moles 

C). Find the moles of OH- remaining after the reaction with H3O+ ions. 
because stoichiometry is 1:1 
6.25 x 10-3  moles - 1.70 x 10-3  moles = 4.55 x 10-3  mol of OH- left 

D). Calculate molarity of OH-
4.55 x 10-3  mol/ 0.03000 L = 0.152 mol/L  (Make sure to use total volume 5.00 mL + 25.00 mL) 

E). Calculate pH 
pOH = -log 0.152 = 0.818 

pH = 14.00 -0.818 = 13.18 

2. Calculating the volume of HCl needed to reach the equivalence point. 
Initially 6.25 x 10-3  mol of OH- were present.  At the equivalence point, 6.25 x 10-3  mol of HCl will 
have been added (1:1 stoichiometry) 

23.5


6.25 x 10-3  mol x  1L 
0.340 mol 

= 0.0184 L 

What is the pH at the equivalence point? 

3. Calculate the pH after 1.00 mL of HCl has been added after equivalence point has been reached.

A). Find moles of H3O+ formed due to the 1.00 mL addition of HCl

(H3O+  formed = amount of HCl added, since strong acid)

0.340 mol/L x (0.00100 L) = 3.40 x 10-4  mol of H3O+ 

B). Calculate molarity of H3O+ 

C). pH = -log (7.66 x 10-3) = 2.116

Example: Titration of weak acid with strong base 
25.0 mL of 0.10 M HCOOH with 0.15 M NaOH (Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4  for HCOOH) 

1. Volume = 0 mL of NaOH added

Before any NaOH is added, the problem is that of an ionization of a weak acid in water.

2. 
0 < V < Veq 

In this range, the acid has been partly ionized by the strong base (buffering region).


Calculate the pH of the solution resulting from the addition of 5.0 mL of 0.15 M NaOH.

Because OH- is a stronger base than HCO2
-, it reacts almost completely with HCOOH.

Initial Moles 
For HCOOH, (25.0 x 10-3  L)(0.10M) = 2.5 x 10-3  moles 
For OH-,  (5.0 x 10-3  L)(0.15M) = 0.75 x 10-3  moles 
Moles after Reaction 
2.5 x 10-3  moles - 0.75 x 10-3  moles = 1.75 x 10-3  moles of HCOOH left

assume x is small  ~=  0.0250x 
0.0583 

x = 4.13 x 10-4 
Check assumption: 4.13 x 10-4 is 1.65% of 0.025 and is 0.7% of 0.0583  okay 
pH = -log [4.13 x 10-4] = 3.38 

Option 2 
pH ~= pKa  - log ([HA]/[A-])

pH ~= 3.75 - log ([0.0583]/[0.0250]) = 3.75 - 0.368 = 3.38


check assumption: for a pH of 3.38, [H3O+] = 4.2 x 10-4  and that is <5% of 0.0583 and is <5% of

0.0250. Okay


If the 5% assumption is not valid, than option 1 must be used and 

Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4 =  (0.0250 + x)(x)/(0.0583 - x)  can not be simplified.

Must solve by quadratic equation.

Note: when the volume of NaOH added is between 0 and the equivalence volume Veq, the problems are

similar to buffer problems.  This region of the titration curve is called the "buffering region."


Half-equivalence point 
When the volume of NaOH added is equal to half the equivalence volume, [HA] = [A-].

pH ~= pKa  - log ([HA]/[A-]) 
pH ~=pKa -log (1) 
pH ~=pKa 

3. 
V = Veq
At the equivalence point, the amount of NaOH added is equal to the amount of HCOOH.  The pH is 
not 7 as it is for a strong acid and a strong base.  The pH is >7 when a weak acid is titrated with a 
strong base.  The pH depends on the properties of the salt formed during the neutralization process. 
HCOOH and NaOH form NaHCO2  and H2O. Na+  has no effect on pH and HCO2  is a base.  Thus at the 
-
equivalence point, the pH is >7. 

Calculate the pH at the equivalence point

You can take it from here. Simplify if x is small compared to 0.0600 M. Calculate x, which is equal to 

[OH- ] = 1.83 x 10-6  M. Then calculate pOH = 5.74.  From pOH, calculate pH.

pH = 8.26 (which is >7)


4. 
V > Veq
Beyond the equivalence point, NaOH is added to the solution of the conj. base HCO2  .  Since HCO2 
-
-
does not give rise to much OH- in solution (1.83 x 10-6  M), the pOH and pH are determined by the 
amount of excess NaOH added. This problem is similar to a strong acid/strong base problem.
