From Wednesday’s handout 

Now the answer to the biochemical question 

How is vitamin B12  reduced in the body? Vitamin B12  is reduced by a protein called flavodoxin. 

E° for vitamin B12  is -0.526 V

E° for flavodoxin is -0.230 V


Is the reduction of vitamin B12  by flavodoxin spontaneous?


∆E°(cell)  =  E°(reduction) - E° (oxidation)

=  E° (vitamin B12) - E° (flavodoxin)

= -0.526 V -(-0.230 V) = -0.296 V


∆G°  = -nℑ∆E° = -(1)(96485 Cmol-1)(-0.296 V) = +28.6 kJ/mol 

Vitamin B12  is a better reducing agent than flavodoxin. Vitamin B12  should reduce flavodoxin not 
the other way around. So why don't we all have heart disease and megaloblastic anemia? 

Answer: S-adenosylmethionine provides the energy to drive the reaction. The ∆G° for the 
cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine is -37.6 kJ/mol

d-block metals used as probes of biological systems and/or drugs include Cr, Co, Y, Tc, Ag, Cd, 
Pt, Au, Hg.

Roles of metals in biology include 
global cycling of nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen 
radical reactions 
biosynthesis of vitamins 
biosynthesis of deoxynucleotides 
etc 

Formation of coordination complexes 
A key feature of transition metals is their ability to form complexes with small molecules and 
ions. 
Positive metals ions can attract electron density, usually a lone pair of electrons from another 
atom or molecule to form a coordination complex. 
Donor atoms are called ligands (Lewis _________ –typically _______ one lone pair of 
electrons) 

Examples of ligands:

Acceptor atoms are transition metals (Lewis acid –accept lone pair electrons) 
Examples of transition metals: Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn,  Ir, Pt, etc 

Coordination complexes ≡ metals surrounded by ligands.  Example: 

NH3

H3N

Coordination number (CN) is the number of ligands bonded to the metal ion. 
Here CN = 6.  Six ligands comprise the primary coordination sphere. 

Typical CN’s range from 2-12.  Six is the most common.

Chelate Effect in Coordination Complexes 

Ligands that bind a metal at one site are called unidentate or monodentate (one tooth). 

Ligands that have two or more points of attachment to the metal are called chelating ligands and 
the coordination complexes are called chelates (greek for claws). 

Bidentate – two points of attachment 
Tridentate – 
Tetradentate -
Hexadentate – 

ex. corrin ring of B12 
ex. EDTA 

Metal  chelates  are  unusual  stable.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  favorable  entropic  factor 
accompanying release of non-chelating ligands (usually H2O) from the coordination sphere. 
Examples 

27.4 

1. Vitamin B12. 
Cobalt is coordinated by 
a planar tetradentate 
ligand (corrin ring system). 
It is also coordinated by an 
upper axial ligand 
(5’deoxyadenosine) and a 
lower axial ligand (dimethylbenzimidazol 
e)

2. Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Binding of EDTA is entropically favorable.  Six molecules of H2O are released for every 1 
molecule of EDTA bound.

Optical isomers (enantiomers) are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. 

A complex that is not identical to its mirror image is also called a chiral complex.

Chiral molecules have different properties in chiral environments (such as a human body).

d-Electron Counting in Coordination Complexes 

d-electron count of metal = group number (periodic table) -oxidation number of metal 

1. find oxidation number:


For Co in [Co(NH3)6]3+


NH3  is neutral, so Co must be +3


2. d-count is 9-3 = 6
