I. A) ATOMIC RADIUS 
The atomic radius is defined as the value of r below which 90% of electron density is
contained. 

The role of atomic radius in ion channel selectivity : 
Ion channels
Ions Cell membrane

Ion channels 
* regulate the influx of ions into cells.
* enable rapid electrical signaling in neurons.
 
Regulation and selectivity are essential.

Sodium  ion  channels  are  selective  for  Na+
 in  the  presence  of  other  ions,  including  K+ . 
Sodium  channels  include  a  tiny  pore  (~0.4  nm  wide)  that  is  just  wide  enough  to

accommodate a sodium ion and associated water molecule.  Too small for potassium!


I. B) ISOELECTRONIC ATOMS / IONS.	
Isoelectronic - having the same e- configuration. 
For example, all 1s2  2s2  2p6  ions are isoelectronic with Ne.

II. COVALENT BONDS 
Chemical bonds form between atoms when the arrangement of  the nuclei and electrons 
of  the bonded atoms results in a _____________ (more negative) energy  than that for  the 
separate atoms. 

A covalent bond is a pair of electrons ______________ (sometimes equally, sometimes not) 
between two atoms.  Covalent bonds form between nonmetals. 

Energy of two H-atoms: 
E = 2(-1312 kJ/mol)

E = _________ kJ/mol


Energy of H2  molecule:


E = _________ kJ/mol 

The  two  H-atoms  shown  are  bound  together  by  the  coulombic  attraction  between  the  electrons 
and  each  nucleus.  Since  neither  atom  loses  an  electron  completely,  the  full  IE  is  not  required  to 
form the bond. 
In bonding, r = distance between nuclei. 

We can plot the energy of the two H-atoms as a function of internuclear distance, r. 

Energy of interaction = nuclear-nuclear  +  electron-nuclear  +  electron-electron 
repulsion 
attraction 
repulsion 
ΔEd  (or D) = ________________________ , the energy required to separate bonded atoms. 
ΔEd  for H2  =  __________ kJ/mol – ( ___________ kJ/mol) = __________ kJ/mol

Bond strength is defined as ΔEd.

We can plot bond strength directly by defining 0 as the E of separate atoms.


Compare the H-H and N≡N bonds: 
Which bond is stronger? 
__________ (deeper energy well) 

Which bond is shorter?  _________ 

III. (Introduction to) LEWIS STRUCTURES 
G.N.  Lewis  (American  scientist,  1875-1946).  Twenty  years  prior  to  the  development  of
quantum mechanics, Lewis recognized an organizing principle in bonding. Namely that: 
The  key  to  covalent  bonding  is  electron  sharing,  such  that  each  atom  achieves  a 
___________ valance shell (noble gas configuration). 

OCTET  RULE:  electrons  are  distributed  in  such  a way  that  each  element  is  surrounded 
by eight electrons, an octet. Each dot in a Lewis structure represents a ______________ e-. 

EXCEPTION WITH H: special stability is achieved with ______ electrons. 

Each valence e- in a molecule can be described as a bonding or a lone-pair electron. 
For Cl in HCl 
•  _____ bonding electrons 
•  _____ lone-pair electrons  or  ______ lone pairs 

Lewis  structures  correctly  predict  electron  configurations  90%  of  the  time.  Our  other 
option: solve the Schrödinger equation.

PROCEDURE FOR DRAWING LEWIS STRUCTURES 
1.	 Draw  a  skeleton  structure.  H  and  F  are  always  terminal  atoms.  The  element 
with the lowest ionization energy goes in the middle (with some exceptions). 
2.	 Count the total number of valence electrons.  If there is a negative ion, add the 
absolute value of  total  charge to  the  count of  valence  electrons;  if positive  ion, 
subtract. 
3.	 Count the total # of e-s needed for each atom to have a full valence shell. 
4.	 Subtract  the  number  in  step  2  (valence  electrons)  from  the  number  in  step  3
(total electrons for full shells).  The result is the number of bonding electrons. 
5.	 Assign 2 bonding electrons to each bond. 
If  bonding  electrons  remain,  make  some  double  or  triple  bonds.  In  general, 
6.	
double  bonds  form  only  between  C,  N,  O,  and  S.  Triple  bonds  are  usually 
restricted to C, N, and O. 
If  valence  electrons  remain,  assign  them  as  lone  pairs,  giving  octets  to  all
atoms except hydrogen. 
8.	 Determine the formal charge.
