5.111 Lecture Summary #36 
Review of Topics 
Chemical Equilibrium, Acid Base, Oxidation Reduction, Transition Metals, and Kinetics 
These topics represent the basic principles of how enzymes work, and one needs to understand how 
enzymes work to inhibit them. 

36.1 

Inhibition of enzymes is used to treat headaches, arthritis, cancer, HIV, etc 
Big money for the Pharmaceutical industry 

Let's review these topics using methionine synthase as a case study. 

KINETICS 
Methionine synthase (MetH) is an enzyme, "a catalyst of life".

It transfers a methyl group from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, generating methionine

and tetrahydrofolate.


Inhibition of this enzyme has been associated with neutral tube defects and heart disease.  It is also a

potential chemotherapeutic target.


TRANSITION METALS 
Methionine synthase requires vitamin B12  and zinc.

REVIEW 
:

Vitamin B12  is reduced by a protein called flavodoxin. 

E° for vitamin B12  is -0.526 V 
E° for flavodoxin is -0.230 V 

Which is a better reducing agent? 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(reduction) - E° (oxidation) 
=  E° (vitamin B12) - E° (flavodoxin) 
= -0.526 V -(-0.230 V) = -0.296 V 

Is the reduction of vitamin B12  by flavodoxin spontaneous? 
∆G°  = -nℑ∆E° = -(1)(96485 Cmol-1)(-0.296 V) = +28.6 kJ/mol 
S-adenosylmethionine provides the energy to drive the reaction. The ∆G° for the cleavage of S-
adenosylmethionine is -37.6 kJ/mol 

Cells that require energy to bring about non-spontaneous reactions are called?

Enzyme-bound homocysteine has a pKa  of 6.  The zinc acts as a lewis acid and binds homocysteine,

CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
Methionine synthase exists in multiple conformations. These conformations are in equilibrium with 
each other. 

The enzyme needs to position three things above the B12 and there is no room for any of them. 
Conformational changes need to occur. 

"Methyl-cap" region must move
