CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
Topics: External effects on K and sig figs for logs. 

Chapter 9 sections 9.10-9.13 

Recall Principle of Le Châtelier: A system in equilibrium that is subjected to stress will react in a 
way that tends to minimize the effect of the stress. 

CHANGING THE VOLUME 
A decrease in the volume of a gaseous system causes an increase in the total pressure.  Le 
Châtelier's principle predicts that the system would respond, if possible, in such a way as to 
reduce the total pressure. 

Example  2P2  (g) 

P4  (g) 

A decrease in volume shifts the reaction to the right (toward product).  This occurs because for 
every 2 molecules of P2  consumed only 1 molecule of P4  is formed.  A shift to the right reduces 
the total pressure, partially compensating for the external stress of the volume change.

Now Consider in terms of Q and K.  Suppose the volume is decreased by a factor of 2 at constant 
temperature. This will increase the partial pressure of P2  by 2 and of P4  by 2, initially.

Q decreases by a factor of 2, and Q < K.  ∆G is negative.  Reaction proceeds in forward direction 
(toward products) until Q=K again. 

In contrast, increasing the volume shifts the reaction to the left (toward reactants).

ADDING INERT GAS 

20.2 

1) For 2P2  (g) 
P4, what happens if an inert gas is added to the container increasing the total 
pressure at constant temperature? Answer: _____________  Why? 

Q depends on the partial pressure of P2  and P4  gases and the partial pressures do not change here. 

Review Partial Pressure: The partial pressure is the pressure that each gas would exert if it alone 
were present in the container.

2) What happens if an inert gas is added to the container but the total pressure and temperature 
are kept constant?  For the pressure to be kept constant, the volume of the container must have 
been increased.

CHANGING THE TEMPERATURE 

20.3 

Raising the temperature of an equilibrium mixture by adding heat causes the reaction to shift 
such that some of the heat is absorbed.  Le Châtelier's principle is consistent with this 
observation. 

Raising the temperature of an exothermic reaction favors the formation of reactants. Raising the 
temperature of an endothermic reaction favors the formation of products. 

Here ∆H is the predictive tool 

Example 
2SO2  (g) + O2 
2SO3  (g) 
∆H° = -197.78 kJ/mol 
If heat is added, which direction will the reaction go? 

TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF K

K can change with temperature and reaction rates can change with temperature.


∆G° = -RT ln K =  ∆H° - T ∆S° 

or 

ln K =  -∆H°/RT  +  ∆S°/R


Since it is reasonable to assume that ∆H° and ∆S° are approximately independent of temperature

over the range of temperatures of interest, K changes with a change in T.


Consider a reaction carried out at Temperatures T1  and T2:

ln K2  = -∆H°/RT2  +  ∆S°/R 
and 
ln K1 = -∆H°/RT1  +  ∆S°/R

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives:

MAXIMIZING THE YIELD OF A REACTION 

N2(g) + 3H2(g) 

2NH3(g)  exothermic reaction 

low temperature favors products, good  but low temperature slows rate, bad

Compromise temperature used is 500°C.


What are other ways to drive the reaction toward products?


Bacteria can catalyze the same reaction using an enzyme called nitrogenase. 

LE CHÂTELIER AND HEMOGLOBIN 
The combination of oxygen with hemoglobin (Hb), which carries oxygen through the blood, can 
be represented by 

Hb (aq) + O2  (aq) 

HbO2  (aq) 

where HbO2  is oxyhemoglobin (oxygen bound to hemoglobin) 

At an altitude of 3 km the partial pressure of oxygen is only about 0.14 atm, compared to 0.2 atm 
at sea level.  According to Le Châtelier's principle, the equilibrium would be shifted to the left. 
This change causes hypoxia.  How can the body compensate? 

SIG FIG RULES FOR LOGS AND EXPONENTIALS (APPENDIX 1C, D (PAGE A5-A7)

log (7.310 x 103) = 3.8639 (4 sig figs in mantissa)

log (7.310 x 1023) = 23.8639 (4 sig figs in mantissa)

The characteristic (left of decimal point) is determined solely by the location of the decimal point

in the number and not by the number's precision, it is not included when counting sig figs.  The

mantissa (right of decimal point) should be written with as many sig figs as the original number.


100.389  =2.45 (3 sig figs in answer) 
1012.389=2.45  x 1012(3 sig figs in answer)
