Standard States and Cell Potentials 

∆G°cell 

=

-nℑ∆E°cell 

∆E°cell  =  cell potential (cell voltage) in which products and reactants are in their standard states 
Units for ∆E is volts. 

Example - Calculate ∆E°cell for 

Zn (s) | Zn2+  (aq) ||  Cu2+  (aq) |Cu (s) 

anode 
cathode 

Zn (s) ⇒ Zn2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Zn (s)  (oxidation) 
(reduction) 
Cu2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Cu (s) 

∆E°(cell)  =	

standard reduction potential 
for the couple at cathode 

minus 

standard reduction potential 
for the couple at anode 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 

Look up Standard REDUCTION Potentials (E°) in back of book (measured against S.H.E) 

Zn2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Zn (s)  E° = -0.7628 volts 
Cu2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Cu (s)  E° = +0.3402 volts 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 
E° (Cu2+/Cu(s)) - E°(Zn2+/Zn(s)) 
= 0.3402 - (-0.7628 ) = 1.103 volts 

Is the flow of electrons spontaneous? 

∆G°cell 

=

-nℑ∆E°cell 

So, if ∆E°cell  is positive, ∆G°cell will be negative. 

Is a reaction spontaneous when ∆G° is negative?

Galvanic Cell is an electrochemical cell in which a ____________________ chemical reaction is

used to generate an electric current.


Electrolytic Cell uses electrical energy provided by an external circuit to carry out

________________________ reactions.


Summary


Whether the cell operates spontaneously can be determined by ∆Ecell. ((+) = spontaneous)


∆Ecell can be calculated from the Standard Reduction Potentials (E°) of half-cell reactions.


Meaning of standard reduction potential E°


A large positive E° means the element or compound is easy to reduce


ex. F2  (g) + 2e- ⇒ 2F-

E°=+2.87 volts (easy to add electrons to F2)

positive E°, negative ∆G°, favorable 

Is F2  a good oxidizing agent? 

A large positive E° means the oxidized species of the couple is very oxidizing. 

A large negative E° means the element or compound is hard to reduce 

ex. Li+1  + e- ⇒ Li (s) 

E°=-3.045 volts (hard to add electrons to Li+1) 
negative E°, positive ∆G°, not favorable 

Is Li+1  a good oxidizing agent? 

A large negative E° means the reduced species of the couple is very reducing. 

Example: What is ∆E° for the cell reaction: 2Fe3+  (aq)  +  2I- (aq) ⇒  2Fe2+  (aq)  +  I2 (s)?

Standard Reduction Potentials are: 
E°(Fe3+/Fe2+)  = +0.770 V 
E° (I2/I-) 
= +0.535 V 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 

= 

Is the reaction spontaneous? 

Which is the better oxidizing agent: Fe3+, I2? 

Which is the better reducing agent: I-, Fe2+? 

Question: Vitamin B12  has a large negative reduction potential, so how is it reduced in the body? 
Vitamin B12  needs to be reduced to be active.  Proper functioning of an enzyme that requires 
vitamin B12  and folic acid is thought to be necessary for preventing heart disease and birth 
defects. 

Where do you get vitamin B12  and folic acid in your diet? and how is the vitamin B12  reduced? 

Today’s material 

Adding and Subtracting Half-Cell Reactions to Calculate ∆E° for a New Half-Cell Reaction 
What if you need to know E° for the half-cell reaction: Cu2+  (aq) +  e- ⇒  Cu+ (aq), but it is not 
available in the Table in the book?  However, values of E° for other reactions involving Cu are 
available. 

One can add or subtract half-cell reactions with known E° to form the new half-cell reaction: 

Half-cell reactions: 
Cu2+  (aq) +  2e- ⇒  Cu (s) 
Cu (s)  ⇒  Cu+  (aq)  +  e-
Cu2+  (aq) +  e- ⇒  Cu+ (aq)


Standard Reduction Potentials are:

E° (Cu2+/Cu(s)) = +0.340 V

E° (Cu+/Cu(s)) = +0.522 V


26.4 

and calculate the E° for that new half-cell reaction as follows: 

∆G°new  = ∆G°reduction  - ∆G°oxidation 

or 

-n3ℑE°3  (new) =  -n1ℑE°1(reduction) +  n2ℑE°2(oxidation) 

E°3 =  n1E°1  (reduction) - n2E°2  (oxidation)

n3


E°3  = ( 2 )(0.340V) - (1)(0.522V) 
(1) 

= 0.158 V 

= 

E° (Cu2+/Cu+) 

NERNST EQUATION 

An exhausted battery is a sign that the cell reaction has reached equilibrium.  At equilibrium, a

cell generates zero potential difference across its electrodes.


To understand this, we need to know how the cell potential changes with cell composition.


What do we know already about equilibrium and the components of a reaction?


We know that ∆G changes as the concentrations of the components change until equilibrium is

reached, then ∆G = 0. 

∆G =  ∆G°  +  RT ln Q 

What do we know about the relationship between ∆G° and ∆E°? 

∆G°  = -nℑ∆E° 

Combining: 

-nℑ∆E  =  -nℑ∆E° + RT ln Q 

Dividing by -nℑ: 

∆E =  ∆E° - RT  ln Q 
nℑ 

(NERNST EQ.) 

Example: Calculate ∆E (the cell potential, potential difference, emf) at 25 °C of a cell in which

the concentration of Zn2+  ions is 0.10 M and Cu2+  is 0.0010 M.


Cu2+  (aq)  + Zn (s) ⇒  Zn2+  (aq) + Cu (s)


Step 1: Calculate ∆E °(Cell) from the E° for the half-reactions. 
Standard Reduction Potentials 
E° (Cu2+/Cu(s)) = +0.340 V 
E° (Zn2+/Zn(s)) = -0.7628 V 

Cu2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Cu (s) 
Zn (s) ⇒  Zn2+  (aq) + 2e-

26.5 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 
= 

Step 2: Calculate Q for Cu2+  (aq)  + Zn (s) ⇒  Zn2+  (aq) + Cu (s) 

Q = 

Step 3: Find n 

Step 4: Use the Nernst Eq. 

∆E =  ∆E° - RT  ln Q

∆E = 1.103 V - (8.315 J K-1mol-1)(298 K) ln (1.0 x 102)

∆E = 1.103 V - 0.0592 = +1.044 V

What about at EQUILIBRIUM?


Q = ?


∆G = ?


∆G =  ∆G°  +  RT ln Q

∆G°  = - RT ln K

∆G°  =  -nℑ∆E°


Combining: 
-RT ln K =  -nℑ∆E° 

OR: 

ln K =  nℑ∆E° 
RT 

Can calculate K from standard potentials! 

Now the answer to the biochemical question 
How is vitamin B12  reduced in the body? Vitamin B12  is reduced by a protein called flavodoxin. 

E° for vitamin B12  is -0.526 V 
E° for flavodoxin is -0.230 V 

Is the reduction of vitamin B12  by flavodoxin spontaneous? 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(reduction) - E° (oxidation) 
=  E° (vitamin B12) - E° (flavodoxin) 
= -0.526 V -(-0.230 V) = -0.296 V 

∆G°  = -nℑ∆E° = -(1)(96485 Cmol-1)(-0.296 V) = +28.6 kJ/mol 

Vitamin B12  is a better reducing agent than flavodoxin. Vitamin B12  should reduce flavodoxin not 
the other way around. So why don't we all have heart disease and megaloblastic anemia? 

Answer: S-adenosylmethionine provides the energy to drive the reaction. The ∆G° for the 
cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine is -37.6 kJ/mol
