Example: Titration of weak acid with strong base 
25.0 mL of 0.10 M HCOOH with 0.15 M NaOH (Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4  for HCOOH) 

1. Volume = 0 mL of NaOH added

Before any NaOH is added, the problem is that of an ionization of a weak acid in water.

x = 0.00421 (check 0.00421 is 4.2% of 0.10) okay 

pH = -log [0.00421] = 2.38 (to how many sig figs?) 

2. 
0 < V < Veq 

In this range, the acid has been partly ionized by the strong base (buffering region).


Calculate the pH of the solution resulting from the addition of 5.0 mL of 0.15 M NaOH. 
Because OH- is a stronger base than HCO2
-, it reacts almost completely with HCOOH. 
HCOOH (aq) + OH- (aq)  →  H2O (l) +  HCO2  (aq)  K>>1

Initial Moles 
For HCOOH, (25.0 x 10-3  L)(0.10M) = 2.5 x 10-3  moles 
For OH-,  (5.0 x 10-3  L)(0.15M) = 0.75 x 10-3  moles 
Moles after Reaction 
2.5 x 10-3  moles - 0.75 x 10-3  moles = 1.75 x 10-3  moles of HCOOH left 
0.75 x 10-3  moles OH- produces _____________of  HCO2 
-
Molarity 
1.75 x 10-3  moles of HCOOH/ (0.0250 + 0.0050 L)  = 0.0583 M HCOOH 
0.75 x 10-3  moles of HCO2  / (0.0250 + 0.0050 L)  = 0.0250 M HCO2

Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4 =  (0.0250 + x )(x) 
(0.0583-x) 

assume x is small  ~=  0.0250x 
0.0583 

x = 4.13 x 10-4 
Check assumption: 4.13 x 10-4 is 1.65% of 0.025 and is 0.7% of 0.0583  okay 
pH = -log [4.13 x 10-4] = 3.38 

Option 2 
pH ~= pKa  - log ([HA]/[A-])

pH ~= 3.75 - log ([0.0583]/[0.0250]) = 3.75 - 0.368 = 3.38


check assumption: for a pH of 3.38, [H3O+] = 4.2 x 10-4  and that is <5% of 0.0583 and is <5% of

0.0250. Okay


If the 5% assumption is not valid, than option 1 must be used and 

Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4 =  (0.0250 + x)(x)/(0.0583 - x)  can not be simplified.

Must solve by quadratic equation.

Note: when the volume of NaOH added is between 0 and the equivalence volume Veq, the problems are

similar to buffer problems.  This region of the titration curve is called the "buffering region." 

Half-equivalence point 

When the volume of NaOH added is equal to half the equivalence volume, [HA] = [A-]. 

pH ~= pKa  - log ([HA]/[A-]) 
pH ~=pKa -log (1) 
pH ~=pKa 

3. 
V = Veq
At the equivalence point, the amount of NaOH added is equal to the amount of HCOOH.  The pH is 
not 7 as it is for a strong acid and a strong base.  The pH is >7 when a weak acid is titrated with a 
strong base.  The pH depends on the properties of the salt formed during the neutralization process. 
HCOOH and NaOH form NaHCO2  and H2O. Na+  has ___________ on pH and HCO2  is ___________. 
-
Thus at the equivalence point, the pH is >7.

Calculate the pH at the equivalence point 

Calculate total volume at equivalence point 

moles of HCOOH = 2.5 x 10-3  moles = moles of HCO2  formed = moles of OH- added 
-

2.5 x 10-3  moles of OH- x  1L 
0.15 mol 
Total volume = 0.0250 L + 0.0167 L =  0.0417 L 

=  1.67 x 10-2  L of NaOH added 

Molarity of HCO2 
-
2.5 x 10-3  moles of HCO2

-/ (0.0417 L)  = 0.0600 M HCO2

This is an ionization of weak base in water problem.

You can take it from here. Simplify if x is small compared to 0.0600 M. Calculate x, which is equal to 

[OH- ] = 1.83 x 10-6  M. Then calculate pOH = 5.74.  From pOH, calculate pH.

pH = 8.26 (which is >7)


4. 
V > Veq
Beyond the equivalence point, NaOH is added to the solution of the conj. base HCO2  .  Since HCO2 
-
-
does not give rise to much OH- in solution (1.83 x 10-6  M), the pOH and pH are determined by the 
amount of excess NaOH added. This problem is similar to a strong acid/strong base problem. 

At 5.00 mL past the equivalence point:


0.00500 L x 0.15 M = 7.5 x 10-4  moles excess OH-


7.5 x 10-4  moles OH- /(0.00500 L + 0.0250 L+ 0.0167 L) = 0.016 M OH-

pOH = -log [0.16] = 1.79 
pH = 12.21

Today’s material 

OXIDATION/REDUCTION REACTIONS 
Guidelines for assigning oxidation numbers 

1) In free elements, each atom has an oxidation number of zero. Example H2 

2) For ions composed of only one atom the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion.  Thus 
Li+1  has an oxidation number of +1.  Group 1 and group 2 metals have oxidation numbers of +1 and 
+2, respectively.  Aluminum has an oxidation number of +3 in all its compounds. 

3) The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is -2.  However, in peroxides such as H2O2  and 
O2
-2, oxygen has an oxidation state of -1. 

4) The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when it is bonded to metals in binary compounds, 
such as LiH, NaH, CaH2.  In these cases, its oxidation number is -1. 

5) F has an oxidation number of -1 in all its compounds.  Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) have negative 
oxidation numbers when they occur as halide ions in compounds (Ex. NaCl).  However, when 
combined with oxygen (oxoacids), they have positive oxidation numbers (Ex. ClO-). 

6) In a neutral molecule, the sum of the oxidation numbers of all the atoms must be zero.  In a 
polyatomic ion, the sum of oxidation numbers of all the elements in the ion must be equal to the net 
charge of the ion.  For example NH4
+ 

H is 

N is 

Sum is 

7) Oxidation numbers do not have to be integers.  For example, the oxidation number of oxygen 
in superoxide O2
-1 is _________

Li2O 

HNO3

(6) Multiply the half reactions so that the number of electrons given off in the oxidation equals
the number of electrons accepted in the reduction. 

6e- + 14H+  +  Cr2O7

2- ⇒  2Cr3+  + 7H2O 

Fe2+  ⇒  Fe3+ +  e-

(7) Add half reaction, make appropriate cancellations. 

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+ +  6e-
6e- +  14H+  +  Cr2O7
B. BALANCE IN BASIC SOLUTION  (Book has a different approach. You can use either.) 

2- ⇒  Cr3+  + Fe3+ 

Fe2+  +  Cr2O7
Follow steps (1-7) to get your answer for acidic solution: 

14H+  +  Cr2O7

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+ 

(8) Then "adjust pH" by adding OH- to both sides to neutralize H+. 

14OH- + 14H+  +  Cr2O7
OR 

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

14H2O  +  Cr2O7
CANCEL 
7 
14H2O  +  Cr2O7

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

Thus:  7H2O  +  Cr2O7
2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-
