Topics: 

I.  Discovery of the electron and the nucleus 
II.	 (Failure of) the classical description of the atom 

Heading  into  the  20th  century  there  was  a  feeling  by  many  in  the  chemistry  and
physics  communities  that  our  scientific  knowledge  was  nearly  complete. 
It  was 
universally  accepted  that  atoms  were  the  most  basic  constituent  of  matter  and  that
the behavior of all matter could be explained through Newtonian mechanics. 
BUT…several discoveries and observations contradicted these theories: 

I. A) DISCOVERY OF THE ELECTRON 
J.J.	 Thomson 
(English  physicist,  1856-1940)  in  1897  discovers  the  electron  and 
determines the charge to mass ratio.  In 1906 he wins the Nobel Prize. 
The Experiment: 

cathode(-)  anode(+) 

H2(g) 

cathode rays 

deflection plate (+) 

!V >> 0 

!x deflection

!V = 0 

deflection plate (-) 

high voltage

difference

cathode rays = _____________________-charged particles = electrons 
If ΔV (the voltage difference between the two deflection plates) = 0 there is no deflection,
but when ΔV is large there is Δx deflection towards the positive plate.  From classical 
electromagnetism, Thompson knew that 
Δx(-) ∝  _______ 
e(-)= ___________________  of the negative particle 
m(-)  = __________________ of the negative particle

BUT when a very large ΔV is applied a slight deflection towards the negative plate is 
also observed.  Therefore there is also a positive particle! 
Δx(+) ∝  _______ 
e(+)= charge of the positive particle 
m(+)  = mass of the positive particle 
BUT  Δx(-) >>> Δx(+) 
Thompson suspected that the positive particle was H+ and H was the source of the 
negative particle.  Since H is electronically neutral, 
Then   e(-) =  e(+) 
So:   Δx(-)    = 
 Δx(+) 

Since the ratio of Δx is large the ratio of masses will be large :  m(-)  ___________ m(+) 
This negative particle from the cathode ray tubes was named the electron (m = 9.11 x 10-
31  kg). Atoms are NOT indivisible! 
Thomson proposed  a model of  the  atom  in which  electrons are embedded  in a  cloud
of  positive  charge. His  (inaccurate) model  is  often  referred  to  as  the  "Plum  pudding 
model". 

I. B) DISCOVERY OF THE NUCLEUS 
Ernest Rutherford  (Cambridge University, England, 1871-1937) studied α emission 
from newly-discovered radioactive elements. 
•  α particles were known to be heavy, charged particles 
•  α particles are ________ atoms- this was unknown in 1911 

In 1911 Rutherford tested the plum pudding model. (Experiments were done with a 
postdoc, Hans Geiger, and an undergraduate, E. Marsden.)

Count rate = ____________________  α particles / min

Count rate = ____________________  α particles / min

It appeared that all of the α particles passed through the Au foil.


A detector was built that could swing around to the front side and measure any

potential back scattered particles.

Probability (P) of backscattering: 
count rate backscattered 
P = 
count rate of incident particles 

=  ___________  = 

Interpretation: 

Plum pudding model disproved!	

New atomic model 

•	 Since the vast majority of α particles pass through the Au foil undeflected, the 
Au atoms are mostly ________________. 
•	 A  very  tiny  percentage  of  α  particles  hit  something  massive  in  the  atom  and 
backscatter (bounce back).  This indicates that most of the mass of the atom is 
concentrated  in  a  very  small  volume  relative  to  the  volume  of  the  entire 
atom.  We now call this the NUCLEUS. 
•	 Rutherford  calculated  the  diameter  of  the  nucleus  to  be  _________  m.  His 
calculation  (see  below)  related  the  probability  of  backscattering  to  the 
diameter  of  the  nucleus  based  on  the  size  of  the  atom  (10-10  m)  and  the 
thickness of the foil. 
•	 Rutherford  proposed  the  charge  on  the  nucleus  to  be  positive,  since  electrons
are negatively charged and atoms are neutral. 
Z = atomic number 
Charge on the nucleus =  _________ 
e = absolute value of electron’s charge 

NOW FOR AN IN-CLASS RUTHERFORD BACKSCATTERING EXPERIMENT! 
Please imagine: 
white Styrofoam balls = 1 monolayer of Au nuclei 
ping pong balls = α particles 
_________ = radioactive material emitting α particles

Probability of backscattering (P) =  ________________________________________ 

(We will experimentally determine this value.) 
P is related to r, the radius of an Au nucleus (styrofoam ball) in the following way: 

P = _________________________  =  _______________________________________ 

P  =  ____________ 
1.39 m2 

We can solve for r (radius) and d (diameter) of the “Au nucleus” / Styrofoam ball: 
r = ___________________ 
d = 2r = ___________________ 

Now we can experimentally find P to determine d, the diameter of the nucleus: 

P =  ____________  = 

d = 

II.  (FAILURE OF) THE CLASSICAL DESCRIPTION OF AN ATOM 
How  is  an  e- bound  to  the  nucleus?  What  is  the  force  between  them?

Electromagnetic force.  We will simplify this by calling it the Coulomb force.

So the force between a positively-charge nucleus and a negatively-charged electron is

Coulomb force, which can be quantified by Coulomb’s Force Law.

For a hydrogen atom:

F(r) = ____________ 

e = absolute value of an electron’s charge

(note: nuclear charge = +e for a H atom) 
r = distance between two charges 
ε0  = permittivity constant of a vacuum
(8.854 x 10-12 C2J-1m-1)

Consider an H atom (Z=1) with 1 electron and 1 proton. 

electron 

-e 

When r → ∞ 

F(r) = ________ 

As r → 0 

F(r) = ________ 

r 

+e 

H nucleus 
The closer the electron is to the nucleus, the larger the attractive force between the
two charges. 

•  The Coulomb force law tells us the force (F) as a function of r. 
•  The Coulomb force law does not tell us how r changes with ________________. 

There  is  a CLASSICAL EQUATION  OF MOTION  that  tells  us  how  the  electron  and
nucleus move under influence of this Coulomb force: Newton’s 2nd  Law 
Force = mass times acceleration 
F = ma 
We can rewrite F as a function of velocity, F = m(_______) or distance, F = m(d2r/dt2) 
We can plug in the Coulomb force law for F, and solve the equation for a given initial
value of r. 
If rinitial  is 10 Å (10-10  m), a typical distance for an H atom, the calculation indicates that 
r = 0 at t = _______ sec! 

This predicts that the electron should plummet into the nucleus in ______________! 

What is wrong here?

It turns out that the laws of classical mechanics no longer work at this size scale.

Need a new kind of mechanics to describe this and other “unsettling” observations.


QUANTUM MECHANICS provides a single and comprehensive theory that explains the 
behavior of matter on an atomic (nanometer or smaller) scale.
