5.111 Lecture 31 
Kinetics 
Topics: Rates of Chemical Reactions and Rate Law 
Chapter 13.1-13.5 

When considering a chemical reaction, one must ask whether the reaction will go

(thermodynamics), and how fast the reaction will go (kinetics).


A kinetics experiment measures the rate at which the concentration of a substance taking part in 

a chemical reaction changes with time.


Oxidation of Glucose


C6H12O6  + 6O2  → 6CO2  + 6H2O


∆G° = ∆H° - T∆S°


∆H° = -2816 kJ/mol

T∆S° or ∆S° is (+)

∆G° = -2,885 kJ/mol


Thermodynamically favorable.


But to be useful as an energy source, the oxidation of glucose must be fast enough.


Glucose oxidation is slow.  Body uses protein catalysts called enzymes to speed up the reactions.

Rate Laws 

The rate law is the relationship between the rate and the concentration, which are related by a 
proportionality constant, k, called the rate constant. 

aA +  bB  → cC  +  dD 

rate = k [A]m[B]n..... 
m and n are order of reaction in A and B, respectively 
k is the rate constant 

Truths about rate laws 
(1) Rate law is a result of experimental observation.  You can't look at the stoichiometry of the 
reaction and predict the rate law (unless the reaction is an elementary reaction - we will come 
back to this later). 

(2) Rate law is not limited to reactants.  It can have product terms, i.e., rate = k[A]m[B]n[C]c 

(3) For rate = k[A]m[B]n, m is the order of reaction in A, n is the order of reaction in B.  m and n 
can be integers, fractions, negative or positive. 

m = 0 

m = 1/2 

m = 1 

First order 

k[A]	

Double concentration/ 

m = 2 

Second order 

k[A]2	

Double concentration/ 
Triple concentration/ 

m = -1 

m = -1/2 

(4) The overall reaction order is the sum of the exponents in the rate law.  For rate = k[A]2[B], 
the overall reaction order is _________ order. 

31.5 

(5) The units for k vary.  Determine units for k by considering units for rate and for 
concentration. 

Integrated Rate Laws 
Measuring initial rates can be difficult because it involves determining small changes in 
concentrations that occur during short intervals in time.  An alternative is to use the integrated 
rate law, which expresses concentrations directly as a function of time.
