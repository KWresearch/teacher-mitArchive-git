I. LEWIS STRUCTURES 
Lewis structures share the total number of valence electrons between atoms so that 
each atom achieves a noble gas configuration. 
EXAMPLE:  Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) 
Draw  skeleton  structure.  H  and  F  are  always  terminal  atoms.  The  element 
1.	
with the lowest ionization energy goes in the middle (with some exceptions).

Count  the  total  #  of  valence  e-s.  If  there  is  a  negative  ion,  add  the  absolute
value of total charge to count of valence electrons; if a positive ion, subtract. 

Calculate the total # of e-s needed for each atom to have a full valence shell. 

Subtract  the  number  in  step  2  (valence  electrons)  from  the  number  in  step  3
(total electrons for full shells).  The result is the number of bonding electrons. 

Assign 2 bonding electrons to each bond. 
Are  there  any  remaining  bonding  e-s?  _____________.  If  bonding  electrons 
remain, include double or triple bonds. 

Are  there  any  remaining  valence  electrons?  _____________.  If  valence 
electrons remain, assign as lone pairs, giving octets to all atoms except H.

EXAMPLE:  Thionyl chloride (SOCl2) 

Thionyl Chloride, SOCl2 
SOCl2  is  a  reagent  used  in  organic  and  medicinal  chemistry  to  convert  carboxylic  acid 
(COOH) groups to acid chloride (COCl) groups in molecules.  One example of using SOCl2
in  the  synthesis  of  pharmaceuticals  is  for  novacaine,  a  local  anasthetic  drug  used  in
dentistry and to reduce pain in intramuscular injections of other drugs, such as antibiotics.

II. FORMAL CHARGE (FC) 
Formal charge is a measure of the extent to which an atom has gained or lost an 
_______________ in the process of forming a covalent bond. 

To assign formal change, use the formula below. 
FC = V – L - (½)S 
V ≡ number of _______________ electrons 
L ≡ number of _______________ electrons 
S ≡ number of _______________ (bonding) electrons 

For an electronically-neutral molecule, the sum of the formal charges of the 
individual atoms must be ___________. 

3 

For a molecule with a net charge of -1, the sum of the formal charges of its atoms 
must be ______. 
The sum of individual formal charges must equal the total charge on the molecule! 
Let’s go back to two of Lewis structure examples.
EXAMPLE:  CN-

FC on C = V – L - (½)S  = _____ - _____ - (½) _____ = _____ 
FC on N = V – L - (½)S =  _____ - _____ - (½) _____ = _____ 

EXAMPLE:  SOCl2 

FC on S = _____ - _____ - (½) _____ = _____ 
FC on O =  6 - 6 - (½)2  = _____ 
FC on each Cl = 7 – 6 - (½) 2 = _____ 

In general, more electronegative atoms should hold the negative charge. 
Note:  FORMAL CHARGE ≠ OXIDATION NUMBER 

Formal  charge  is  very  helpful  in  deciding  between  possible  Lewis  structures. 
Structures  with  lower  absolute  values  of  FC  are  the  _________  stable  (lower 
energy) structures. 
For example, consider the three possible structures for the thiocyanate ion, CSN-. The 
ionization energies in kJ/mol for C, S, and N are IEC  = 1090, IES  1000, IEN  = 1400. 
Based on IE alone, we would predict _____ to be the central atom.

FCN  = 5 – 0 - 4 = _______ 
FCC  = 4 – 4 - 2 = _______ 
FCS  = 6 – 4 - 2 = _______ 

The most stable structures is _______ .

If  two  valid  Lewis  structures  have  the  same  absolute  value  of  formal  charges,  the
more  stable  structure  is  the  one  with  a  negative  charge  on  the  more  electronegative
atom. 
CH3  usually represents a 
____________ group.  These 
groups are always terminal. 

For “chain” molecules, atoms
usually written in order.
Terminal atoms usually follow 
the atom to which they are
attached.

III. RESONANCE STRUCTURES 
For certain molecules, more than one Lewis structure is needed to correctly describe
the valence electron structure of the molecule.

We might expect one short O=O bond and one long O-O bond, but experimental 
evidence demonstrates that the two bonds are __________________. 

Thus, the two structures are equivalent. A better model is to blend the structures as
denoted with the brackets and arrows below, a resonance hybrid. 

Electrons in resonance structures are ________________. Electron pairs are shared 
over several atoms, not just two. 
Resonance structures are two (or more) structures with the same arrangement of 
____________, but a different arrangement of ________________.
