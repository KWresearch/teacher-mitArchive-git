19.1 

Chemical reactions reach a state of dynamic equilibrium in which the rates of forward and 
reverse reactions are equal and there is no net change in composition. 

Consider: 
N2(g) + 3H2(g) 

2NH3(g)  ∆G° = -32.90 kJ/mol 

conc 

time 

When the reaction mixture has not produced enough products to have reached equilibrium, the 
spontaneous direction of change is toward more products (∆Gforward reaction  ___ 0). 

When excess products are present (ex. pure ammonia), the reverse reaction is spontaneous 
(∆Gforward reaction  ______ 0).

Progress of reaction 

19.2

The reaction free energy (∆G) changes as the proportion of reactants and products change.  To 

find out how ∆G changes with composition of reactants and products, we need to know how the

molar free energy of each substance varies with its partial pressure (if gas), or with its

concentration (if solute).


∆G =  ∆G° + RT ln Q


Where

∆G = reaction free energy at any definite, fixed composition of the reaction mixture.

∆G° = is the difference in molar free energy of the products and reactants in their standard states.

R = universal gas constant, T = Temperature, and Q = reaction quotient

We can rewrite

∆G = 
or 
∆G =  RT ln (Q/K) 

Relationship between K and Q: 
If Q < K, ∆G is ___________ and the forward reaction will occur 
If Q > K, ∆G is ___________and the reverse reaction will occur 

Example:  N2(g) + 3H2(g) 

2NH3(g)

If K=1.9 x 10-4  at 400°C, and PN2  = 5.5 bar  PH2=2.2 bar PNH3  = 1.1 bar  at 400°C, which direction 
will the reaction go?

WHAT DOES K TELL US? 

K tells us about the mixture of products and reactants at equilibrium, whether we can expect high 
or low concentration of products at equilibrium. 

when K > 1, __________  products 
when K < 1, _________ products

∆G° = -4.76 kJ/mol  and  K = 6.84 at 298 K 

Start with 1.000 bar of NO2  (reactant) and no N2O4  (product) 
so Q < K  and ∆G < 0, and the reaction goes forward

For K >1, more products at equilibrium.  Large K results from very spontaneous reaction  (very 
negative  ∆G°) 

Relationship between ∆G° and the magnitude of K: 

rewrite ∆G° = -RT ln K as 

K = exp [-∆G° / RT] 

K is large if ∆G° is ??? 

Relationship among equilibrium expressions 

If the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction can be written as the sum of two or more 
chemical equations, the equilibrium constant for the overall reaction is the product of the 
equilibrium constant for the component reactions.

When a balanced equation is multiplied by a constant factor, K is raised to the power of that 
constant factor. 

EXTERNAL EFFECTS ON K 

19.5


Principle of Le Châtelier: A system in equilibrium that is subjected to stress will react in a way 
that tends to minimize the effect of the stress. 

Le Châtelier's principle provides a way to predict qualitatively the direction of change of a 
system under an external perturbation.

1) ADDING MORE REACTANT 
If you are at equilibrium and then add more hydrogen, according to Le Châtelier's principle, the 
system will tend to minimize the increase in the number of hydrogen molecules.  Reaction shifts 
to the right toward product. 

This can be explained in terms of Q and K.  When reactants are added, Q falls below K 
momentarily, because the reactant concentration term appears in the denominator. 

Q = [products]/[reactants] 

K= {[products]/[reactant]} equilibrium 

With Q<K, the system responds by making more products (reaction proceeds in the forward 
direction). 

2) ADDING MORE PRODUCT 

Q rises above K.  Q is larger because product term is in numerator (K is unchanged). With Q>K, 
reaction goes toward reactants (reaction proceeds in the reverse direction). 

3) REMOVING PRODUCT
