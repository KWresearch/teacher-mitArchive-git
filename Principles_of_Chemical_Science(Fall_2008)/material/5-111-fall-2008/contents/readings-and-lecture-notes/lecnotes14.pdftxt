MOLECULAR ORBITAL (MO) THEORY 
In MO  theory,  valence  electrons are _________________ over  the  entire molecule,  not 
confined to individual atoms or bonds, as in Lewis and valence-bond models. 
I. BONDING AND ANTIBONDING ORBITALS 
Molecular  orbitals  (____________________)  of  diatomic molecules  arise  from  adding 
together (superimposing) atomic orbitals: 
linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) to create a molecular orbital. 
Bonding orbitals 

σ:  designates a molecular orbital that is cylindrically symmetric about the bond axis
(with no nodal plane along the bond
axis). 
______ + ______ = ______ ≡ bonding MO 

σ1s  is a wavefunction.

As  with  atomic  wavefunctions,  the  physically  significant  quantity  for  molecular 
wavefunctions is probability density (P). 

P ∝ (______)2  = (_____ + _____)2  = (1sa)2  + (1sb)2  +  2(1sa)(1sb)

interference term

The cross-term represents ____________ interference between the two wavefunctions. 
The result is a ______________ orbital: higher probability density between the nuclei. 

Energy of interaction for bonding orbitals.  The energy _______________ compared 
to the atomic orbitals! 

Molecule is more stable than the individual atoms. 

Antibonding orbitals 
But since electrons are waves, they can also destructively interfere. 

______ - ______ = ______ ≡ antibonding molecular orbital.

Probability density, P ∝ (______)2  = (_____  _____)2  = (1sa)2  + (1sb)2  - 2(1sa)(1sb) 
interference term 
The cross-term represents ____________ interference between the two wavefunctions. 
The result is lower probability density between the nuclei, an antibonding orbital. 
Energy of interaction for antibonding orbitals.  The energy ______________ 
compared to the atomic orbitals! 

σ1s* is an ___________________ orbital. 
•	 Less electron density accumulates between nuclei, exposing nuclei to greater
repulsions. 
•	 Creates an effect exactly opposite to a bond. Antibonding is ____ nonbonding. 
•	 An antibonding orbital is raised in energy by approximately the same amount
that the bonding orbital is lowered in energy.

and 2 e-s went into an antibonding 
orbital, no net gain or lowering in energy.
