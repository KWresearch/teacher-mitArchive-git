2NO (g)  + O2  (g) →  2NO2  (g)


It is experimentally determined that the rate of formation of NO2  is kobs  [NO]2[O2]

Step 2 

k2 
O2  + N2O2  →  NO2  +  NO2 

What is the rate of NO2  formation?  NO2  is formed in step 2 and the rate equals: 

rate of formation of NO2  = 2k2  [O2][N2O2] 

(The factor of 2 appears because two molecules of NO2  are formed; so the concentration of NO2

increases twice as fast as the concentration of N2O2  decreases).


but this expression includes an intermediate, [N2O2], and is therefore not acceptable.


Solve for [N2O2] in terms of reactants, products, and rate constants: 

net rate of formation of N2O2  = k1  [NO]2  - k-1  [N2O2] - k2  [N2O2][O2] 

33.2 

At this point, we use the steady-state approximation. 

Steady-state approximation ≡  net rate of formation of an intermediate equals zero or 
rate of formation of an intermediate equals the rate of disappearance of an intermediate. 

Net rate = 0 = k1  [NO]2  – k-1  [N2O2]  - k2  [N2O2][O2] 

solving for [N2O2]: 

rearranging: 

substituting into "rate of formation of NO2  = 2k2  [O2][N2O2]" 

rate of formation of NO2  = 2 k1 k2  [O2] [NO]2 
k-1  + k2  [O2] 

This would be the answer if the mechanism had no fast or slow steps. The above rate law is 
inconsistent with the experimentally determined rate law, so the mechanism must have fast and 
slow steps. 

What if the first step is proposed to be fast and reversible, and the second step is proposed to be 
slow?

Step 2

O2  + N2O2  →  NO2  +  NO2 

The slowest elementary step in a sequence of reactions is called the rate determining step (RDS). 
A rate determining step is so much slower than the rest of the steps that it governs the rate of the 
overall reaction. 

33.3 
Given this proposal about fast and slow steps, we can simply our expression for the intermediate 

[N2O2] 

= 

k1  [NO]2 
k-1  +  k2  [O2] 

by considering that the decomposition of N2O2  is faster than the consumption of N2O2. Therefore: 

k-1  [N2O2] 

rate of 
decomposition 
of [N2O2] 

>>> 

is 
faster 
than 

k2  [N2O2][O2] 

rate of consumption 

and k-1  >> k2  [O2] and the term "k2  [O2]" drops out 

[N2O2] = k1  [NO]2 
k-1 

or 

[N2O2]  =  k1 
[NO]2 
k-1 

equilibrium expression for the 1st  step 

When a reversible fast step is followed by a slow step, the first step is in equilibrium.  Not much 

of the product is being siphoned off by the second step, so an equilibrium is reached.

The rate is determined by the slowest step 

The rate of formation of O2  is equal to 2 times the rate of the slow step (k2[O][O3]), since two 
molecules of O2  are formed. 

Thus, rate of formation of O2  = 2k2[O][O3], but “O” is an intermediate, solve for “O” in terms of 
products and reactants and rate constants. 

Since the first step is fast and reversible and the second step is slow, the first step is in 
equilibrium and we can write 

[O2][O]  =  k1  = K1 

or

Another Example 
If you know the experimental rate law (rate = kobs  [NO][Br2]), you can determine which step is 
slow.

rearranging:

k-1  +  k2  [NO]

Substituting: 

rate of formation of NOBr  =  2k1k2 [NO] 2 [Br2 ] 
k-1  +  k2  [NO] 
k2[NO] >> k-1
