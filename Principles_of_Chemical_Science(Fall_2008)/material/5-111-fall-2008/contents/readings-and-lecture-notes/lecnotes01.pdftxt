5.111 PRINCIPLES OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE Fall 2008 
This subject deals primarily with the fundamental principles and concepts of chemistry.  There 
are three lectures and two recitations each week.  In addition to homework assignments, three 
hour-long examinations and a regularly scheduled final examination are given.

GRADING: 

HOMEWORK is due on the days specified on the  calendar. Late problem sets are not accepted. 
Adjustments  for  missed  homework  resulting  from  excused  absences  will  be  made  in  the  fina l 
grade . Inform your TA if you are ill or experience other catastrophes.

HOUR EXAMS  and the  final exam are  closed-book and  closed-notes.  Most  required equations 
and  a  periodic  table  will  be  provided.  You  will  need  to  bring  a  pencil,  an  eraser ,  and  a  basic 
scientific calculator . Make-up exams will not be given. 
CLASSROOM  CLICKERS  w ill  be  used  to  facilitate  interaction  and  to  take  attendance  and 
administer  in  class  “quizzes”.  Each  student w ill  be  assigned  a  clicker  during  the  first  recitation
section.  If  you  already  have  a  physics  clicker ,  you  may  register  that  clicker  with  chemistry  as
well.  It  is  your  responsibility  to  register  your  clicker  number  with  your  TA,  bring  your  clicker
to every lecture . Using someone else’s clicker  is an act ionable offence. Additiona l information  is 
provided on the attached clicker po licy sheet. 
SIGNIFICANT  FIGURES.  Rules  for  scient ific  notation  and  significant  figures  are  available  in
the back of our  textbook  in Appendix 1, pages A5-A6. You are also  responsible  for knowing  the 
follow ing SI prefixes: n (nano, 10-9), µ (micro, 10-6), m (milli, 10-3), c (centi, 10-2), and k (kilo, 103). 
LAPTOPS.  Laptops  should  not  be  open  or  in  use  during  class.  You  will  be  given  lecture 
handouts each day, so there is no need to type lecture notes.

5.111 Classroom Clicker Policies for Fall 2008 
We  will  use  classroom  response  devices  in  5.111  during  lectures  to  take  attendance,  enable
feedback,  and  facilitate  occasiona l  in-class  quizzes.  We  have  out lined  the  following  points  to 
help clarify the class policies regarding clicker use . 
Why are we using clickers? 
1)	 Clickers  give  us  additional  feedback  on  whether  the  class  as  a  who le  understands  a
given  concept  or  when  our  explanat ions  need  to  be  expanded  or  clarified.  This  enables 
us to gauge the understanding of the entire class and adjust our lessons accordingly. 
2)	 Clickers  a lso  provide  you  as  a  student  feedback  on  how  well  you  understand  the 
material  and  how  fast  you  are  able  to  solve  problems.  For  example ,  if  you  are  able  to 
solve  the  homework  problems  but  run  out  of  t ime  on  in-class  clicker  quest ions,  it  is  a
good  indicat ion  that  you  will  be  pinched  for  time  on  the  exam  and  may  need  to  work
through more practice problems to increase you speed. 
3)	 We feel it is appropriate to reward the many students that consistently come to class and
participate.  In  addit ion,  because  we  take  attendance  we  feel  more  comfortable  posting
lecture notes online . 
Answering in-class clicker questions: 
For  in-class  responses,  the  clicker  rece iver  will  record  your  final  answer  during  open
polling.  This means you can click as many answers as you like during an open slide , but
only the last click will be recorded as your answer . 
•	 Apart  from  announced  in-class  quiz  quest ions,  you  will  NOT  be  graded  on  whether 
you answer clicker questions correctly. 
For  routine  clicker  questions,  you  are  encouraged  to  attempt  the  question  on  you  own,
but  you  are  certainly  allowed  to  quietly  discuss  the  problem  with  your  ne ighbor .  For 
announced quiz questions, any talking or sharing answers is considered cheating. 
It  is  an  actionable  offence  to  use  another  classmate’s  clicker  during  class  or  to  have  a
classmate answer an attendance or quiz question using your clicker. 
Attendance details: 
•	 Class attendance will be  recorded each day using  the  clickers.  It  is your  responsibility  to
bring your clicker with you as part of being prepared for class. 
If  you  have  an  excused  absence  from  class,  such  as  an  illness  or  family  emergency,  you
should  contact  your  TA  within  one  day  of  your  absence.  Excused  absences  that  are 
reported w ithin this time frame will not damage your attendance or quiz grade. 
If  you  forget  to  bring  your  clicker  to  class,  you  should  check  in with  your  TA  before  or 
after lecture to record your attendance.
