I.  (FAILURE OF) THE CLASSICAL DESCRIPTION OF AN ATOM 

Coulomb’s Force Law to describe the F between the nucleus and electron in an H atom. 

F(r)  = 

     
-e 2 
4πε0r2 

Consider an H atom (Z=1) with 1 electron and 1 proton. 

e = absolute value of an electron’s charge 
r = distance between two charges 
ε0 = permittivity constant of a vacuum (8.854 x 10-12 C2J-1m-1) 
electron 
-e

 

 

When r → ∞ 

F(r) = ________

As r → 0 

F(r) = ________ 

r 

+e 
H nucleus 

The closer the electron is to the nucleus, the larger the attractive force between the two 
charges. 

•  The Coulomb force law tells us the force (F) as a function of r. 
•  The Coulomb force law does not tell us how r changes with ________________. 
There  is  a CLASSICAL  EQUATION OF MOTION  that  tells  us  how  the  electron  and 
nucleus move under influence of this Coulomb force: Newton’s 2nd Law 

F = ma 

Force = mass times acceleration 

We can rewrite F as a function of velocity, F = m(_______) or distance, F = m(d2r/dt2). 

We  can plug  in  the Coulomb  force  law  for  F,  and  solve  the  equation  for  any  rinitial.  If 
rinitial is 10 Å (10-10 m), a typical distance for an H atom, the calculation indicates that 
r = 0 at t = _______ sec! 

This predicts that the electron should plummet into the nucleus in ______________! 

What is wrong here?  

It turns out that the laws of classical mechanics no longer work at this size scale.  

Need a new kind of mechanics to describe this and other “unsettling” observations.  


QUANTUM MECHANICS provides a single and comprehensive theory that explains the 
behavior of matter on an atomic (nanometer or smaller) scale. 

II. AN INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS 

•  Matter and radiation display both _______________ and particle-like properties. 
•  Light consists of discrete packets of energy (called photons). 

We’ll briefly set aside our discussion of atomic structure (to be returned to in Lecture #5) 
to discuss these two sets of observations that are essential for understanding the atom. 

THE WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY OF MATTER AND RADIATION 

Between 1887 and 1927 experiments were done that suggested the boundry between 
waves and particles is not rigid. 

III. LIGHT AS A WAVE, CHARACTERISTICS OF WAVES 

We’ll begin by describing some general properties of waves, including water waves, 
sound waves and light (electromagnetic or EM) waves. 

Waves have a periodic variation of some quantity.

a perpendicular magnetic field).

The electric field is the force field through which the Coulomb force operates. 

We can characterize an electromagnetic wave in terms of: 

Amplitude (a): the deviation from an average level 
Wavelength (λ): the __________________ between successive maxima or minima 
Frequency (ν): the number of ________________ per unit time

We can also characterize electromagnetic radiation using the complete mathematical 
description for a wave: 

E(x,t) = _____________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

E = __________________ 
x = __________________ 
t = ___________________ 

The  EM  wave  is  a  function  of  two  variables,  x  and  t.  For  visualization,  let’s  hold  one 
variable constant and plot it as a function of the other variable. (So we will plot the wave at 
a fixed time as a function of position, or at a fixed position as a function of time.) 

First we will examine an EM wave at a constant time. 
At t = 0

E(x,0) = a (its maximum), when x = ___________________________________ 
Note: any  time we  see an equation of a wave, we automatically know  its amplitude, a. We 
also know its maximum intensity:  intensity = __________ 

We can also describe an EM wave at a constant position. 
At x = 0 

E(0,t) = _________________

a = maximum amplitude

•  E(0,t) = a (its maximum), when t = …-3/ν, -2/ν, -1/ν, 0, 1/ν, 2/ν, 3/ν… 
•  Units of frequency (ν) : cycles per second = _______ 

We can calculate the speed of a wave: 

Speed = distance traveled / time elapsed = ____________ = __________ 

Electromagnetic radiation has a constant speed, c (the “speed of light”). 

λν = c = 2.9979 x 108 ms-1 

For any wavelength of light, the product of λ * ν is always c.  λ and ν are NOT independent 
of each other.  If you know λ, you can calculate ν.  If you know ν, you can calculate λ.

The color of EM waves is determined by their wavelength: 

RED  has longest  λ 
YELLOW 
GREEN 
BLUE  has shortest  λ 

~650 nm (6.5 x 10-7 m) 
~580 nm (5.8 x 10-7 m) 
~520 nm (5.2 x 10-7 m) 
~460 nm (4.6 x 10-7 m) 

and lowest ν 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and highest ν 

4.6 x 1014 Hz 
5.2 x 1014 Hz 
5.8 x 1014 Hz 
6.5 x 1014 Hz 

Visible light is only a small part of the entire electromagnetic spectrum: 

 

 

 

 

radio waves 
microwaves 
infrared 
visible
ultraviolet 
x-rays 
gamma-rays 

 

λ = 1 m – 108 m 

λ = 10-3 m – 1 m 

λ = 10-6 m 10-3 m 

λ = 10-7 m 10-6 m 

λ = 10-8 m 10-7 m 

λ = 10-11 m 10-9 m 

λ < 10-11 m 


(You are not responsible for knowing specific wavelength or frequency ranges, but you 
should know the relative order of colors and types of waves.) 
MIT Chemistry Research Example: 
Research  in  the  Bawendi  laboratory  includes  the  synthesis  and  application  of  quantum 
dots, semiconductor crystals of <10 nm in diameter. Quantum dots excited by UV radiation 
emit  light  of  characteristic  color  that  corresponds  to  the  size  and material  of  the  quantum 
dot.    Smaller  dots  emit  bluer  (higher  frequency)  light  and  larger  dots  emit  redder  (lower 
frequency)  light.  Quantum  dots  are  being  used  and  designed  for  an  ever-increasing 
number of biological and sensor applications.

IV. LIGHT AS A PARTICLE 

The Photoelectric Effect 

A beam of light hitting a metal surface can eject electrons. 

UV light (ν) 

e -
K.E.= (1/2)mv2 

metal 

The frequency, ν, of the incoming light must be equal to some threshold frequency, ν0, for 
an electron to be emitted. The ν0 value depends on the identity of the metal. 
At a constant intensity, the frequency of the light has no effect on the number of electrons 
ejected, as long as the frequency is above ν0.  (Below ν0, no electrons are emitted.)

The following (very surprising!) observations were made: 

The kinetic energy, K.E., of ejected electros was measured as function of the frequency of 
the incident light:

These data were in direct opposition to the predictions of classical mechanics. In 1905 
Einstein analyzed plots of K.E. as a function of frequency for different metals and found 
that all of the data fit into a linear form

Einstein could rewrite the equation of the line: 

y = mx + b 

K.E = _______ - _______ 

hν = the energy of the incident light = Ei 

Einstein postulated (1905) 

1)  The energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency!!! 

E = hν 

2)  Light is made up of energy “packets” called “photons” 

This provided a new model for the photoelectric effect: 

hν = Ei = energy of the incident photon  

hν0 = _______________________ = energy required to eject an e- from the surface of a metal.

We can describe this mathematically: 

K.E. = _________________ 

or 

Ei = _________________ 

(Note: these are just different forms of the equation K.E = hν  - hν0)
