2. Base in water 

NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4

+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

Base ionization constant Kb = 

[NH4

+] [OH-]

[NH3 ] 

Kb  is 1.8 x 10-5  at 25°C.  This small value tells us that only a small amount of NH3 is present as 
NH4
+. A strong base reacts essentially completely to give OH- (aq) when put in water.  NH3 is not 
a strong base.  It is a moderately weak base. 

B (aq) + H2O (l) 
A- (aq) + H2O (l)

3.  Conjugate acids and bases 

The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. 
The stronger the base, the weaker its conjugate acid. 

Consider conjugate acid-base pair NH3  and NH4

+: 

NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4

+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

NH4

+  (aq) + H2O (l) 

H3O+  (aq) + NH3  (aq) 

Multiply K's together and get: 

Ka x Kb  = 

[NH3 ][H3O+]

log Ka + log Kb = log Kw  or  pKa + pKb = pKw = 14.00

Equilibrium involving weak acids 

Example: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, HC6H7O6) has a Ka  of 8.0 x 10-5.  Calculate the pH of a 
solution made by dissolving 500. mg in 100. mL of water. 

0.500 g x 1 mol/176.126 g = 2.84 x 10-3  mol 
2.84 x 10-3  mol/0.100 L = 0.0284 M

x = 0.00151 (really 2 sf, but carry extra) 

Check assumption. Is 0.0284 - 0.00151 ~= 0.0284?

You can use assumption if x is less than 5% of the value in question.

Here (0.00151/0.0284) x 100% = 5.3% (more than 5%), so must use the quadratic equation.

Using quadratic eq, x = 0.00147 (really 2 sf)


pH = -log [1.47 x 10-3  ] = 2.83

pH of salt solutions 
A salt is formed by the neutralization of an acid by a base.  The pH of salt in water is not always 
neutral. 

Salts that contain the conjugate acids of weak bases produce acidic aqueous solutions; so do salts 
that contain small, highly charged metal cations (e.g. Fe3+). (Note: all Group 1 and 2 metals (e.g. 
Li+, Ca+2) and all metal cations with charge +1 (e.g. Ag+1) are neutral.) Salts that contain the 
conjugate bases of weak acids produce basic aqueous solution.

For the following solutions, predict the pH as acidic, neutral, or basic 

1) NH4Cl (aq) 

NH4

+	

Is NH4
+  a conjugate acid of a weak base? 
Is NH3  a weak base? 

Cl-

Is Cl- a conjugate base of a weak acid? 
Is HCl a weak acid? 

2) NaCH3CO2(aq) 

3) General rule for compound XY 

If yes, then acidic; If no, neutral 
Is X+  a conjugate acid of a weak base? 
X+ 
Y-
If yes, then basic; If no, neutral 
Is Y- a conjugate base of a weak acid? 
Overall: acidic+neutral=acidic; basic+neutral=basic;neutral+neutral=neutral 

Buffers 

A buffer solution is any solution that maintains an approximately constant pH despite small 
additions of acid and base. 

An acid buffer: consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base supplied as a salt.  It buffers on 
the acidic side of neutral. 

A base buffer: consists of a weak base and its conjugate acid supplied as a salt.  It buffers on the 
basic side of neutral. 

22.6


Acid Buffer Example: Mix acetic acid with an acetate salt and get dynamic equilibrium: 
- (aq) 
H3O+  (aq)  + CH3CO2
CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) 

What happens if strong acid is added to a solution containing approximately equal amounts of 
CH3CO2  and CH3COOH?  The newly formed H3O+  ions transfer hydrogen ions (protons) to 
-
CH3CO2  generating CH3COOH and H2O molecules (back reaction).  The added H3O+  ions are 
-
effectively removed and the pH stays constant. 

If OH- base is added, the base removes a proton from CH3COOH to form H2O and CH3CO2 
-
molecules.  The added OH- ions are effectively removed and the pH stays constant. 

Acid buffer action: The weak acid, HA, transfers protons to OH- ions supplied by strong base. 
The conjugate base, A-, of the weak acid accepts protons from the H3O+  ions supplied by a strong 
acid. 

A strong acid and the salt of its conjugate base don't make a good buffer. Why? 

Base Buffer Example: NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4

+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

When strong acid is added, NH3  accepts protons from incoming acid to make NH4
+.  When 

+  donates a proton to form NH3  and H2O.  pH remains the same.

strong base is added, NH4

Base buffer action: The weak base, B, accepts protons supplied by strong acid.

The conjugate acid, BH+, of the weak base transfers protons to the OH- ions supplied by a strong

base.


A buffer is a mixture of weak conjugate acids and bases that stabilize the pH of a solution by

providing a source or sink for protons.


Sample Buffer Problem: Suppose 1.00 mol of HCOOH and 0.500 mol of NaHCOO are added to 
water and diluted to 1.0 L. Calculate the pH. (Ka  = 1.77 x 10-4)

Now - what  if 0.100 mol of a strong acid (HCl) had been included in the 1.0 L solution.


Because 0.100 mol of HCl reacts with equal number of moles of HCOO- to form equal moles of 
HCOOH: 

For HCOO-, 0.500 mol - 0.100 mol = 0.400 mol 

[HCOO-] = 0.400 mol/1.0 L =0.400 M 

For HCOOH, 1.00 mol + 0.100 mol = 1.10 mol 

[HCOOH] = 1.10 mol/1.0 L =1.10 M

pH = 3.31 

So addition of 0.10 mol of strong acid only changed pH from 3.45 to 3.31 

Designing a Buffer 

One must consider the relationship between the ratio of [HA] to [A-], pKa, and pH in designing a 
buffer.

Ka = 

[HA] 

Rearrange: 

[H3O+]  =  Ka  x 

[HA] 

[A -] 

Take logarithms of both sides: 

log  [H3O+]  =  log  Ka  + 

log 

[HA] 

[A -] 

Multiply by (-) : 

-log  [H3O+]  =  -log  Ka 

-

That is:

[HA]

eq 

The values of [HA] and [A-] in the equation are at equilibrium. However, a weak acid HA 
typically loses only a tiny fraction of its protons, so [HA] is negligibly different from the 
molarity of the acid used prepare the buffer.  Likewise, only a tiny fraction of the weakly basic 
anions of A- accept protons, so [A-] is negligibly different from the molarity of the base used to 
prepare the buffer.

So

Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation 

This assumption is valid when [H3O+] is small compared to [HA] and [A-] (i.e. less than 5%).

Example: Design a buffer system with pH 4.60. 
Acetic acid is suitable with a pKa  of 4.75 
A buffer solution is most effective in the range of pKa  ±1 

pH  =  pKa  -

 

log 

[CH3COOH]0 
[CH3COO-]0 

log 

[CH3COOH]0
[CH3COO-]0 

=  pKa  - pH  = 4.75  - 4.60  =  0.15 
 
 
 

[CH3COOH]0 
[CH3COO-]0 

=  100.15  = 1.4 

The ratio is more important than the amounts used.  However, the amounts do affect the capacity 
of the buffer to resist changes in pH.  Higher concentrations = more resistance to change. 

If you use too low concentrations, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation won’t be valid. 

For pH 4.60, [H3O+] is 2.5 x 10-5. 

2.5 x 10-5 
x 100%  < 5% 
[HA] or [A-] 

need concentration > 5.0 x 10-4 M
