I.  POLAR COVALENT BONDS/POLAR MOLECULES (continued from Lect. #12) 
A polar covalent bond is an unequal sharing of e-s between two atoms with different 
electronegativities (χ).  In general, a bond between two atoms with an χ difference of 
> _____ and < _____ (on the Pauling scale) is considered polar covalent. 
Polar molecules have a non-zero net dipole moment. 

In large organic molecules and in biomolecules, such as proteins, we often consider 
the number of polar groups within the molecule. 

For example, let’s compare vitamin A to vitamin B9

II.  THE SHAPES OF MOLECULES: VALENCE SHELL ELECTRON PAIR 
REPULSION (VSEPR) THEORY 

The  shape  (  _______________  )  of  molecules  influences  physical  and  chemical 
properties, including melting point, boiling point, and reactivity. 
Shape  is particularly  important  in biological  systems where,  for example,  a molecule
must fit precisely into the active site of an enzyme. 

VSEPR  Theory  can  be  used  to  predict molecular  geometry with  high  accuracy.  The 
theory is based on Lewis structure and the principles that 
•	 valence electron pairs ___________ each other. 
the geometry around  the central atom will be such as to minimize the electron
•	
repulsion. 
VSEPR nomenclature: 
A = ______________ atom 
X = ______________ atom

E = lone pair


General guidelines for the VSEPR model: 
•  ______________ number (SN) is used to predict geometries.

SN = (# of atoms bonded to central atom) + (# of lone pairs on central atom)

Note:  When  considering  electron-pair  repulsion,  double  bonds  and  triple bonds  can 
be treated like single bonds.  This approximation is valid for qualitative purposes. 

AX2E 

SN = ____ 

A 

AX2E  SN = 3

This means  the  number  of  ______________  bonded  to  the  central  atom  is  important, 
not the BONDS to central atom.

If a molecule has two or more resonance structures, the VSEPR model can be
applied to any one of them. 
If there is more than 1 central atom in a molecule, consider the bonding about
each atom independently.

B. Molecules with lone pairs
When lone pairs are involved, additional details must be considered. 
Attractive  forces  exerted  by  the  nuclei  of  the  two  bonded  atoms  hold  electrons  in  a 
bond. These electrons have less "spatial distribution" than lone pairs, meaning 
•  electrons in bonds take up ___________ space. 
lone-pair e-s take up more space, and therefore experience ________ repulsion. 
• 
Thus, according to VSEPR, the repulsive forces decrease in the following order: 
lone-pair/lone-pair  >  lone-pair/bonding-pair  >  bonding-pair/bonding-pair

Rationalization of shapes based on VSEPR theory

• AX4E molecules have a seesaw shape. An axial lone pair would repel ____ bonding 
electron pairs strongly, whereas an equatorial lone pair repels only ____ strongly. 

axial lone pair 

equatorial lone pair 

• AX3E2  molecules have a ___________. Lone pairs occupy two of the three equatorial 
positions, and these lone-pair electrons move away from each other slightly. 

AX3E2 

SN = 5 

•  AX4E2  molecules  are  square  planar.  The  two  lone  pairs  are  farthest  apart  when 
they are on opposite sides of the central atom. 

AX4E2 

SN = 6 

• In molecules with lone-pair e-s, angles between bonded atoms tend to be _________
relative to the equivalent SN structures where only bonding electrons are present. 
Example: NH3 

SN = 4 

Instead of an angle of 109.5° (as in CH4), the angle is 106.7°.

•  Atomic size _____________ down a column of the periodic table.

Therefore,  lone-pairs  occupy  larger  spatial  volumes  as  one  moves  down  a  column,

and  the  angles  between  bonded  atoms  tend  to  be  even  smaller  relative  to  the

equivalent SN structures where only bonding electrons are present.

Example: compare PH3  to NH3. 
Instead of an angle of 109.5° (as in CH4), or 106.7° (as in NH3),
SN = 4
the angle is _______°.

The  ideas  of  VSEPR  make  possible  many  predictions  (or  rationalizations)  of 
molecular geometries about a central atom.  There are very few incorrect predictions. 
However,  VSEPR  provides  no  information  about  energies  of  bonds  or  about  how
multiple bonds affect structure.
