ENERGY LEVELS (continued from Lecture #5) 
The Rydberg formula can be used to calculate the frequency (and also the E or λ,
using E = hν or λ = c/ν ) of light emitted or absorbed by any 1-electron atom or ion. 

nf > ni  in ___________________.  Electrons absorb energy causing them to go from a lower 
to a higher E level. 
ni > nf  in ___________________.  Electrons emit energy causing them to go from a higher to 
a lower E level. 

I. WAVEFUNCTIONS (ORBITALS) FOR THE HYDROGEN ATOM 
When solving H Ψ = EΨ, the solutions are En  and Ψ(r,θ,φ). 
Ψ(r,θ,φ) ≡ stationary state wavefunction: time-independent 
In solutions for Ψ(r,θ,φ), two new quantum numbers appear!  A total of 3 quantum 
numbers are needed to describe a wavefunction in 3D. 
n  ≡  principal quantum number 
1. 
n	 =  1, 2, 3 … … ∞

determines binding energy

l  ≡  angular momentum quantum number 
l	 =  _____________________________________

l is related to n

largest value of l = n – 1

determines angular momentum

m ≡  magnetic quantum number 
m =  _____________________________________ 
m is related to l 
largest value is +l, smallest is –l 
determines behavior of atom in magnetic field 
To completely describe an orbital, we need to use all three quantum numbers: 
Ψnlm(r,θ,φ) 
The wavefunction describing the ground state is ________________ .

100  orbital is instead called the “___” orbital.

Using the terminology of chemists, the 
Ψ 
An orbital is (the spatial part) of a wavefunction;  n(shell)  l(subshell)  m(orbital)


l = 0 ⇒ ___ orbital  l = 1 ⇒ ___ orbital  l = 2 ⇒ ___ orbital  l = 3 ⇒ ___ orbital 
for l = 1:  m = 0  _____ orbital,  m = ±1 states combine to give ____ and ____ orbitals

II. SHAPES OF H-ATOM WAVEFUNCTIONS: S ORBITALS 
THE PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF A WAVEFUNCTION 
Max Born (German physicist, 1882-1970). The probability of finding a particle (the
electron!) in a defined region is proportional to the square of the wavefunction. 
[Ψnlm(r,θ,φ)]2  =  PROBABLITY DENSITY 
probability of finding an electron per unit volume at r, θ, φ 

To consider the shapes of orbitals, let’s first rewrite the wavefunction as the product of a 
radial wavefunction, Rnl(r ), and an angular wavefunction Ylm(θ,φ) 
Ψnlm(r,θ,φ)]  =  _________  x  _________ 
for a ground state H-atom: 

where a0  = ____________________________ (a constant) = 52.9 pm 
•  For all s orbitals (1s, 2s, 3s, etc.), the angular wavefunction, Y, is a ______________. 
•  s-orbitals are spherically symmetrical – independent of _____ and_____.

NODE:  A value for r, θ, or φ for which Ψ (and Ψ2) = ______.  In general, an orbital 
has n -1 nodes.

RADIAL NODE:  A value for ______ for which Ψ (and Ψ2) = 0.  In other words, a

radial node is a distance from the radius for which there is no probability of finding

an electron.

In general, an orbital has 
n - 1 – l radial nodes. 
1s: 
1– 1– 0= 0 radial nodes 
2s: 
____ – ____ – ____ = ____ radial nodes 
3s: 
____ – ____ – ____ = ____ radial nodes 

III. RADIAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION 
Probability of finding an electron in a spherical shell of thickness dr at a distance r
from origin.

We can plot the radial probability distribution as a function of radius.
Radial probability distribution for a hydrogen 1s orbital: 

Maximum probability or most probable value of r is denoted rmp.

rmp  for a 1s H atom = a0  = 0.529 x 10–10 m = 0.529Å 
a0  ≡ BOHR radius


1913  Niels Bohr (Danish scientist) predicted quantized levels for H atom prior to 
QM  development,  with  the  electron  in  well-
defined circular orbits. 
This was still a purely particle picture of the e– . 

But,  an  electron does not have well-defined  orbits!  The best we  can do  is  to  find  the 
probability of finding e–  at some position r. 
Knowing  only  probability  is  one  of  main  consequences  of  Quantum  Mechanics.
Unlike  CM,  QM  is  non-deterministic.  The  uncertainty  principle  forbids  us  from 
knowing r exactly.
