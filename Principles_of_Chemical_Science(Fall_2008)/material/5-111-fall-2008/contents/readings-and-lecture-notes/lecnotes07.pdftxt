I. RADIAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS (RPD) FOR S-ORBITALS 
Radial Probability Distribution: The probability of finding an electron in a spherical
shell of thickness dr at a distance r from the origin. 

Knowing  only  probability  is  one  of  main  consequences  of  Quantum  Mechanics.
Unlike  CM,  QM  is  non-deterministic.  The  uncertainty  principle  forbids  us  from 
knowing r exactly. 

II. P ORBITALS 
•  For any subshell of l = 1, there are three p-orbitals, _____, _____, and _____. 
•  m = ±1 states combine to give px  and py  orbitals. m = 0  is called the pz  orbital.

A. THE SHAPE OF P-ORBITALS 
•	 Unlike  s orbitals,  p-orbitals  have θ,  φ dependence.  P-orbitals _____________  spherically 
symmetrical. 
p orbitals consist of  two  lobes  (of opposite  sign)  separated by a _____________ plane on 
which  Ψ = 0 (and Ψ2  = 0). 
•	 There is zero probability of finding a p-electron in a nodal plane. Thus, there is ________ 
probability of finding a p-electron at the nucleus.

Nodal planes (planes that have no electron density) arise from angular nodes in the
wavefunction. 
•	 Angular nodes:  values of ______ or ______ at which Ψ (and Ψ2)  = 0. 
•	 Recall from Lecture #6: Radial nodes are values of r at which Ψ (and Ψ2) = 0. 

In general, an orbital has: 
n – 1 
total nodes 
___________  angular nodes 
___________  radial nodes 

For 2s: _________ = ____ total nodes 
_________ = ____ angular nodes

Interpreting RPD plots 
•	 As n increases (from 1 to 2 to 3), the orbital rmp “size” ______________. 
•	 As l increases (from s to p to d) for a given n, the orbital rmp  “size”___________. 
•	 Only  electrons  in  s  states  have  a  substantial probability  of  being very  close  to
nucleus. This means  that although  the  “size” of  s orbitals is  larger  than p or d
orbitals, s-electrons are the ___________ shielded. 

III.  ELECTRON SPIN AND THE FOURTH QUANTUM NUMBER 
From quantum mechanics, a fourth quantum number appears that describes the spin
of an electron within an orbital. 
Spin magnetic quantum number, ______ 

3 

There is no classical analogy to spin. 
•	 An electron can have two spin states:

ms  = ________ (spin up)  or  ms  = _______ (spin down).

•	 Similar  to  the  angular  momentum  quantum  number,  l,  ms  describes  the 
magnitude of an angular momentum.  However, ms  completes the description
of an __________________ and is NOT dependent on the orbital. 
The property of electron spin was first proposed by S. Goudsmit and G. Uhlenbeck in
1925 to explain tiny deviations from the expected frequencies of spectral lines: 

_______________ 
_________________ 
observed ν 
expected ν	
So we can describe a given orbital using three quantum numbers (n, l, ml) and a given 
electron using 4 quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms). 

!nlml	
describes an ___________ 

!nlmlm s 
describes an ___________ 

PAULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE 
No two electrons in the same atom can have the same four quantum numbers.  In other words, 
no two electrons can be in the same orbital and have the same spin. 

The Pauli exclusion principle limits an atom to  ________ electrons per orbital. 

ie. How many electrons in a single atom can have the following two quantum 
numbers: n = 4 and ml = -2?  _______
