I. LIGHT AS A PARTICLE 

A) The Photoelectric Effect (continued from Lecture #3) 

The energy of an incoming photon (Ei) must be equal to or greater than the workfunction 
(�) of the metal in order to eject an electron.

 e- __________ ejected

 e- __________ ejected

  e- __________ ejected


Three photons, each with an energy equal to �/2 will NOT eject an electron!

The # of electrons ejected from the surface of a metal is proportional to the ______________ 
of photons absorbed by the metal (assuming Ei � �), and not the energy of the photons. 

•	 Thus, the intensity (I) of the light (energy/sec) is proportional to the # of photons 
ejected/sec. 
•	 High intensity means more __________________ and NOT more _________________. 

Unit of intensity (I) : W = ___________ 

Terminology tips to help solve problems involving photons and electrons: 

•	 photons: also called light, electromagnetic radiation, etc. 
o	 may be described by _____________, _______, or ______ 
•	 electrons: also called photoelectrons. 
o	 may be described by ________, ___________, or � (see part II of today’s notes) 
•	 eV  is a unit of energy = 1.6022 x 10-19 J. 

NOW FOR AN IN-CLASS DEMO OF THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT: 

Metal surface: Zn, � = ________________ 
Incident light sources: 
•	 UV lamp with a � centered at 254 nm 
•	 Red laser pointer (� = 700 nm) 

First, let’s solve the following problems to determine if there is sufficient energy in a single 
photon of UV or of red light to eject an electron from the surface of the Zn plate.  For 
calibration, we’ll also calculate the # of photons in a beam of light. 

Consider our two light sources: a UV lamp (� = 254 nm) and a red laser pointer (� = 700. 
nm). 

1)	 What is the energy per photon emitted by the UV lamp? 
2)	 What is the energy per photon emitted by the red laser pointer? 
3)	 What is the total number of photons emitted by the laser pointer in 60 seconds if the 
intensity (I) = 1.00 mW?

1) What is the energy per photon emitted by the UV lamp?  ��  = 254 nm 

E = _________ 

� = ___________ 

E = ____________ 

E = _______________________________________  E = _________________ 

The UV lamp ________________ have enough energy per photon to eject electrons from the 
surface of a zinc plate (� of Zn = 6.9 x 10-19 J). 

2) What is the energy per photon emitted by the red laser?  ��  = 700. nm 

E =  ____________ 

E = 

(6.626 x10-34 Js)(2.998 x 108 m/s) 

E = _________________ 

___________________ 

The red laser ________________ have enough energy per photon to eject electrons from the 
surface of a zinc plate (� of Zn = 6.9 x 10-19 J). 

3) What is the total number of photons emitted by the red laser in 60 seconds if the 
intensity (I) of the laser is 1.00 mW? 

1.00 mW = 1.00 x 10-3 J/s

 1.00 x 10-3 J  x __________________ x ____________ = 

s


The intensity of a light ________________ related to the energy of its photons.  Intensity is 
related to the number of photons. 
LIGHT IS BOTH A WAVE AND A MASSLESS PARTICLE. Einstein taught us that 
both descriptions (wave and particle) can coexist without a contradiction.

B) PHOTON MOMENTUM 

If light is a stream of particles, each of those particles must have a momentum. Using 
relativistic equations of motion, Einstein showed that a photon has momentum p, 
even though it has zero mass! 

p = h�/c 

and,  since c = ��

 p = _____/_____ 

Observation of photon momentum (Arthur Compton, 1927 Nobel Prize) is another piece 
of evidence for the particle-like behavior of light. 

II.  MATTER AS A WAVE 

1924 Louis de Broglie (PhD thesis and 1929 Nobel Prize!) postulated that just as light 
has  wave-like  and  particle-like  properties,  matter  (electrons)  must  also  be  both 
particle-like  and  a wave-like. Using Einstein's  idea  that  the momentum  of a photon 
(p) = h/�, de Broglie suggested: 

wavelength of a particle = ��  = h/p 

mv = linear momentum (p)  so ��  = h/(mv) 

h = Planck's constant 
m = mass of the particle 
v = speed of the particle 

de Broglie wavelength for matter waves 

��  = h/p = h/(mv) 

Let’s do a sample calculation to think about why matter waves hadn’t previously 
been observed. 

Consider a 5 oz (0.142 kg) baseball crossing home plate at 94 mph (___m/s) (Go Sox!) 

� =  _____  =

Now consider the ��  of a gaseous electron (9�10-31  kg) traveling at 1�105 ms-1: 

� =  h 
mv 

= 

6.626�10-34 kgm2s s 
-2
(9�10-31 kg)  �  (1�105 ms-1) 

� = __________ m = _____ Å.  Compare this � to the diameter of atoms (1-10 Å)! 

Clinton  Davisson  and  Lester  Germer  (1925)  diffracted  electrons  from  a  Ni  crystal 
and observed the resulting interference patterns, thus verifying wave behavior of e-‘s. 

G.P.  Thomson  had  a  similar  discovery.  He  showed  that  electrons  that  passed 
through  a  very  thin  gold  foil  produced  a  diffraction  pattern.  Thomson  shared  the 
1937 Nobel Prize with Davisson for demonstrating that 

ELECTRONS HAVE BOTH WAVELIKE AND PARTICELIKE PROPERTIES. 

If particles like e-‘s have wave properties what is the equation of motion for an e-? 

III. THE SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION 

Microscopic particles,  like  electrons, whose �’s are on  the order of  their  environment 
do  not  obey  classical  equations  of  motion.  Electrons  must  be  treated  like  waves  to 
describe their behavior. 

1927 Erwin Schrödinger wrote an equation of motion for particles (like electrons) that 
account for their wave-like properties. 

Schrödinger equation 
Hˆ � = E.�

�  = wavefunction (describes the particle) 

 
E  = ____________________________ 
Hˆ  = ___________________________ 

For 
the 
the  H  atom,  where 
potential  energy  is  a  function  of 
one  distance  variable, 
r, 
it 
simplifies 
to  use 
the  equation 
spherical  polar  coordinates.  The 
wavefunction  for  the  electron  in an 
H atom is written as a function of r, 
�, and �. 

�� (r, �� , �� )

The Schrödinger equation for the H atom:


The U(r) term is the potential energy of interaction between the e- and nucleus. 

The potential energy of interaction is the Coulomb interaction…

The Schrödinger equation is to quantum mechanics like Newton’s equations of 
motion are to classical mechanics. 

Classical mechanics fails in the realm of microscopic particles- need a more complete 
mechanics- classical mechanics is “contained” within quantum mechanics. 

What does solving the Schrödinger equation mean? 

•  Finding ______ , binding energies of electrons 

•  Finding ______ , wavefunctions or orbitals 

Unlike classical mechanics, the Schrödinger equation correctly predicts (within 10-10 
%!) experimentally observed properties of atoms.
