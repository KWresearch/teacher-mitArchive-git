OXIDATION/REDUCTION REACTIONS 
Guidelines for assigning oxidation numbers 
1) In free elements, each atom has an oxidation number of zero. Example H2 

2) For ions composed of only one atom the oxidation number is equal to the charge on the ion. 
Thus Li+1  has an oxidation number of +1.  Group 1 and group 2 metals have oxidation numbers 
of +1 and +2, respectively.  Aluminum has an oxidation number of +3 in all its compounds. 

3) The oxidation number of oxygen in most compounds is -2.  However, in peroxides such as 
-2, oxygen has an oxidation state of -1. 
H2O2  and O2

4) The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1, except when it is bonded to metals in binary 
compounds, such as LiH, NaH, CaH2.  In these cases, its oxidation number is -1. 

5) F has an oxidation number of -1 in all its compounds.  Other halogens (Cl, Br, and I) have 
negative oxidation numbers when they occur as halide ions in compounds (Ex. NaCl).  However, 
when combined with oxygen (oxoacids), they have positive oxidation numbers (Ex. ClO-). 

6) In a neutral molecule, the sum of the oxidation numbers of all the atoms must be zero.  In a 
polyatomic ion, the sum of oxidation numbers of all the elements in the ion must be equal to the 
net charge of the ion.  For example NH4
+ 

H is  +1 

N is 

_-3 

Sum is  +1 

7) Oxidation numbers do not have to be integers.  For example, the oxidation number of oxygen 
-1 is _ -½ ___ 
in superoxide O2

equals the number of electrons accepted in the reduction. 

6e- + 14H+  +  Cr2O7

2- ⇒  2Cr3+  + 7H2O 

Fe2+  ⇒  Fe3+ +  e-

(7) Add half reaction, make appropriate cancellations. 

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+ +  6e-
6e- +  14H+  +  Cr2O7
B. BALANCE IN BASIC SOLUTION  (Book has a different approach. You can use either.)

Follow steps (1-7) to get your answer for acidic solution: 

14H+  +  Cr2O7

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+ 

(8) Then "adjust pH" by adding OH- to both sides to neutralize H+. 

14OH- + 14H+  +  Cr2O7
OR 

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

14H2O  +  Cr2O7
CANCEL

14H2O  +  Cr2O7

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  7H2O  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

Thus:  7H2O  +  Cr2O7
2- +  6Fe2+ ⇒  2Cr3+  +  6Fe3+  +  14OH-

Today’s material 

An Electrochemical Cell is a device in which an electric current (a flow of electrons through a 
circuit) is either produced by a spontaneous chemical reaction or used to bring about a 
nonspontaneous reaction.  Battery - technically, a battery is a collection of cells joined in a 
series, so the voltage they produce is the sum of the voltages of each cell.

Anode (Oxidation) Electrons produced from oxidation flow out of compartment through a wire. 
Positive charge increases in the compartment due to the production of Zn2+  from Zn0.  To 
maintain neutrality, Cl- flows in through the salt bridge. 

Cathode (Reduction) Elections entering the compartment are consumed in the reduction of Cu 2+ 
to Cu0.  Positive charge decreases and K+  ions migrate through the salt bridge and enter the 
cathodic compartment to maintain the charge. 

25.5


Overall, the electrochemical cell may be represented by: 

Zn (s) | Zn2+  (aq) ||  Cu2+  (aq) |Cu (s) 

Phase boundaries are represented by "|" 
The salt bridge is represented by "||" 

In the above electrochemical cell, Zn is consumed and Cu is deposited in a quantity proportional 
to the charge passed (Faraday's Law). 

Example: How much Zn is consumed and how much Cu is deposited if a current of 1.0 A flows 
for 1.0 hours? 

Step1. Find how much charge passed though the circuit.

experiments.  A Pt electrode, which is inert, can be used.

A Hydrogen Electrode constructed with Pt is commonly used.  Many reduction potentials are 
measured against a Standard Hydrogen Electrode (S.H.E).  The hydrogen electrode is denoted: 

H+  (aq) | H2  (g) | Pt (s) 

Pt (s) | H2  (g) | H+  (aq) 

when it acts as a cathode (H+  is reduced) and 

when it acts as an anode (H2  is oxidized).

Cell Potential (∆E cell)/Cell Voltage/Electromotive Force (emf) and Gibbs Free Energy 

The flow of electrons arises from a potential difference, ∆E, between the electrodes in the circuit. 

25.7


The overall free energy of the cell is related to the cell potential by 

∆Gcell 

= 

-nℑ∆Ecell 

n = number of electrons 
ℑ = Faraday's constant 

Standard States and Cell Potentials 

∆G°cell 

=

-nℑ∆E°cell 

∆E°cell  =  cell potential (cell voltage) in which products and reactants are in their standard states 
Units for ∆E is volts. 

Example - Calculate ∆E°cell for 

Zn (s) | Zn2+  (aq) ||  Cu2+  (aq) |Cu (s) 

anode 
cathode 

∆E°(cell)  =	

standard reduction potential 
for the couple at cathode 

minus 

standard reduction potential 
for the couple at anode 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 

Look up Standard REDUCTION Potentials (E°) in back of book (measured against S.H.E) 

Zn2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Zn (s)  E° = -0.7628 volts 
Cu2+  (aq)  + 2e- ⇒  Cu (s)  E° = +0.3402 volts 

∆E°(cell)  =  E°(cathode) - E° (anode) 
E° (Cu2+/Cu(s)) - E°(Zn2+/Zn(s)) 
= 0.3402 - (-0.7628 ) = 1.103 volts 

Is the flow of electrons spontaneous? 

∆G°cell 

=

-nℑ∆E°cell 

So, if ∆E°cell  is positive, ∆G°cell will be negative. 

Is a reaction spontaneous when ∆G° is negative? 

25.8 

Galvanic Cell is an electrochemical cell in which a spontaneous chemical reaction is used to 
generate an electric current. 

Electrolytic Cell uses electrical energy provided by an external circuit to carry out 
nonspontaneous reactions. 

Summary


Whether the cell operates spontaneously can be determined by ∆Ecell. ((+) = spontaneous)


∆Ecell can be calculated from the Standard Reduction Potentials (E°) of half-cell reactions.


Meaning of standard reduction potential E°


A large positive E° means the element or compound is easy to reduce


ex. F2  (g) + 2e- ⇒ 2F-

E°=+2.87 volts (easy to add electrons to F2)

positive E°, negative ∆G°, favorable 

Is F2  a good oxidizing agent? 

A large positive E° means the oxidized species of the couple is very oxidizing. 

A large negative E° means the element or compound is hard to reduce 

ex. Li+1  + e- ⇒ Li (s) 

E°=-3.045 volts (hard to add electrons to Li+1) 
negative E°, positive ∆G°, not favorable 

Is Li+1  a good oxidizing agent? 

A large negative E° means the reduced species of the couple is very reducing. 

Example: What is ∆E° for the cell reaction: 2Fe3+  (aq)  +  2I- (aq) ⇒  2Fe2+  (aq)  +  I2 (s)?

Which is the better oxidizing agent: Fe3+, I2? 

Which is the better reducing agent: I-, Fe2+? 

Question: Vitamin B12  has a large negative reduction potential, so how is it reduced in the body? 
Vitamin B12  needs to be reduced to be active.  Proper functioning of an enzyme that requires 
vitamin B12  and folic acid is thought to be necessary for preventing heart disease and birth 
defects. 

Where do you get vitamin B12  and folic acid in your diet? and how is the vitamin B12  reduced?
