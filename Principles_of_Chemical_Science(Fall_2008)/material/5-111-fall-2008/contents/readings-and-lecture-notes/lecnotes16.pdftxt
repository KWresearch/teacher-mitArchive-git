I. VALENCE BOND THEORY AND HYBRIDIZATION (continued from Lecture #15) 

DETERMINING HYBIDIZATION IN COMPLEX MOLECULES 

To determine the hybridization of a given atom in a molecule, 

(# of bonded atoms) + (# of lone pairs) = # of hybrid orbitals 

2 hybrid orbitals- _____ , 

3 hybrid orbitals - _____ , 

4 hybrid orbitals- sp3 

Exception: single-bonded, _______________ atoms. For the purposes of this course, do NOT 
hybridize single, bonded, terminal atoms.

II. ENERGIES AND ENTHALPIES OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS 

A. BOND ENERGY/ BOND ENTHALPY 

bond (dissociation) energy, �Ed, is the energy required to break a bond. 

CH4 

� CH3 + H 

�H, bond ________________ , is the change in heat accompanying the dissociation of 
a bond (measured at constant pressure P). 

For gases, �H & �E differ by ______ %.  For liquids and solids, negligible difference. 

�H = �E + �(PV) 

�H ° = _________________ bond enthalpy. Indicates reactants and products are in the 
standard state (pure form) at 1 bar for gasses.

�H° = +438 kJ/mol

�H° = +410 kJ/mol

�H° = +429 kJ/mol

�H° = +380 kJ/mol

�H° = +377 kJ/mol


�H° is positive – ________________ 

The  C-H  bond  enthalpies  listed  above  are  all  within  8%  of  the  average  value 
(________ kJ/mol) for C-H bonds. (See Table 6.8 in the text.) 

What  is  the  importance  of bond  enthalpies?  The difference between bond  enthalpies 
in products and reactants gives an estimate of the enthalpy of reaction. 

C6H12O6 + 6O2 

� 6CO2 + 6H2O

 �Hr° = –2816 kJ/mole 

�H° is negative - ________________ 

Plants convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar (glucose) and oxygen. 

The oxidation of glucose 

* This process requires energy. 
* We eat plants to get the energy stored in
 the glucose molecules. 

6CO2 + 6H2O  �  C6H12O6 + 6O2 

We perform the reverse reaction, the oxidation of glucose, to harness the stored energy. 
C6H12O6 + 6O2 
� 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy 

We store this energy in the form of ATP. 

To calculate �Hr° for the oxidation of glucose (or for any reaction): 

If bonds stronger in products than reactants, �H is _______________ (_____________). 
If bonds stronger in reactants than products, �H is _______________ (endothermic).

�Hr°calculated  = 12,452 kJ/mol – 15,192 kJ/mol = ____________. kJ/mol of C6H12O6 

�Hr°experimental  = -2,816 kJ/mol


Agreement within 3%, very good for mean bond enthalpies.


B. HEAT OF FORMATION 

More accurate approach…use heat of formation - �Hf° 

�Hf° = �Hr°	

for forming 1 mol of compound from pure elements in their most 
stable form at the standard state = 1 bar and 298.15 K

�H° = – 285.8 kJ/mol = �Hf° for H2O(l)

�H° = – 393.5 kJ/mol = �Hf° for CO2(g) 

�H° = ______ = �Hf° for O2(g) 

The heat of formation of an element in its most stable state is ______________. 

3O2(g) +  6Cgr + 6H2(g) � C6H12O6 

�Hf° = ________. kJ/mol for C6H12O6

We can calculate �Hr° for glucose oxidation (or any other reaction) using �Hf°. 

�Hr° = ��Hf°(_______________) - ��Hf°(________________) 

�Hr° = 

�Hr° =  

�Hr° = ____________ kJ/mol 

Same value as experiment because �Hf° is specific to a compound.  Table of �Hf° for 
compounds is small compared to a table of �H for all possible reactions or to a table 
of individual bond enthalpies for each bond in all possible molecules! 

Enthalpy is a “STATE” FUNCTION, which means �H is __________________ of path. 

Hess's Law:  If two or more chemical equations are added to give another chemical 
equation, corresponding _________ must be added.
