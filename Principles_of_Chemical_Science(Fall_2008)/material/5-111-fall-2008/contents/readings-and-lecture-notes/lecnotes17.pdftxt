II. SPONTANEOUS CHANGE AND FREE ENERGY 
A spontaneous change is a process that, given enough time, occurs without the need

for outside intervention.

For example, the following reactions are spontaneous at constant pressure:

4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Fe2O3(s) 
∆H° = __________ kJ/mol 
H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq) → 2H2O(l)  ∆H° = __________ kJ/mol

But so are these …

-(aq) 
NH4NO3(s) → NH4
+(aq) + NO3
Is ∆H the key to spontaneity?  _______!

Condition for spontaneity under constant P + T involves GIBBS FREE ENERGY, ∆G.

∆G = ∆H – T∆S

where T = temperature and ∆S = change in entropy, a measure of disorder. 
∆G < 0  _____________________ process 
∆G > 0  _____________________ process 
∆G = 0  equilibrium 

Under constant pressure and temperature, a process is spontaneous when ∆G < 0, 
not necessarily when ∆H < 0.  Why? 

Figuring this out was one of the towering achievements of thermodynamics!! 

For example,	

+(aq) + NO3
NH4NO3(s) → NH4
-(aq) 
∆Sr° = +109 JK-1mol-1 
∆Hr° = +28 kJ/mol 

∆G° = ∆H° – T∆S°

at T = 298 K,  ∆G° = _______________ – ________(____________________)

∆G° = __________ kJ/mol - __________ kJ/mol

∆G° = __________ kJ/mol


3 

∆G° is negative, even though ∆H° is positive.  The reaction is spontaneous. 
Now consider glucose oxidation at room temperature: 
C6H12O6  + 6O2  → 6CO2  + 6H2O 
∆H° = –2,816 kJ/mol,  ∆S° = +233 J/K•mol 

∆G° = __________ – 298(__________) = __________kJ/mol 
∆G° more negative than ∆H°.  This reaction is spontaneous at ______________ 
temperatures. 

III.  ENTROPY 
Entropy, S, is a measure of the ________________ of a system. 
∆S = change in entropy. ∆S is a state function. 

∆S° positive ⇒ _______________ in disorder

∆S° negative ⇒ ______________ in disorder


Disorder of gas ____ liquid ____ solid

In solids, molecules cannot move around freely- they are locked in ordered locations.

Internal degrees of freedom – e.g. multiple molecular configurations, many quantum 

states that can be occupied - also contribute to entropy

Without calculations, we can predict the sign of ∆S for many reactions.  For example,

2H2O2(l) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) has a ________________ ∆S.


Entropy for reactions, ∆Sr°

can be calculated from absolute entropies of products and reactants,

∆Sr° = ΣS°(_______________) - ΣS°(________________) 
where S° is the absolute standard entropy. 
Unlike E or H, where the zero can be selected, S has an absolute zero – the perfect 
crystal at T = 0 K (perfectly ordered, no disorder at all). 
For example, consider the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. 

4 

2H2O2(l) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g) 
∆Sr° = ΣS°(products) - ΣS°(reactants) 
∆S°  = ___S°(___________) + S°(________) - ___S°(________) 
∆S°  = 
2(70. JK–1mol–1) + (205 JK–1mol–1) – 2(110. JK–1mol–1) 
∆S°  = __________ JK–1mol–1 

Why is ∆S° positive? The reaction converts liquid → liquid and gas. 
∆G°	 = ∆H° – T∆S° 
= -196 kJ/mol – 298.15 K (___________ kJ K–1mol–1) 
= -233 kJ/mol 
(The reaction is _______________) 

Now consider ice melting at 298.15 K.  H2O(s) → H2O(l) 
∆S° = S°(__________) – S°(__________) = 69.91 – 41.32 
Why is ∆S° > 0? _____________________ 

∆S° = 28.59 J K–1  mol–1 

∆G°	 = 6.95 – 298.15K(2.859 x 10–2  kJ/K mol) 
= -1.57 kJ/mol 
Ice melting is spontaneous at room temperature even though ∆H° is positive. 

IV.  FREEE ENERGY OF FORMATION, ∆Gf 
analogous to ∆Hf 
∆Gfº  ≡  standard Gibbs free energy of formation 
≡	 ∆ Grº for formation of 1 mol of compound from its elements in their 
most stable form in the standard states at P = 1 bar and T = 298.15 K. 

Tabulated for many compounds like ∆Hfº, but can also be calculated from 

_______ = _______ – T∆S° 

For example, 
C(gr) + O2(g) → CO2(g) 

∆G° = –394.36 kJ/mol = ∆Gfº 

∆Gfº is important because it is a measure of a compound’s stability relative to its elements. 

5 

If ∆Gfº <  0, a compound is thermodynamically __________________ relative to its elements. 
If ∆Gfº >  0, a compound is thermodynamically __________________ relative to its elements. 

6C(gr) + 3H2(g) → C6H6(l)  ∆Gfº = 124 kJ/mol

C6H6(l) → 6C(gr) + 3H2(g)  ∆Gº = –124 kJ/mol

The reverse reaction is spontaneous, but very, very slow! 
Free energy tells whether or not a reaction will happen spontaneously, but it tells us 
________________ about the rate of the reaction (for rate information we need 
chemical kinetics). 

To calculate ∆G° for a reaction… 
∆Gr° = Σ∆Gf°(products) - Σ∆Gf°(reactants) 
∆Gr° = ∆Hr° – T∆Sr°
