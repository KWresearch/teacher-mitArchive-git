Effect of Temperature on Reaction Rates 

Gas-Phase 
A qualitative observation is that reaction rates tend to increase with increased temperature.  Now 
we will consider the quantitative effect. 

In 1889, Svante Arrhenius plotted rate constants (k) versus temperature.  He found that plotting 
ln k versus inverse temperature gave a straight line. 

intercept = ln A 

k = rate constant 

T = temperature 

A = factor A  or pre-exponential factor 
(same units as k)

What is Ea, activation energy?


Consider  CH3  (g)  + CH3  (g) →  C2H6  (g) 


2 molecules collide to form product (bimolecular) but every two molecules that collide won't

form product.  Why?


Only those collisions for which the collision energy exceeds some critical energy 

(_________________ energy) result in a reaction.


At low temperatures, a small fraction will have this much energy.


At higher temperatures, a larger fraction will have this much energy.

A large activation energy means that the rate constant is ________ sensitive to changes in 

temperature.


What do you think happens to the rate of an enzymatic reaction at liquid N2  temperatures?


The Reaction Coordinate and the Activation Complex


Why is there a critical collision energy, Ea, for the reaction between two molecules?


As two reactant molecules approach each other along a reaction path, their potential energy 
increases as the bonds within them distort.  The encounter results in the formation of an activated 
complex or transition state, a combination of molecules that can either go on to form products or 
fall apart again into unchanged reactants. 

Only molecules with sufficient energy can overcome the activation energy barrier.

Reaction coordinate 
Recall from Lecture #17, ∆H =  ∆E +  ∆(PV) 
For gases, these quantities differ by 1-2% and for liquids and solids, there is a negligible 
difference. 

For elementary reactions, the activation energy barrier is always positive (some barrier to 
overcome). 
Therefore increasing the temperature __________________the rate of an elementary reaction. 

For overall reactions, increasing temperature can decrease or increase the overall rate.

Since first step is fast and reversible and the second step is slow, we can solve for [N2O2] by

effect of temperature on an 
equilibrium constant depends 
on whether the reaction is 
endothermic or exothermic 

Here the reaction is exothermic, so increasing temperature ___________the equilibrium constant 

kobs  = 2k2K1 

with increased temperature / the rate constant increases 
and the equilibrium constant decreases 

(Magnitude of change depends on Ea  (for rate constant) and ∆H (for equilibrium constant.) 

2NO2, Ea  is a small number and ∆H is a big number 
For 2NO  +  O2 
Since Ea  is small, the rate constant increases only a little 
Since ∆H is big, the equilibrium constant decreases a lot with temperature 
Thus, increasing the temperature actually decreases kobs.

A large Ea  means that k is very sensitive to changes in temperature. 

A large ∆H means that K is very sensitive to changes in temperature. 

Rate constants always increase with temperature, since Ea  is always ______________. 

34.6 

Equilibrium constants can increase or decrease with temperature, since ∆H can be (-) or (+).


The magnitude of ∆H indicates the magnitude of the change, and the sign of ∆H indicates the

direction of the change.
