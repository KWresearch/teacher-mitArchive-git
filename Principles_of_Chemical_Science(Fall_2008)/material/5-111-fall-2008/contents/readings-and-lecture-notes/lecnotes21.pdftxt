Classification of Acids and Bases 

1. Arrhenius  - a narrow definition of acids and bases 
An acid is a substance that when dissolved in water increases the concentration of hydrogen ions. 
A base is a substance that increases the hydroxide concentration. 

2. BrØnsted-Lowry - a broader definition 

A BrØnsted-Lowry acid  - a substance that can donate a hydrogen ion

A BrØnsted-Lowry base  - a substance that can accept a hydrogen ion


Example 1

CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l)

Acid1 
Base2 

H3O+  (aq) + CH3COO- (aq) 
Acid2 
Base1 

(note: hydronium ion H3O+  (aq) is used instead of H+  (aq) to represent the true nature of hydrogen 
ions in water) 

Acid-bases occur as conjugate acid-base pairs.  CH3COOH and CH3COO- are a pair.  H2O and 
H3O+  are a pair.  The conjugate base of an acid is the base that is formed when the acid has donated 
a hydrogen ion.  The conjugate acid of a base is the acid that forms when base accepts a hydrogen 
ion. 

Example 2  Which are BrØnsted-Lowry acids and which are BrØnsted-Lowry bases? 

HCO3  (aq) + H2O (l) 
-

H3O+  (aq)  + CO3

-2  (aq) 

HCO3

- (aq) + H2O (l) 

H2CO3  (aq)  + OH  (aq) 
-

amphoteric - molecules that can function either as acids or bases depending on the reaction 
conditions.

3. Lewis Acid and Base - more general definition - applies to reactions that don't involve a 
hydrogen ion 

Lewis base - species that donates lone-pair electrons 
Lewis acid - species that accepts such electrons

Ammonia is the Lewis base. It donates lone-pair electrons to BF3, the Lewis acid and the electron 
acceptor. 

Autoionization of Water 

H2O (l) + H2O (l) 
acid 
base 

H3O+  (aq) + OH- (aq)  or  2H2O (l) 
acid 
base 

H3O+  (aq)  + OH- (aq) 

How much H2O is in a glass of water? 

∆G° =  ∆Gf°(H3O+,aq) +  ∆Gf° (OH-,aq) - 2∆Gf° (H2O,l) 
= (-237.13) + (-157.24) - 2 x (-237.13) kJ/mol 
= +79.89 kJ/mol 

ln K  =  -!G°/RT  = 
  
 
  

- ( 7.989 x 104  J/mol) 

= 

-32.24 
   

(8.3145 J/Kmol)(298.0 K) 

K = 1.0 x 10-14  at 298 K 

This very small value indicates that only a small proportion of water molecules are ionized. 
Concentration of ions due to autoionization of water is very low, about 1 molecule in 200 million. 

21.3


K = [H3O+][OH-] 

This K is called Kw. 

Because Kw  is an equilibrium constant, the product of [H3O+][OH-] is always 1.0 x 10-14  at 298 K. 

Note: Because the concentration of the solvent, H2O, does not change significantly in a dilute 
solution, it does not enter the equilibrium expression.  The solvent, water, is very nearly pure, and 
pure liquids and pure solids are not included in equilibrium expressions. 

pH Function 

pH = -log [H3O+] 

pOH Function 

pOH = -log [OH-] 

Kw  = [H3O+][OH-] 
logKw  = log[H3O+] + log[OH-] 
-logKw  = -log[H3O+] - log[OH-] 
pKw  = pH + pOH = 14.00 at 25°C 

Strength of Acids and Bases 

pH of pure water  pH = -log (1.0 x 10-7) = 7.00 
pH of an acid solution is 
pH of an base solution is 
EPA defines waste as "corrosive" if the pH is lower than 3.0 or higher than 12.5. 

1. Acid in water 

CH3COOH (aq) + H2O (l) 

H3O+ (aq) + CH3CO2  (aq) 
-

Acid ionization constant Ka 

=  [H3O+] [CH3CO2  ] 
-
[CH3COOH] 

Ka equals 1.76 x 10-5  at 25°C.  Small value tells us that only a small proportion of CH3COOH 
molecules donate their proton when dissolved in water (weak acid). 

21.4


ACID (HA) IN WATER 
H3O+ (aq) + A- (aq) 
HA (aq) + H2O (l) 
BH+ (aq) + H2O (l) 
ACID (BH+) IN WATER 
H3O+ (aq) + B (aq) 
A strong acid has a Ka  >1 which means that the acid ionizes almost completely. 

A weak acid has a Ka  <1. The reaction with water does not produce many ionized species before 
equilibrium is reached. 

pKa  = -log Ka 

The lower the value of Ka, the higher the value of pKa.  The higher the pKa, the weaker the acid. 

2. Base in water 

NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4

+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

Base ionization constant Kb = 

[NH4

+] [OH-]

[NH3 ] 
Kb  is 1.8 x 10-5  at 25°C.  This small value tells us that only a small amount of NH3 ionizes to NH4
+ 
and OH- in solution. A strong base reacts essentially completely to give OH- (aq) when put in water. 
NH3 is not a strong base.  It is a moderately weak base. 

B (aq) + H2O (l) 
A- (aq) + H2O (l) 

BH+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 
HA (aq) + OH- (aq) 

BASE (B) IN WATER 
BASE (A-) IN WATER 

pKb  = -log Kb 

larger Kb, stronger base 
larger pKb, weaker base 

3.  Conjugate acids and bases 

The stronger the acid, the weaker its conjugate base. 
The stronger the base, the weaker its conjugate acid. 

Consider conjugate acid-base pair NH3  and NH4

+: 

NH3  (aq) + H2O (l) 

NH4

+  (aq) + OH- (aq) 

NH4
H3O+  (aq) + NH3  (aq) 
+  (aq) + H2O (l) 
Multiply K's together and get: 

Ka x Kb  = 

[NH3 ][H3O+] 
+] 

[NH4

[NH4  ][OH-] 

[NH3 ]

[H3O+][OH-]

Ka x Kb  =  Kw 

log Ka + log Kb = log Kw  or  pKa + pKb = pKw = 14.00 

Strong acid  HA (aq) + H2O (l) 

Strong base B (aq) + H2O (l) 

4. Relative strengths of acids

Equilibrium involving weak acids 

Example: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid, HC6H7O6) has a Ka  of 8.0 x 10-5.  Calculate the pH of a solution 
made by dissolving 500. mg in 100. mL of water. 

0.500 g x 1 mol/176.126 g = 2.84 x 10-3  mol 
2.84 x 10-3  mol/0.100 L = 0.0284 M

x = 0.00151 (really 2 sf, but carry extra) 

Check assumption. Is 0.0284 - 0.00151 ~= 0.0284?

You can use assumption if x is less than 5% of the value in question.

Here (0.00151/0.0284) x 100% = 5.3% (more than 5%), so must use the quadratic equation.

Using quadratic eq, x = 0.00147 (really 2 sf)


pH = -log [1.47 x 10-3  ] = 2.83
