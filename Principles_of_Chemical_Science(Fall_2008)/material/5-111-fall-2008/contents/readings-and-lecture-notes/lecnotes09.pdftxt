I. PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY (PES) 
PES can determine orbital energies directly.  (Similar concept to photoelectric effect!) 

Ei = IE + KE 

IE = _____ - _____ 

(Recall for the photoelectric effect:  Ei = φ + KE) 

Each line on the spectrum corresponds to a different initial orbital energy from which 
electrons were ejected. 

1 

Orbital E in multi-electron atoms depend on two quantum numbers, ___ and ____. 

PES Example: If a certain element being studied by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
displays  an  emission  spectrum  with  5  distinct  kinetic  energies.  What  are  all  of  the 
possible elements that could produce this spectrum? 
•  First, determine the orbitals that the spectral lines are originating from: 
______, ______, ______, ______, and ______. 

•	 The elements that have electrons in (only) these orbitals are 
______________________________________________________________. 

II. THE PERIODIC TABLE / PERIODIC TRENDS 
1869  Dmitri  Mendeleev  (Russian,  1834-1907)  introduced  a  periodic  table  based  on
reoccurring  physical  properties  and  chemical  properties  of  the  elements.  He  left 
space for missing elements (1/3 naturally occurring elements were unknown!)  Some
examples of grouping by properties: 
•	 Li, Na, and K were originally grouped together in a column because they are
all soft, malleable, reactive metals. 
•	 He, Ne, and Ar were grouped together because of their inertness. 
Elements that are in the same column have related valence electron configurations: 
•	 Li, Na, and K have _________ valence e–  in an s-state. 
•	 He, Ne, and Ar have ______________ shells. 

PERIODIC TRENDS 

A. IONIZATION ENERGY (IE
IE  is the minimum energy required  to remove an electron from an atom.  IE refers to 
the first IE unless otherwise specified. 
IE = ________ (binding energy) of the most weakly bound electron. 
Ionization energy definitions: 
∆E = Eprod  – Ereact  = IE = -E2p 
B+ (1s22s2) + e– 
B(1s22s22p1) 
!!! "!
!!!!!!!!!!!!
IE ≡ first IE: energy to remove an e–  from the HOAO (highest occupied atomic orbital). 

2 

∆E = IE2  = -E2s  for B+ 
B+(1s22s2) 
___________ + e– 
!!! "!
!!!!!!!!!!!!
IE2  ≡ second ionization energy.  IE2  is always higher than the first IE. 
∆E = IE3 = -E2s  for B+2 
B+2(1s22s1) 
___________ + e– 
!!! "!
!!!!!!!!!!!!
IE3  ≡ third ionization energy 
Consider the energy required to remove electrons from the 2s orbital from B+  and B: 
B+(1s22s2) 
B+2 (1s22s1) + e– 
∆E = IE2  = ___________ 
!!!!!!!!!!!! 
!!! " !

B+ (1s22s12p1) + e– 

∆E = IE2s= ___________ 

B(1s22s22p1) 

!!!!!!!!!!!! 
!!! " !
Are these two ∆E’s equal? ________

A 2s-electron in the B+  ion has less shielding.

It therefore feels a ______________ Zeff  and 
• 
requires ___________ energy to be pulled away from the nucleus. 
• 

Periodic trends in ionization energy: 
Across  a  row,  IE  _____________.  Z  increases,  but  n  (the  shell)  stays  constant.  The 
outermost e- is bound more tightly to the nucleus and requires more E to be ejected. 
Down a column, IE _____________.  Although Z increases as you go down a column, 
so does n. Shells are well-separated in space, so electrons in larger n are farther awa
from  the nucleus. A  large distance  from  the nucleus dominates over  the  increased Z,
making electrons less strongly bound and therefore decreasing IE.

B. ELECTRON AFFINITY (EA or Eea)

The ability of an atom (or ion) to gain electrons:  ______ + e- ⇒  ______

Cl + e– 
∆E = – 349 kJ/mol 
Cl– 
energy is released --- ion is __________ stable than atom 
Electron affinity, EA, is defined as 
EA = –∆E 
So, EA for Cl is 
EA = ___________ kJ/mol 
Unlike IE (which is always positive), EA can be positive or negative. 
N  + e–
 N– 
∆E = 7 kJ/mol 
So EA = –7 kJ/mole for N --- the -1 ion is _________ stable than atom 
General trends in EA: 

•	 Noble gases (group VIII) have ___________ 
EA because addition of an electron would 
require occupying a new shell. 
•	 Halogens (group VII) have the largest EA's 
because the extra e- fills a “hole” in the p-
subshell to give a complete shell. 

C. ELECTRONEGATIVITY (χ) 
Electronegativity  is  the  net  ability  of  an  atom  to  attract  an  electron  from  another
atom. Linus Pauling  first proposed  this  idea  in 1932.  His electronegativity  scales are
in general use today. 
Mulliken's electronegativity scale developed 2 years later is conceptually easier.

electronegativity (χ) ∝ ______ ( ______ + ______ ) 

An atom with high electronegativity is an electron  _________________ .

An atom with low electronegativity is an electron  __________________ .


General trends for electronegativity: 

D. ATOMIC RADIUS 
The atomic size is defined as the value of r below which 90% of electron density is
contained. This is the atomic radius. 

The role of atomic radius in ion channel selectivity : 
Ion channels
Ions Cell membrane

Ion channels 
* regulate the influx of ions into cells. 
 
* enable rapid electric signaling in neurons.
Regulation and selectivity are essential.

Sodium  ion  channels  are  selective  for  Na+
 in  the  presence  of  other  ions,  including  K+ . 
Sodium  channels  include  a  tiny  pore  (~0.4  nm  wide)  that  is  just  wide  enough  to

accommodate a sodium ion and associated water molecule.  Too small for potassium!
