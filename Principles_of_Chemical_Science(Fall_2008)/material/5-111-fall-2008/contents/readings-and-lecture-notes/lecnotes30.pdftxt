Transition Metals 
Topic: Crystal Field Theory and the Spectrochemical Series. 
Chapter 16 

A molecule’s color can depend on oxidation state or liganded state. Example: oscillating clock. 
Consider the overall reaction: 
IO3  + 2 H2O2  + CH2(CO2H)2  + H+   ICH(CO2H)2  + 2 O2  + 3 H2O 
-

The overall reaction can be broken into two components (1 and 2), the second of which can be 
further divided into components (a and b): 
-
(1)  IO3  + 2 H2O2 + H+  HOI + 2 O2  + 2 H2O  what is happening to “I”? 
(Note that the HOI produced in the first reaction is a reactant in the second reaction.) 
(2) HOI + CH2(CO2H)2  ICH(CO2H)2  + H2O 
(a)	 I- + HOI + H+    I2  + H2O 
what is being oxidized and what is being 
reduced in this reaction? 
(b) I2CH2(CO2H)2   ICH2(CO2H)2  + H+  + I-
As this reaction proceeds, the color will oscillate from clear to amber to deep blue.  Specifically, 
I- is clear. The amber color is from I2  formation. The deep blue color results from the I- and I2 
binding to the starch present in the solution. Thus, the color of iodine depends on its oxidation 
state and its liganded state (whether or not it is bound to starch). 

Transition  metal  coordination  complexes  can  have  beautiful  colors.  The  color  given  off  by  a 
coordination complex depends on  the nature of  the transition metal and  the nature of the ligands. 
Crystal  field  theory  can  be  used  to  explain  the  observed  colors  of  various  coordination 
complexes. 

Spectrochemical Series -relative abilities of common ligands to split the d-orbital energy levels. 

Strong field ligands - produce large energy separations between d-orbitals 

Weak field ligands - produce small energy separations between d-orbitals

Light Absorbed by Octahedral Coordination Complexes 

A substance absorbs photons of light if the energies of the photons match the energies required to 
excite the electrons to higher energy levels. 

Elight  = hv = ∆o	

E = energy of light absorbed 
h = planck's constant 
v = frequency 
∆o = octahedral crystal field splitting energy 

If high frequency light is absorbed, the wavelength of the absorbed light is _________. 

c=λv	

c = speed of light 

λ = wavelength 

v = frequency 

30.3 

Going back to our example: high spin [Fe(H2O)6]3+  and low spin [Fe(CN)6]3-
High spin [Fe(H2O)6]3+  has a crystal field splitting energy of 171 kJ/mol 
Low spin [Fe(CN)6]3- has a crystal field splitting energy of 392 kJ/mol 

Calculate the wavelength of light absorbed by both complexes. 
High spin [Fe(H2O)6]3+ 
λ = c/v and v = ∆o/h 
so λ = hc/∆o  = 
(6.626 x 10-34  J s) (2.997 x 108  m/s) 
(171 kJ/mol)(1000 J/kJ)(1 mol/6.022 x 1023) 

=  7.00 x 10-7  m or 700. nm 

[Fe(H2O)6]3+  absorbs red light 

Low spin [Fe(CN)6]3-

λ = hc/∆o  =	

(6.626 x 10-34  J s) (2.997 x 108  m/s) 
=  3.05 x 10-7  m or 305. nm 
(392 kJ/mol)(1000 J/kJ)(1 mol/6.022 x 1023) 

[Fe(CN)6]3- absorbs violet light

Color of transmitted light is complementary to the color of absorbed light.  Violet is 
complementary to yellow; blue is complementary to orange; green is complementary to red. 

Transmitted light has a _______wavelength 
[Cr(H2O)6]3+  is violet (400-430nm)

Estimate crystal field splitting energy in kJ/mol 
Example [CrCl6]3-
wavelength of most intensely absorbed light is 740 nm 

predicted color: 

frequency of light absorbed is c/λ = (2.997 x 108  m/s)/(740 x 10-9  m) = 4.05 x 1014 s-1 

crystal field splitting energy ∆o is hv = (6.626 x 10-34  J s)(4.05 x 1014 s-1) = 2.68 x 10-19 J 

(2.68 x 10-19  J) x (1 kJ/1000 J) x (6.022 x 1023  mol-1) = 160 kJ/mol
