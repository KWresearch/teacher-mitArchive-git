I. WAVEFUNCTIONS FOR MULTIELECTRON ATOMS 
(Describing atoms with Z=2 or higher)

The Schrödinger equation correctly describes the electronic structure for all atoms,

not just 1-e–  atoms. 
Hydrogen: 
Hˆ !(r"#) = E!(r"#) 
Helium (2 e-s):  H
ˆ 
!(r1"1#1r2"2#2) = E!(r1"1#1r2"2#2) 
Lithium (3 e-s):  Hˆ !(r1"1#1r2"2#2r3"3#3) = E!(r1"1#1r2"2#2r3"3#3) 
The equations becomes much more complicated. Approximations are needed! 
Hartree orbitals: Assume we can write a multi-electron Ψ as the product of 1-electron Ψs: 
Helium:  Ψ(r1θ1φ1r2θ2φ2) = Ψ (r1θ1φ1)  •  Ψ (r2θ2φ2) 
Ψ for ______  •  Ψ for _______ 
Ψ100+1/2 
Ψ100−1/2 
1s(1) 
1s(2) 
Lithium: Ψ (r1θ1φ1r2θ2φ2r3θ3φ3) = Ψ (r1θ1φ1) • Ψ (r2θ2φ2) • Ψ (r3θ3φ3)

HOW DO THE MULTI-ELECTRON WAVEFUNCTIONS COMPARE TO THE H-ATOM

WAVEFUNCTIONS?

Let’s consider Ar as an example: 1s22s22p63s23p6

Similarities to H atom wavefunctions:

•	 Each orbital obtained is similar in shape to the corresponding H 1-e- orbital. 
•	 The nodal structure is the same (nodes occur at values of r, θ and Φ which give 
Ψ and Ψ2  = 0). 
Differences to H atom wavefunctions: 
•	 Each multi-electron orbital is ________________ than the corresponding hydrogen
atom orbital. 
Why?  Stronger pull from the nucleus with higher Z (Z=18 for Ar , Z=1 for H). 
In multi-electron atoms, orbital energy depends on both the shell (n) and the 
subshell (l). 

•	

II. BINDING ENERGIES FOR MULTI-ELECTRON ATOMS 
All orbitals in a multi-electron atom are lower in energy (__________________) than 
the corresponding energy in a hydrogen atom. 

2 

The lower energy results in multi-electron atoms results from a higher Z--- a stronger 
pull from the nucleus. 

The principal quantum number, n, is no longer the sole determining factor for the 
orbital energies of multi-electron atoms. Energy now depends on n and ____. 

For _________-electron atoms 

For _________-electron atoms 

Where Zeff is the effective charge experienced by the electron in the n,l state.

Zeff  _______ the same as Z for the nucleus.  Zeff  differs from Z because of ___________.


Shielding and Zeff 
To illustrate the effect of shielding, consider the two extreme shielding situations
possible for the He atom (Z = 2). 
EXTREME CASE A: electron #1 is very far from nucleus; electron #2 close to nucleus 

•  Electron #2 cancels part of the charge experienced by electron #1. 
•  Electron #1 experiences a force on average of Zeff = _______ , not Zeff  = +2e. 
•  The energy of electron #1 is that of an electron in a H (1-electron) atom. 

3 

EXTREME CASE B: electron #1 close to nucleus; electron #2 very far from nucleus 

•  Electron #1 experiences a force on average of Zeff  = ________. 
•  The energy of electron #1 is that of an electron in a ________ (1-electron) ion. 

Zeff = 1, 
Extreme case A: 
Extreme case B: 
Zeff = 2, 
Experimentally determined IEHe: 

IEHe= 2.18 x 10–18 J 
IEHe= 8.72 x 10–18 J 

__________  shielding 
__________  shielding 

Experimental IEHe  = 3.94 x 10–18 J 
So the reality is somewhere between total shielding and no shielding. 

We can calculate the Zeff  from the experimentally determined IE: 

Note: Our calculated Zeff  is a reasonable value, since it falls between ___ (total shielding) and ___ 
(no shielding). 
Why is E2s < (more negative than) E2p  and E3s  < E3p < E3d 
For a given n state (shell), electrons in orbitals with lower values of l ______________ 
closer to the nucleus (even though rmp  decreases with increasing l!).

•	

This means (for the same n): 
s-electrons are _________ 
shielded than p electrons. 
•	 p-electrons are less shielded 
than ____-electrons 

Consider why the electron configuration for Li is 1s2  2s1  and not 1s2  2p1.

The s-orbital is less shielded.  Averaging over the RPD yields ________ < ________ .

Since Enl  = - (Zeff)2RH  / n2,  E2s  ______ E2p


III. ELECTRON CONFIGURATIONS 
Electron  configuration  describes  the  electronic  structure  of  an  atom  by  specifying
which  orbitals  are  occupied.  This  is  very  useful  notation,  since  electron  structure
dictates the chemical properties and reactivity of a given atom. 
How do we determine the electron configuration of an atom? 
AUFBAU PRINCIPLE 
Fill energy states (which depend on ___ and ___) one electron at a time, starting with 
the lowest energy state and following: 
1)	 The Pauli exclusion principle 
2)	 Hund’s  rule: when  electrons  are  added 
to states of  the same E, a single electron
enters  each  state  before  a  second 
electron  enters  any  state.  Spins  remain 
______________  prior 
to  adding  a 
second electron to any state. 
Let’s try this for O (Z = 8). 
Electron configuration: _____________ 
(specifying ml): ____________________ 
You need only provide ml  notation if specifically asked.

* Exceptions to the Aufbau principle: filled (____) and half-filled (____) d-orbitals 
have lower energy than simple theory predicts. 

Core electrons:  electrons in inner shells making up a noble gas configuration. 

Valence electrons:  electrons in the outer most shell.  Valence electrons are the 
exciting ones- in general, only the valence electrons participate in chemical reactions. 

Fifth Period: Rb to Xe.  Mo and Ag are counterpart anomalies to Cr and Cu in 4th 
period.  Additional anomalies and other effects are difficult to predict. 

Mnemonic for electon configuration: diagonals 

Using this chart, we can write out the correct order of orbitals with 
increasing energy from left to right 

1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 6s, 4f, 5d, 6p, 7s, 5f, 6d, 7p 

ELECTRON CONFIGURATIONS OF IONS  - NOT THE SAME AS NEUTRALS!!! 
Once a d orbital is filled, the orbital energy drops to below the corresponding s orbital.
