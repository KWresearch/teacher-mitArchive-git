Radioactive Decay 

The decay of a nucleus is ____________ of the number of surrounding nuclei that have decayed. 
We can apply first order integrated rate laws: 

[A] = [A]0 e-k t 

and

 t1/2  = 0.6931 
k 

However, instead of concentration, the first order integrated rate law is expressed in terms of 
N (number of nuclei) 

N = Noe-k t	

k ≡ decay constant 
t ≡time 
N0  ≡ number of nuclei originally present 

Chemical kinetics – monitor changes in concentration over time 

Nuclear kinetics – monitor rate of occurrence of decay events with a Geiger counter (radiation 

detector)


Decay rate is also called Activity (A)


Activity = A = -dN = k N

dt 

because activity is proportional to the number of nuclei (N): 

N = Noe-k t 

can be expressed as  A = Aoe-k t 

A ≡ Activity 
A0  ≡ original activity 

S.I. unit for Activity is the becquerel (Bq) 
1 Bq ≡ 1 radioactive disintegration per second 
1 Ci = 3.7 x 1010  disintegrations per sec 
Older unit is the curie (Ci)

Medical  uses  of  Radioactive  Decay.  Example:  Technetium-99  is  the  most  widely  used 
radioactive  nuclide  in  medicine.  It  is  used  for  diagnostic  organ  imaging  and  bone  scans,  with 
over  7  million  uses  annually  in  the  US  alone.  One  of  the  patent  holders  for  technetium, 
"cardioliteTM", is our own, Professor of Chemistry, Alan Davison.

Kinetics and Chemical Equilibrium 

At equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

The equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction that has form A + B  ⇔ C + D is


K =


Suppose experiments show both the forward reaction and reverse reaction are second order, with 
the following rate laws: 

32.5 

k1 
A + B  ⇔ C + D 
k-1 

forward reaction 
reverse reaction 

ratef = 
rater = 

At equilibrium, these rates are equal: k1  [A][B] = k-1  [C][D] 

and	

[C][D]  = 
[A][B]

k1 
 k-1 

K  =	

Therefore 

k1 
k-1 
The equilibrium constant for a reaction is equal to the ratio of the rate constants for the forward 
and reverse elementary reactions that contribute to the overall reaction. 

Equilibrium constants in kinetics terms: 

K > 1 

K < 1 

k1 ?  k-1 

k1 ?  k-1 

Reactions do not typically occur in 1 step, but proceed through a series of steps.


Each step is called an elementary reaction.


For an overall reaction, the order and the rate law cannot be derived from the stoichiometry of

the balanced reaction.


For an elementary reaction, the order and rate law can be predicted.  Elementary reactions occur

exactly as written.

Example: decomposition of ozone 

2O3  (g) 

→ 

3O2  (g) 

proposed mechanism has two elementary reaction steps


1st  step 

2nd step 

O3  →O + O2 

unimolecular 

rate = k [O3]


O + O3  →O2  + O2 

bimolecular	

rate = 

molecularity ≡ number of reactant molecules that come together to form product.


Unimolecular – 1 reactant 

ex. Decomposition, radioactive decay


Bimolecular – 2 reactants 

ex. Two reactants collide to form product


Termolecular – 3 reactants 

ex. Three reactants collide to form product (rare)


Individual steps (elementary reactions) can be added together to get the overall equation for the 
reaction. 

1st  step 
2nd step 

Overall 

O3  →O + O2 
O + O3  →O2  + O2 

O3  + O3  →O2  + O2  + O2	

“O” is a reaction intermediate 

“O” does not appear in the overall 
reaction equation 

Reaction mechanisms (which are a series of elementary reaction steps) must be tested 
experimentally.  Reaction mechanisms cannot be proven to be correct.  At best, data are 
consistent with a reaction mechanism.
