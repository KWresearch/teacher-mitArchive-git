Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 
Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 
Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 
Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

(b)(5  points)  Part  (a)  implies  the  following:  For  every  pair  of  real  numbers  (x1 , y1 ),  there  is  a 
tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  with  x­intercept  x1  and  y ­intercept  y1  if  and  only  if  x1y1  equals 
4.  You may  use  this  fact  freely. 

Let  (a, b)  be  a  point  such  that  ab  is  nonzero  and  less  than  1  (possibly  negative).  Show  that  a  line 
L  with  x­intercept  x1  and  y ­intercept  y1  is  a  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  containing  (a, b)  if 
and  only  if  x1  satisﬁes, 
1  − 4x1  + 4a = 0, 
bx2 

and  y1  satisﬁes, 

2  − 4y1  + 4b = 0. 
ay1

Hint.  Using Equations 1–5 on pp.  11–12 of  the  textbook, deduce  that L contains  (a, b)  if and only 
if  bx1  + ay1  equals  x1y1 .  Then  use  the  fact  above  to  eliminate  one  of  x1  or  y1  from  this  equation, 
and  simplify. 

(c)(5 points) Using the quadratic formula and Part  (b), which you may now use freely, write down 
the  equations  of  the  2  tangent  lines  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  containing  the  point  (a, b) = (5, −3). 
Problem  2(10  points) For  a mass moving  vertically  under  constant  acceleration −g ,  the  displace­
ment  function  is, 
x(t) = −g t2/2 + v0 t + x0 , 
where  x0  is  the  displacement  and  v0  is  the  instantaneous  velocity  at  time  t = 0. 
A  scientist  uses  a magnetic  ﬁeld  to  conduct  an  experiment  simulating  zero  gravity.  At  time  t = 0, 
the  scientist  drops  a mass  from  a  height  of  10m with  instantaneous  velocity  v0  = 0  under  constant 
acceleration  −10m/s2 .  When  the  mass  drops  below  height  5m,  the  ﬁeld  is  switched  on  and  the 
particle  continues  to move  with  new  acceleration  0m/s2 . 

Assuming  the  displacement  and  velocity  are  continuous,  determine  the  height  and  instantaneous 
velocity  of  the mass  at  time  t = 1.2s.  Show  your  work. 

Problem  3(5  points)  For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f (x)  and  a  real  number  a,  using  the  diﬀerence 
quotient  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative,  show  that  the  function  g(x) = f (ax)  has  derivative, 
g � (x) = af � (ax).
