Solutions  to  Problem  Set  8


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 
Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 
Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 
Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

Solution  to  (a)  Since  ln(tan(π/4))  =  0,  and  sin(π/4) −  cos(π/4)  =  0,  this  limit  has  the  ” 0 ”

Solution  to  (b)  By  plugging  in  x  =  π/2,  we  see  that  the  limit  becomes  ”1∞”,  which  IS  an 
0 ”,  or  ” ∞ ”,∞
indeterminate  form.  In  order  to  convert  this  form  to  one  of  the  indeterminate  forms  ” 0 
for  which  we  can  use  the  L’hospital’s  rule,  let  us  write 

lim  (sin x)tan x  = 
x→π/2 

lim  eln(sin x)tan x 
x→π/2 
limx→π/2  tan x ln(sin x)
= e 

=  lim  e tan x ln(sin x)
x→π/2 

(2) 

Therefore  we  are  interested  in  the  limit 

ln(sin x)
lim  tan x ln(sin x) =  lim 
x→π/2  cot x 
x→π/2 
which,  when  written  in  this  last  form,  has  the  ” ∞ ”  indeterminancy,  therefore  we  can  invoke 
∞
L’Hospital’s  rule  to  yield 

ln(sin x) 
lim 
x→π/2  cot x

Note  that  the  limit  limb→∞ e−b (sin b −  cos b)  =  0,  because  e−b  vanishes  as  b  tends  to  ∞,  and 
(sin b − cos b)  remains  bounded,  namely  its  values  are  always  in  [−2, 2]  for  all  values  of  b.  More 
precisely,  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  squeezing  lemma,  and 
−2e−b  ≤ e−b (sin b − cos b) ≤ 2e−b 
with  the  observation  that  both ±2e−b  tend  to  zero  as  b  tends  to ∞.

Solution  to (d) First oﬀ, we observe that the required integral is improper, because ln x/

While  the  ﬁrst  limit  is  clearly  zero,  we  need  to  resort  to  our  friend  L’hospital  for  the  evaluation  of 
the  second  one,  as  it  is  in  the  indeterminate  form  ” ∞ ”.  This  yields

Problem  2(15  points)  Solve  Problem  2  from  Exam  4  using  the  disk  method.  In  other  words,  use 
the  disk  method  to  compute  the  volume  of  the  solid  obtained  by  revolving  about  the  y ­axis  the 
region  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  bounded  by  the  x­axis,  the  line  x = 0,  the  line  x = a  and  the  curve,

Solution  to  Problem  2  Since  we  are  revolving  around  the  y ­axis,  dV  = πx2dy  = π (y+b)2 dy .  We 
also  observe  that,  when  x = a,  we  have  y = 0  and  as  x → 0,  we  have  y → ∞.  Therefore  the  limits
