Solution  (a) By Equation  (4)  on  p.  54,  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  parabola  at  (x0 , y0 )  is 
2x0 .  Thus  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
(y − y0 ) = 2x0 (x − x0 ),  or  equivalently  y = 2x0x − x0 . 
2
(a).  At  the  point  (x0 , y0 ) = (−2, 4),  the  tangent  line  is, 
y = −4x − 4. 

(b).  Since  the  slope  is  2x0 ,  the  slope  is  8 when x0  equals  4.  Plugging  in,  y0  equals x0  = (4)2 , which 
2
is  16.  Thus  the  tangent  line  with  slope  8  is, 

y 

= 8

x − 16.

(c).  If  x0  is  zero,  the  tangent  line  has  equation  y = 0,  i.e.,  the  tangent  line  is  the  x­axis.  Thus  the 
tangent  line  does  not  have  a  well­deﬁned  x­intercept.  Therefore  assume  that  x0  is  nonzero.  The 
x­intercept  of  the  tangent  line  is  the value x1  such  that  y  is 0.  Plugging  in,  this gives  the  equation, 
0 = 2x0x1  − x0 .

Simplifying,  this  is  2x0x1  =  x0 .  Since  x0  is  nonzero  by  hypothesis,  also  2x0  is  nonzero.  Dividing 
both  side  by  2x0  gives  the  equation  x1  =  x0/2.  Thus  the  x­intercept  x1  equals  2  if  and  only  if  x0 
equals  2x1  = 2 × 2 = 4.  As  computed  in  (b),  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
x − 16.
y 
= 8

Solution  (b)  Since  f (x)  equals  ax2  + bx + c,  substituting  x + Δx  for  x,  f (x + Δx)  equals, 

a(x + Δx)2  + b(x + Δx) + c. 

Expanding  the  square,  this  is, 

a(x 2  + 2xΔx + (Δx)2 ) + b(x + Δx) + c. 
Therefore  f (x + Δx) − f (x)  equals, 
[a(x 2  + 2xΔx + (Δx)2 ) + b(x + Δx) + c] − [ax  + bx + c]. 
2

Cancelling  like  terms,  namely  ax2 ,  bx  and  c,  this  simpliﬁes  to, 

2axΔx + a(Δx)2  + bΔx. 

Separating  the  common  factor Δx  from  these  terms,  this  simpliﬁes  to, 
f (x + Δx) − f (x) = (2ax + aΔx + b)Δx. 

This  complete  Step  1. 

Because  of  the  common  factor Δx,  the  diﬀerence  quotient  is, 
f (x + Δx) − f (x) 
Δx 
for Δx  nonzero.  This  completes  Step  2. 

= 2ax + aΔx + b,

Holding  a,  b  and  x  constant  and  allowing  Δx  to  vary,  the  expression  2ax + aΔx + b  is  a  linear 
function  in  Δx;  perhaps  this  is  easier  to  see  if  it  is  written  aΔx + (2ax + b).  A  linear  function  is 
continuous.  Thus  to  compute  the  limit  as  Δx  approaches  0,  it  suﬃces  to  substitute  in  Δx  equals 
0.  Therefore, 
f � (x) =  lim [aΔx + (2ax + b)] = a0 + (2ax + b), 
Δx 0→
which  simpliﬁes  to  2ax + b.  Therefore  the  derivative  of  ax2  + bx + c  is, 
f � (x

) = 2
ax + b.

Solution  (c) The function is deﬁned when 3x + 2 is nonzero, i.e., when x is not −2/3.  The function 
is  undeﬁned  with  x  equals −2/3.  Therefore  assume  that  x  is  not −2/3.

Considered as a function of Δx, is the expression (−3)/(3x+2+3Δx)(3x+2) deﬁned and continuous 
at Δx = 0?  The only values of Δx where the expression is undeﬁned or discontinuous are the values 
where  the  denominator  equals  0. 
By  hypothesis,  x  is  not  −2/3,  and  thus  3x + 2  is  not  zero.  Therefore  the  denominator  is  0  if  and 
only  if  3x + 2 + 3Δx  is  0.  Thus  the  function  (−3)/(3x + 2 + 3Δx)(3x + 2)  has  a  single  inﬁnite 
discontinuity when Δx  equals −x − 2/3.  Again  using  the  hypothesis  that  x  is  not −2/3, −x − 2/3 
does  not  equal  0.  In  other  words,  there  is  a  single  point  where  the  function  is  undeﬁned  and 
discontinuous,  but  this  point  is  diﬀerent  from  Δx  =  0.  Therefore  (−3)/(3x + 2 + 3Δx)(3x + 2) 
is  deﬁned  and  continuous  at  Δx  =  0.  So  the  limit  can  be  computed  by  substituting  in  0  for  Δx.

(a).  There  are  3  cases  to  consider:  0  ≤ t ≤ 9/4,  9/4  < t ≤ 3  and  t > 3.  In  the  ﬁrst  case,  v1 (t)

(6 − 2t = 9 − 4t)  if  and  only  if  (2t = 3)  if  and  only  if  (t = 3/2). 
So  for  0  ≤ t  ≤ 9/4,  the  speeds  are  equal  for  precisely  one  moment,  t  = 3/2.  At  this  time,  both 
speeds equal 3.  Note, however,  the velocity of  the ﬁrst particle  is −3 and  the velocity of  the  second 
particle  is +3,  i.e.,  the  velocities  are  not  equal. 
In  the  second  case,  |v1 (t) equals  v2 (t) if  and  only  if,

|
(6 − 2t = 4t − 9)  if  and  only  if  (6t = 15)if  and  only  if  (t = 15/6). 
Note  that  15/6 =  5/2 =  2 1  is  between  9/4 =  2 1  and  3.  So,  for  9/4 < t ≤ 3,  the  speeds  are  equal 
4 
2
for  precisely  one moment,  t = 5/2.  At  this  time,  both  speeds  equal  1.

(a)(5  points)  Show  that  for  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  at  (x0 , y0 ),  the  x­intercept  of  the

(b)(5  points)  Part  (a)  implies  the  following:  For  every  pair  of  real  numbers  (x1 , y1 ),  there  is  a 
tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  with  x­intercept  x1  and  y ­intercept  y1  if  and  only  if  x1y1  equals 
4.  You may  use  this  fact  freely. 
Let  (a, b)  be  a  point  such  that  ab  is  nonzero  and  less  than  1  (possibly  negative).  Show  that  a  line 
L  with  x­intercept  x1  and  y ­intercept  y1  is  a  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  containing  (a, b)  if 
and  only  if  x1  satisﬁes,

and  y1  satisﬁes, 

Hint.  Using Equations 1–5 on pp.  11–12 of  the  textbook, deduce  that L contains  (a, b)  if and only 
if  bx1  + ay1  equals  x1y1 .  Then  use  the  fact  above  to  eliminate  one  of  x1  or  y1  from  this  equation, 
and  simplify. 
Solution  to  (b)  The  equation  of  the  line  L  with  x­intercept  x1  and  y ­intercept  y1  is, 

Therefore  (a, b)  is  on  L  if  and  only  if, 

x1y + y1x = x1y1 . 

bx1  + ay1  = x1y1 .

First,  substituting  in  y1  = 4/x1  to  Equation  1  gives, 

4a 
bx1  +  = 4.

Multiplying  both  sides  by  x1  and  simplifying  gives,

a+ 4 = 0. 

Next,  substituting  in  x1  = 4/y1  to  Equation  1  gives,

y1 

+ ay1  = 4. 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  y1  and  simplifying  gives,

b+ 4 = 0. 

(c)(5 points) Using the quadratic formula and Part  (b), which you may now use freely, write down 
the  equations  of  the  2  tangent  lines  to  the  graph  of  f (x)  containing  the  point  (a, b) = (5, −3). 
Solution  to  (c)  Plugging  in  a = 5  and  b = −3  to  the  equation  bx2 
1  − 4x1  + 4a = 0  gives, 
2−3x1  − 4x1  + 20 = 0.

Thus the solutions are x1  = 6/3 = 2 and x1  = −10/3.  Since y1  = 4/x2 ,  the corresponding solutions 
of  y1  are  y1  = 2  and  y1  = −6/5. 
Since  the  equation  of L  is  y1x + x1y = x1y1 ,  the  equations  of  the  2  tangent  lines  containing  (5, −3)

Problem  2(10  points) For  a mass moving  vertically  under  constant  acceleration −g ,  the  displace­
ment  function  is, 
x(t) = −g t2/2 + v0 t + x0 , 
where  x0  is  the  displacement  and  v0  is  the  instantaneous  velocity  at  time  t = 0. 
A  scientist  uses  a magnetic  ﬁeld  to  conduct  an  experiment  simulating  zero  gravity.  At  time  t = 0, 
the  scientist  drops  a mass  from  a  height  of  10m with  instantaneous  velocity  v0  = 0  under  constant 
acceleration  −10m/s2 .  When  the  mass  drops  below  height  5m,  the  ﬁeld  is  switched  on  and  the 
particle  continues  to move  with  new  acceleration  0m/s2 . 
Assuming  the  displacement  and  velocity  are  continuous,  determine  the  height  and  instantaneous 
velocity  of  the mass  at  time  t = 1.2s.  Show  your  work. 

Solution  to  Problem  2  Before  the  ﬁeld  is  switched  on,  the  displacement  function  is, 
x(t) = −10t /2 + 0t + 10 = −5t2  + 10.

Diﬀerentiating,  the  velocity  function  is, 
v(t) = x� (t) = −10t. 

The  time  t1  at  which  the  ﬁeld  is  switched  on  is  the  positive  solution  of  the  equation  x(t1 )  =  5. 
Plugging  in  and  solving  gives, 
5 = −5t1  + 10  or  equivalently  5t1  = 5  or  equivalently  t2  = 1.

Therefore  the  ﬁeld  is  activated  at  time  t1  = 1s. 
The  displacement  function  for  t > t1  is, 
x(t) = g1 (t − t1 )2/2 + v1 (t − t1 ) + x1 , 
where  g1  is  the  new  acceleration,  v1  is  the  instantaneous  velocity  at  time  t  =  t1 ,  and  x1  is  the 
displacement  at  time  t = t1 .  At  time  t1 ,  the  displacement  is  x1  = 5  and  the  instantaneous  velocity 
is  v(t1 ) =  −10(1)  =  −10.  For  t  >  t1 ,  the  particle  moves  with  acceleration  g1  =  0.  Thus  the 
displacement  function  is, 
x(t) = 0(t − 1)2  + (−10)(t − 1) + 5 = −10t + 15. 
Plugging  in  t = 1.2s  gives, 

x(1.2) = −10(1.2) + 15 = −12 + 15 =  3m. 
Problem  3(5  points)  For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f (x)  and  a  real  number  a,  using  the  diﬀerence 
quotient  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative,  show  that  the  function  g(x) = f (ax)  has  derivative, 
g � (x) = af � (ax). 

Solution  to  Problem  3  Plugging  in, 
g(x + Δx) − g(x) = f (a(x + Δx)) − f (ax) = f (ax + aΔx) − f (ax). 
Thus  the  diﬀerence  quotient  for  g(x)  is, 
g(x + Δx) − g(x)

f (ax + aΔx) − f (ax)

Applying  this  to  the  limit  above,  and  using  that  a(0)  equals  0,

f (ax + aΔx) − f (ax) 
g � (x) =

This  limit  is  precisely  the  derivative  of  f (x)  at  the  point  ax.  Therefore,
