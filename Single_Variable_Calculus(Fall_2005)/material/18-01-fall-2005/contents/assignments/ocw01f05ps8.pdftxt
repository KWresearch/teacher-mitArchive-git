Problem  Set  8


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 

Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 

Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 

Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps). 

Part  I(20  points) 
(a) 
(4  points)  p.  403,  Section  12.2,  Problem  14 
(b)  (4  points)  p.  408,  Section  12.3,  Problem  38 
(c) 
(4  points)  p.  413,  Section  12.4,  Problem  8 
(d)  (4  points)  p.  413,  Section  12.4,  Problem  13 
(e) 
(4  points)  p.  414,  Section  12.4,  Problem  20 
Part  II(30  points) 
Problem  1(15  points)  Solve  Problem  21,  p.  414,  §12.4  of  the  textbook.  First  solve  (e)  above. 
Problem  2(15  points)  Solve  Problem  2  from  Exam  4  using  the  disk  method.  In  other  words,  use 
the  disk  method  to  compute  the  volume  of  the  solid  obtained  by  revolving  about  the  y ­axis  the 
region  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  bounded  by  the  x­axis,  the  line  x = 0,  the  line  x = a  and  the  curve,
