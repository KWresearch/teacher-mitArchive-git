To  solve  for  x, multiply  both  sides  of  the  equation  by  1 + y  to  get,

Let  z  equal  1/(1 + x).  Then  y  equals  1 − z .  So  y �  equals −z � .  So  y ��  equals −z �� .  Clearly,  for  every 
positive  integer  n,  y (n)  equals −z (n) .  By  the  same  argument  as  in  Example  2  on  p.  109, 
z (n)  = (−1)n n!(x + 1)−(n+1) . 

Thus,  for  every  positive  integer  n,

Solution  (d)  The  equation,

(ay  − x)2  = x  − 1.

Expanding  the  left­hand­side  gives, 
(ay )2  − 2xay  + x 2  = x  − 1. 
2

Cancelling  x2  from  each  side  gives, 

(ay )2  − 2xay  = −1. 
Adding  2xay  + 1  to  each  side  of  the  equation  gives, 

(ay )2  + 1 = 2xay . 

The  expression  2ay  is  always  nonzero.  Thus  it  is  valid  to  divide  each  side  by  2ay ,  giving, 

x = [(ay )2  + 1]/(2ay ) = [ay  + 1/ay ]/2.

Solution  (e) Because 1/2 is less than 1,  log(1/2) is less than log(1) = 0.  Thus log(1/2) is negative. 
For  every  pair  of  real  numbers  a < b  and  every  negative  number  c,  ac  is  greater  than  bc,  not  less 
than  bc.  Therefore,  the  correct  inequality  is,

cos(2φ) = (cos(φ))2  − (sin(φ))2  = 2(cos(φ))2  − [(cos(φ))2  + (sin(φ))2 ] = 2(cos(φ))2  − 1. 

Substituting  2θ  for  φ  gives, 

cos(4θ) = 2(cos(2θ))2  − 1. 
Subsituting  in  cos(2θ) = 2(cos(θ))2  − 1  gives,

Part  II(30  points) 
Problem  1(5  points)  Find  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  y  =  e571x  containing 
the  point  (102π , 0).  (This  is  not  a  point  on  the  graph;  it  is  a  point  on  the  tangent  line.) 

Solution  to  Problem  1  Denote  571  by  the  symbol  n.  Denote  102π  by  the  symbol  a.  The 
derivative  of  enx  equals  nenx .  Thus  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  y  =  enx  at  the  point  (b, enb ) 
equals  nenb .  So  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  to  y = enx  at  (b, enb )  is, 
y = ne  (x − b) + e nb  = ne  x − (nb − 1)e nb .

Problem  3(10 points) A bank oﬀers savings  accounts  and  loans.  For an  initial deposit of A dollars 
in  a  savings  account  with  continuously  compounded  interest  at  an  annual  rate  a,  after  t  years  the 
bank  owes  the  customer  A(1 + a)t  dollars  (neglecting  fees).  For  an  initial  loan  of  B  dollars  with 
continuously  compounded  interest  at  an  annual  rate  b,  after  t  years  the  customer  owes  the  bank 
B (1 + b)t  dollars (neglecting fees).  To make a proﬁt, the bank sets rate b, the interest rate for loans, 
higher  than  rate a,  the  interest  rate  for  savings.  To  simplify  computations,  introduce α = ln(1 + a) 
and  β  = ln(1 + b). 
Customer 1 deposits A dollars  in a savings account.  The bank  immediately  loans a smaller amount 
of  B  dollars  to  Customer  2.  After  t  years,  the  bank’s  net  gain  from  the  two  transactions  together 
is, 
G(t) = B e β t  − Aeαt . 
In  the  long  run,  which  is  to  say,  when  t  is  very  large,  G(t)  is  positive  and  the  bank  has  made  a 
gain.  However,  for  t  small, G(t)  is  negative  and  the  bank  has  a  net  liability, 
L(t) = −G(t) = Aeαt  − B e β t . 

(1) 

(2) 

The  liability  for  the  savings  account  alone  is, 

M (t) = Aeαt . 

(3) 

In  these  equations,  A, B , α  and  β  are  positive  constants,  and  t  is  the  independent  variable. 
(a)(5  points)  Find  the  moment  t  =  T  when  the  derivative  L� (T )  equals  0.  Assume  that  αA  is 
greater  than  βB .  Also,  leave  your  answer  in  the  form, 
e(β−α)T  = something. 

Remark.  After Lecture  10, we will  learn  that T  is  the moment when L(t) has  its  largest value.  In 
other  words,  if  at  time  t  Customer  1  withdraws  all  money,  and  Customer  2  repays  all  money,  the

bank  loses  the maximum  amount  when  t = T .

Solution  to  (a)  Using  the  chain  rule, 

L� (t) = A(e  )�  − B (e  )�  = A(αe αt ) − B (β e β t ) = αAeαt  − βB e β t . 
β t
αt
By  deﬁnition  of  T ,  L� (T )  equals  0.  Thus, 

Dividing  each  side  of  the  equation  by  βB eαT  gives, 

βB e βT  = αAeαT . 

Using  rules  of  exponents,  this  is,

It  is  worth  remarking  that  to  make  T  small,  the  bank  may  maximize  the  fraction  B /A  of  money 
loaned  to money deposited and  the bank may maximize  the  fraction β /α  (although  if β  is  too high 
or  α  too  low,  customers  are  discouraged  from  using  the  bank). 

(b)(5  points)  Consider  the  ratio  L(t)/M (t).  Using  your  answer  to  (a),  determine  L(T )/M (T ). 
Simplify  your  answer  as much  as  possible.  How  does  this  ratio  depend  on  the  amounts  A  and  B ? 

Solution  to  (b)  The  ratio  L(t)/M (T )  equals,

L(t) 
B 
e(β−α)t . 
M (t)

In  particular,  this  is 

independent  of 

A  and  B .

Remark.  From the formulas, the bank’s strategy is clear.  First, adjust the ratio β /α to the highest 
level allowed by  law and compatible with  the market’s demands.  Then,  for ﬁxed α and β ,  the  ratio 
L(T )/M (T )  is  independent  of  A  and  B .  So  the  maximal  liability  L(T )  is  proportional  to  M (T ). 
Since M (T )  is an  increasing  function,  the  strategy  is  to minimize T , by maximizing  the  ratio B /A. 
(Of  course  this  ratio will always be  less  than 1,  since  some  fraction of all  capital goes  to  the  federal 
reserve,  some  fraction  is  used  to  cover  operating  expenses,  etc.) 
Problem  4(10  points)  Let  A,  β ,  ω  and  t0  be  positive  constants.  Let  f (t)  be  the  function, 
f (t) = Ae−β t cos(ω(t − t0 )). 

(a)(5  points)  Compute  f � (t)  and  f �� (t).  Simplify  your  answer  as much  as  possible. 
Solution  to  (a)  Let  s  equal  t − t0 .  Then  f (t) = g(s),  where, 
g(s) = B e−β s cos(ωs),

ds
The second derivative g �� (s) involves the derivative of e−β s cos(ωs), but it is also involves the deriva­
tive  of  e−β s  sin(ωs).  Using  the  chain  rule  and  the  product  rule, 
ds (e−β s  sin(ωs)) = (e−β s )�  sin(ωs) + e−β s (sin(ωs))�  = 
d 
−β e−β s  sin(ωs) + ωe−β s cos(ωs). 

As  above,

Back­substituting  s = t − t0  and  B e−β s  = Ae−β t  gives,

(b)(5 points) Using  your  answer  to  (a),  ﬁnd nonzero  constants  c0 , c1  and  c2  for which  the  function 
c2f �� (t) + c1f � (t) + c0f (t), 

always  equals  0. 
Solution to (b) From the Solution to (a), f � (t)+ β f (t) equals −Ae−β t (ω sin(ω(t− t0 ))).  Plugging 
this  into  the  formula  for  f �� (t)  gives, 
f �� (t) = (β 2  − ω 2 )f (t) − 2β (f � (t) + β (f )) = −2β f �  − (β 2  + ω 2 )f (t). 
Simplifying  gives, 

f �� (t) + 2β f � (t) + (ω2  + β 2 )f (t) = 0. 
In  fact,  every  solution  is  of  the  form, 

for  some  nonzero  c.
