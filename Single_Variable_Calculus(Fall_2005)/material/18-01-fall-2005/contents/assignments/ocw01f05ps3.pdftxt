Problem  Set  3


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 
Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 
Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 
Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

Figure  1:  Sliding  line  segment  of  length  c 

For −2π ≤ x ≤ 2π ,  sketch  the  graph  of  y = f (x).  Do  each  of  the  following. 

(i)  Label  all  vertical  asymptotes.  Use  the  form  “y =  number”. 

(ii)  Label  all  local  maxima  and  local  minima  (if  any).	 Give  the  coordinates  for  each  labelled 
point. 

(iii)  Label  all  inﬂection  points  (if  any).  Give  the  coordinates  and  the  derivative  of  each  labelled 
point. 

(iv)  Label	 each  region  where  the  graph  is  concave  up.  Label  each  region  where  the  graph  is 
concave  down. 

Warning:  This  graph  is  trickier  than  it  seems!  Before  attempting  the  problem,  it may  be  helpful 
to  use  a  computer  or  graphing  calculator  to  get  an  idea  what  the  graph  looks  like. 

Problem  2(10  points)  Figure  1  depicts  two  ﬁxed  rays  L  and M  meeting  at  a  ﬁxed  acute  angle  φ. 
A  line  segment  of  ﬁxed  length  c  is  allowed  to  slide  with  one  endpoint  on  line  L  and  one  endpoint 
on  line  M .  Denote  by  a  the  distance  from  the  origin  of  ray  L  to  the  endpoint  of  the  segment  on 
line  L.  Denote  by  b  the  distance  from  the  origin  of  ray  M  to  the  endpoint  of  the  segment  on  line 
M .  Denote  by  θ  the  angle made  by  the  line  segment  and  the  ray  L  at  the  point  where  they meet. 

For the position of the line segment making b maximal, express a, b and θ  in terms of the constants: 
c  and  φ.  The  expression  for  the  one  remaining  angle  of  the  triangle  is  easier  than  the  expression 
for  θ .  You may  want  to  start  by  computing  that  angle,  and  then  solve  for  θ  using  that  the  sum  of 
the  interior  angles  of  a  triangle  equals  π . 

Show  your  work.  You may  ﬁnd  the  law  of  cosines  useful, 
c  = a  + b2  − 2ab cos(φ).

Problem  3(10  points)  Solve  Problem  17  from  §4.4,  p.  137  of  the  textbook.  You  are  free  to  use 
any  (valid) method  you  like.  You may  ﬁnd  the  following  remarks  useful. 

Figure  2  depicts  an  isosceles  triangle  circumscribed  about  a  circle  of  radius  R.  The  two  similar 
sides  each  have  length  A + B ,  and  the  third  side  has  length  2A.  Express  the  area  of  each  right

Figure  2:  An  isosceles  triangle  circumscribing  a  circle  of  radius  R 

triangle  in  terms  of  either  tan(α)  or  tan(β ).  Because  the  sum  of  the  angles  of  a  circle  is  2π ,  β 
equals  π − 2α.  Recall  the  double­angle  formula  for  tangents, 

tan(2θ) =

2 tan(θ)
1 − (tan(θ))2 , 

and  the  complementary  angle  formula  for  tangents, 
tan(π − θ) = − tan(θ). 

Using  these,  express  tan(β ),  and  thus  the  total  area  of  the  triangle,  in  terms  of  T  =  tan(α).  Now 
minimize  this  expression  with  respect  to  T ,  ﬁnd  the  corresponding  angle  α,  and  the  height  of  the 
triangle.
