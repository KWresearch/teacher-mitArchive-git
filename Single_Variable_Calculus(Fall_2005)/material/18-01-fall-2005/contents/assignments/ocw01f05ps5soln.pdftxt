Solutions  to  Problem  Set  5


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 
Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 
Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 
Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

Solution  to  (a) We  rewrite  the  equation  dy  =  2+2y  in  form 
dx 
� 
� 
(2 + 2y)dy = (5 + 3x 2 )dx 
and  integrate  both  sides  to  obtain  (2 + 2y)dy =  (5 + 3x2 )dx,  or 
y 2  + 2y = x 3  + 5x + C 

where  C  is  a  constant,  which  is  going  to  be  determined  by  the  initial  condition  y = 3  when  x = 2. 
Thus we  have  32  + 2.3 = 23  + 5.2 + C  which  yields C  = 26.  In  order  to  obtain  an  expression  for  y ,

we  complete  the  left  hand  side  to  a  complete  square, 
y 2  + 2y + 1 − 1 = (y + 1)2  − 1 = x 3  + 5x + C  = x 3  + 5x + 26 

or  (y + 1)2  = x3  + 5x + 27,  therefore

Note that we chose the plus sign for the square root to be consistent with the given initial condition. 
Solution  to  (b) We  are  given  the  equation  L dI  = E − RI ,  which  is  separated  as 
dt 

LdI

Solution  to  (d)  We  ﬁrst  need  to  calculate  the  tangent  line  of  y  =  x3  at  x  =  1.  As  the  slope  of 
this  line  is  given  by  y � (1) = 3x |x=1  = 3,  it  is  given  by 
2
y = 3(x − 1) + 1 = 3x − 2 

(1) 

A  graph  of  the  region  is  included  on  the  webpage. 

In  order  to  calculate  the  area  between  this  tangent  line  and  the  graph  of  y = f (x)  we  need  to  ﬁnd 
the  other  point  where  the  two  intersect.  Let’s  denote  this  point  by  (u, u3 )  (remember  that  this 
point  is  on  y = x3 )  .  Then,  by  plugging  into  (1),  we  obtain  u3  = 3u − 2.  This  can  be  rewritten  as 
3 u  − 3u + 2 = 0 
which,  at  ﬁrst  sight,  not  easy  to  solve.  However,  since  the  tangent  line  touches  the  curve  at  u = 1, 
we  know  one  solution  is  u = 1.  In  fact,  u = 1  is  a  double  root,  because  the  tangent  line  is  tangent 
to  the  curve  at  that  point.  Therefore,  we  should  be  able  to  rewrite  (2)  in  the  form 
3 u  − 3u + 2 = (u − 1)2 (u − a) 
where  a  is  the  other  root.  By  multiplying  out,  or  a  simple  inspection,  we  easily  see  that  a = −2.

Therefore,  the  sought  integral  has  the  limits  ­2  and  1.  Hence

Solution  to  (a)  By  diﬀerentiating  y  = C xn ,  we  obtain  dy  = C nxn−1 .  One  way  to  get  rid  of  C  is
dx 
to  write

where  we  used  both  our  equations  to  obtain  expressions  for  C .  Thus,  we  have  obtained 

C  =

which  is  the  required  diﬀerential  equation.  Note  that  this  equation  does  not  involve  C ,  and  it  is 
satisﬁed  by  y = C xn  for  any  arbitrary  C .

(b)(5  points) A  diﬀerentiable  function  y = g(x)  has  the  property  that  for  every  point  (a, b)  on  the 
graph,  the  tangent  line  to  y = g(x)  at  (a, b)  is  orthogonal  to  the  tangent  line  to  y = C xn  at  (a, b). 
Here  C  is  chosen  to  be, 

b

an 
so  that  (a, b)  is  on  the  graph  of  y  = C xn .  Use  the  hypothesis  to  write  a  diﬀerential  equation  g(x) 
satisﬁes. 

C  = 

Hint.  The  diﬀerential  equation  is  separable. 

Solution  to  (b) We  remember  the  slopes  of  the  two  orthogonal  lines  multiply  to  ­1.  It’s  easy  to 
read  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  be  ny .  Therefore  the  sought  equation  is

G(x, y) = E , 

where G(x, y)  is  a  polynomial,  and  E  is  a  positive  real  number.

Problem  2(10  points)  Solve  Problem  11  on  p.  229  of  the  textbook.  The  answer  is  in  the  back  of 
the  book  (and  even  in  the  statement  of  the  problem).  You  are  responsible  for  showing  the  work, 
and  explaining  the  steps,  leading  to  the  answer. 
Solution  to  Problem  2  We  are  considering  the  volume  generated  by  revolving  the  given  circle

Problem  3(5  points) A  cone  over  a  plane  region R  is  the  solid  obtained  by  joining  every  point  in 
R  to  a  ﬁxed  point  P  not  in  the  plane.  If  the  height  of  P  above  the  plane  is  h,  and  if  the  area  of 
the  region  R  is  A,  the  volume  of  the  cone  is,

Prove  this  fact  by  computing  the  volume  using  the washer method.  You may  use  the  fact  that  if  a 
plane  region  is  scaled  by  a  factor  c,  the  area  scales  by  the  factor  c2 . 
Solution  to  Problem  3  An  illustration  of  the  setup,  with  a  slice  highlighted,  is  available  on  the

A(z ) = s 2A

where  s  is  a  scale  factor  which  decreases  linearly  from  1  at  z  = 0  to  0  at  z  =  h.  Therefore  it  is
