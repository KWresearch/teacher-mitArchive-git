Problem  Set  7


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 

Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 

Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 

Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

Problem  1(15  points)  This  problem  sketches  a  systematic  method  for  ﬁnding  antiderivatives  of 

expressions  F (sin(θ), cos(θ)),  where  F  is  a  fraction  of  polynomials.

(a)(8  points) With  the  substitution  tan(θ/2) = z ,  verify  that, 
1 − z 2 
2z 
1 + z 2 , 
1 + z 2 ,  cos(θ) = 
Please  try  this  on  your  own  ﬁrst.  However,  if  you  are  very  stuck,  take  a  look  at  Problem  5E­12  in 
the  course  reader.

1 + z 2 

sin(θ) = 

dθ = 

(b)(7 points) By Example 3 on p.  571 of the textbook,  the polar equation of the conic section with 
eccentricity  e  and  focal  parameter  p · e  is, 

r = f (θ) = 

ep 
1 − e cos(θ) 
Set  up  the  integral  for  the  area  of  the  region  bounded  by  0 ≤  r ≤ f (θ)  for  a ≤  θ ≤ A.  Use  (a)  to 
� 
turn  this  into  an  integral  involving  only  z = tan(θ/2).  Use  the  nonnegative  constant, 
1 − e
|

,
1 + e 

b = 

to  simplify  your  answer.  You  need  not  evaluate  the  integral.


Problem  2(15  points)


(a)(5  points)  Read  through  Section  10.3  (it  is  only  3  and  a  half  pages).  Everybody  will  get  credit

for  this  part.

� 
(b)(5  points)  Use Problem  1  (a)  to  rewrite  the  integral, 


sinm (θ) cos n (θ)dθ, 

as  an  integral  involving  only  z = tan(θ/2).

� 
(c)(5  points)  Assume  n ≥ 2.  Use  the  following  integration  by  parts, 


� 
to  ﬁnd  a  reduction  formula  of  the  form, 

sinm (θ) cos n (θ)dθ,  u = sinm (θ) cos n−1 (θ),  dv = cos(θ)dθ, 
� 
sinm (θ) cos n (θ)dθ = F (sin(θ), cos(θ) + A 

sinm+2 (θ) cos n−2 (θ)dθ. 

Not  to  be  turned  in:  Of  these  three methods  for  evaluating  the  integral, which would be  easiest 
to  use  and  fastest  on  an  exam?
