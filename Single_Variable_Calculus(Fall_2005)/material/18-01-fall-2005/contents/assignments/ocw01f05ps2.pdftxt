Problem  Set  2


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 

Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 

Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 

Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

the  point  (102π , 0).  (This  is  not  a  point  on  the  graph;  it  is  a  point  on  the  tangent  line.)

Problem  2(5  points) 
(a)(2  points)  What  does  the  chain  rule  say  if  y  =  xa  and  u  =  y b?  The  constants  a  and  b  are 
fractions. 

(b)(3  points)  Using  the  chain  rule,  give  a  very  short  explanation  of  the  formula  from  Problem  3, 
Part  II  of  Problem  Set  1. 

Problem  3(10 points) A bank oﬀers savings  accounts  and  loans.  For an  initial deposit of A dollars 
in  a  savings  account  with  continuously  compounded  interest  at  an  annual  rate  a,  after  t  years  the 
bank  owes  the  customer  A(1 + a)t  dollars  (neglecting  fees).  For  an  initial  loan  of  B  dollars  with 
continuously  compounded  interest  at  an  annual  rate  b,  after  t  years  the  customer  owes  the  bank 
B (1 + b)t  dollars (neglecting fees).  To make a proﬁt, the bank sets rate b, the interest rate for loans, 
higher  than  rate a,  the  interest  rate  for  savings.  To  simplify  computations,  introduce α = ln(1 + a) 
and  β  = ln(1 + b). 

Customer 1 deposits A dollars  in a savings account.  The bank  immediately  loans a smaller amount 
of  B  dollars  to  Customer  2.  After  t  years,  the  bank’s  net  gain  from  the  two  transactions  together 
is, 
G(t) = B e β t  − Aeαt . 
In  the  long  run,  which  is  to  say,  when  t  is  very  large,  G(t)  is  positive  and  the  bank  has  made  a 
gain.  However,  for  t  small, G(t)  is  negative  and  the  bank  has  a  net  liability, 
L(t) = −G(t) = Aeαt  − B e β t . 

(1) 

(2) 

The  liability  for  the  savings  account  alone  is, 

M (t) = Aeαt . 

(3) 

In  these  equations,  A, B , α  and  β  are  positive  constants,  and  t  is  the  independent  variable. 
(a)(5  points)  Find  the  moment  t  =  T  when  the  derivative  L� (T )  equals  0.  Assume  that  αA  is 
greater  than  βB .  Also,  leave  your  answer  in  the  form, 
e(β−α)T  = something. 

Remark.  After Lecture  10, we will  learn  that T  is  the moment when L(t) has  its  largest value.  In 
other  words,  if  at  time  t  Customer  1  withdraws  all  money,  and  Customer  2  repays  all  money,  the 
bank  loses  the maximum  amount  when  t = T . 

(b)(5  points)  Consider  the  ratio  L(t)/M (t).  Using  your  answer  to  (a),  determine  L(T )/M (T ). 
Simplify  your  answer  as much  as  possible.  How  does  this  ratio  depend  on  the  amounts  A  and  B ? 
Problem  4(10  points)  Let  A,  β ,  ω  and  t0  be  positive  constants.  Let  f (t)  be  the  function, 
f (t) = Ae−β t cos(ω(t − t0 )).

(a)(5  points)  Compute  f � (t)  and  f �� (t).  Simplify  your  answer  as much  as  possible. 
(b)(5 points) Using  your  answer  to  (a),  ﬁnd nonzero  constants  c0 , c1  and  c2  for which  the  function 
c2f �� (t) + c1f � (t) + c0f (t), 

always  equals  0.
