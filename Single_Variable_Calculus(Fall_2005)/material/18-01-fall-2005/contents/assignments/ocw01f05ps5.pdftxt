Problem  Set  5


Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 
Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 
Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 
Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps).

Problem  1(15  points)  For  each  positive  integer  n,  consider  the  collection  of  curves,

y = C x n , 

where  C  varies  over  all  real  numbers. 
(a)(5 points) For y = C xn , ﬁnd the derivative dy/dx.  Then use the expression y = C xn  to eliminate 
the  constant  C  from  dy/dx.  Write  your  answer  in  the  form,

for  some  function  F  that  does  not  involve  C .

(b)(5  points) A  diﬀerentiable  function  y = g(x)  has  the  property  that  for  every  point  (a, b)  on  the 
graph,  the  tangent  line  to  y = g(x)  at  (a, b)  is  orthogonal  to  the  tangent  line  to  y = C xn  at  (a, b). 
Here  C  is  chosen  to  be, 

b 
, 
an 
so  that  (a, b)  is  on  the  graph  of  y  = C xn .  Use  the  hypothesis  to  write  a  diﬀerential  equation  g(x) 
satisﬁes. 

C  = 

Hint.  The  diﬀerential  equation  is  separable. 

(c)(5  points)  Solve  the  separable  diﬀerential  equation  to  ﬁnd  all  curves  y  =  g(x)  satisfying  the 
hypothesis.  Express  the  curve  implicitly  in  the  form, 

G(x, y) = E , 

where G(x, y)  is  a  polynomial,  and  E  is  a  positive  real  number. 

Problem  2(10  points)  Solve  Problem  11  on  p.  229  of  the  textbook.  The  answer  is  in  the  back  of 
the  book  (and  even  in  the  statement  of  the  problem).  You  are  responsible  for  showing  the  work, 
and  explaining  the  steps,  leading  to  the  answer. 

Problem  3(5  points) A  cone  over  a  plane  region R  is  the  solid  obtained  by  joining  every  point  in 
R  to  a  ﬁxed  point  P  not  in  the  plane.  If  the  height  of  P  above  the  plane  is  h,  and  if  the  area  of 
the  region  R  is  A,  the  volume  of  the  cone  is, 

Prove  this  fact  by  computing  the  volume  using  the washer method.  You may  use  the  fact  that  if  a 
plane  region  is  scaled  by  a  factor  c,  the  area  scales  by  the  factor  c2 .
