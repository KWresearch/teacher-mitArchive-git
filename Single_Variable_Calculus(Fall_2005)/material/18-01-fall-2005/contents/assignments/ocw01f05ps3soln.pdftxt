We  infer  that  there  is  a  local  maximum  at  x = −1,  where  y  = −2,  and  a  local  minimum  at  x = 1 
where  y = 2. Considering  that  y  = f (x)  almost  equals  x  for  large  values  of  x, we  are  now  ready  to 
sketch  its  graph,  which  is  shown  in  Figure  1. 

Solution  (b)  Let  them  intersect  at  the  point  (x0 , y0 ).  Because  they  intersect  at  (x0 , y0 )

This  implies  that  tan ax0  = 1  which  in  turn  implies  ax0  = π/4 + nπ  for  some  integer  n.  Therefore 
sin ax0  = cos ax0  = ±1/

y �  = f � (x) = 3x 2  + 6x = 3x(x + 2) 

We  observe  that  f � (x) < 0  only  for −2 < x < 0,  otherwise  f � (x) ≥ 0. 
Some  of  its  values  are:  f (−2) = −2,  f (−1) = −4.  f (0) = −6,  f (1) = −2,  f (2) = 14.

Now,  since  f (−2) < 0, and  f � (x) > 0  for  x < −2, we  can  say  that  f  has  no  roots  for  x < −2.Also, 
since  f (−2)  <  0,  and  f � (x)  <  0  for  −2  <  x  <  0,  we  can  say  that  f  has  no  roots  for  −2  <  x  < 
0.Moreover,  since  f (0) = −6, and  f � (x) > 0  for  x > 0, we  can  say  that  f  has  at most  one  root  for 

x > 0. 

−
Furthermore,  since  f (1) =  2  <  0  and  f (2)  =  14  >  0,  we  conclude  that  f  has  exactly  one  root 
which  is  between  1  and  2  by  the  intermediate  value  theorem. 

Now,  we  are  ready  to  calculate  the  Newton’s  iterates

Since  x4  and  x5  have  the  ﬁrst  the  six  digits  the  same,  we  conclude  that  x5  is  at  least  accurate  to 
six  digits. 
Solution  (j) We  are  given  y = f (x) = x3  + 3x − 8. Then 
y �  = f � (x) = 3x 2  + 3 > 0  always 

Therefore  y = f (x)  is  always  increasing,  which  implies  it  cannot  have more  than  one  root. 

Since  f (2) = 6 > 0, and  f (1) = 4 < 0, by  the  intermediate  value  theorem,  f  has  a  root  between  2 
and  1. Now,  we  are  ready  to  calculate  the  Newton’s  iterates

We can consider b as a function of a  : in fact, there are two such functions, however, their maximums 
are  the  same  and  they  take  on  their maximum  at  the  same  point. 
Implicitly  diﬀerentiating  (4)  with  respect  to  a,  we  obtain 
db 
db 
− 2b cos φ − 2a 
da 
da 
db
At  the maximum  of  b = b(a),  we  know  that  da  = 0.  Therefore 
0 = 2a − 2b cos φ  =  a = b cos φ
⇒ 

0 = 2a + 2b

cos φ 

Plugging  this  back  into  (4),  we  obtain 
2 c  = b2 (cos2 φ + 1) − 2b2 cos φ = b2 (1 − sin2 φ) = b2  sin2 φ 

therefore  the maximum  b  is 

which  is  assumed  for 

b = 

c 
sin φ 

a = b cos φ = c cot φ 

(5) 

We’re  also  required  to  ﬁnd  an  expression  for  θ  when  b  is  maximum.  We  call  α  the  angle  corre­
sponding  to  the  edge  b  in  the  abc  triangle,  then  by  sines  theorem 

b 
sin α 

= 

c 
sin φ 

But  this,  combined  with  (5),  implies  that  sin α  =  1,  and  hence  α  =  π/2.  From  the  relation 
φ + θ + α = π ,  we  ﬁnd  out  that 
2  − φ 
θ =  π 

in  the  case  when  b  is maximal.

Figure  6  depicts  an  isosceles  triangle  circumscribed  about  a  circle  of  radius  R.  The  two  similar

triangle  in  terms  of  either  tan(α)  or  tan(β ).  Because  the  sum  of  the  angles  of  a  circle  is  2π ,  β

hence

therefore  u2  = 0  or  u2  = 3.  Recalling  that  u =  tan α,  which  needs  to  be  a  positive  number  for  the

u = tan α =
