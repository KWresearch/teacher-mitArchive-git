Late  homework  policy.  Late  work  will  be  accepted  only  with  a  medical  note  or  for  another 
Institute­approved  reason. 

Cooperation  policy.  You  are  encouraged  to  work  with  others,  but  the  ﬁnal  write­up  must  be 
entirely  your  own  and  based  on  your  own  understanding.  You  may  not  copy  another  student’s 
solutions.  And  you  should  not  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group  while  writing  up  your  solutions 
(if  you  need  to  refer  to  notes  from  a  study  group,  it  isn’t  really  “your  own  understanding”). 

Part  I.  These  problems  are  mostly  from  the  textbook  and  reinforce  the  basic  techniques.  Occa­
sionally  the  solution  to  a  problem  will  be  in  the  back  of  the  textbook.  In  that  case,  you  should 
work  the  problem  ﬁrst  and  only  use  the  solution  to  check  your  answer. 

Part  II.  These  problems  are  not  taken  from  the  textbook.  They  are  more  diﬃcult  and  are  worth 
more  points.  When  you  are  asked  to  “show”  some  fact,  you  are  not  expected  to  write  a  “rigorous 
solution”  in  the  mathematician’s  sense,  nor  a  “textbook  solution”.  However,  you  should  write 
a  clear  argument,  using  English  words  and  complete  sentences,  that  would  convince  a  typical 
Calculus  student.  (Run  your  argument  by  a  classmate;  this  is  a  good  way  to  see  if  your  argument 
is  reasonable.)  Also,  for  the  grader’s  sake,  try  to  keep  your  answers  as  short  as  possible  (but  don’t 
leave  out  important  steps). 

Part  I(20  points) 
(a) 
Ignore  the  introductory 
(2  points)  p.  235,  Section  7.4,  Problem  18(a) 
(b)  (2  points)  p.  235,  Section  7.4,  Problem  18(b)  physics  note/”problem” 
(c) 
(2  points)  p.  591,  Section  17.1,  Problem  12(a) 
(d)  (2  points)  p.  591,  Section  17.1,  Problem  12(b) 
(2  points)  p.  240,  Section  7.5,  Problem  10

(f )

(h)  (2  points)  p.  567,  Section  16.2,  Problem  1 
(2  points)  p.  579,  Section  16.4,  Problem  14 
(i) 
(j) 
(2  points)  p.  582,  Section  16.5,  Problem  7 

12  and  15  are  also  fun 

Part  II(30  points) 

Problem  1(10 points) Solve Problem 41 on p.  256.  In other words, compute the volume of a torus 
using  the  shell method.

Problem  2(20  points)  The  three­leaved  rose  is  the  polar  curve, 

r = cos(3θ). 

(a)(5  points)  Sketch  the  polar  curve  for −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2.  In  a  separate  box,  list  the  angles  where 
r  is maximum,  the  angles  where  r  is  0,  and  the  slope  of  the  curve  at  each  point  where  r  is  0. 

(b)(5  points)  Compute  the  area  of  the  leaf  of  the  rose  that  contains  the  point  (θ = 0, r = 1). 
(c)(5  points) Read Problem  11,  §9.1,  p.  300.  You may  use  the  solution  from  the  back  of  the  book; 
the  problem  is  very  similar  to  Problem  12,  which  was  Part  I,  (h)  from  Problem  Set  2.  Using  the 
solution,  ﬁnd  an  implicit  equation  for  the  Cartesian  form  of  the  curve,  e.g.  some  polynomial  in  x 
and  y  equals  0. 
�  x=1 
(d)(5  points)  Using  your  solution  to  (c),  write  down  an  integral  of  the  form, 
2 
x=0 

f (x)dx, 

for  the  area  of  the  leaf  in  (b).  Do  not  attempt  to  solve  this  integral;  you  already  computed  its 
value.
