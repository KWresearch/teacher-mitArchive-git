Solutions  to  18.01  Exam  3


Problem 1(20 points) A particle moves along the positive x­axis with velocity 5 units/second.  How 
fast  is  the  particle  moving  away  from  the  point  (0, 3)  (which  is  on  the  y ­axis)  when  the  particle  is 
7  units  away  from  (0, 3)? 

Solution  to  Problem  1  The  independent  variable  is  time,  t.  Denote  by  x  the  position  of  the 
particle  on  the  x­axis.  Denote  by  L  the  distance  of  the  particle  from  (0, 3).  By  the  Pythagorean 
theorem, 

L2  = x 2  + 9. 

Diﬀerentiating  with  respect  to  t  gives,

Solution  to  (c)  The  function  sin(θ)  is  odd.  Therefore  the  odd  power,  sin7 (θ)  is  also  an  odd 
function.  The  interval  [−π/2, π/2]  is  symmetric  with  respect  to  the  origin.  Therefore  the  integral 
of  sin7 (θ)  over  [−π/2, 0]  equals  the  negative  of  the  integral  of  sin7 (θ)  over  [0, π/2].  So  the  two 
� 
integrals  cancel  to  give, 
−π/2 

sin7 (θ)dθ =  0.

Alternatively,  rewrite  the  integral  as,

to  reduce  the  original  integral  to,

�  u=0

Since  the  upper  and  lower  limit  are  each  0,  again  this  gives,
