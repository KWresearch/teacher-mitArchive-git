tives  of  f (x).

For  the  third  derivative,  take  u  and  v  as  above,  and  set  z  equals  (x2  − 1)v .  So  z  equals  f �� (x).  By

Extra  credit(5  points)  Only  attempt  this  after  you  have  completed  the  rest  of  the  exam  and 
checked  your  answers.  For  every  positive  integer  n,  show  that  the  nth  derivative  of  f (x)  is  of  the 
form f (n) (x) = pn (x)f (x), where pn (x)  is a polynomial.  Also, give a rule to compute pn+1 (x), given 
pn (x). 
Solution to extra credit problem The claim, proved by induction on n, is that for every positive 
integer  n,  f (n) (x)  equals  pn (x)  where  pn (x)  is  a  degree  n  polynomial  and, 
pn+1 (x) = −xpn (x) + p�
n (x). 
The  solution  to  Problem  2  proves  this  when  n  = 1, 2  and  3.  Let  n  be  a  positive  integer.  By  way 
of  induction,  assume  the  result  is  proved  for  n.  Precisely,  assume  f (n) (x)  equals  pn (x)e−x
2 /2
where 
pn (x)  is  a  degree  n  polynomial.  The  goal  is  to  prove  the  result  for  f (n+1) (x);  precisely,  f (n+1) (x) 
equals  pn+1 (x)e−x2 /2  for  a  degree  n + 1  polynomial  pn+1 (x).  By  deﬁnition, 
d

f (n+1) (x) = 

By  the  induction  hypothesis,  this  equals, 

d

Let  u  and  v  be  as  above,  and  set  y  equals  pn (x)v .  So  y  equals  f (n) (x).  By  the  product  rule,

Since  pn (x)  is  a  degree  n  polynomial,  pn

this  gives,

So  the  result  for  n + 1  follows  from  the  result  for n.  Therefore  the  result  is  proved  by  induction  on 
n.  Moreover,  this  gives  the  inductive  formula  for  pn (x),

at  (1, 2).

By  the  ﬁrst  paragraph,  d/dx(2x3  − 9xy + 2y 3 )  equals  0.  Substituting  in  gives  the  equation,

(a)(10  points)  Assuming  that  both  s(t)  and  s� (t)  are  continuous  at  t = 5,  determine  A  and  B . 
Solution  to  (a)  Because  s(t)  is  continuous  at  t =  5,  the  left­hand  limit  and  the  right­hand  limit

which  simpliﬁes  to, 

Therefore,  the  solution  is,

(b)(15  points)  The  barrier  is  located  at  s =  33  meters.  Determine  the  velocity  of  the  car  when  it 
strikes  the  barrier.  (The  quadratic  polynomial  has  whole  number  roots.) 

Solution  to  (b)  For  t > 5,  the  equation  for  displacement  is, 
s(t) = −2t2  + 30t − 75. 

The moment  T  when  the  car  strikes  the  barrier  is  the  solution  of  the  equation  s(T ) = 33, 
−2T 2  + 30T  − 75 = 33. 

Subtracting  33  from  each  side  gives  the  equation, 
−2T 2  + 30T  − 108 = 0. 
Dividing  each  side  by −2  gives  the  equation, 
T 2  − 15T  + 54 = 0.

The  fraction  54  factors  as  2 × 27,  3 × 18  and  6 × 9.  In  the  last  case,  the  sum  of  the  factors  is +15. 
Thus  the  quadratic  polynomial  factors  as, 
T 2  − 15T  + 54 = (T  − 6)(T  − 9). 
The  two  possible  solutions  of  (T  − 6)(T  − 9) = 0  are  T  = 6  and  T  = 9.  Since  the  car  cannot  crash 
twice,  the  car  crashes  at  the moment, 

T  = 6. 
For  t > 5,  the  equation  of  v(t) = s� (t)  was  calculated  above  to  be, 
s� (t) = −4t + A = −4t + 30. 

Plugging  in  t = T  = 6  gives, 

s� (6) = −4(6) + 30. 
Therefore,  at  the moment  the  car  crashes  into  the  barrier,  the  velocity  is, 

6 meters/second.
