Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next 
to  the  problem  –  use  your  time  wisely.  Please  show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial 
credit  will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.
