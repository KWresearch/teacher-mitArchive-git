Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  3  hours  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next  to  the 
problem  –  use  your  time  wisely.  Please  show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial  credit 
will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  3(25  points)  An  aerosol  can  is  designed  as  in  the  ﬁgure.  The  sides  of  the  can  form  a 
cylinder  of  base  radius  r  and  height  h.  The  top  of  the  can  is  a  hemisphere  of  radius  r  pointing  up, 
and  the  bottom  of  the  can  is  also  a  hemisphere  of  radius  r  pointing  up.  The  volume  of  a  cylinder 
of base  radius r  and height h  is πr 2h,  and  the area of  the  sides of  the cylinder  is 2πrh .  The volume 
of  a  sphere  of  radius  r  is  (4/3)πr 3 ,  and  the  surface  area  is  4πr 2 .  What  ratio  of  height  h  to  radius 
r  maximizes  the  volume  of  the  can  for  a  ﬁxed  surface  area?  Show  all  work.

Problem  5(25  points)  The  hourglass  shown  is  obtained  by  revolving  about  the  y -axis  the  region 
in  the  ﬁrst  and  fourth  quadrants  of  the  xy -plane  bounded  by  the  y -axis,  the  line  y  = +3,  the  line 
y = −3  and  the  hyperbolic  segment, 
5x 2  − 2y 2  = 2. 
This region is contained in the rectangle with vertices (0, +3), (2, +3), (2, −3) and (0, −3).  Therefore 
the hourglass  is  contained  in  a  cylinder  of base  radius  2  and height  6.  What  fraction  of  the volume 
of  the  cylinder  is  occupied  by  the  hourglass?  Show  all  work.
