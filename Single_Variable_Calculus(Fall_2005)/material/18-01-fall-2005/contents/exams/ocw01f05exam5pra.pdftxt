More  Exam  5  Practice  Problems


Here  are  some  further  practice  problems  with  solutions  for  Exam  5.  Many  of  these  problems  are 
more  diﬃcult  than  problems  on  the  exam. 
I.  Areas  of  regions  bounded  by  polar  curves.  In  each  of  the  following,  ﬁnd  the  area  of  the 
region  bounded  by  the  polar  curves. 
I.1  The  region  bounded  by  r = aebθ  for  0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. 
I.2  The  region  bounded  by  r2  = 2a2 cos(2θ)  for −π/4 ≤ θ ≤ π/4. 
I.3  The  region  bounded  by  r = cos(θ)/(p sin2 (θ))  for  π/4 ≤ θ ≤ π/3. 
II.  Inverse  substitution.  For  each  of  the  following,  use  inverse  substitution  to  evaluate  the 
antiderivative.

Hint.  Because  cot2 (θ)  equals  csc2 (θ) − 1,  the  antiderivative  of  cot2 (θ)  equals − cot(θ) − θ + C . 
III.  Partial  fractions.  Use  polynomial  division,  factoring  and  partial  fractions  to  compute  the 
� 
following  integrals.
