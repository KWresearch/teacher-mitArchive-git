Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next 
to  the  problem  –  use  your  time  wisely.  Please  show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial 
credit  will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1(15  points)  Use  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative  as  a  limit  of  diﬀerence  quotients  to 
1
compute  the  derivative  of  y = x +  x  for  all  points  x > 0.  Show  all  work.

Problem  2: 

/10 

Problem  2(10  points)  For  the  function  f (x) = e−x2 /2 ,  compute  the  ﬁrst,  second  and  third  deriva­
tives  of  f (x). 

Extra  credit(5  points)  Only  attempt  this  after  you  have  completed  the  rest  of  the  exam  and 
checked  your  answers.  For  every  positive  integer  n,  show  that  the  nth  derivative  of  f (x)  is  of  the 
form f (n) (x) = pn (x)f (x), where pn (x)  is a polynomial.  Also, give a rule to compute pn+1 (x), given 
pn (x).

Problem  3(15  points)  A  function  y = f (x)  satisﬁes  the  implicit  equation, 
2x 3  − 9xy + 2y 3  = 0. 

The graph  contains  the point  (1, 2).  Find  the  equation of  the  tangent  line  to  the graph of y = f (x) 
at  (1, 2).

Problem  4: 

/20 

Problem  4(20  points)  The  point  (0, 4)  is  not  on  the  graph  of  y  = x + 1/x,  but  it  is  contained  in

exactly  one  tangent  line  to  the  graph.


(a)(15  points)  Find  the  one  value  of  a  for  which  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  y  =  x + 1/x  at 

(a, a + 1/a)  contains  (0, 4). 

Hint:  You  do  not  need  to  solve  a  quadratic  equation  to  ﬁnd  a.


(b)(5  points) Write  the  equation  of  the  corresponding  tangent  line.

Problem  5: 

/25 

Problem  5(25  points)  In  an  automobile  crash­test,  a  car  is  accelerated  from  rest  at  2  m/s2  for  5

� 
seconds  and  then  decelerated  at −4m/s2  until  it  strikes  a  barrier.  The  position  function  is,

0 ≤ t < 5

t2 
s(t) =  −2t2  + At + B
t ≥ 5

(a)(10  points)  Assuming  that  both  s(t)  and  s� (t)  are  continuous  at  t = 5,  determine  A  and  B . 

(b)(15  points)  The  barrier  is  located  at  s =  33  meters.  Determine  the  velocity  of  the  car  when  it 
strikes  the  barrier.  (The  quadratic  polynomial  has  whole  number  roots.)
