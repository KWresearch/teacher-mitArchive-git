More  18.01  Final  Practice  Problems


Here  are  some  further  practice  problems  with  solutions  for  the  18.01  Final  Exam.  Many  of  these 
problems  are more  diﬃcult  than  problems  on  the  exam. 

Goal  1.  Diﬀerentiation. 
1.1  Find  the  equation  of  every  tangent  line  to  the  curve  y = e containing  the  point  (−1, 0).  This 
x
is  not  a  point  on  the  curve. 

1.2  Let  a  and  b  be  positive  real  numbers.  Find  the  equation  of  every  tangent  line  to  the  ellipse 
with  implicit  equation,

containing  the  point  (2a, 2b).  This  is  not  a  point  on  the  ellipse.

1.3  Let  a  be  a  real  number  diﬀerent  from  0.  Use  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative  as  a  limit  of 
diﬀerence  quotients  to  ﬁnd  the  derivative  to  the  following  function, 

f (x) = 

1 
, 
x 

at  the  point  x = a. 

1.4  Use  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative  as  a  limit  of  diﬀerence  quotients  to  ﬁnd  the  derivative  of 
the  following  function, 

f (x) = tan(x), 

at  the  point  x =  0.  You  may  use  without  proof  that  the  following  limits  exist  and  have  the  given 
values,

Goal  3.  Applications  of  diﬀerentiation. 

3.1  A  sculpture  has  the  form  of  a  right  triangle.  The  material  used  for  the  vertical  leg  has  twice 
the  cost  of  the  material  used  for  the  horizontal  leg.  The  length  of  the  hypotenuse  is  ﬁxed  (thus 
its  cost  is  irrelevant).  What  ratio  of  vertical  leg  to  horizontal  leg  minimizes  the  total  cost  of  the 
material? 

3.2  A  farmer has a  fence running diagonally across her property at a 45 degree angle  to the north­
south  and  east­west  lines.  She  decides  to  build  a  corral  by  adding  a  length  b − a  of  fence  running 
north­south,  a  length  b − a  of  fence  running  east­west,  and  then  connect  the  two  corners  with  2 
length  b  of  fence  running  north­south  and  east­west.  Thus,  the  total  new  length  of  fence  needed  is 
4b − 2a,  and  the  corral  has  the  form  of  a  square  of  length  b,  with  a  small  isosceles  triangle  of  leg 
length  a  removed  from  one  corner  (where  the  square  corral meets  the  pre­existing  diagonal  fence). 
What  ratio  of  a  to  b  gives maximal  area  of  the  corral  for  a  ﬁxed  length  of  new  fence? 

3.3  An  icicle  has  the  shape  of  a  right  circular  cone  whose  ratio  of  length  to  base  radius  is  10. 
Assuming  the  icicle  melts  at  a  rate  of  1  cubic  centimeter  per  hour,  how  fast  is  the  length  of  the 
icicle  decreasing  when  it  is  10  centimeters  long? 

3.4  A  cube  of  ice  rests  on  the  ground.  The  cube  of  ice melts  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  surface 
area  of  the  cube  exposed  to  the  air  (thus,  the  area  of  the  5  sides  other  than  the  side  sitting  on  the 
ground).  Assuming  it  takes  5  hours  before  the  volume  of  the  melted  cube  equals  1/2  the  initial 
volume,  how much  longer  does  it  take  for  the  cube  to melt  entirely?

Solutions. 
Solution  to  1.1  Denote  by  (a, ea )  a  point  on  the  curve.  The  tangent  line  to  the  curve  has  slope, 

dy 
(a) = e a . 
dx 
Therefore  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
y = e  (x − a) + e a . 
a
The  tangent  line  contains  (−1, 0)  if  and  only  if, 
0 = e a ((−1) − a) + e . 
a

Simplifying  gives, 

0 = −ae a . 
Since  ea  is  always  nonzero,  the  equation  holds  if  and  only  if  a  equals  0.  Therefore,  the  equation  of 
the  unique  tangent  line  to  the  curve  containing  (−1, 0)  is, 

y = x + 1. 

Solution  to  1.2  Implicit  diﬀerentiation  with  respect  to  x  gives,

So  for  a  point  (x0 , y0 )  on  the  ellipse,  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  ellipse  is,

Plugging  in  (x, y) = (2a, 2b),  the  tangent  line  contains  (2a, 2b)  if  and  only  if, 

2ab2 x0  + 2a  by0  = a 2 b2 . 
2

Solving  for  y0  gives, 

2ay0  = −2bx0  + ab. 
Because  (x0 , y0 )  is  contained  in  the  ellipse,  the  pair  satisﬁes  the  equation, 

2 
b2 x0  + a y0  = a 2 b2 , 
2 2

which  is  equivalent  to, 

4b2 x0  + (2ay0 )2  − a 2 b2  = 0. 
2
Substituting  the  equation  for  2ay0  gives  the  quadratic  equation  in  x0 , 
8b2 x0  − 4ab2 x0  − 3a 2 b2  = 0.

At  the  endpoint  x = s,  y  equals  0  and  the  cost  is,

Choose  b  as  the  independent  variable.  From  the  constraint  equation,

Thus  the  only  critical  point  is  at  b = L/2,  which  is  also  an  endpoint.  This  gives  a  local  maximum

To compute  this,  it  is best  to make an  inverse hyperbolic  substitution.  Since  the goal  is  that x2 + 1 
is  a  square,  it  is  best  to  use  x = sinh(t),  so  that  x2  + 1 = cosh2 (t).  The  substitution  is, 
x = sinh(t),  dx = cosh(t)dt.
