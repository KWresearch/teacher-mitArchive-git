Problem  2  Find  the  following  antiderivative  using  integration  by  parts. 
x sin−1 (x)dx. 
� 
Solution  First  substitute  x = sin(θ),  dx = cos(θ)dθ.  Then  the  integral  becomes, 
θ sin(θ) cos(θ)dθ . 
� 
Of  course  sin(θ) cos(θ) =  1

Set  u =  1 θ ,  dv = sin(2θ)dθ.  Then  du =  dθ  and  v = − 2  cos(2θ).  So  udv = uv −  vdu,  i.e.,

(Hint:  Compare  with  another  function.) 
Solution  Because  the  integrand  is  nonnegative,  the  integral  converges  if  and  only  if  it  is  bounded. 
Therefore the comparison test applies.  For x > 1, x2  > x.  Therefore −x2  < −x and 0 ≤ e−x2

Problem  5  You  wish  to  design  a  trash  can  that  consists  of  a  base  that  is  a  disk  of  radius  r , 
cylindrical  walls  of  height  h  and  radius  r ,  and  the  top  consists  of  a  hemispherical  dome  of  radius  r 
(there  is  no  disk  between  the  top  of  the  walls  and  the  bottom  of  the  dome;  the  dome  rests  on  the 
top  of  the  walls).  The  surface  area  of  the  can  is  a  ﬁxed  constant  A.  What  ratio  of  h  to  r  will  give 
the  maximum  volume  for  the  can?  You  may  use  the  fact  that  the  surface  area  of  a  hemisphere  of 
radius  r  is  2πr2 ,  and  the  volume  of  a  hemisphere  is  2 πr3 .
3 
Solution The area of the base  is πr2 .  The area of  the  sides are 2πrh.  The area of  the dome  is 2πr2 . 
Therefore  we  have  the  equation, 
A = πr 2  + 2πrh + 2πr 2  = πr(3r + 2h). 
It  follows  that h =  2πr  −  2  .  The  volume  of  the  cylindrical portion  of  the  can  is  the  area  of  the base 
A 
3r

times  the  height,  i.e.,  πr2h.  The  area  of  the  dome  of  the  can  is  2 πr3 .  Therefore  the  total  volume  of

the  can  is, 
2πr  −  2  +  2 πr3  =

i.e.,  A = 5πr2 .  Since  A = 3πr2  + 2πrh,  we  conclude  that  2πrh = A − 3πr2  = 2πr2 .  Cancelling,  we 
have  that  h =  r .  This  is  contained  in  the  interval  for  r ,  moreover  geometric  reasoning  (or  the  ﬁrst 
derivative  test)  shows  this  is  a  maximum  for  V .  Therefore  the  maximum  volume  is  obtained  when 
h = r . 
Problem  6  A  point  on  the  unit  circle  in  the  xy ­plane  moves  counterclockwise  at  a  ﬁxed  rate  of 
1 radian .  At  the  moment  when  the  angle  of  the  point  is  θ  =  4 ,  what  is  the  rate  of  change  of  the

absolute  value  of  the  x­coordinate.  Since  the  point  is  in  the  1st  quadrant,  this  is  just  x  =  cos(θ).

2 2  = r4 .
Solution The curve  intersects the y ­axis when r2y2  = r4 ,  i.e.  y = r .  The curve  intersects the x­axis 
�

when x4  = r4 ,  i.e.  x = r .  So  the  endpoints  of  the  curve  are  (0, r)  and  (r, 0).  Using  the disk method,

Problem  10 Compute the area of the  lune  that  is the region  in the 1st  and 3rd  quadrants contained 
inside  the  circle  with  polar  equation  r = 2a cos(θ)  and  outside  the  circle  with  polar  equation  r = a. 
Solution Setting 2a cos(θ) equal to a, the points of intersection occur when 2 cos(θ) = 1, i.e.  θ = −

and  θ = + π .  So  the  lune  is  the  region  between  the  two  graphs  for  − ≤ θ ≤  3 .  The  outer  curve  is
