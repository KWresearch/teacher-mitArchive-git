Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next  to 
the problem – use your time wisely.  Please show all work, unless instructed otherwise.  Partial credit 
will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1: 
/20 
Problem  1(20 points) Compute the partial fraction decomposition of f (z ) =  (z2−1)2 .  Show all your 
1
work. 
Hint:  Use Heaviside’s method  to  determine  2  of  the  4  undetermined  coeﬃcients.  Is  f (z )  an  even 
function  or  an  odd  function?  What  does  this  tell  you  about  the  2  remaining  coeﬃcients?  Combine 
this with  a  substitution  to  determine  the  2  remaining  coeﬃcients  (or  use  any  other method  you  like 
to  determine  the  2  coeﬃcients).

Problem  3: 
Name: 
Problem  3(25 points) This problem  computes  a  recursive  relation  for  the  antiderivative  of  secn (θ). 
(a)(10  points):  Compute  the  derivative  of  secn−2 (θ) tan(θ).  Eliminate  tan(θ)  from  your  answer 
using  a  trigonometry  identity  in  order  to  express  the  derivative  in  terms  of  sec(θ)  alone.  Show  all 
your  work.

� 
� 
(b)(10  points):  Write  your  answer  from  (a)  in  the  form  of  an  integral  identity,  and  then  solve  for 
secn (θ)dθ  to  ﬁnd  a  recursive  formula  of  the  form 
secn (θ)dθ = F (sec(θ), tan(θ)) + A 

secn−2 (θ)dθ . 

Show  all  your  work. 

(c)(5 points):  Use  your  recursive  formula  to  compute  the  antiderivative  of  sec4 (θ).  Show  all your 
work.
