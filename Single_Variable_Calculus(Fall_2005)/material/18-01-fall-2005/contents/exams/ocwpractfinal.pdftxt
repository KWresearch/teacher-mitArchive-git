Problem  5  You  wish  to  design  a  trash  can  that  consists  of  a  base  that  is  a  disk  of  radius  r , 
cylindrical  walls  of  height  h  and  radius  r ,  and  the  top  consists  of  a  hemispherical  dome  of  radius  r 
(there  is  no  disk  between  the  top  of  the  walls  and  the  bottom  of  the  dome;  the  dome  rests  on  the 
top  of  the  walls).  The  surface  area  of  the  can  is  a  ﬁxed  constant  A.  What  ratio  of  h  to  r  will  give 
the  maximum  volume  for  the  can?  You  may  use  the  fact  that  the  surface  area  of  a  hemisphere  of 
radius  r  is  2πr2 ,  and  the  volume  of  a  hemisphere  is  2 πr3 .

Problem  6  A  point  on  the  unit  circle  in  the  xy ­plane  moves  counterclockwise  at  a  ﬁxed  rate  of 
1 radian .  At  the  moment  when  the  angle  of  the  point  is  θ  =  4 ,  what  is  the  rate  of  change  of  the
