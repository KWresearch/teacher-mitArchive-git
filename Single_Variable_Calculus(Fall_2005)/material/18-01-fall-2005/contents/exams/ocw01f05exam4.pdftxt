Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next 
to  the  problem  –  use  your  time  wisely.  Please  show  all  work,  unless  instructed  otherwise.  Partial 
credit  will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1(25  points) A  solid  is  formed  by  revolving  about  the  x­axis  the  region  bounded  by  the 
�  � 
x­axis,  the  line  x = 0,  the  line  x = a,  and  the  curve, 
πx 
y = b sin 
. 
a 

Find  the  volume  of  the  solid.


� 
You may  use  the  half­angle  formulas, 


cos2 (θ/2)  =  (1 + cos(θ))/2, 
sin2 (θ/2) =  (1 − cos(θ))/2

Problem  2(25  points)  A  solid  is  formed  by  revolving  about  the  y ­axis  the  region  bounded  by  the 
x­axis,  the  line  x = 0,  the  line  x = a,  and  the  curve, 

ab 
y =  − b. 
x 

Find  the  volume  of  the  solid.


It  is  simplest  to  use  the  shell method.  But  you may  use  the  disk method  if  you  prefer.

Problem  3(25  points)  A  surface  is  formed  by  revolving  about  the  x­axis  the  curve, 
y = x ,  0 ≤ x ≤ 1. 
3 

Since  the curve  is  revolved about the x­axis,  the radius of each  slice  is y .  Compute  the  surface area 
of  the  surface.

Problem  4(25  points)  Sketch  the  polar  curve, 
r(θ) = sin(θ) sin(θ + (π/2)),  0 ≤ θ ≤ π . 

Take  note:  the  angle  θ  varies  over  only  1/2  of  a  complete  revolution. 

In  particular,  label  the  following  on  your  graph, 

(i)  in  which  quadrant  or  quadrants  the  curve  is  contained, 

(ii)  the  endpoints  of  the  curve, 

(iii)  the  two  slopes  of  the  tangent  lines  at  the  endpoints  of  the  curve, 

(iv)  and  the  angle  or  angles  θ  at  which  r(θ)  is  a maximum.
