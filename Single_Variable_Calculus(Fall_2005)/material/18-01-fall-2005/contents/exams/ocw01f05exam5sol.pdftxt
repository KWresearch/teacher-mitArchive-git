You  will  not  need  to  use  partial  fractions  (though  you  are  free  to  do  so). 

Solution  to  Problem  2  By  the  polynomial  division  algorithm, 
3
x  − 1 = (x + 3)(x 2  − 3x + 2) + (7x − 7). 

Thus  the  fraction  is,

The  denominator  of  the  new  fraction  factors  as, 
2 x  − 3x + 2 = (x − 1)(x − 2).

Problem  3(20  points) 

(a)(15  points)  Find  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  of, 

x + 3 
. 
x2  − 2x + 1 
Solution  to  (a)  Using  the  quadratic  formula,  x2  − 2x + 1  has  only  the  root  1.  Thus  it  is, 
2 x  − 2x + 1 = (x − 1)2 . 

So  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  has  the  form,

Problem  4(25  points)  Let  a  be  a  positive  real  number. 

(a)(3  points)  Determine  the  range  of  x  on  which  2ax − x2  is  nonnegative.

Solution  to  (a)  Completing  the  square  gives,

−x 2  + 2ax = −(x − a)2  + a . 
2

Therefore  the  expression  is  nonnegative  when, 
−(x − a)2  + a  ≥ 0 ⇔ a  ≥ (x − a)2 .

Taking  square  roots,  the  expression  is  nonnegative  when, 
a ≥ x − a ≥ −a. 

This  simpliﬁes  to, 

0 ≤ x ≤ 2a.

This  integral  can  be  computed  using  an  inverse  trigonometric  substitution,

cos  (θ)dθ. 

This can be  solved either using  integration by parts or using  the half­angle  formula  from  trigonom­
etry.  The  half­angle  formula  is  decidedly  faster  and  gives,
