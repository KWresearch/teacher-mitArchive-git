You may  use  the  half­angle  formulas, 


cos2 (θ/2)  =  (1 + cos(θ))/2, 
sin2 (θ/2) =  (1 − cos(θ))/2

where  A(x)  is  the  area  of  a  cross­section  disk  through  x, 

A(x) = πy(x)2  = πb2  sin2 (πx/a). 

Substituting  this  in  gives, 

To  integrate,  use  the  half­angle  formulas  to  rewrite,

Problem  3(25  points)  A  surface  is  formed  by  revolving  about  the  x­axis  the  curve, 
y = x ,  0 ≤ x ≤ 1.

Since  the curve  is  revolved about the x­axis,  the radius of each  slice  is y .  Compute  the  surface area 
of  the  surface.

Solution  to  Problem  3  The  area  of  the  surface  of  revolution  is, 
dA = 2πrds.

Since  the  curve  is  revolved  about  the  x­axis,  the  radius  of  each  slice  is  y ,  r = y .  Thus  the  area  is,

The  diﬀerential  element  of  arc  length  satisﬁes  the  “formal  Pythagorean  theorem”,

Since  the  independent  variable  is  x,  express  dy  as,


dy =

dx = 3x 2dx.

Substituting  in  gives, 

Taking  square  roots  gives,

Problem  4(25  points)  Sketch  the  polar  curve, 
r(θ) = sin(θ) sin(θ + (π/2)),  0 ≤ θ ≤ π . 

Take  note:  the  angle  θ  varies  over  only  1/2  of  a  complete  revolution. 

In  particular,  label  the  following  on  your  graph, 

(i)  in  which  quadrant  or  quadrants  the  curve  is  contained, 

(ii)  the  endpoints  of  the  curve, 

(iii)  the  two  slopes  of  the  tangent  lines  at  the  endpoints  of  the  curve, 

(iv)  and  the  angle  or  angles  θ  at  which  r(θ)  is  a maximum.

Solution  to  Problem  4  An  image  ﬁle  of  the  polar  curve  is  on  the  course  webpage.  The  curve  is 
contained  in  the  ﬁrst  and  fourth  quadrants  (where  x ≥ 0,  but  y  can  be  positive  or  negative).  The 
endpoints  of  the  curve  are  both  the  point  (0, 0).  The  slopes  of  the  tangent  lines  are  both  0;  the 
tangent  lines  are  both  just  the  x­axis.  The  angles  at  which  r(θ)  is maximum  are  the  points  where 
r � (θ)  is  0, 
r � (θ) = cos(θ) sin(θ + (π/2)) + sin(θ) cos(θ + (π/2)) = 0. 

Solving  gives, 

cos(θ) sin(θ + (π/2)) 
sin(θ) cos(θ + (π/2)) 
Graphing  sine  and  cosine,  or  thinking  about  the  unit  circle  leads  to, 
sin(θ + (π/2)) = cos(θ),  cos(θ + (π/2)) = − sin(θ). 

= −1. 

Thus  the  equation  is, 

cos2 (θ) 
= −1 ⇔ 
2
tan  (θ) = +1. 
− sin2 (θ)
In  other  words,  tan(θ)  equals +1  or −1.  Thus  θ  is  45  degrees  or  135  degrees,  i.e., 

θ = 

π/4,  or  3π/
