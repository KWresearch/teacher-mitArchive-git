Instructions:  Please  write  your  name  at  the  top  of  every  page  of  the  exam.  The  exam  is  closed 
book,  calculators  are  not  allowed,  but  you  are  allowed  to  use  your  prepared  index  card.  You  will 
have  approximately  50  minutes  for  this  exam.  The  point  value  of  each  problem  is  written  next  to 
the problem – use your time wisely.  Please show all work, unless instructed otherwise.  Partial credit 
will  be  given  only  for  work  shown. 
You may use either pencil or ink.  If you have a question, need extra paper, need to use the restroom, 
etc.,  raise  your  hand.

Problem  1: 
Name: 
Problem  1(30  points)  Evaluate  each  deﬁnite  and  indeﬁnite  integral.  Use  whatever  method  you 
like,  but  show  all  work.  If  you  use  a  basic  integral  formula,  write  the  formula  on  your  paper.

(a)(15  points):  Using  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  (not  a  table  of  antiderivatives), 
compute  F � (x).  Simplify  your  answer  as  much  as  possible  and  show  all  work. 

(b)(5  points):  Using  (a),  give  a  formula  for  F (x). 

(c)(5  points):  Use  the  formula  for F (x)  to  ﬁnd  an  antiderivative  of  1+x2  (do  not  simply  copy  the 
1
antiderivative  from  your  index  card  –  explain  why  the  antiderivative  follows  from  (b)).
