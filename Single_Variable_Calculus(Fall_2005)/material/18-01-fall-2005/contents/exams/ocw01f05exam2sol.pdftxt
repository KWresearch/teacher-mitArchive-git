(a)(10  points) 

Solution  to  (a) The simplest solution uses the double­angle formula for tan(θ).  Because sin(2θ) = 
2 sin(θ) cos(θ)  and  cos(2θ) = cos(θ)2  − sin(θ)2 ,  tan(2θ)  equals, 

tan(2θ) = 

sin(2θ) 
cos(2θ) 

= 

2 sin(θ) cos(θ)
cos(θ)2  − sin(θ)2 

. 

Factoring  cos(θ)2  from  both  numerator  and  denominator  yields, 

This  gives, 

2 sin(θ)/ cos(θ) 
tan(2θ) =

The  more  straightforward  proof  uses  the  chain  rule  and  the  quotient  rule.  Set  v  =  tan(θ).  Set 
w = 2v/(1 − v 2 ).  By  the  chain  rule,

Solution  to  (b)  By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  sin(2t)2  + cos(2t)2  equals  1.  This  gives, 
1 − sin(2t)2  = cos(2t). 
There  is  an  issue  about  whether  this  is  + cos(2t)  or  − cos(2t).  The  condition  that  t  is  between 
−π/4  and  π/4  insures  it  is  + cos(2t).  Let  u  equal  2t  and  let  v  equal  cos(u).  By  the  chain  rule,

(a)(3  points) Write  the  equation  of  each  vertical  asymptote.  If  none  exist,  write  “none  exist”. 
√
Solution  to  (a)  For  every  vertical  asymptote  x = a,  the  denominator  of  some  term  in  the  expres­
sion  approaches  0  as  x  approaches  a.  The  only  denominator  in  the  expression  is 
x, which  is  zero 
only  when  x = 0.  Thus  there  is  a  unique  vertical  asymptote: 

the  line  = 0.

(b)(3  points) Write  the  equation  of  each  horizontal  asymptote.  If  none  exist,  write  “none  exist”.

Solution  to  (b)  As  x  approaches +∞,  f (x)  grows  like 

x.  Thus, 

there  is  no  horizontal  asymptote. 

(c)(7  points) On  the  number  line,  identify  where  f � (x)  is  positive,  negative  or  zero. 
Solution  to  (c)  The  expression  f (x)  equals, 
f (x) = x−1/2 (x + 1).

This  is  positive,  negative  or  zero  as  x − 1  is  positive,  negative  or  zero.  Thus, 

f (x

(d)(3  points) Write  the  coordinates  of  each  local maximum.  If  none  exist,  write  “none  exist”. 

Solution  to  (d)  By  part  (c),  f (x)  is  decreasing  for  0  < x <  1  and  is  increasing  for  x >  1. 
Therefore, 

there  is  no  local maximum. 

(e)(3  points) Write  the  coordinates  of  each  local minimum.  If  none  exist,  write  “none  exist”. 

Solution  to  (d)  By  the  same  argument  as  in  (d),

Problem  3(30  points)  A  box  is  made  from  two  identical  square  sheets  of  metal  with  edge  length 

E .  A  small  square  of  edge  length  x  is  removed  and  the  two  ﬂaps  are  folded  up.  Find  the  value  of 
x  that maximizes  the  volume  of  the  box. 
Solution  to  Problem  3  The  length  and  width  of  the  base  of  the  box  are  each  l  =  E − x  and 
w = E − x.  The  height  of  the  box  is  h = x.  The  volume  of  the  box  is, 
V  = lwh = (E − x)2 x. 

Therefore,

The  critical  points  are  x = E /3  and  x = E .  The  endpoints  are  x = 0  and  x = E .  Since  V (0) = 0
