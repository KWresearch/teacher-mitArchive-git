1.  Parametric  equations.  To this point  in the course, plane curves were speciﬁed  in 1 of 2
The  explicit  form,  or  graph  form  of  a  curve  in  Cartesian  coordinates  is  the  common  form, 
y = f (x), a ≤ x ≤ b. 
The  implicit  form  of  a  curve  in  Cartesian  coordinates  is  as  the  set  of  all  solutions  of  an  equatio

 ways. 

Often a subset of this curve is speciﬁed by imposing extra conditions, e.g., the upper unit semicir
is  the  set  of  solutions  of  x2  + y 2  = 1  satisfying  the  extra  condition  y > 0.

There  is  a  third  important  way  to  specify  a  curve:  using  parametric  equations.  Given  a  parameter 
�

t  varying  in  an  interval  a ≤ t ≤ b  and  given  functions  f (t)  and  g(t)  on  this  interval,  the  associated 
parametric  curve, 

x  =  f (t), 
y  =  g(t) 

is  simply  the  set of all pairs  (x, y) = (f (t), g(t)) as  t varies over  the  interval a ≤ t ≤ b.  We  consider 
only  the  case  where  f (t)  and  g(t)  are  piecewise  diﬀerentiable  functions  (more  advanced  courses 
discuss  some  pitfalls  if  f (t)  and  g(t)  are merely  continuous  functions). 
Examples.  A.  One  speciﬁcation  of  the  points  on  the  circle  of  radius  r  centered  at  (0, 0)  is  using 
�

the  angle  θ .  This  gives  rise  to  a  parametric  equation  with  parameter  θ , 
0 ≤ θ < 2π . 

x  =  r cos(θ), 
y  =  r sin(θ)

B.  An  ellipse  centered  at  (0, 0)  whose  axes  equal  the  coordinate  axes  has  a  parametric  equation, 
0 ≤ θ < 2π . 

x  =  a cos(θ), 
y  =  b sin(θ)

C.  A  pro jectile  is  launched  from  an  initial  position  of  (x0 , y0 )  with  an  initial  velocity  vector  of 
magnitude  v0  at  an  angle  α  to  the  horizontal,  and  under  the  inﬂuence  of  constant  graviational 
� 
acceleration −g .  According  to Newton’s  laws of mechanics,  the position of  the pro jectile after  time 
t  is, 

x  = 
v0 cos(α)t + x0 , 
y  =  −(g/2)t2  + v0  sin(α)t + y0 
This  is  a  parametric  equation  where  time  t  is  the  parameter.  Even  when  some  other  quantity  is 
the  parameter,  it  is  often  useful  to  think  of  the  parameter  as  time.  Thus  the  curve  is  the  trail  left 
by  a  point,  or  perhaps  better,  the  tip  of  a  pen,  as  it moves  in  the  plane. 
2.  Implicitization.  Under  reasonable  hypotheses,  it  is  possible  to  turn  a  portion  of  an  implicit 
curve  into an explicit curve.  Similarly,  it should be possible to turn a portion of a parametric curve 
into  an  explicit  curve.  It  is  often  simpler  to  ﬁnd  an  implicit  equation  satisﬁed  by  a  parametric 
curve.  The  process  of  ﬁnding  an  implicit  equation  is  called  implicitization. 
Examples.  A.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  A  above,  by  the  Pythagorean  Theorem, 

0 ≤ t. 

x(θ)2  + y(θ)2  = r  cos  (θ) + r 2  sin2 (θ) = r  (cos2 (θ) + sin2 (θ)) = r . 
2 
2

2

Thus  the  parametric  equation  satisﬁes  the  implicit  equation, 

x2  + y 2  = r2 . 

B.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  B, 

(x(θ)/a)2  + (y(θ)/b)2  = cos  (θ) + sin2 (θ) = 1. 
2

Thus  the  parametric  equation  satisﬁes  the  implicit  equation, 

x2/a2  + y 2/b2  = 1. 

C.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  C,  assuming  v0 cos(α)  is  nonzero,  the  equation  for  x  can 
be  solved  for  t, 
x − x0 
x = v0 cos(α)t + x0  ⇔ t = 
. 
v0 cos(α) 
This  can  then  be  substituted  into  the  equation  for  y  to  get  an  explicit  equation  for  the  curve, 
y = −g(x − x0 )2/(2v 2 
α)(x − x0
0  cos2 (α

)) + tan(

) + 
y0 .

In  going  from  a  parametric  equation  to  an  implicit  equation,  there  are  2  important  warnings  to 
keep  in mind:

•	 A  parametric  equation  may  traverse  only  part  of  the  implicit  curve.  The  most  usual  reason 
is  that  the  parameter  t  is  restricted  to  a  certain  range.  A  closely  related  reason  is  that  the 
� 
functions  of  t  are  themselves  somehow  limited,  as  in  the  parametric  curve  lying  in  the  line 
y = x, 

x  =  cos(t), 
y  =  cos(t) 

A more  interesting reason  is that the  implicit curve may have more than one connected piece, 
� 
as  in  the  parametric  curve, 

2t/(1 − t2 ), 

x  =
y  =  (1 + t2 )/(1 − t2 ) 
As  t  varies,  this  parametric  curve  sweeps  out  the  top  branch  of  the  hyperbola  y 2  − x2  = 1. 
•	 A  parametric  equation  may  sweep  out  all  or  a  portion  of  the  implicit  curve  multiple  times. 
This  is  clear  in Examples A  and B:  as  θ  is  allowed  to  vary  over  the  interval  0 ≤ θ < 2nπ ,  the 
parametric  curve  completes  n  revolutions  of  the  implicit  curve. 

− 1 < t < 1.


3.  Arc  length.  Given  a  segment  of  curve,  what  is  the  length  of  the  curve?  Imagining  the  curve 
made of some ﬂexible extensible material  like wire, what  is the  length when the wire  is pulled taut? 
The  answer  is  called  the  arc  length,  s. 
The method for expressing arc  length  is an  integral  is by now familiar.  Break the  interval a ≤ t ≤ b 
into  a  large  number  n  of  subintervals  with  endpoints, 
a = t0  < t1  < · · · < tn−1  < tn  = b. 
Approximate  the  curve  on  each  subinterval  tk−1  ≤ t ≤ tk  by  a  line  segment.  The  line  segment  runs 
from  the  point, 

(xk−1 , yk−1 ) = (x(tk−1 ), y(tk−1 )), 

to  the  point, 

(xk , yk ) = (x(tk ), y(tk )). 
The  rise  and  run  of  the  line  segment  are, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1  ≈ x� (tk )Δtk , 
Δyk  = yk  − yk−1  ≈ y � (tk )Δtk . 
� 
�	
By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  the  length  of  the  line  segment  is, 
(Δxk )2  + (Δyk )2  ≈ 
(x� (tk ))2  + (y � (tk ))2Δtk . 

Δsk  =

The  arc  length  of  the  curve  is  approximately  the  sum  of  the  lengths  of  the  approximating  line 
segments, 
n
(x� (tk ))2  + (y � (tk ))2Δtk . 
k=1 
This  is  a  Riemann  sum.  As  the  mesh  of  the  partition  tends  to  0,  the  Riemann  sums  tend  to  a

Taking  square  roots  gives  the  equation, 

= r,  ⇔ ds = rdθ . 
�  θ=b

Thus  the  arc  length  of  the  arc  of  the  circle  from  θ = a  to  θ = b  is, 
θ=a 

r(b − a). 

rdθ = 

ds = 

ds 
dθ 

s = 

This  is,  in  fact,  our  deﬁnition  of  the  angle:  the  angle  θ  subtended  by  an  arc  of  a  circle  equals  the 
ratio  of  the  arc  length  by  the  radius  of  the  circle.  If  this  logic  sounds  circular,  it  is  perhaps  that 
nobody  ever  told  you  before  how  to deﬁne  the  length  of  the  arc  of  a  circle!  It  is  also  an  argument 
in  favor of the more natural deﬁnition of the angle as the ratio of the area  of the sector of the circle 
by  r2/2. 

Example  2.  This  is  not  a  single  example,  but  a  class  of  examples.  A  curve  in  explicit  form, 
� 
y = f (x),  a ≤ x ≤ b,  can  always  be  put  in  parametric  form, 

x  = 
t, 
y  =  f (t) 

a ≤ t ≤ b.

Since  the  parameter  t  in  the  Riemann  integral  is  only  a  dummy  variable  anyway,  it  is  allowed  to 
replace  it  by  the  variable  x  (so  long  as  x  plays  no  other  role  in  the  integral,  which  it  does  not).
