1.  Product  rule  example.  For  u  = 
(3x + 1)�  = 3.  By  the  product  rule,  (u · u)�  = u� 
· u + u · 
u�  = 2uu� .  Thus  solving, 
u� (x) = 3/(2u) = 

−1/2/2  .

2.  The  derivative  of  un .  From  above,  (u2 )�  equals  2uu� .  By  a  similar  computation,  (u3 )�  equals 
3u2u� .  This  suggests  a  pattern,

This  can  be  proved  by  induction  on  n.  For  n  = 1, 2  and  3,  it  was  checked.  Let  n  be  a  particular 
integer  (for  instance,  70119209472933054321).  For  that  integer,  suppose  the  result  is  known, 

d(un ) 
dx 

n−1 du 
= nu 
. 
dx 

The  goal  is  to  prove  the  result  for  n + 1,  that  is, 

Let  v = un .  Then  un+1  equals  uv .  So,  by  the  product  rule,

Plugging  in  v = un ,  this  is,

By  the  induction  hypothesis,  d(un )/dx  equals  nun−1 (du/dx).  Plugging  in, 

d(un+1 )

=

Thus,  the  result  for  n + 1  follows  from  the  result  for  n.  By  induction,  the  result  holds  for  every  n. 
3.  The  derivative  of  xa ,  a  a  fraction.  Let  a  be  a  fraction  m/n  and  let  u(x)  be  x .  Then  u

equals  xm .  Thus,

which  equals mxm−1 .  By  the  above,  d(un )/dx  equals  nun−1 (du/dx).  Thus,

Solving  for  du/dx,

One  of  the  basic  rules  of  exponents  is  that  (a
equals  nxm/n(n−1) ,  which  equals  nx
m−m/n
.  Thus, 
du  mxm−1

n(xm/n )n−1
equals  abc .  Thus  the  denominator  n(xm/n )n−1

Another  basic  rule  of  exponents  is  that  ab  a equals  ab+c .  Thus,

Remembering  that m/n  is  just  a,  and  u(x)  is  xa ,  this  ﬁnally  gives,

4.  The  chain  rule.  Let  y  be  a  function  of  x,  y  =  f (x),  and  let  u  be  a  function  of  y ,  u  =  g(y). 
Then  u  is  a  function  of  x,  u  =  g(f (x)).  This  function  is  a  composite  function,  and  is  denoted 
by, 
(g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)). 
What  is  the  derivative  of  a  composite  function?  The  claim  is  that, 
(g ◦ f )� (x) = g � (f (x)) · f � (x). 

This  is  often  easier  to  remember  in  the  form, 

du

This  also  suggests  the  proof,

Δu 
(g ◦ f )� (x0 ) = lim 
·

,

Δx 0  Δx  Δx 0  Δy

where y0  equals f (x0 ), u0  equals g(y0 ) = g(f (x0 )), Δy  equals f (x0 + Δx) − f (x0 ) = f (x0 + Δx) − y0 , 
and Δu equals g(y0 + Δy) − g(y0 ) = g(f (x0 + Δx)) − g(f (x0 )).  So long as Δy  is nonzero, the fraction 
in  the  limit  is  deﬁned.  And,  as Δx  approaches  0,  also Δy  approaches  0.  Thus  the  limit  breaks  up 
as, 

· 
Δy
lim 
→
Δx 0  Δx 

= g � (y0 ) · f � (x0 ). 

Δu 
(g ◦ f )� (x0 ) =  lim 
Δy→0  Δy 
Thus  (g ◦ f )� (x0 )  equals  g � (f (x0 ))f � (x0 ). 
Example.  Let  y(x)  equals  1 + x2 ,  and  let  u(y)  equal  1/y  =  y−1 .  Then  y � (x)  =  0 + 2x  = 2x  and 
� 
� 
u� (y) = −y−2 .  Thus,  by  the  chain  rule,

5.  Implicit  diﬀerentiation.  This  method  has  already  been  used  many  times.  Given  a  function 
y(x) satisfying some equation involving both x and y , formally diﬀerentiate each side of the equation 
with  respect  to  x  and  then  try  to  solve  for  y � .
