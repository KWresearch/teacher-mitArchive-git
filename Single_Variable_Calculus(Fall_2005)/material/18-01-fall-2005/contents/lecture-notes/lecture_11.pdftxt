1.  Related  rates.  A  situation  that  arises  often  in  practice  is  that  two  quantities,  say  x  and  y , 
depend  on  a  third  independent  variable,  say  t.  The  quantities  x  and  y  are  related  through  some 
constraint.  Using the constraint,  if the rate­of­change dx/dt is known, the rate­of­change dy/dt can 
be  inferred. 
Example.  For  a  spring  displaced  x  units  from  equilibrium,  Hooke’s  law  implies  the  potential 
energy  of  the  spring  is, 

1 
P  =  kx 2 ,
2 
where  k  is  a  constant  with  units  kg/s2 .  At  some  moment  t  =  T ,  a  spring  is  displaced  5cm  from 

equilibrium  and  has  velocity  5cm/s.  In  terms  of  the  spring  constant  k ,  describe  the  rate­of­change 
of  the  potential  energy  at  t = T .

2.  Method  for  solving  related­rates  problems.  Many  of  these  steps  apply  to  any  word­
problem  in mathematics. 

(i)  Identify  the  independent  variable.  In  the  example,  this  is  t. 

(ii)  Label  all  constants.  In  the  example,  k  is  a  constant. 

(iii)  Label  all  dependent  variables.  In  the  example,  x  and  P  are  dependent  variables. 

(iv)  Draw  a  diagram  and  carefully  label  it. 

(v)  Write  the  given  rate­of­change  and  the  unknown  rate­of­change.	 In  the  example,  dx/dt(T )  is 
given  as  5cm/s,  and  dP /dt  is  unknown. 

(vi)  Using the diagram and any other information, ﬁnd constraints among the dependent variables. 
In  the  example,  this  is  the  equation  P  = kx2/2. 

(vii)  Implicitly  diﬀerentiate  the  constraint  equations  with  respect  to  the  independent  variable.  In 
the  example,  this  gives  dP /dt = kxdx/dt. 

(viii)  Substitute  in all known quantities and  solve  for  the unknown  rate­of­change.  In  the example, 
dP /dt(T )  equals  25kcm2/s. 

Example.  A  state  trooper  waits  a  distance  a  from  a  highway  for  passing  speeders.  The  speed 
limit  is 60mph.  The trooper aims her radar gun at an angle of π/4 to the road.  The radar registers 
a  passing  car  moving  away  from  the  trooper  at  a  speed  of  50mph.  Should  the  trooper  ticket  the 
driver? 

The  independent  variable  is  time  t.  The  constants  are  the  distance  a  and  the  angle  θ  =  π/4. 
Label  a  coordinate  system  with  the  trooper  at  the  origin  and  the  highway  equal  to  the  line  y = a. 
Label  the  position  of  the  car  along  the  highway  as  x,  moving  in  the  positive  direction.  Denote  by 
r  the  distance  of  the  car  from  the  trooper.  Then  x  and  r  are  dependent  variables.  The  rate­of­
change  dr/dt(T )  is  given  as  50mph.  The  unknown  rate­of­change  is  dx/dt(T ).  The  constraint  is 
the  Pythagorean  theorem,

Example.  A  point  on  the  x­axis  moves  away  from  the  origin.  There  is  an  angle  θ  subtended  by 
the point and the unit circle with equation x2 + y 2  = 1.  In other words,  standing at the point (x, 0) 
and  staring  at  the  circle,  θ  is  the  angle  of  your  ﬁeld­of­vision  occupied  by  the  circle.  At  a moment 
t = T ,  the  point  is  at  the  position  (2, 0)  and moving with  velocity  v .  What  is  the  rate­of­change  of 
θ  at  t = T ? 

The  independent  variable  is  time  t.  There  is  no  constant.  The  dependent  variables  are  the  x­
coordinate of the point, x(t), and the angle θ(t).  The rate­of­change dx/dt(T ) is given to be v .  The 
rate­of­change  dθ/dt  is  unknown. 

The constraint is somewhat tricky.  There are two tangent lines to the circle containing (x, 0).  These 
are  the  tangent  lines  to  points  (a, +b)  and  (a, −b)  on  the  circle.  Because  the  tangent  line  to  the 
circle  at  (a, b)  is  perpendicular  to  the  radius  through  (a, b),  the  triangle  with  vertices  (0, 0),  (a, b) 
and  the  point  (x, 0)  is  a  right  triangle.  The  angle  of  the  triangle  at  (x, 0)  is  θ/2.  Since  the  radius 
has  length  1  and  the  hypotenuse  has  length  x,  the  constraint  is, 

Implicit  diﬀerentiation  with  respect  to  t  gives,

3.  Another applied max/min problem.  As review for Exam 2, this is another applied max/min 
problem.  A  trapezoid  is  inscribed  inside  the  upper  unit  semicircle,  x2  + y = 1, y  ≥  0.  The  base 
2
of  the  trapezoid  is  the  diameter  of  the  semicircle  lying  on  the  x­axis.  The  top  of  the  trapezoid 
is  parallel  to  the  x­axis  joining  (−x, y)  to  (x, y)  for  a  point  (x, y)  on  the  unit  circle  in  the  ﬁrst 
quadrant.  What  is  the maximal  area  enclosed  by  such  a  trapezoid? 

The  parameters  are  x  and  y .  The  height  of  the  trapezoid  is  y .  The  area  of  a  trapezoid  is  the 
product  of  the  height  with  the  average  of  the  parallel  sides.  Thus, 

(2 + 2x)
A = y 
2 
This  is  the  quantity  to  be maximized.  There  is  a  constraint  among  the  parameters, 

= (x + 1)y . 

2 x  + y 2  = 1. 
Also,  since  (x, y)  is  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant,  0 ≤ x ≤ 1  and  0 ≤ y ≤ 1. 
There  are  at  least  3  ways  to  proceed.  The most  direct  is  to  solve  for  y  in  terms  of  x, 
√
1 − x2 . 

y = 

Substituting  this  into  the  equation  for  A  gives, 

A(x) = (x + 1)

Because  the  quadratic  polynomial  2x2  + x − 1  factors  as, 
2x 2  + x − 1 = (2x − 1)(x + 1), 
the  critical  points  of  A  are  x  =  −1  and  x  = 1/2.  But  x  =  −1  does  not  give  a  point  in  the  ﬁrst 
quadrant.  Thus A  is maximized  either  at  one  of  the  endpoints  x = 0,  x = 1  or  at  the  critical  point 
x = 1/2.  Plugging  in  gives,

Two  other methods  were  given  in  lecture.  The  fastest  among  the  three  is  to  instead minimize  A2 , 

A2  = (x + 1)2 y . 
2

Using  the  constraint,  y 2  = 1 − x2 ,  thus, 
(A2 )(x) = (x + 1)2 (1 − x  ).

The  derivative  of  this  polynomial  is  very  fast  to  compute,  and  gives  the  same  answer  as  above.
