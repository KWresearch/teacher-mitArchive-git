1.  Application  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem.  A  real­world  application  of  the  Mean  Value 
Theorem  is  error  analysis.  A  device  accepts  an  input  signal  x and  returns  an  output  signal  y .  If 
the  input  signal  is  always  in  the  range −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1/2  and  if  the  output  signal  is, 
1 
1 + x + x2  + x3 , 
what  precision  of  the  input  signal  x is  required  to  get  a  precision  of ±10−3  for  the  output  signal? 
If  the  ideal  input  signal  is  x = a,  and  if  the  precision  is  ±h,  then  the  actual  input  signal  is  in  the 
range  a − h ≤ x ≤ a + h.  The  precision  of  the  output  signal  is  f (x) − f (a) .  By  the  Mean  Value

Theorem, 
f (x) − f (a) 
= f � (c), 
x − a 
for  some  c between  a and  x.  The  derivative  f � (x)  is, 
−(3x2  + 2x + 1) 
. 
(1 + x + x2  + x3 )2 

f � (x) = 

For −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1/2,  this  is  bounded  by, 

|f � (x)

| ≤ 

3(1/2)2  + 2(1/2) + 1 
[1 + (−1/2) + (−1/2)2  + (−1/2)3 ]2 

= 7.04.

Thus  the Mean  Value  Theorem  gives, 
f (x) − f (a) =  f � (c

Therefore  a  precision  for  the  input  signal  of, 
h =  10−3/7.04  ≈ 10−4 
guarantees  a  precision  of  10−3  for  the  output  signal. 
2.  First derivative  test.  A function f (x) is increasing, respectively decreasing, if f (a) is less than 
f (b),  resp.  greater  than  f (b),  whenever  a  is  less  than  b.  In  symbols,  f  is  increasing,  respectively 
decreasing,  if 

f (a) < f (b)  whenever  a < b,  resp.  f (a) > f (b)  whenever  a < b.

If  f (a)  is  less  than  or  equal  to  f (b),  resp.  greater  than  or  equal  to  f (b),  whenever  a  is  less  than 
b,  then  f (x)  is  non­decreasing,  resp.  non­increasing.  If  f (x)  is  increasing,  the  graph  rises  to  the 
right.  If  f (x)  is  decreasing,  the  graph  rises  to  the  left. 
If f � (a)  is positive,  the First Derivative  Test  guarantees  that f (x)  is  increasing  for all x suﬃciently 
close  to  a.  If  f � (a)  is  negative,  the  First  Derivative  Test  guarantees  that  f (x)  is  decreasing  for  all 
x suﬃciently  close  to  a. 
Example.  For  the  function  y =  x3  + x − x − 1,  determine  where  y  is  increasing  and  where  y  is 
2
decreasing. 
The  derivative  is, 

y �  = 3x 2  + 2x − 1 = (3x − 1)(x + 1). 
Thus  the  derivative  of  y  changes  sign  only  at  the  points  x = −1  and  x =  1/3.  By  testing  random 
elements,  y �  is  positive  for  x > 1/3,  it  is  negative  for  −1 < x < 1/3,  and  it  is  positive  for  x < −1. 
Therefore, by the First Derivative Test, y is increasing for x < −1, y is decreasing for −1 < x < 1/3, 
and  y is  increasing  for  x > 1/3. 
3.  Extremal  points.  If  f (x) ≤  f (a)  for  all  x near  a,  then  x is  a  local  maximum.  If  f (x) ≥  f (a) 
for  all  x near  a,  then  x is  a  local  minimum.  Because  of  the  First  Derivative  Test,  if  f � (a) > 0  and 
f  is deﬁned  to  the  right of a,  the graph of f  rises  to  the  right of a.  Thus a is not a  local maximum. 
Similarly,  if  f � (a) < 0  and  f  is  deﬁned  to  the  left  of  a,  the  graph  of  f  rises  to  the  left  of  a.  Thus 
a is  not  a  local  maximum.  In  particular,  if  f  is  deﬁned  to  both  the  right  and  left  of  a,  if  f � (a)  is 
deﬁned, and  if a is a  local maximum,  then f � (a) equals 0.  Similarly,  if f  is deﬁned to both the right 
and  left  of  a,  if  f � (a)  is  deﬁned,  and  if  a is  a  local minimum,  then  f � (a)  equals  0. 
A  point  a where  f � (a)  is  deﬁned  and  equals  0  is  a  critical  point.  By  the  last  paragraph,  if  x = a is 
a  local maximum  of  f ,  respectively  a  local minimum  of  f ,  then  one  of  the  following  holds. 

(i)  The  function  f (x)  is  discontinuous  at  a. 
(ii)  The  function  f (x)  is  continuous  at  a,  but  f � (a)  is  not  deﬁned. 
(iii)  The point a is a left endpoint of the interval where f is deﬁned, and f � (a) ≤ 0, resp.  f � (a) ≥ 0. 
(iv)  The  point	 a  is  a  right  endpoint  of  the  interval  where  f  is  deﬁned,  and  f � (a)  ≥  0,  rexp. 
f � (a) ≤ 0. 
(v)  The  function  f  is  deﬁned  to  the  left  and  right  of  a,  and  f � (a)  equals  0.  In  other words,  a is  a 
critical  point  of  f . 
Example.  For  the  function  y =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  critical  points  are  x = −1  and  x =  1/3.  By 
2
examining where  y is  increasing  and decreasing,  x = −1  is  a  local maximum  and x = 1/3  is  a  local 
minimum. 
The plurals of “maximum” and “minimum” are “maxima ” and “minima ”.  Together,  local maxima 
and  local  minima  are  called  extremal  points,  or  extrema.  These  are  points  where  f  takes  on  an 

18.01  Calculus

extreme  value,  either  positive  or  negative.  A  point where  f  achieves  its maximum  value  among  al l 
points where  f  is  deﬁned  is  a  global  maximum  or  absolute  maximum.  A  point where  f  achieves  its 
minimum  value  among  al l  points  where  f  is  deﬁned  is  a  global  minimum  or  absolute  minimum. 
4.  Concavity and the Second Derivative Test.  For a diﬀerentiable function f , every “interior” 
extremal  point  is  a  critical  point  of  f .  But  not  every  critical  point  of  f  is  an  extremal  point. 
Example.  The function f (x) = x3  has a critical point at x = 0.  But f (x) is everywhere increasing, 
thus  x = 0  is  not  an  extremal  point  of  f . 
When  is  a  critical  point  an  extremal  point?  When  is  it  a  local  maximum?  When  is  it  a  local 
minimum?  This  is closely  related to  the concavity  of f .  A  function f (x)  is concave  up,  respectively 
concave  down,  if no secant line segment to f (x) crosses below the graph of f , resp.  above the graph 
of  f .  In  symbols,  f  is  concave  up,  resp.  concave  down,  if 
(f (c) − f (a))/(c − a) ≤ (f (b) − f (a))/(b − a)  whenever  a < c < b, 
resp.  (f (c) − f (a))/(c − a) ≥ (f (b) − f (a))/(b − a)  whenever  a < c < b. 
For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f ,  this  equation  is  close  to, 
f � (c) ≤ f � (b)  whenever  a < c < b, 
resp.  f � (c) ≥ f � (b)  whenever  a > c > b. 
This  precisely  says  that  f �  is  non­decreasing,  resp.  f �  is  non­increasing.  If  f �  is  non­decreasing, 
resp.  non­increasing,  then f  is concave up,  resp.  concave down.  Applying the First Derivative Test 
to determine when f �  is increasing, resp.  decreasing, gives the Second Derivative Test :  If f �� (a) > 0, 
then  f  is  concave  up  near  x = a;  if  f �� (a) < 0  then  f  is  concave  down  near  x = a. 
If  f  is  concave  up  near  a  critical  point,  the  critical  point  is  a  local minimum.  If  f  is  concave  down 
near  a  critical  point,  the  critical  point  is  a  local maximum.  Combined  with  the  Second  Derivative 
Test, this gives a test for when a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum:  If f � (a) equals 
0  and  f �� (a) < 0,  then  x = a is  a  local  maximum.  If  f � (a)  equals  0  and  f �� (a) > 0,  then  x = a is  a 
local minimum. 
Example.  For  y  =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  second  derivative  is  y ��  = 6x + 2.  Since  y �� (−1)  =  −4  is 
2
negative,  the  critical  point  x = −1  is  a  local maximum.  Since  y �� (1/3) = 4  is  positive,  x = 1/3  is  a 
local minimum. 
5.  Inﬂection  points.  If  f  is  diﬀerentiable,  but  for  every  neighborhood  of  a,  f  is  neither  concave 
up  nor  concave  down  on  the  entire  neighborhood,  then  a is  an  inﬂection  point.  If  f �� (a)  is  deﬁned, 
the Second Derivative Test says that f �� (a) must equal 0.  Except in pathological cases, an inﬂection 
point  is  a  point  where  f  is  concave  up  to  one  side  of  f ,  and  concave  down  to  the  other  side  of  f . 
Example.  For  y  =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  second  derivative  y ��  = 6x + 2  is  negative  for  x < −1/3 
2
and  is  positive  for  x > 1/3.  By  the  Second Derivative Test,  y  is  concave  down  for  x < −1/3  and  y 
is  concave  up  for  x > −1/3.  Therefore  x = −1/3  is  an  inﬂection  point  for  y .
