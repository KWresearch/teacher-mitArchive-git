1.  Ordinary  diﬀerential  equations.  An  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  is  an  equation  involving

a  single  independent  variable  x  together  with  a  dependent  variable  y  and  its  derivatives  dk y/dxk , 
dk y
G  x, y , 
dxk 

dy  d2y
dx2 , . . . , 
, 
dx
The  largest  k  for  which  dk y/dxk  occurs  in  the  equation  is  called  order  of  the  diﬀerential  equation. 
Examples.  Here  are  examples  of  ordinary  diﬀerential  equations. 
(i)  The  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation, 

= 0. 

y − sin(x 2 ) = 0, 

has order 0, because no derivatives of  y  actually occur  in  the  equation.  It has a unique  (and  rather 
trivial)  solution, 

y = sin(x 2 ). 

Because  the  solution  is  unique,  it  depends  on  0  parameters  (and  the  order  is  0). 
(ii)  The  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation, 

dy 
dx 

= 0,

−

x + 1

has order 1 because dy/dx occurs and no higher derivatives occur.  Every solution is an antiderivative 
of  1/x + 1,

dx = ln(|x + 1 ) + C, 
x + 1 
Notice  the  solution  depends  on  1  parameter,  C .  And  the  order  is  1. 
(iii)  The  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation, 

y =

+ ω 2 y = 0,

has  order  2.  The  general  solution  was  found  in  Problem  Set  2,  Problem  4, 

The  solution  depends  on  2  parameters,  A  and  B .  And  the  order  is  2. 

y = A cos(ωx) + B sin(ωx). 

(iv)  The  previous  equation  was  one  particular  linear  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation. 
linear  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  has  the  form, 
dk−1y 
dk y
dxk−1  + · · ·
dxk  + ak−1 (x) 
ak (x) 
for  functions  ak (x), . . . , a0 (x), b(x).  If  b(x)  is  zero,  the  equation  is  homogeneous.  Otherwise  it 
is  inhomogeneous.  Very  important  is  the  case  when  all  the  functions  ak (x), . . . , a0 (x), b(x)  are 
constant.  Then  the  diﬀerential  equation  is  called  constant  coeﬃcient.  The  solution  of  constant 
coeﬃcient  linear  ordinary  diﬀerential  equations  is  a main  focus  of Math  18.03.

2.  Separable  diﬀerential  equations.  Many  diﬀerential  equations  arising  in  applications  are 
examples  of  separable  diﬀerential  equation.  A  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  is  a  ﬁrst­
order  diﬀerential  equation, 

dy 
dx 

= F (x, y),

for  which  f (x, y)  factors  as, 

F (x, y) = g(x)/h(y). 

Example.  Find  the  equation y = f (x) of  every  curve with  the  following property:  For  every point 
(x, y)  on  the  curve,  the  tangent  line  to  the  curve  is  perpendicular  to  the  line  joining  (x, y)  to  the 
origin  (0, 0). 

The slope of the tangent  line to the curve at (x, y)  is dy/dx.  The slope of  the  line  joining (0, 0) and 
(x, y)  is  y/x.  Since  the  tangent  line  is  perpendicular  to  the  line  joining  (0, 0)  and  (x, y), 

= −x/y . 

dy 
dx 

Thus,  the  equation  y = f (x)  is  a  solution  to  this  separable  diﬀerential  equation. 


The  algorithm  for  solving  a  separable  diﬀerential  equation  is  the  following. 


(i).  Factor  f (x, y)  as  g(x)/h(y).  This  is  often  the most  diﬃcult  step.  In  the  example,  it  is  quite

easy.  Simply  take  g(x) = −x  and  h(y) = y .

(ii).  Rewrite  the  diﬀerential  equation  as  an  equality  of  diﬀerentials.  In  other  words,

rewrite  the  equation  as, 


dy 
dx 

= 

g(x) 
h(y) 

⇒ h(y)dy = g(x)dx.

In  the  example,  this  gives, 

−x  ⇒ ydy = −xdx.

(iii).  Antidiﬀerentiate  both  sides  of  the  equation.  In  the  example,  the  antiderivatives 
ydy =  −xdx,

give,

(iv).  If  there  is  an  inital  value,  use  it  to  ﬁnd  the  constant  of  integration.  An  initial  value 
problem  is  an  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  together  with  some  information  for  an  initial  value  x0 
� 
of  the  independent  variable.  It  is  often  written, 

dy/dx = F (x, y), 
y(x0 ) = y0 . 

The  example  was  not  an  initial  value  problem.  However,  it  can  easily  be  made  an  initial  value 
problem  by  specifying, 

y(1) = 1, 

for  instance.  With  this  condition,  the  constant  C  satisﬁes  the  equation, 
−1
2 

1 
(1)2  = 
2

(1)2  + C. 

The  solution  is, 

C  = 1. 

(v).  Simplify  the  answer.  Often  it  is  best  to  solve  for  y  =  f (x).  Often  this  is  unnecessary.  It 
depends  on  the  problem.  In  the  example  problem,  the  simplest  answer  is  the  implicit  answer, 

So  the  solution  of  the  initial  value  problem  is, 

x2  + y 2 

= 2
C .

x2  + y 2  = 2. 

Thus  every  curve  satisfying  the  geometric  property  is  a  circle  centered  at  the  origin. 

Example.  Here  is  a  somewhat  diﬀerent  example.  There  is  a  single  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential 
equation  satisﬁed  by  every  function, 
y = (x − a)3 , 
where  a  is  an  arbitrary  constant.  Find  this  diﬀerential  equation,  and  ﬁnd  all  its  solutions.

The  derivative  of  y  is, 

dy 
dx 
The  constant  a  can  be  eliminated  by  writing  this  as, 

= 3(x − a)2 . 

= 3[(x − a)3 ]2/3  = 3y

2/3

. 

dy 
dx 

This  is  a  separable  diﬀerential  equation, 

The  algorithm  gives, 

y 2/3 .
dy/dx = 3
�

� 
y−2/3dy = 3dx, 
y−2/3dy = 3dx, 
3y 1/3  = 3x + C. 
Calling  the  constant −3a  gives  the  answer, 
y = (x − a)3 . 

However,  there  are  other  solutions.  For  instance,  y  =  0  is  a  solution.  The  general  solution  of  the 
⎧⎨ ⎩

diﬀerential  equation  depends  on  2  parameters,  a < b, 
(x − a)3 ,
0, 
(x − b)3 ,

The  problem  is  that  in  the  step  giving  dy/y 2/3  = dx.  If  y  equals  0,  this  equation  involves  division 
by  zero.  Division  by  zero  is  not  allowed,  so  the method  breaks  down. 
Important  fact.  This  fact will  not  be  used  in  this  class.  However,  it  is  often  crucial  in  real­world 
�

applications  to  know  the  solution  to  an  initial  value  problem  is  unique.  The  fact  is, 

x ≤ a, 
a < x ≤ b, 
x > b 

y =


dy  = F (x, y),
dx 
y(x0 ) = y0 , 

has  a  unique  solution  for  x  close  to  x0  if  F (x, y)  is  both  continuous  and  diﬀerentiable  at  (x0 , y0 ). 
In  the  previous  example,  F (x, y) = 3y 2/3  is  continuous  at  y0  =  0.  But  it  is  not  diﬀerentiable  at 
y0  = 0.  Ultimately,  this  is  the  reason  for  the  extra  solutions  of  the  diﬀerential  equation. 
3.  Applications.  Separable  diﬀerential  equations  come  up  often  in  applications.  The  most 
common  separable  diﬀerential  equation  is  the  equation  for  exponential  growth, 

dy 
dt 

= ky , 

 

18.01  Calculus 

where  k  is  a  constant.

The  solution  behaves  diﬀerently  if  k  is  positive  or  negative.  For  k  positive,  this  equation  arises  in 
population  growth  and  interest  on  savings,  among  others.  For  k  negative,  this  equation  arises  in 
radioactive  decay,  a  discharging  capactior  in  an  RC­circuit,  and  Newton’s  law  of  cooling. 

Population growth.  The simplest model of population growth is that a population N (t) (modeled 
as  continuous  for  simplicity)  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  size  of  the  population.  This  gives, 

Following  the method  gives, 

dN 
= kN . 
dt 
�  dN/N  = kdt, 
� 
1/N dN  =  kdt, 
ln(|N  ) = kt + C. 
|

Exponentiating  both  sides  gives, 

N0e . kt 
Observe  that  N (t)  increases  without  bound  as  t  increases.  When  N  is  very  large,  the  ecosystem 
cannot  support  such  a  population.  Thus  the model  is  only  valid  if N (t)  is  not  too  large. 

N (t) = 

A  slightly  more  realistic  model  hypothesizes  a  constant,  equilibrium  population  Nequi  sustainable 
indeﬁnitely.  The model  is  that  the  population  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  both  to  the  population 
N  and  the  diﬀerence Nequi  − N , 

dN 
= kN (Nequi  − N ). 
dt 
This  is  again  a  separable  diﬀerential  equation.  It  gives  the  solution, 
N0Nequi/(N0  Nequi  − N0 )e−
+ (

N (t
) = 

kNequi

t ).

The most  important  feature  is  that N (t)  approaches Nequi  as  t  increases.  This  is  called  the  steady­
state  solution.  In  general,  to  ﬁnd  the  steady­state  solution  to  a  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential 
equation,  assume  the  solution  is  constant  y  =  y1  so  that  dy/dt  is  0.  In  the  original  model  of 
population  growth,  the  only  steady­state  solution  is N  = 0.  In  the  new model,  there  are  2  steady­
state  solutions,  N  =  0  and  N  = Nequi .  In  Math  18.03,  stability  is  deﬁned,  and  a  method  is  given 
to  show  the  only  stable  steady­state  solution  is N  = Nequi . 
Radioactive  decay.  A  radioactive  isotope  decays  to  a more  stable  isotope  at  a  rate  proportional 
to  the  remaining  radioactive  isotope.  Thus  the mass m(t)  satisﬁes  a  diﬀerential  equation, 

Using  the method,  the  solution  is, 

= −km.

m(t) =  m0e−kt .

An important feature in decay problems is the half­life.  The half­life  is the length of time necessary 
for  the mass  of  radioactive  isotope  to  decrease  to  one­half  the  initial mass, 

Solving  in  the  formula  gives, 

m(Thalf ) = m0/2. 

Thalf  = 

ln(2)

/k .

Example.  The  half­life  of  a  certain  radioactive  isotope  is  20  years.  How  long  is  required  for  the 
mass  to  decrease  to  1%  of  the  initial  mass?  Using  the  formula  above,  k =  ln(2)/25.  Therefore  the 
equation  for  the mass  is, 
m(t) = m0e− ln(2)t/25 . 
Thus  the  time  tf  when  the mass  equals  0.01m0  satisﬁes, 
m0e− ln(2)tf /25  = m0/100, 

or, 

Solving  gives, 

ln(2)tf /25 = ln(100) = 2 ln(10). 

tf  = 50 ln(10)/ ln(2) = 

166  years. 

Newton’s  Law  of  Cooling.  Isaac Newton  proposed  a  law  for  the  rate­of­change  of  the  tempera­
ture T  of an ob ject placed in a large, eﬀectively inﬁnite, environment at a ﬁxed ambient temperature 
Tamb .  The law is that the rate­of­change of T  is negatively proportional to the temperature gradient 
T  − Tamb , 

= −k(T  − Tamb ). 

dT 
dt 

The method  gives  the  solution, 

T (t) = Tamb  + (T  − Tamb )e−kt . 

As  t  increases,  the  temperature  T  approaches  the  steady­state  temperature,  Tamb .
