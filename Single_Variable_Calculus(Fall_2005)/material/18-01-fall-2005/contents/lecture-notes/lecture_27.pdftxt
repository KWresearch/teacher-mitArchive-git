1.  Integration  by  parts.  The  diﬀerential  form  of  the  product  rule  is, 

d(uv) = udv + vdu. 

An  equivalent  form  is, 

udv = d(uv) − vdu. 
� 
� 
This  gives  a  very  useful  antidiﬀerentiation  formula, 
udv = uv − 

vdu. 

This  formula  is  integration  by  parts. 

� 
Example.  Compute  the  antiderivative  of, 

x cos(x)dx. 

Set  u  to  be  x  and  dv  to  be  cos(x)dx.  Then  u, v , du  and  dv  are, 

u = x 
du = dx 
� 

dv = cos(x)dx, 
v = sin(x) 
� 
udv = uv − 

sin(x)dx. 

Using  integration  by  parts, 

� 
� 
The  new  integral  is  easy  to  evaluate.  Altogether  this  gives,

Because  it  is  much  easier  to  diﬀerentiate  than  the  antidiﬀerentiate,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  check  you

2.  How to use integration by parts.  The goal of integration by parts is to replace a complicated 
integral,  udv ,  by  a  simpler  integral  vdu.  What  this  usually means  is  that  du  should  be  simpler 
than  u,  and  v  should  be  no  more  complicated  than  dv .  This  was  the  case  in  the  last  example. 
However,  occasionally  this  is  not  the  case. 
� 
Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  compute  the  antiderivative, 

ln(x)dx. 

There  is very  little  choice here,  if we  are  to use  only  integration by parts.  Set u  to be  ln(x)  and  set 
dv  to  be  dx.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

u = ln(x),  dv = dx 
v = x 
du = dx/x, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 

dx. 

Using  integration  by  parts, 

� 
� 
The  new  integral  is  easy  to  evaluate.  Altogether  this  gives, 

� 
vdu, 
ln(x)dx = x ln(x) − 

ln(x)dx = 

x ln(x) − x + C . 

Notice this example does not follow the general rule.  The integral v = x is strictly more complicated 
than  dv  =  dx.  However,  du =  dx/x  is  much  simpler  than  u =  ln(x).  So  vdu =  dx  is  simpler  than 
udv  =  ln(x)dx.  The  lesson  is  to  be  ﬂexible  when  antidiﬀerentiating.  Try  diﬀerent  things,  and  see 
which  one  works.  For  example,  another  approach  to  this  problem,  which  ultimately  comes  down 
to  integration  by  parts  again,  is  to make  an  inverse  substitution, 
t 
x = e ,  dx = e tdt. 
� 
� 

The  new  integral  is, 

ln(x)dx = 

tetdt. 

Set  u = t  and  du = etdt.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

u = t, 
du = dt, 

dv = etdt 
v = et

Back­substituting  for  x  gives,

ln(x)dx =  x ln(x) − x + C . 

This  agrees  with  the  earlier  answer. 
2.  Reduction  formulas.  It  often  happens  that  an  integral  can  be  computed  only  be  repeated 
application  of  integration  by  parts.  It  sometimes  happens  that  integration  by  parts  gives  the 
induction  step  to  solve  inﬁnitely  many  integrals.  In  this  case,  the  formula  given  by  integration  by 
parts  is  called  a  reduction  formula. 
� 
Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  give  a  reduction  formula  for, 

[ln(x)]ndx. 

Now there is much more choice for u and dv .  The simplest choice is to set u = [ln(x)]n  and dv = dx. 
Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

dv = dx 
v = x 

Using  integration  by  parts, 
� 

u = [ln(x)]n , 
du = n[ln(x)]n−1/xdx, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 
x[ln(x)]n  − n � 
vdu, 
[ln(x)]n−1dx. 
[ln(x)]ndx = 
The  new  integral  is  simpler  than  the  original  integral.  And  repeated  application  of  the  formula 
� 
� 
eventually  leads  to  a  formula  for  the  integral.  Thus  this  is  a  reduction  formula.  For  instance,  this 
gives, 
[ln(x)]2dx = x[ln(x)]2  − 2 

ln(x)dx. 

� 
The  new  integral  was  already  computed.  Altogether  this  gives, 
[ln(x)]2dx =  x[ln(x)]2  − 2x ln(x

) + 2
x + C .

Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  ﬁnd  a  reduction  formula  for, 

tn e tdt. 

The  simplest  choice  is  to  set  u = tn  and  dv = etdt.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

Using  integration  by  parts, 

u = tn , 
dv = etdt 
du = ntn−1dt,

v = e
� 
� 
udv = uv −

Notice  how  similar  this  answer  was  to  the  answer  of  the  previous  example.  The  connection  comes 
from  the  inverse  substitution,

x = e ,  dx = e tdt,

so  that,

[ln(x)]ndx = 

tn e tdt. 

3.  Advanced  reduction  formulas.  Sometimes  a  reduction  formula  can  only  be  obtained  by 
repeatedly  applying  integration  by  parts  or  by  using  some  other  identity. 
� 
Example.  Using  integration  by  parts  to  ﬁnd  a  reduction  formula  for, 
[sin(x)]ndx,  n ≥ 1. 

One  choice  is  to  set  u = [sin(x)]n−1  and  to  set  dv = sin(x)dx.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 
u = [sin(x)]n−1 , 
dv = sin(x)dx 
du = (n − 1)[sin(x)]n−2 cos(x)dx,  v = − cos(x). 
� 
� 
Using  integration  by  parts, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 
vdu, 
[sin(x)]ndx = −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x) + (n − 1) 
[sin(x)]n−2 cos  (x)dx. 
2
At  ﬁrst  blush,  this  is more  complicated  than  the  original  integral  since  it  involves  both  sin(x)  and 
� 
� 
� 
cos(x).  But  cos2 (x)  equals  1 − sin2 (x).  This  substitution  gives, 
[sin(x)]n−2dx − (n − 1) 
[sin(x)]ndx = −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x) + (n − 1) 

[sin(x)]ndx.

This certainly seems circular:  the new formula for the integral involves the integral we were looking 
� 
� 
� 
for.  However,  bringing  like  terms  to  one  side  of  the  equation  gives, 
[sin(x)]n  = −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x) + (n − 1) 
[sin(x)]ndx + (n − 1) 
� 
n − 1)/n � 
Cleaning  this  up  a  bit  gives  the  reduction  formula, 
[sin(x)]ndx =  −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x)/n 
[sin(x)]n−2dx.
