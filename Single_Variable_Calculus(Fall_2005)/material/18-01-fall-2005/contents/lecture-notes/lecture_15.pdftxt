1.  The Riemann  sum  for  the  exponential  function.  The problem is to compute the Riemann 
integral, 
0 
using Riemann sums.  Choose the partition of  [0, b]  into a sequence of n equally­spaced subintervals 
of  length  b/n.  So  the  partition  numbers  are  xk  =  kb/n.  Also  the  length  of  each  partition  is 
Δxk  =  b/n.  Because  ex  is  increasing,  the  minimum  value  of  e on  the  interval  [xk−1 , xk ]  occurs  at 
x
the  left  endpoint, 

xe  dx, 

. 

Amin  = 

Thus  the  lower  sum  is, 

(k−1)b/n
yk,min  = e xk−1  = e
Similarly,  the maximum  value  occurs  at  the  right  endpoint, 
kb/n 
yk,max  = e xk  = e

Taking  the  limit  of  Amin ,  respectively  Amax ,  as  n  tends  to  inﬁnity  is  the  same  as  taking  the  limit

2.  The  Riemann  sum  for  x .  Let  r > 0  be  a  positive  real  number.  The  problem  is  to  compute 
the  Riemann  integral, 
1 
using Riemann  sums.  For  this  particular  integral,  a  diﬀerent  partition  than  usual  is more  eﬃcient. 
Let  n  be  a  positive  integer,  and  let  q  be  the  real  number, 

r x  dx, 

Choose  the  partition  of  [1, b]  into  n  subintervals  with  partition  numbers, 

q = b1/n . 

k 
xk  = q . 

Observe  that, 

1 = x0  < x1  < · · · < xn−1  < xn  = (b1/n )n  = b. 
The  length  of  the  k th  subinterval  is, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1  = q k  − q k−1  = q k−1 (q − 1). 

Observe  this  increases  as  k  increases.  So  this  is  not  the  partition  of  [1, b]  into  n  equal  subintervals. 
The mesh  size  is, 

mesh = max(Δx1 , . . . , Δxn ) = Δxn  = (q − 1)b(n−1)/n  ≤ q − 1. 

As  n  tends  to  inﬁnity,  the mesh  size  tends  to, 
lim mesh =  lim q − 1 =  lim b1/n  − 1 = 0.

Thus,  even  though  this  isn’t  the  most  obvious  choice  of  partition,  it  can  be  used  to  compute  the 
Riemann  integral.

Because  x is  increasing,  the  minimum  value  of  x on  the  interval  [xk−1 , xk ]  occurs  at  the  left 
endpoint, 
yk,min  = xk−1  = q (k−1)r .

Similarly,  the maximum  value  occurs  at  the  right  endpoint, 

Thus  the  lower  sum  is,

Thus  the  upper  and  lower  sums  simplify  to,

Amax  = q  (q − 1)(q n(r+1)  − 1)/(q  − 1).

Now  back­substitute  q = b1/n  to  get  that  qn(r+1)  = br+1 .  Simplifying  gives,

3.  The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus.  There  is  a  single  theorem  that  it  is  at  the  heart 
of  almost  all  applications  involving  Riemann  integrals.  The  theorem  answers  two  question  simul­
taneously:  Which  functions  are  Riemann  integrable?  What  is  the  Riemann  integral  of  a  function? 
The  answer  to  the  ﬁrst  question  is:  Every  function  you  are  likely  to  encounter  is  Riemann  inte­
grable.  Precisely,  every  continuous  function,  and  every  piecewise  continuous  function  is  Riemann 
integrable. 

The  answer  to  the  second  question  is more  interesting.  Assume  f (x)  is  a  continuous  function.  Let 
� 
x = a  be  a  ﬁxed  point  where  f (x)  is  deﬁned.  Form  the  function, 
a 

F (x) = 

f (t)dt. 

x 

The  function  F (x)  is  deﬁned  whenever  f (t)  is  deﬁned  on  all  of  [a, x].  If  f (x)  is  continuous,  the 
� 
Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  asserts  F (x)  is  diﬀerentiable  and,

f (t)dt = f (x).

Let  ymin  be  the  minimum  value  of  f (t)  on  the  interval  [x, x + Δx].  Let  ymax  be  the  maximum 
<  · · · 
value  of  f (t)  on  the  interval  [x, x + Δx].  Then  for  every  choice  of  partition  t0  <  t1 
<  tn  of
[x, x + Δx],  and  every  choice  of  values  y ∗  on  the  subintervals, 
k 
ymin  ≤ y ∗ 
k  ≤ ymax ,

The middle term  is the diﬀerence quotient.  Consider what happens as Δx tends to 0.  Because f (t) 
is  continuous,  both  the  maximum  and  minimum  values  of  f (t)  on  [x, x + Δx]  simply  limit  to  the 
value  f (x).  Thus, 

lim ymin  = lim ymax  = f (x).

By  the  Squeezing  Lemma  for  limits,  since  these  two  limits  exist  and  are  equals,  the  middle  limit 
also  exists  and  equals  f (x),

4.  Algorithm  for  computing  Riemann  integrals.  The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  has many 
important  applications.  The  most  obvious  is  to  give  us  a  simpler  method  for  computing  Riemann 
integrals,  under  the  hypothesis  that  we  can  compute  the  antiderivative.  If  f (x)  is  a  continuous 
�  b 
function  and G(x)  is  a  known  antiderivative  of  f (x),  then, 
f (t)dt = G(b) − G(a). 
� 
a 
F (x) = 
a 
� 
is  also  an  antiderivative  of  f (t)  by  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus.  Thus,  since  the  general 
antiderivative  is G(x) + C ,  there  is  a  constant  C  such  that  F (x) = G(x) + C .  But  also, 
a 
F (a) = 
f (t)dt = 0. 
a 
�  b 
Thus,  F (x) = G(x) − G(a).  Now  plug  in  x = b  to  get, 
G(b) − G(a).
