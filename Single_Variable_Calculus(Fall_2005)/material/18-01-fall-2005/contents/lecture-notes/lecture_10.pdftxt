1.  Asymptotes.  An  asymptote  describes  the  behavior  of  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  as  it  becomes 
unbounded,  in  some  sense.  There  are  two main  examples.  The  function  f  has  a  vertical  asymptote 
x = a  if  at  least  1  of  the  following  holds, 
lim  f (x) = +∞,  lim  f (x) = −∞,  lim  f (x) = +∞,  lim  f (x) = −∞.

In  each  case,  the  graph  of  y = f (x)  becomes  unbounded,  and  becomes  arbitrarily  close  to  the  line 
x = a.  If  x = a  is  a  vertical  asymptote,  then  f (x)  has  an  inﬁnite  discontinuity  at  x = a. 
The  function  f  has  a  horizontal  asymptote  y = b  if  at  least  1  of  the  following  holds, 

lim  f (x) = b,  lim  f (x) = b. 
x→+∞ 
x→−∞ 

In  other  words,  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  becomes  arbitrarily  close  to  the  line  y  =  b  as  x  approaches 
either +∞  or −∞. 
Example.  For  the  function  y  = (x3  + x)/(x − 1)  =  x(x2  + 1)/(x − 1),  the  lines  x  =  −1  and 
2

x  =  −1  are  vertical  asymptotes.  There  is  no  horizontal  asymptote.  However,  the  graph  of  y  is 
asymptotic  to  the  line  y  =  x.  This  was  not  discussed  in  lecture.  A  pair  of  functions  f  and  g  are 
asymptotic  to  each  other  if  the  line  y = 0  is  a  horizontal  asymptote  of  f  − g . 
2.  Applied  maximum/minimum  problems.  Using  the  First  Derivative  Test,  the  maximum 
and minimum  of many  functions  can  be  computed.  This  is  very  important  in  applications. 
Example.  Two  long  walls  meet  at  right  angles  making  a  corner.  Using  a  length  of  10  meters  of 
fence  to  form  the  other  2  sides  of  a  rectangle,  what  is  the  largest  area  that  can  be  enclosed  in  this 
corner? 
Step  1.  Identify  parameters.  A  parameter  is  a  constant  or  variable.  The  constant  in  this 
problem  is  10 meters.  Two  variables  are  the  length  l  of  one  side  of  the  rectangle,  and  the  width  w 
of  the  remaining  side  of  the  rectangle. 
Step  2.  Draw  a  diagram.  This  was  done  in  lecture. 
Step  3.  Find  the  quantity  to  be  maximized  or  minimized.  The  quantity  to  be  maximized 
is  the  area  A  of  the  rectangle.  Since  the  area  is  the  product  of  the  length  and  width,  A  equals  lw. 
Step  4.  Use  the  constraints  to  eliminate  variables.  The  constraint  is  that  the  total  length 
of  fence  is  10 meters.  Thus  l + w  equals  10.  This  is  used  to  eliminate  w, 
w = 10 − l. 
Making  this  substitution,  A  is  now  a  function  of  l  alone, 
A(l) = lw(l) = l(10 − l) = −l2  + 10l.

Step  4 1 .  Sketch  a  graph  of  the  quantity  to  be  maximized  or  minimized.  This  is  not 
2 
absolutely  necessary.  Sometimes  it  is  impossible.  When  you  can  make  a  rough  sketch,  this  will 
typically  give  a  very  good  idea  where  the  maximum  or  minimum  lies.  In  the  example  above,  A(l) 
is  a  quadratic  equation.  Because  both  l  and  w  must  be  nonnegative,  A(l)  is  only  deﬁned  on  the 
interval  0 ≤  l ≤ 10.  Thus  the  graph  of  A(l)  is  a  segment  of  a  parabola  opening  down.  The  vertex 
of  the  parabola  is  contained  in  the  segment.  Thus  the  vertex  is  the maximum. 

Step  5.  Compute  the  derivative.  In  this  case, 
A� (l) = −2l + 10. 

Step  6.  Find  all  critical  points,  endpoints,  discontinuity  points,  etc.  In  most  cases,  it 
suﬃces  to  ﬁnd  all  critical  points  and  endpoints.  Occasionally  it  is  also  necessary  to  ﬁnd  all  points 
where  f �  is  not  deﬁned.  Rarely  it  is  necessary  to  also  consider  discontinuity  points  (although  this 
is  usually  so  obvious  that  it  does  not  require  a  separate  step).  In  this  case,  the  endpoints  are  l = 0 
and  l = 10.  The  one  critical  point  is  l = 5. 

Step  7.  Determine  the  global  maximum  or  minimum.  Checking  all  critical  points,  end­
points,  etc.,  determine  the  global  maximum  or  the  global  minimum.  In  this  case,  A(0)  equals  0, 
A(10)  equals  0  and  A(5)  equals  25.  Thus  l = 5  is  the  global maximum. 

Step  8.  Back­substitute.  Plug  in  the  value  of  the  single  remaining  independent  variable  to 
determine  the  values  of  the  remaining  independent  variables.  In  this  case,  w  equals  10 − l,  which 
is  10 − 5 = 5  for  l = 5.  Thus,  the  largest  area  25  is  enclosed  by  a  square  of  side  length  5. 
Example.  A  swimmer  is  in  the  water  at  a  distance  b1  meters  from  shore.  She  wants  to  reach  a 
point on  land b2  meters  from the water.  The point  is a meters parallel to the shore.  If the swimmer 
swims  v1  meters  per  second  and  runs  v2  meters  per  second,  at  what  distance  x  from  the  closest 
point  on  shore  should  she  aim  to  minimize  her  time  to  the  target?  Mathematically,  the  swimmer 
is  at  point  (0, b1 )  and  wants  to  reach  point  (a, −b2 ),  where  the  shore  is  the  x­axis.  At  what  point 
(x, 0)  should  she  aim? 
The  constants  are  a,  b1 ,  b2 ,  v1  and  v2 .  The  variable  is  x.  It  is  also  convenient  to  introduce  a 
variable  d1  for  the  distance  from  (0, b1 )  to  (x, 0),  and  a  variable  d2  for  the  distance  from  (x, 0)  to 
(a, −b2 ).  Although  not  obvious,  it  is  also  very  convenient  to  introduce  a  variable  θ1  for  the  acute 
angle  formed  by  the  x­axis  and  the  line  segment  joining  (0, b1 )  to  (x, 0).  Also  introduce  θ2  for  the 
acute  angle  formed  by  the  x­axis  and  the  line  segment  joining  (x, 0)  to  (a, −b2 ). 
The  time  T1  to  swim  to  point  (x, 0)  is,

Thus  the  total  time  to  reach  the  target  is,

Technically,  there  are  no  endpoints.  However,  it  is  obvious  that  the  maximum  must  occur  for 
0 ≤ x ≤ a.  Thus  these may  be  taken  to  be  endpoints.  The  critical  value  occurs  when,

This is Snel l’s Law  for refraction of light upon crossing from one medium to another.  For refraction, 
a  particle  of  light  (perhaps  ﬁctitious)  replaces  the  swimmer,  a  translucent  medium  of  one  type 
replaces  the  water,  and  a  translucent  medium  of  a  second  type  replaces  the  land.  If  light  travels 
with velocity v1  in the ﬁrst medium and with velocity v2  in the second medium, light rays will refract 
upon  crossing  the  boundary  between media.  Snell’s  Law  describes  the  angles  of  this  refraction.
