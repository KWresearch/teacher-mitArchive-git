1.  Tangent  lines  to  parametric  curves.  This  short  section  was  not  explicitly  discussed  for 
general  parametric  curves.  It  was  discussed  for  polar  curves,  which  are  a  special  collection  of 
parametric  curves.

Given  a  parametric  curve, 


�


x  =  f (t), 
y  =  g(t),

what  is  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  at  (f (a), g(a))?  The  relevant  diﬀerentials  are, 
dx = f � (t)dt,  dy = g � (t)dt. 
� � ��

If  g � (a)  is  nonzero,  then  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
f � (t)dt 
dy 
(a) =

g (t)dt 
dx

In  particular,  for  a  function  r = r(θ),  the  associated  polar  curve  is,


f � (a)

g (a)


= 

x  =  r(θ) cos(θ), 
y  =  r(θ) sin(θ) 

Thus  the  diﬀerentials  are, 

dx  = [r � (θ) cos(θ) − r(θ) sin(θ)]dθ, 
dy  = [r � (θ) sin(θ) + r(θ) cos(θ)]dθ. 

Therefore  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
r � (θ) sin(θ) + r(θ) cos(θ) 
. 
r � (θ) cos(θ) − r(θ) sin(θ)

2.  Tangent  lines  for  polar  curves.  Although  the  formula  above  is  perfectly  correct,  it  is  a  bit 
long  to  remember.  There  is  a  slightly  diﬀerent  packaging  that  is much  easier  to  remember.  Deﬁne 
α  to  be  the  angle  from  the  horizontal  ray  emanating  from  (x(θ), y(θ))  in  the  positive  x­direction, 
and the tangent line.  To be precise, there are two such angles, diﬀering by π .  The deﬁning equation 
for  α  is, 

tan(α) = 

dy
. 
dx 

And,  of  course, 

tan(θ) = 

y
. 
x 

Deﬁne  ψ  to  be  the  diﬀerence  between  α  and  θ , 
ψ = α − θ . 

The  angle  addition/subtraction  formulas  for  tan(θ)  are, 
tan(φ1 ) + tan(φ2 ) 
,  tan(φ1  − φ1 ) = 
1 − tan(φ1 ) tan(φ2 ) 

tan(φ1  + φ2 ) = 

tan(φ1 ) − tan(φ2 ) 
. 
1 + tan(φ1 ) tan(φ2 )

Therefore, 

tan(ψ) = tan(α − θ) = 

tan(α) − tan(θ) 
. 
1 + tan(α) tan(θ) 
Substituting  in  the  equations  for  tan(θ)  and  tan(α)  from  above  gives, 
(dy/dx) − (y/x) 
. 
1 + (y/x)(dy/dx) 

tan(ψ) = 

To  simplify  this,  imagine  multiplying  both  numerator  and  denominator  by  xdx  and  manipulate 
formally, 
xdy − ydx
. 
xdx + ydy 
The  actual  justiﬁcation  of  this  is  a  little  more  involved,  but  the  formal  manipulation  leads  to  the 
correct  equation. 

tan(ψ) = 

To  compute  the  denominator  in  the  expression,  diﬀerentiate  both  sides  of, 

to  get,

r  = x  + y , 

2rdr = 2xdx + 2ydy , 

or  equivalently, 

xdx + ydy = r(θ)r � (θ)dθ. 
To  compute  the  numerator  in  the  expression,  diﬀerentiate  both  sides  of, 

tan(θ) =

(xdy − ydx). 

Cancelling  sec2 (θ)  and multiplying  both  sides  by  r2  gives, 
xdy − ydx = r 2dθ. 

Thus  the  fraction  for  tan(ψ)  is, 

tan(ψ) = 

xdy − ydx 
xdx + ydy

Simplifying  gives, 

tan(ψ) =  r(θ)/r � (θ)  . 

Example.  Consider  the  cardioid,  discussed  in  recitation, 

r(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)). 

Jason  Starr

The  formula  for  ψ  is, 

1 + cos(θ)
a(1 + cos(θ)) 
r
tan(ψ) = = 
− sin(θ) 
−a sin(θ) 
r � 
To  simplify  this,  write  θ = 2(θ/2)  and  use  the  double­angle  formulas  to  get, 
1 + (cos2 (θ/2) − sin2 (θ/2)) 
1 + cos(2(θ/2)) 
. 
−2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) 
− sin(2(θ/2)) 
Replacing  1 − sin2 (θ/2)  in  the  numerator  by  cos2 (θ/2),  this  simplﬁes  to, 

= 

. 

= 

2 cos2 (θ/2) 
−2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) 

= − cot(θ/2). 

Of  course  there  is  an  identity, 

− cot(u) = tan(u − π/2). 

Altogether,  this  gives, 

Therefore, 

tan(ψ) = − cot(θ/2) = tan(θ/2 − π/2). 

ψ = 

(θ − π)/2. 

Since  α  equals  θ + ψ ,  this  gives, 

(3θ − π)/2. 
α = 
In  particular,  the  angle  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  cardioid  at  θ = π/2  is  α = π/4.

3.  Arc  length  in  polar  coordinates.  As  discussed  previously,  the  formula  for  arc  length  of  a 
parametric  curve  is, 
ds = (dx/dt)2  + (dy/dt)2dt. 
In  the  case  of  a  parametric  curve,  this  becomes  a  bit  simpler.  The  diﬀerentials  are, 
dx = (r � (θ) cos(θ) − r(θ) sin(θ))dθ, 
dy = (r � (θ) sin(θ) + r(θ) cos(θ))dθ. 

Squaring  gives, 

(dx)2  = ((r � )2 cos2 (θ) − 2rr �  sin(θ) cos(θ) + r2  sin2 (θ))(dθ)2 , 
(dy)2  = ((r � )2  sin2 (θ) + 2rr �  sin(θ) cos(θ) + r2 cos2 (θ))(dθ)2 .

Summing  down  columns  gives, 

(dx)2  + (dy)2  = [(r � )2  + r  ](dθ)2 .

ds =  � 
Taking  square  roots  gives  the  diﬀerential  element  of  arc  length  for  a  polar  curve, 
[r � (θ)]2  + [r(θ)]2dθ . 

Example.  For  the  cardioid, 

the  derivative  is, 

Thus, 

r(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)), 

r � (θ) = −a sin(θ). 

(r � )2  + r  = a  (1 + cos(θ))2  + (−a sin(θ))2  = a  (1 + 2 cos(θ) + cos 2 (θ)) + a 2  sin2 (θ).

This  simpliﬁes  to, 

2a 2 (1 + cos(θ)). 

To  simplify  this  further,  write  θ = 2(θ/2)  and  use  the  double­angle  formula  to  get, 
2a  (1 + cos(2(θ/2))) = 2a  (1 + cos 2 (θ/2) − sin2 (θ/2)) = 2a  (2 cos 2 (θ/2)) = 4a  cos  (θ/2).

Taking  square  roots  gives,

Note,  this  answer  is  only  correct  for  −π  ≤  θ  ≤  π .  Outside  this  range,  we  might  have  to  take  the

�  θ=π 
other  square  root  to  get  a  positive  number.  In  particular,  the  total  arc  length  of  the  cardioid  is, 
θ=−π

Simplifying,  the  total  arc  length  of  the  cardioid  is, 

s =  8a. 

Surface  areas  of  surfaces  of  revolution  can  be  computed  in  a  similar  way.  This  was  only  brieﬂy

discussed  in  lecture.  Here  is  a  continuation  of  the  previous  problem.


Example.  The  top  half  of  the  cardioid,

r(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)),  0 ≤ θ ≤ π , 

is  revolved  about  the  x­axis  to  give  a  fairly  good  approximation  of  the  surface  of  an  apple.  What 
is  the  surface  area  of  this  apple?

Since  we  are  revolving  about  the  x­axis,  the  radius  of  each  slice  is  y .  Therefore  the  diﬀerential 
element  of  surface  area  is, 

dA = 2πyds. 
Substituting  in  y = r(θ) sin(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)) sin(θ),  and  substituting  in  for  ds  gives, 

dA = 2π [a(1 + cos(θ)) sin(θ)](2a cos(θ/2)dθ). 

To  simplify  this,  substitute  both, 

and, 

to  get, 

1 + cos(θ) = 2 cos 2 (θ/2), 

sin(θ) = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), 

Thus  the  total  surface  area  is, 

dA = 4πa 2 (2 cos 2 (θ/2))(2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) cos(θ/2)dθ = 16πa 2 cos  (θ/2) sin(θ/2)dθ.

5.  Area  of  a  region  enclosed  by  a  polar  curve.  What is the area of the planar region enclosed 
by a cardioid?  By the same sort of reasoning as for volumes and arc lengths, the diﬀerential element 
of  area  of  the  triangular  region  bounded  by  the  rays  θ ,  θ + dθ  and  the  curve  r(θ)  is, 

dA =
