1.  Average  values.  Given  a  function  f (x)  deﬁned  on  some  interval  [a, b],  what  is  the  average 
value  of  f (x)?  A  reasonable  ﬁrst  approximation  is  to  choose  a  ﬁnite  collection  of  points  from  [a, b] 
and  compute  the  average  value  over  those  points.  Break  [a, b]  into  a  union  of  n  subintervals  of 
(b − a)/n.

Example.  Under  ideal  conditions,  a  wire­producing  machine  produces  wire  of  uniform  radius  r0 . 
Because of  small vibrations  in  the machine,  the actual  radius of  the wire varies as a  function of  the 
length, 

r(x) = r0  + A cos(ωx). 
The  quantity  A  is much  smaller  than  r0 .  What  is  the  average  radius  of  the  wire? 
Because  the  variation  is  periodic,  the  average  value  over  any  number  of  periods  equals  the  average 
value  of  one  period.  In  other  words,  compute  the  average  for  the  interval  0  ≤  x  ≤  2π/ω .  The 
�  2π/ω 
length  of  this  interval  is  2π/ω .  Thus  the  average  value  is, 
1 
(2π/ω)  0 
Using  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus,  this  equals, 
1 
(r0x + (A/ω) sin(ωx)|0 
2π/ω 
(2π/ω) 

r0  + A cos(ωx)dx. 

Average = 

. 

This  evaluates  to, 

1 
r0 (2π/ω) = r0 . 
(2π/ω) 
Thus,  although  the  radius  varies  and  does  not  usually  equal  its  ideal  value  r0 ,  the  average  value  is 
indeed, 

Average =  r0 . 

2.  Average  values:  non­uniform  distribution.  It  often  happens  that  the  average  value  of  f (x)  is 
desired  in  a  situation  where  the  values  f (x)  are  not  all  uniformly  likely.  Typically,  the  probability 
that  x  has  value  in  the  range  from  x0  to  x0  + Δx  is  approximately, 
Prob(x0  ≤ x ≤ x0  + Δx) ≈ ρ(x0 )Δx,

ρ(x)dx. 

ρ(x)dx = 1. 

for some nonnegative continuous function ρ(x).  The function ρ(x) is called a probability distribution. 
Assuming this approximation becomes arbitrarily good as the length Δx approaches zero, the exact 
� 
probability  that  x  has  value  in  the  range  x0  to  x1  is, 
Prob(x0  ≤ x ≤ x1 ) = 
x0 
�  b 
In  particular,  because  x must  take  value  somewhere  in  the  interval  [a, b],  the  total  probability  is  1. 
In  other  words, 
a 
This  is  called  the  normalization  condition. 
The  average  value  is  computed  as  before.  But  this  time,  each  value  y ∗  = f (x∗ 
k )  is  weighted  by  the 
k 
approximate  probability  that  x  takes  value  in  the  k th  interval,  ρ(x∗ 
� 
k )Δx.  This  gives, 
n
f (xk )∗ρ(xk )∗Δx. 
k=1 
�  b 
In  the  limit  as  n  goes  to ∞,  this  gives  the  exact  average, 
a 
It must  be  noted,  the  probability  distribution  ρ(x)  often  does  not  satisfy  the  normalization  condi­

tion.  In  this  case,  the  formula  above  is  wrong.  But  it  is  easily  correct, 
a  ρ(x)dx).
Example.  A  particle  is  ﬁred  through  a  slit  and  strikes  a  screen  on  the  other  side.  Measuring  the 
position on the screen so that the origin is the closest point on the screen to the slit, the probability 
distribution  is  empirically  observed  to  be, 
ρ(x) = C e−x2 /2σ2 
, 

Average ≈ 

Average = 

f (x)ρ(x)dx. 

Average = 

where  σ  is  a  constant  determining  the  “width”  of  the  probability  distribution,  and  C  is  an  unde­

termined  normalization  constant.  What  is  the  average  distance  of  the  particle  from  the  center  of 

the  screen?  Assume  the  particle  lies  in  an  interval  [−R, R],  where  R  is  very  large.

Remark.  This diﬀers from the formula given in lecture, which was C e−x2 /2σ  for a particular choice

of  σ .  The  formula  given  here  is more  “standard”.  I  apologize  for  any  confusion.

2C σ2  (e  −R2 /2Σ2  = 2C σ 2 (1 − e−R2 /2Σ2

As  R  becomes  large,  the  quantity  e−R2 /2Σ2  becomes  vanishingly  small.  Thus,  in  the  limit  as  R 
tends  to ∞,  the  numerator  equals,  �  R

where,

The  solution  is  that  C  = C1/σ .  Plugging  this  into  the  formula  above,  the  average  distance  is,

3.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolution:  the  shell method.  An alternative to the disk and washer 
method  is  the  shell  method.  A  shel l  is  the  region  between  2  cylinders  of  the  same  height.  If  the 
average  radius of  the  cylinders  is  r ,  if  the width of  the  region  is w  and  if  the height of  the  cylinders 
is  h,  then  the  approximate  volume  of  the  shell  is, 
Volume ≈= Circumference × height × width = 2πrhw. 

Take  the  plane  region  bounded  by  x =  a,  x =  b,  the  x­axis  and  the  curve  y  =  f (x).  Revolve  this 
region  about  the  y ­axis.  (Please  note:  In  the  disk  and  washer  method,  the  region  was  revolved 
about  the  x­axis.)  To  compute  the  corresponding  volume,  approximate  the  region  obtained  from 
x  to  x + dx  as  a  shell.  The  radius  of  the  shell  is  x.  The  height  of  the  shell  is  y = f (x).  The  width 
of  the  shell  is  dx.  Therefore  the  diﬀerential  element  of  volume  is, 
dV  = (2πx)(f (x))dx.

Integrating  gives  the  volume,

Example.  The  dog  dish  revisited.  The  main  part  of  a  dog  dish  is  a  solid  of  revolution  whose 
radial  cross­section  is  a  triangle  of  height  H  whose  base  has  inner  radius  Ri  and  outer  radius  Ro . 
Find  the  volume  of material  used  to make  the  dog  dish. 
The volume was computed using  the washer method.  This  time  it will be computed using  the  shell 
method.  The  triangular  region  is  the  union  of  two  regions.  The  ﬁrst  region  is  bounded  by  x = Ri , 
x = (Ri  + Ro )/2,  the  x­axis,  and  the  line  segment,

Notice  how  similar  are  the  integrals  for  V1  and  V2 .  They  have  the  same  fraction  in  front  of  the 
integral,  and  they  have  the  same  limits  of  integration.  Thus,  the  sum  of  the  2  volumes  is,

This  is  precisely  the  same  answer  as  computed  using  the  washer  method.  Please  observe  though, 
how  much  more  eﬀort  was  required  for  the  shell  method.  The  lesson  is,  if  you  have  an  alternative 
between the disk method and the shell method, consider carefully which method requires  less eﬀort 
before  committing  to  one  or  the  other.
