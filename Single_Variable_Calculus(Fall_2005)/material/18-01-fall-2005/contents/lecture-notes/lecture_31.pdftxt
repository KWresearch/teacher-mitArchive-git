1.  Power  series.  Given  a  real  number  a  and  a  sequence  of  real  numbers  (cn )n≥0 ,  there  is  an

associated  expression,  called  a  power  series  about  x = a, 
∞
cn (x − a)n  = c0  + c1 (x − a) + c2 (x − a)2  + . . . 
n=0 

For  every  choice  of  a  real  number  x,  the  power  series  gives  a  usual  series.  In  particular,  for  the 
choice  x = a,  the  series  has  only  1  nonzero  term,  thus  converges  to  c0 . 
Question.  Given a power series,  for which real numbers x does the corresponding series absolutely 
converge? 

Examples.  1.  Consider  the  power  series,

2.  Consider  the  power  series, 

Of  course  this  converges  to  0  for  x  =  0.  But  for  any  x  other  than  0,  the  sequence  nnxn  = (nx)n 
diverges.  Therefore  the  series  does  not  converge.  In  other  words,  the  series  converges  only  for 
x = 0.

This  is  a  geometric  series.  From  the  last  lecture,  the  series  converges  absolutely  for  |x|  <  1  and 
diverges  if  x ≥ 1.

The  ratio  of  the  nth  and  (n + 1)st  terms  in  the  series  is, 

(x n+1/(n + 1)!)/(x  /n!) = 
n

x 
. 
n + 1 
For  ﬁxed  x,  as  n  grows,  this  sequence  of  ratios  converges  to  0,  which  is  less  than  1.  Therefore,  by 
the  ratio  test,  for  every  choice  of  x  the  series  converges. 
�
These  3  examples  illustrate  the  whole  range  of  possibilities. 
∞  cn (x − a)n  be  a  power  series  about  x = a.  Exactly  one  of  the  following  hold. 
Theorem.  Let 
n=0 
(i)  For  every  x  diﬀerent  from  a,  the  series  does  not  converge  absolutely. 
(ii)  There  exists  a  real  number  R  such  that  the  series  converges  absolutely  if  x − a <  R  and
|
|
does  not  converge  absolutely  if  x − a > R.
|
| 
(iii)  For  every  real  number  x,  the  series  converges  absolutely. 

The  real  number  R  occuring  in  Case  (ii)  is  called  the  radius  of  convergence.  By  convention,  in 
Case  (i)  the  radius  of  convergence  is  deﬁned  to  be  R  =  0.  By  convention,  in  Case  (iii)  the  radius 
of  convergence  is  deﬁned  to  be  R = ∞.  This  allows  us  to  replace  the  original  question  by  a  more 
precise  question. 
Question.  Given  a  power  series,  what  is  the  radius  of  convergence? 
� 
Although  there  is no  single  answer  to  this  question,  in many  interesting  cases  the  ratio  or  root  test 
gives  an  answer. 
cn (x − a)n  is  positive, 
2.  Analytic  functions.  If  the  radius  of  convergence R  of  a  power  series 
then  the  power  series  deﬁnes  a  function  on  the  interval  (a − R, a + R), 
� 
∞
cn (x − a)n . 
n=0 
A  function  deﬁned  in  this  manner  is  called  an  analytic  function.  This  is  the  real  signiﬁcance  of 
power  series:  they  give  important  examples  of  functions  that  cannot  be  described  in  a more  direct 
manner.  Analytic  functions  have  nice  analytic  properties  (whence  the  name).  For  instance,  it  is  a 
theorem  (proved  in  18.100)  that an  analytic  function  f (x)  is diﬀerentiable  and  the derivative has  a

We  can  iterate  the  theorem,  i.e.,  f � (x)  is  diﬀerentiable  and  f �� (x)  has  a  power  series  converging 
absolutely  with  radius  R.  Iterating  k  times,  the  function  f (x)  is  k ­times  diﬀerentiable  and  its  k th

In  particular,  every  derivative  of  f (x)  is  deﬁned.  A  function  with  this  property  is  called  inﬁnitely 
diﬀerentiable  or  smooth.  Thus,  every  analytic  function  is  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable. 

This  is  only  1  of  many  useful  properties  of  analytic  functions.  Which  functions  f (x)  are  analytic 
functions?  By  the  last  paragraph,  if  f (x)  is  analytic,  then  it  is  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable.  Are  there 
other  restrictions?  Can  more  than  1  power  series  about  x  =  a  give  rise  to  the  same  analytic 
function? 
� 
To  answer  both  of  these  questions,  consider  the  analytic  function  deﬁned  by  a  power  series, 
∞
cn (x − a)n . 
n=0 

f (x) = 

Plugging  in  x = a  gives  the  equation, 
f (a) = c0  + c1 (a − a) + c2 (a − a)2 
Thus  the  ﬁrst  coeﬃcient  of  the  power  series  is  simply, 

+ · · · 

= c0  + 0 + 0 + · · · = c0 .

c0  = f (a). 

Moreover,  from  the  power  series  for  the  k th  derivative, 
f (k) (a) = k !ck  + (k + 1)!/1!ck+1 (a − a) + (k + 2)!/2!ck+2 (a − a)2 
Solving  for  ck ,  the  k th  coeﬃcient  of  the  power  series  is, 

ck  =  f (k) (a)/k !. 
Therefore,  the  power  series  deﬁning  f (x)  is, � f (n) (a)
∞
f (x) = 
n! 
n=0 

(x − a)n . 

+ · · · 

= k !ck  + 0 + 0 + · · · = k !ck .

In  particular,  this  series  is  unique.  This  answers  the  second  question.  Two  absolutely  convergent 
power  series  about  x  =  a  give  the  same  analytic  function  if  and  only  if  the  power  series  are 
themselves  equal  (i.e.,  the  corresponding  coeﬃcients  of  the  2  series  are  equal). 
Moreover,  this  gives  us  alot  of  information  about  the  ﬁrst  question.  For  an  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable 
�∞ 
function  f (x)  deﬁned  at  a  point  x  =  a,  there  is  a  very  important  power  series,  the  Taylor  series 
expansion  of  f (x)  about  x = a, 
n!  (x − a)n . 
f (n) (a) 
n=0 
If  f (x)  is  analytic,  then  the  Taylor  series  converges  absolutely  to  f (x).  This  reduces  the  original 
question  to  2  new  questions.  Does  the  Taylor  series  have  a  positive  radius  of  convergence?  If  so, 
does  the  analytic  function  deﬁned  in  this  way  equal  the  original  function  f (x)?

The radius of convergence question is precisely the radius of convergence question posed earlier.  As 
there,  the  answer  can  often  be  found  by  using  the  ratio  or  root  tests.  The  second  question  is  yes 
in  every  practical  case.  There  are  examples  of  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable  functions  where  the  Taylor 
series has a positive radius of convergence, but does not converge to the original function.  However, 
every example is somewhat contrived;  they rarely come up “in nature”.  Just for completeness, here

3.  Algorithm  for  computing  Taylor  series.  The  method  for  ﬁnding  the  Taylor  series  of 
a  function  is  always  the  same.  For  deﬁniteness,  consider  the  Taylor  series  expansion  of  f (x) = 
(1 − x)−1  about  the  point  x = 0. 
Step  1.  Compute  all  derivatives  of  f (x).  If  this  sounds  like  alot  of  work,  it  is!  In  most 
examples,  this really comes down to ﬁnding an  inductive  formula  for the derivatives of f (x).  In the 
example,  the  “zeroth  derivative”  is, 

The  ﬁrst  derivative  is, 

The  second  derivative  is, 

f (x) =  (1 − x)−1 . 

f � (x) = −(1 − x)−2 (−1) =  (1 − x)−2 . 

f �� (x) = (−2)(1 − x)−3 (−1) =  (1 − x)−3 . 

This  begins  to  suggest  a  pattern:  The  k th  derivative  of  f (x)  will  be, 
f (k) (x) = bk (1 − x)−k−1 , 

for some real number bk .  Having made this guess, it is easy to verify by induction.  By computation, 
the  result  is  true  for  k = 0, 1  and  2 with  the  corresponding  real  numbers  b0  = 1,  b1  = 1  and  b2  = 2. 
By  way  of  induction,  assume  the  result  is  true  for  k = n,  i.e., 
f (n) (x) = cn (1 − x)−n−1 . 

Then  the  (n + 1)st  derivative  is, 
f (n+1) (x) = (f (n) (x))�  = (cn (1 − x)−n−1 )�  = cn (−n − 1)(1 − x)−n−2 (−1) = (n + 1)cn (1 − x)−n−2 . 

Thus  the  result  is  also  true  for  k = n + 1  where  cn+1  satisﬁes  the  equation, 

cn+1  = (n + 1)cn .

Thus  the  result  is  proved  by  induction  on  k . 

In  fact, more  has  been  accomplished,  since  now  there  is  an  inductive  formula  for  the  numbers  cn , 
3·2·
cn  = ncn−1  = n(n−1)cn−2  = n(n−1)(n−2)cn−3  =
· · · = n(n−1)(n−2)·· · ··3c2  = n(n−1)(n−2)·· · ··
1.

This  number  has  come  up  before  in  this  class.  It  is  the  nth  factorial  number, 

cn  = n!. 

This  gives  the  ﬁnal  formula  for  the  nth  derivative  of  f (x), 
n!(1 − x)−n−1 . 

f (n) (x) = 

Step 2.  Substitute x = a into the derivatives.  Compared to the work of ﬁnding the derivatives, 
this  is  very  simple.  In  the  example,  plugging  in  x = 0  gives, 

f (n) (0) =  n!. 

Step  3.  Compute  the  coeﬃcients  of  the  Taylor  series.  By  deﬁnition,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  of 
the  Taylor  series  is, 

In  the  example,  this  gives  the  coeﬃcient, 

cn  = 

f (n) (a) 
. 
n! 

cn  =

n! 
n! 

= 

1, 

for  every  integer  n ≥ 0. 
Step  4.  Write  the  Taylor  series.  This  is  really getting  into  the “mind­numbing details”.  In  the 
example,  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  x = 0  is, 
(1 − x)−1  =  �∞ 
n=0 xn . 
Step  5.  If  possible,  ﬁnd  the  radius  of  convergence.  In  the  example,  the  Taylor  series  is 
simply the geometric series.  By the previous lecture, the geometric series converges absolutely with 
radius R = 1.  Moreover, it converges absolutely to (1 − x)−1 .  Notice, this gives another explanation 
for  the  radius  R =  1.  Since  (1 − x)−1  has  a  vertical  asymptote  at  x =  1,  the  Taylor  series  cannot 
converge on any  interval  that contains x = 1.  The  largest  interval centered at x = 0 not containing 
x = 1  is  the  interval  (−1, 1).  This  interval  has  radius  R = 1. 
4.  More  examples.  What  is  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  a  point  x  =  a 
diﬀerent  from  x  =  1?  The  fortunate  fact  is  that  Step  1  allows  to  compute  the  derivatives  f (n) (a)

for  any  a = 1,  not  just x = 0.  This  is  the  typical  case,  and  it  is  one  justiﬁcation  for doing  the work 
necessary  in  Step  1.  In  this  case,  the  answer  is, 
f (n) (a) =  n!(1 − a)−n−1 . 

Therefore,  according  the  Step  3,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  in  the  Taylor  series  expansion  is, 
n!(1 − a)−n−1 
(1 − a)−n−1 . 
= 
cn  =
n! 
Thus,  according  to  Step  4,  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  x = a  is, 
(1 − x)−1  =  �∞ 
n=0 (1 − a)−n−1 (x − a)n . 
What  is  the  radius  of  convergence?  The  ratio  of  the  (n + 1)st  and  nth  terms  of  the  series  is, 
]/[(1 − a)−n−1 (x − a)n ] = (1 − a)−1 (x − a). 
[(1 − a)−n−2
(x − a)n+1
This is independent of n.  Thus, this constant sequence converges to its constant value (1 − a)−1 (x − 
a).  By  the  ratio  test,  the  sequence  is  absolutely  convergent  if  and  only  if  this  limit  has  absolute 
value  less  than  1, 
(1 − a)−1 (x − a) ≤ 1.
| 
|
Rearranging,  the  series  converges  if  and  only  if, 
x − a
|
| ≤ |

1 − a
|
.

Thus  the  radius  of  convergence  is, 

|1 − a|. 
R = 
This  is  perfectly  reasonable.  The  function  (1 − x)−1  has  a  vertical  asymptote  at  x = 1.  Therefore, 
the  power  series  cannot  converge  on  any  interval  containing  x  =  1.  The  largest  interval  centered 
at  x  =  a  not  containing  x  =  1  has  radius  equal  to  the  distance  from  x  =  a  to  x  =  1,  namely 
R = 1 − a . 
|
|
Example  2.  For  the  next  example,  consider  the Taylor  series  expansion  for  f (x) = ex  near  x = 0. 
In  this  case,  Step  1  is  simple.  Every  derivative  of  f (x)  is  simply, 

Therefore,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  of  the  Taylor  series  expansion  is, 

f (n) (x) =  ex .

Observe  this  is  the  power  series  considered  earlier  in  the  lecture,  whose  radius  of  convergence  is

This  equation  is  sometimes  taken  as  the  deﬁnition  of  e .  It  has  certain  advantages  to  our  original 
deﬁnition  of  ex .  Importantly,  it  is  easy  for  a  computer  to determine  ex  to  very high precision using 
this  formula. 
Example  3.  Having  computed  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x =  0,  the  next  question 
is  to  compute  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x = a.  According  to  the  formula, 

and  thus  the  coeﬃcient  is,

On  the  other  hand,  we  didn’t  need  to  do  any  extra  work  to  see  this.  We  could  have  used  the

Example  3.  Consider  the  function  f (x) = sin(x).  The  derivatives  of  f (x)  are,


sin(x), 
cos(x), 
− sin(x), 
− cos(x), 
f (n) (x) 

f (x) 
= 
f � (x)  = 
f �� (x)

⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩

nonnegative  integer  l.  Then  the  rules  above  give, 
n = 4l, 
sin(x) 
cos(x)  n = 4l + 1, 
− sin(x)  n = 4l + 2,

− cos(x)  n = 4l + 3

⎧ ⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎩

Thus,  all  the  even  coeﬃcients  of  the  Taylor  series  are  0.  For  an  odd  coeﬃcient,  say  n  = 2m + 1, 
the  derivative  is, 
f (2m+1) (0) = (−1)m . 

n = 4l, 
n = 4l + 1, 
n = 4l + 2, 
n = 4l + 3

In  particular,  plugging  in  x = 0  gives,


f (n) (x) =

[(−1)m+1 x

This  sequence  converges  to 0.  Therefore, by  the  ratio  test,  the power  series  converges absolutely  to

Notice,  we  didn’t  really  need  to  do  this  work.  Since  cos(x)  is  the  derivative  of  sin(x),  the  Taylor

To  compute  the  Taylor  series  expansions  of  sin(x)  and  cos(x)  about  a  point  x =  a,  we  can  follow 
the  procedure  above.  However,  it  is much  faster  to  use  the  angle  addition  formulas, 
sin(x) = sin(a + (x − a)) = cos(a) sin(x − a) + sin(a) cos(x − a), 
cos(x) = cos(a + (x − a)) = cos(a) cos(x − a) − sin(a) sin(x − a).
