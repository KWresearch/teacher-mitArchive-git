1.  Linear  approximations.  For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f (x),  the  linear  approximation  or 
linearization  of  f (x)  at  x = a  is  the  linear  function, 
f (a) + f � (a)(x − a). 

In  a  precise  sense,  this  is  the  best  approximation  of  f (x)  by  a  linear  function  near  x  =  a.  For  x 
close  to  a,  the  value  of  f (x)  is  close  to  the  value  of  the  linearization.  The  notation  for  this  is, 
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  for  x ≈ a. 

Example.  The  linearization  of, 
f (x) = e−3x  sin(2πx) + 5e−3x cos(2πx), 

near  x = 0  is, 

f (x) ≈ 5 − (15 − 2π)x  for  x ≈ 0.

In  particular,  for  x = 0.02,  this  gives  the  approximate  answer, 
f (0.02) ≈ 5 − (15 − 2π)(0.02) ≈  4.8. 

The  actual  value  is  approximately  4.71.

2.  Basic approximations.  Some linear approximations occur so often, they should be committed 
to memory.  Each  of  the  following  is  the  linear  approximation  for x ≈ 0,  together with  the  terms  in 
the  quadratic  and  higher  approximations.

3.  Combining  basic  approximations.  The  basic  approximations  can  be  combined  to  get  new 
linear  approximations. 
(i) The  linear  approximation  of  f (x)  for  x ≈ a  can  be  converted  to  a  linear  approximation  at  0  by 
setting  g(u) = f (a + u).  In  symbols,

This  is  equivalent  to  the  formula,

(ii) The  linear  approximation  of  f (cx)  for x ≈ a  is  obtained  from  the  linear  approximation  of  f (u) 
for  u ≈ ca  by  substituting  u = cx, 
f (cx) ≈ f (ca

f � (ca)(cx − ca).

(iii)  The  linear  approximation  of  cf (x)  for  x  ≈  a  is  c  times  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x)  for 
x ≈ a, 
cf (x) ≈ cf (a
cf � (a)(x − a)  .
) + 
This  is  diﬀerent  than  the  previous  rule.  Also,  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x) + g(x)  for  x ≈ a  is 
the  sum  of  the  linear  approximations  of  f (x)  and  g(x), 
(f  + g)(x) ≈ f (a
f � (a
) + 
) + (
g(a

g � (a))(x − a).
) + 

Together,  these  two  rules  are  equivalent  to  the  formulas,

(iv)  The  linear  approximation  of  f (x)g(x)  for  x ≈  a  is  the  product  of  the  linear  approximations, 
disregarding  all  quadratic  terms, 
f (x)g(x) ≈ (f (a) + f � (a)(x − a))(g(a) + g � (a)(x − a)), 

which  simpliﬁes  to, 

f (x)g(x) ≈ f (a)g(a
) + (

f (a)g � (a))(x − a).
f � (a)g(a

This  is  equivalent  to  Leibniz’s  rule, 

(f (x)g(x)) =

(v)  The  linear  approximation  of  f (x)/g(x)  for  x ≈ a  is  the  quotient  of  the  linear  approximations, 
using  the  linear  approximation  1/(1 − x) ≈ 1 + x,

(vi)  The  linear  approximation  of  g(f (x))  for  x  ≈  a  is  obtained  from  the  linear  approximation  of 
g(u)  for  u ≈ f (a)  by  substituting  in  for  u  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x)  for  x ≈ a  and  ignoring 
quadratic  terms, 
u = f (x) ≈ f (a) + f � (a)(x − a), 
g(f (x)) = g(u) ≈ g(f (a)) + g � (f (a))(u − f (a)) ≈ g(f (a)) + g � (f (a))((f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)) − f (a)). 
This  simplifes  to, 

g(f (x)) ≈ g(f (a
g � (f (a))f � (a)(x − a).

Together,  these  6  rules  account  for  all  the  general  rules we  have  regarding  diﬀerentiation.  So  every 
rule  of  diﬀerentiation  has  an  equivalent  formulation  in  terms  of  linear  approximations. 

Example.  Using  the  rules,  the  linear  approximation  for, 
f (x) = e−3x  sin(2πx) + 5e−3x cos(2πx), 

for  x ≈ 0  is  given  by, 

which  simpliﬁes  to, 

(1 + (−3x))(2πx) + 5(1 + (−3x))(1) = 2πx + 5 − 15x, 

f (x) ≈ 5 −  − 2π)x.

4.  Quadratic  approximations.  Sometimes  the  linear  approximation  is  not  good  enough.  One 
example  is  the  linear  approximation  of  cos(x)  as  1  for  x  ≈  0.  The  linear  approximation  gives  no 
idea whether  cos(x)  is greater  than 1,  less  than 1,  concave up,  concave down,  etc.  This  is  remedied 
by  the  quadratic  approximation, 
f � (a)(x − a
f (x) ≈ f (a
) + 
) + 

2 f �� (a)(x − a)2  for  x ≈ a.

Each  of  the  basic  approximations  has  an  analogous  quadratic  approximation.  Each  of  the  rules  for 
combining  linear  approximations  has  an  analogous  rule  for  quadratic  approximations. 

5.  The  mean  value  theorem.  This  was  discussed  only  very  brieﬂy.  If  a  function  f (x)  is 
diﬀerentiable on  the  interval having a and  b as  endpoints,  then  there  is a point  c  strictly between a 
and  b  so  that  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  y = f (x)  at  x = c  equals  the  slope  of  the  secant  line 
to  y = f (x)  containing  (a, f (a))  and  (b, f (b)), 

f � (c) = 

f (b) − f (a) 
. 
b − a

This  is  sometimes  useful  for  bounding  f (b) − f (a),  if  a  bound  on  the  derivative  of  f (x)  is  known.
