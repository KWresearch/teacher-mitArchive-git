1.  Velocity.	 Displacement  is  s(t).  Increment  from  t0  to  t0  + Δt  is, 
Δs = s(t0  + Δt) − s(t0 ). 
Average  velocity  from  t0  to  t0  + Δt  is, 

Δs
Δt 
Velocity,  or  instantaneous  velocity,  at  t0  is, 

vave  =

s(t0  + Δt) − s(t0 )

s(t0  + Δt) − s(t0 )

This  is  a  derivative,  v(t)  equals  s� (t) = ds/dt.  The  derivative  of  velocity  is  acceleration, 
v(t0  + Δt) − v(t0 ) 
.

Example.  For  s(t) = −5t2  + 20t,  ﬁrst  computed  velocity  at  t = 1  is, 
v(1) =  lim  10 − 5Δt =  10.

Then  computed  velocity  at  t = t0  is, 

v(t0 ) =  lim

−10t0  + 10 − 5Δt =  −10t0  + 20. 

Finally,  computed  acceleration  at  t = t0  is, 

a(t0 ) =  lim 
Δt→
0 

−10 =  −10. 

2.  Derivative.  Let  y  =  f (x)  be  a  dependent  variable  depending  on  an  independent  variable  x, 
varying  freely.  The  increment  of  y  from  x0  to  x0  + Δx  is, 
Δy = f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 ).

The  diﬀerence  quotient  or  average  rate­of­change  of  y  from  x0  to  x0  + Δx  is,

3.  Examples  in  science  and  math. 

(i)  Economics.	 Marginal  cost  is  the  derivative  of  cost  with  respect  to  some  other  variable,  for 
instance,  the  quantity  purchased. 

(ii)  Thermodynamics.  The  ideal  gas  law  relating  pressure  p,  volume  V ,  and  temperature  T  of  a 
gas  is,


Under  isothermal  conditions,  T  is  a  constant  T0  so  that, 

pV  = nRT .


p(V ) = 

nRT
0 
V 

. 

Under  adiabatic  conditions  (i.e.,  no  transfer  of  heat),  pV γ  is  a  constant  K .  Using  this  to 
eliminate  p  gives, 

T (V ) =  K 
1 
V γ−1 . 
nR 
As this illustrates, the independent variable, dependent variable and constants in an equation 
very much  depend  on  the  problem  to  be  solved. 

(iii)  Biology.  Exponential  population  growth models  the  population N (t)  after  t  years  as, 

N (t) = N0e rt , 

where  ex  is  the  exponential  function, N0  is  initial  population,  and  r  is  a  growth  factor.  Later 
we will  see, N � (t) = rN (t),  i.e.,  the  population  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  size  of  the 
population. 

(iv)  Geometry.	 The  volume  of  a  right  circular  cone  is,


1

V  =  A × h. 
3 

where A  is  the base area of  the  cone and h  is  the height of  the  cone.  The  radius  r  of  the base 
is  proportional  to  the  height, 

r(h) = ch,

for  some  constant  c.  Since  A = πr2 ,  this  gives, 
π 
V (h) =  c 2h3 .

The  derivative  is, 

A.

This  is  very  reasonable.  In  some  sense,  this  explains  the  classical  formula  for  the  volume  of 

a  cone.
