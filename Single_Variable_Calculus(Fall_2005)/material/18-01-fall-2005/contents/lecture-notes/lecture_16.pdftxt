1.  Dummy  variables.  Give  a Riemann  integrable  function  f (x)  deﬁned  on  an  interval  [a, b],  the 
notation, 
a 
is shorthand  for the Riemann  integral of f (x) over this  interval.  In particular,  this equals the  limit, 
b − a
lim  f (a + (b − a)k/n) 
n→∞ 
n
Observe,  the  variable  x  does  not  appear  in  this  limit.  It  is  very  convenient  to  include  the  variable 
x  in  the  notation  for  the Riemann  integral;  for  how  else  are we  to  express  the  function  integrated? 
But,  since  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral  does  not  involve  x,  x  is  really  a  dummy  variable.

This  convention  reduces  the  likelihood  of  an  error. 

2.  Variable  limits  of  integration.  The  Riemann  integral  is  often  used  to  deﬁne  functions, 
particularly  antiderivatives  having  no  simpler  expression. 
Example.  For every angle 0 ≤ θ < π/2, deﬁne f (θ) to be the area above the x­axis,  inside the unit 
� 
circle  x2  + y = 1,  and  bounded  by  the  vertical  lines, − cos(θ) ≤ x ≤ cos(θ).  This  is  an  integral, 
2
√
− cos(θ) 

1 − x2dx. 

f (θ) = 

cos(θ) 

The  problem  is  to  describe  the  rate­of­change  of  f ,  df /dθ . 

The  integral  f (θ)  is  beyond  our  current  techniques  of  integration  (though  soon  we  will  have  tech­
niques to solve  it).  The  simplest solution  is  indirect.  Here, ﬁrst,  is the direct solution.  The  integral 
f (θ)  equals  the  area  of  2  triangles  and  a  circular  sector.  By  high­school  geometry,  the  area  is,

sin(2θ). 

f (θ) =

Using  standard  rules  of  diﬀerentiation,  the  derivative  is, 

= −1 + cos(2θ). 

df 
dθ 

Notice,  by  the  double­angle  formula  for  cosine,  this  equals, 
−1 + cos(2θ) =  −
2 sin

2 (θ).

The hardest step (hidden here) was the geometric computation of f (θ).  However, this is completely 
� 
unnecessary.  Introduce  a  function,

1 − x2dx. 

G(t) =

Using  symmetry  through  the  y ­axis,  f (θ)  equals, 

f (θ) = 2G(cos(θ)). 

By  the  chain  rule,

This  gives,

The  second  method  is  indirect.  The  function  G(t)  has  no  simple  expression.  Nonetheless,  this 
method  is  faster.  In many  cases  this  is  the  only method  that  works. 
The argument above using the chain rule and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is quite general. 
It  gives  the  general  equation,  � v(x) 
u(x)  f (t)dt = f (v(x))v � (x) − f (u(x))u� (x).

3.  Geometric  area  and  algebraic  area.  The  Riemann  integral  is  the  algebraic  area, 
a 

f (x)dx =  Area  above  the  x­axis  −  Area  below  the  x­axis  . 

The  geometric  area  is  the  total  area,  both  above  and  below  the  x­axis.  Although  geometric  area 
�  b 
does  not  equal  algebraic  area,  it  has  a  simple  expression  using  the  Riemann  integral, 
a 

Geometric  area  = 

f (x)|dx.
|

Example.  Find  both  the  algebraic  area  and  the  geometric  area  bounded  by  the  x­axis  and  the 
graph  of  y = sin(x)  over  the  interval −π < x < π . 
Because  sin(x)  is  an  odd  function,  the  area  below  the  x­axis  for −π < x < 0  equals  the  area  above 
the x­axis  for 0 < x < π .  In the expression  for the algebraic area,  these areas cancel to give 0.  This 
�  π 
is  borne  out  by  computation, 
sin(x)dx = (− cos(x) π  = − cos(π) + cos(−π) = −(−1) + (−1) = 0.
|−π 
−π 
|  � 
On  the  other  hand,  the  absolute  value  sin(x)|  equals, 
− sin(x),  −π < x ≤ 0, 
| sin(x)| = 
sin(x), 
0 < x < π . 
Thus  the  geometric  area  equals,  � 0 
� π 
−π − sin(x)dx + 
sin(x)dx = 
0 
|
|
(cos(x) −π  + (− cos(x) π  = (1 − (−1)) + (−(−1) + 1) = 
0
0
Thus  the  geometric  area does not  equal  the  algebraic  area.  But  computation  of  the  geometric  area 
reduces  to  a  straightforward  Riemann  integral.

5.  Change  of  variables.  After  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus,  the  most  useful  integral

rule  is  the  change  of  variables  rule.  The  rule  for  Riemann  integrals  is  nearly  the  same  as  the  rule

It  is  only  fair  to  note  there  is  a  second  method.  Make  the  same  substitution  to  simplify  the 
antiderivative  of  tan(x)  to − ln(|� 
u|) + C ,  and  then  back­substitute  to  get, 

tan(x)dx = − ln( cos(x) ) + C.

Now  use  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  with  the  original  limits  of  integration.  Both 
methods  are  correct.  Usually  the  ﬁrst  method  is  faster  and  less  error­prone;  it  requires  no  back­
substitution. 
6.  Integrating  backwards.  This  comes  so  naturally  for  most  calculus  students,  it  barely  warrants 
mention.  Technically,  the  Riemann  integral, �  b

f (x)dx,

Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  is  the  following,

Because of  the  central  role of  the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,  the above  equation  is  true by 
convention.  With  this  convention,  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  holds  whenever  a  is  less 
than  b,  equal  to  b,  or  greater  than  b.
