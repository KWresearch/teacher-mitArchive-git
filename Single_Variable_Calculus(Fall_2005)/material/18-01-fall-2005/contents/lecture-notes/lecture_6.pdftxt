1.  Trigonometric  functions.  What  is  angle ?  For  a  sector  of  a  unit  circle  (a  circle  of  radius 
1),  the  angle  of  the  sector  equals  both  the  length  of  the  arc  of  the  sector  and  1/2  the  area  of  the 
sector.  Although we have  as yet  general  deﬁnitions  of neither  arc  length nor area,  this  can be used 
to  give  a  rigorous  deﬁnition  of  angle.  We  can  divide  any  sector  in  two  equal  pieces:  simply  bisect 
the  chord  of  the  sector.  We  also  know  how  to  add  two  angles,  by  laying  the  sectors  in  adjacent 
positions.  Denoting  the area of a unit  circle by  the  symbol π  (which happens  to be  the  familiar π), 
these 2 operations produce every angle of the  form mπ/2n , with m and n  integers.  Every angle can

be  approximated  arbitrarily  well  by  such  angles.  Thus,  for  every  continuous  function  of  an  angle, 
every  value  of  the  function  can  be  computed. 

The  basic  functions  are  sin(θ),  cos(θ),  tan(θ),  sec(θ),  csc(θ)  and  cot(θ).  Full  descriptions  of  these 
are  in  §9.1  of  the  textbook  by  Simmons.  The  same  information  is  contained  in  the  webpage  on 
Trigonometry  produced  by MathWorld,  part  of Wolfram  Research. 

2.  Trigonometric  identities.  For  today,  the  most  important  identities  are  the  angle  addition 
formulas, 

sin(α + β ) = 

sin(α

β ),

β ).

cos(α + β ) = 

cos(α

Other  important  identities  are, 
(i)  cos(−θ)  equals  cos(θ),  i.e.,  cos(θ)  is  an  even  function, 
(ii)  sin(−θ)  equals − sin(θ),  i.e.,  sin(θ)  is  an  odd  function, 

(iii)  sin(θ + π/2)  equals  cos(θ), 
(iv)  cos(θ + π/2)  equals − sin(θ),  and 

(v)  sin2 (θ) + cos2 (θ)  equals  1  for  every  θ . 

3.  Some  trigonometric  limits.	 In computing  trigonometric  limits,  the  following  limit  is crucial, 

sin(θ)
1. 
lim

→
θ 
0 
θ
As  explained  in  class,  this  is  essentially  the  statement  that as  θ → 0,  the quotient of  the arc  length 
by  the  chord  length  tends  to  1.  This  was  not  proved  in  lecture,  nor  is  it  proved  in  your  textbook 
in  §2.1  (despite  the author’s  claim).  However,  it  is geometrically  reasonable.  And,  of  course,  it  can 
be  proved. 

This  limit  implies  another  limit, 

cos(θ) − 1 
θ 

lim

0. 

To  see  this,  rewrite  the  term  as, 
cos2 (θ) − 1 
cos(θ) − 1 cos(θ) + 1 
. 
θ · (cos(θ) + 1) 
θ 
cos(θ) + 1 
By  Identity  (v),  cos2 (θ) − 1  equals − sin2 (θ),  so  the  term  equals, 
− sin2 (θ) 
θ · (cos(θ) + 1)

As  θ → 0,  this  limit  tends  to, 

By  a  similar  computation,

4.  Derivatives  of  sin(x)  and  cos(x).  To  compute  the  derivative  of  y  =  sin(x)  at  x =  a,  use  the 
angle  addition  formulas  to  write, 

sin(a + h) = sin(a) cos(h) + cos(a) sin(h). 

This  gives, 

sin(a + h) − sin(a) = sin(a)(cos(h) − 1) + cos(a) sin(h). 
Thus  the  diﬀerence  quotient  equals, 
sin(a + h) − sin(a) 
h 

sin(h)
+ cos(a) 
h 

. 

= sin(a)

cos(h) − 1 
h

Taking  the  limit  gives, 
sin(a + h) − sin(a) 
h 

lim 
h→0 

= sin( ) lim 
a
h→0 

cos(h) − 1

+ cos( ) lim

sin(h)

h


Using  the  limits  from  above,  this  gives, 
sin� (a) = sin(a) × 0 + cos(a) × 1 = cos(a). 

Thus  the  derivative  of  sin(x)  equals, 

d sin(x) 
dx 

= 

cos(x). 

An  entirely  similar  computation  gives, 
cos(a + h) − cos(a) 
h 

= cos(a)

cos(h) − 1 − sin(a)
h

sin(h)

which  leads  to,

= cos(a) × 0 − sin(a) × 1.


Thus  the  derivative  of  cos(x)  equals, 

d cos(x) 
dx 

− sin(x).

5.  Derivatives  of  other  trigonometric  functions.  Using  the  quotient  rule,


d tan(x) 
dx 

= 

1 
(cos(x) × cos(x) − sin(x)(− sin(x))) = 
cos2 (x) 

cos2 (x) + sin2 (x) 
cos2 (x) 

= 

1 
. 
cos2 (x) 

Therefore,  the  derivative  of  tan(x)  equals, 

d tan(x) 
dx 

=  sec2 (x). 

In  a  similar manner, 

and 

d cot(x) 
dx 
d sec(x) 
dx 

=  − csc2 (x), 

=  sec(x) tan(x), 

d csc(x) 
dx 

=  − csc(x) cot(x).
