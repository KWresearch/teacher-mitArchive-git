n! = n × (n − 1) × (n − 2) × · · · × 3 × 2 × 1,

The  Binomial  Theorem  says  that  for  every  positive  integer  n  and  every  pair  of  numbers  a  and  b, 
(a + b)n  equals,

This  is  proved  by  mathematical  induction.  First,  the  result  is  very  easy  when  n  =  1;  it  just  says 
that  (a + b)1  equals  a1  + b1 .  Next,  make  the  induction  hypothesis  that  the  theorem  is  true  for  the 
�

integer  n.  The  goal  is  to  deduce  the  theorem  for  n + 1,

By  the  deﬁnition  of  the  (n + 1)st  power  of  a  number, 
(a + b)n+1  = (a + b) × (a + b)n .

Using  Pascal’s  formula,  this  simpliﬁes  to, 
n+1  an−k bk+1 
n+1  an+1−k bk  +

This  proves  the  theorem  for  n + 1,  assuming  the  theorem  for  n. 
Since  we  proved  the  theorem  for  n  =  1,  and  since  we  also  proved  that  for  each  integer  n,  the 
theorem  for  n  implies  the  theorem  for  n + 1,  the  theorem  holds  for  every  integer. 
3.  The  derivative  of  x .  Let  f (x) = xn  where  n  is  a  positive  integer.  For  every  a  and  every  h, 
n
�  � 
the  binomial  theorem  gives, 
n 
f (a + h) = (a + h)n  = a  + na n−1h + · · · + 
a n−k hk  + · · · + hn . 
n
k
�  � 
Thus,  f (a + h) − f (a)  equals, 
n 
(a + h)n  − a  = na 
n−1h + · · ·
a n−k hk  + · · · + hn .

→ 

Thus  the  diﬀerence  quotient  is, 
f (a + h) − f (a) 
h 

Every  summand  except  the  ﬁrst  is  divisible  by  h.  The  limit  of  such  a  term  as  h 
f (a + h) − f (a) 
= na n−1  + 0 + · · · + 0 = na

0  is  0.  Thus, 

So  f � (x)  equals  nxn−1 . 
3.  Linearity.  For  diﬀerentiable  functions  f (x)  and  g(x)  and  for  constants  b  and  c,  bf (x) + cg(x) 
is  diﬀerentiable  and, 
(bf (x) + cg(x))�  = bf � (x) + cg � (x). 
This  is  often  called  linearity  of  the  derivative. 
4.  The  Leibniz  rule/Product  rule.  For  diﬀerentiable  functions  f (x)  and  g(x),  the  product 
f (x)g(x)  is  diﬀerentiable  and, 

(f (x)g(x))�  = f � (x)g(x) + f (x)g � (x). 

The  crucial  observation  in  proving  this  is  rewriting  the  increment  of  f (x)g(x)  from  a  to  a + h  as, 
f (a+h)g(a+h)−f (a)g(a) = f (a+h)[g(a+h)−g(a)]+f (a+h)g(a)−f (a)g(a) = f (a+h)[g(a+h)−g(a)]+[f (a+h)− 
f (a)]g(a).

5.  The  quotient  rule.  Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be  diﬀerentiable  functions.  If  g(a)  is  nonzero,  the 
quotient  function  f (x)/g(x)  is  deﬁned  and  diﬀerentiable  at  a,  and, 
(f (x)/g(x))�  = [f � (x)g(x) − f (x)g � (x)]/g(x)2 .

One way  to  deduce  this  formula  is  to  set  q(x) = f (x)/g(x)  so  that  f (x) = q(x)g(x),  and  the  apply 
the  Leibniz  formula  to  get, 
f � (x) = q � (x)g(x) + q(x)g � (x) = q � (x)g(x) + f (x)g � (x)/g(x). 
Solving  for  q � (x)  gives, 
q � (x) = [f � (x) − f (x)g � (x)/g(x)]/g(x) = [f � (x)g(x) − f (x)g � (x)]/g(x)2 . 

6.  Another  proof  that  d(xn )/dx  equals  nxn−1 .  This  was  mentioned  only  very  brieﬂy.  The 
product  rule  also  gives  another  induction  proof  that  for  every  positive  integer  n,  d(xn )/dx  equals 
nxn−1 .  For  n =  1,  we  proved  this  by  hand.  Let  n  be  some  speciﬁc  positive  integer,  and  make  the 
induction  hypothesis  that  d(xn )/dx  equals  nxn−1 .  The  goal  is  to  deduce  the  formula  for  n + 1, 

d(xn+1 ) 
dx 

= (n + 1)x n . 

By  the  Leibniz  rule, 

n+1 ) 
d(x

d(x × xn )
dx

= 

d(xn ) 
d(x) 
n 
x  + x 
dx 
dx 

= (1)x n  + x

d(xn )
dx 

. 

By  the  induction  hypothesis,  the  second  term  can  be  replaced, 

d(xn+1 )
dx 

= x  + x(nx n−1 ) = x  + nx n  = (n + 1)x . 
n 
n 
n

Thus  the  formula  for  n  implies  the  formula  for  n + 1.  Therefore,  by  mathematical  induction,  the

formula  holds  for  every  positive  integer  n.
