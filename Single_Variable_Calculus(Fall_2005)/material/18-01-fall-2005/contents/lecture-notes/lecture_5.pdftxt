What  is  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  graph  of  y = f (x)  at  the  point  (x, y) = (1, 1)?

Of  course  (1/x)�  = (x−1 )�  =  −x−2 .  And  by  the  rule  d(un )/dx  =  nun−1 (du/dx),  the  derivative  of 
1/y  is −y−2 (dy/dx).  Thus,

2.  Rules  for  exponentials  and  logarithms.  Let  a  be  a  positive  real  number.  The  basic  rules 
of  exponentials  are  as  follows. 
Rule  1.  If  ab  equals  B  and  a equals  C ,  then  ab+c  equals  B · C ,  i.e., 
c
· 
b+c 
c 
b
a  = a  a .

Rule  2.  If  ab  equals  B  and  B d  equals D,  then  abd  equals D ,  i.e., 

b )d 
bd
(a  = a . 

If  ab  equals  B ,  the  logarithm  with  base  a  of  B  is  deﬁned  to  be  b.  This  is  written  loga (B ) = b.  The 
function B →  loga (B )  is  deﬁned  for  all  positive  real  numbers B .  Using  this  deﬁnition,  the  rules  of 
exponentiation  become  rules  of  logarithms.

Rule  1.  If  loga (B )  equals  b  and  loga (C )  equals  c,  then  loga (B · C )  equals  b + c,  i.e., 
loga (B · C ) = loga (B ) + loga (C ). 

Rule  2.  If  loga (B )  equals  b  and  B d  equals D ,  then  loga (D)  equals  d loga (B ),  i.e., 

loga (B d ) = d loga (B ). 

Rule  3.  Since  logB (D)  equals  d,  an  equivalent  formulation  is  loga (D)  equals  loga (B ) logB (D),  i.e., 

loga (D) = loga (B ) logB (D). 

3.  The  derivative  of  ax .  Let  a  be  a  positive  real  number.  What  is  the  derivative  of  ax?  Denote 
the  derivative  of  ax  at  x = 0  by  L(a).  It  equals  the  value  of  the  limit, 
a − 1 
h 
. 
h

L(a) =  lim 
→
h 0 

Then  for  every  x0 ,  the  derivative  of  ax  at  x0  equals, 
ax0+h  − ax0 
h

lim 
→
h 0 

. 

x0 ah

By  Rule  1,  ax0+h  equals  a

.  Thus  the  limit  factors  as, 
− ax0 
ax0 ah 
h 
Therefore,  for  every  x,  the  derivative  of  ax  is,


lim 
→
h 0 

= a x0  lim a h  − 1h.

= L(a)a x . 

What  is  L(a)?  To  ﬁgure  this  out,  consider  how  L(a)  changes  as  a  changes.  First  of  all,

(ab )h  − 1 
. 
h

L(a b ) =  lim 
→
h 0 

By  Rule  2,  (ab )h  equals  abh .  So  the  limit  is,


L(a b ) =  lim 
→
h 0

→
h 0 

Now,  inside the limit, make the substitution that k  equals bh.  As h approaches 0, also k  approaches 
0.  So  the  limit  is,

L(a b ) = b lim

This  is  very  similar  to  Rule  2  for  logarithms.

Choose  a  number  a0  bigger  than  1,  say  a0  =  2.  Then  for  every  positive  real  number  a,  a  = 
where  b = loga0 (a).  Thus, 

b
a0 

b ) = bL(a0 ) = L(a0 ) loga0 (a). 
L(a) = L(a0

So, with a0  ﬁxed and a allowed to vary, L(a) is just the logarithm function loga0 (a) scaled by L(a0 ). 
Looking  at  the  graph  of  (a0 )x ,  it  is  geometrically  clear  that  L(a0 )  is  positive  (though  we  have  not 
proved  that  L(a0 )  is  even  deﬁned).  Thus  the  graph  of  L(a)  looks  qualitatively  like  the  graph  of 
loga0 (a).  In  particular,  for  a  less  than  1,  L(a)  is  negative.  The  value  L(1)  equals  0.  And  L(a) 
approaches  +∞  and  a  increases.  Therefore,  there  must  be  a  number  where  L  takes  the  value  1. 
By  long  tradition,  this  number  is  called  e; 

e − 1 
h 
L(e) =  lim 
→
h 0  h

= 1. 

This  is  the  deﬁnition  of  e.  It  sheds  very  little  light  on  the  decimal  value  of  e. 

Because  e  is  so  important,  the  logarithm  with  base  e  is  given  a  special  name:  the  natural  loga­
rithm.  It  is  denote  by, 

ln(a) = loge (a). 

So,  ﬁnally,  L(a)  equals, 

L(a) = loge (a)L(e) = ln(a)(1) = ln(a). 
x
This  leads  to  the  formula  for  the  derivative  of  a , 

d(ax ) 
dx 

= 

ln(a)ax . 

In  particular, 

d(ex ) 
dx 
In  fact,  ex  is  characterized  by  the  property  above  and  the  property  that  e0  equals  1. 
4.  The  derivative  of  loga (x)  and  the  value  of  e.  By  the  chain  rule, 

x = e . 

For  u = loga (x),  au  equals  x.  Thus, 

Thus, 

d(au ) 
dx 

du 
= ln(a)a u 
.

d(au )

Solving  gives, 

d loga (x)

In  particular,  for  a = e,  this  gives,

ln(a) au 

= 

1/(ln(a)x)  . 

d ln(x) 
dx 

= 

1/x  . 

What  is the derivative of  ln(x) at x = 1?  On the one hand,  since the derivative of  ln(x) equals 1/x, 
the  derivative  at  x = 1  is  1/1 = 1.  On  the  other  hand,  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative  gives, 
ln(1 + h) − ln(1) 
. 
h

lim 
→
h 0 

Of  course,  ln(1)  equals  0,  so  this  simpliﬁes  to, 

Using  Rule  2  for  logarithms,  this  gives, 

1 
lim 
h 0  h→

ln(1 + h). 

lim ln((1 + h)1/h ). 
h 0→

Since  ln(y)  is  continuous,  the  limit  equals, 

ln[ lim (1 + h)1/h ]. 
h 0→

So  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  inner  limit  equals  1.  But  e  is  the  unique  number  whose  natural 
logarithm  equals  1.  This  leads  to  the  formula, 

e =  lim (1 + h)1/h . 
h 0→

Making  the  substitution  n = 1/h  leads  to  the more  familiar  form, 

lim  (1 + 1/n)n  =  e  . 
n→+∞ 

This  can  be  used  to  compute  e  to  arbitrary  accuracy.  The  ﬁrst  few  digits  of  e  are

5.  Logarithmic  diﬀerentiation.  There  is  a  method  of  computing  derivatives  of  products  of 
functions that is often useful.  If y  is a product of n factors, say f1 (x) ·
f2 (x) · · · · ·
fn (x), the derivative 
of  y  can  be  computed  by  the  product  rule.  However,  it  seems  to  be  a  fact  that  multiplication  is 
more  error­prone  than  addition.  Thus  introduce, 
u = ln(y) = ln(f1 (x)) + ln(f2 (x)) + · · · + ln(fn (x)).
