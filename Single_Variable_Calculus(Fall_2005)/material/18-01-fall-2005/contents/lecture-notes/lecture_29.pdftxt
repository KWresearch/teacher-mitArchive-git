1.  A  problem  with  Riemann  integrals.  Riemann  integrals  are  deﬁned  in  very  many  cases. 
�  b 
The result we use most often  is that  for a piecewise continuous  function f (x) on a bounded  interval 
[a, b],  the  Riemann  integral, 
f (x)dx, 
a 
exists  (and  equals  a  ﬁnite  number).  What  if  the  interval  is  unbounded,  e.g.,  [a, ∞)?  Quite  simply, 
the Riemann integral is not deﬁned.  This isn’t a problem with our methods for computing integrals. 
It  is  a  problem  with  the  very  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral.  In  fact,  this  is  only  the  ﬁrst 
of  many  problems  with  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral.  Eventually  these  problems  led

mathematicians  to  develop  a  better  deﬁnition,  the  Lebesgue  integral,  which  is  studied  in  course 
18.103.  Luckily,  the  particular  problem  of  deﬁning  the  integral  on  unbounded  intervals  can  be 
easily  overcome  using  limits  (with  no  need  to  use  the  Lebesgue  integral). 
2.  Improper  integrals  of  the  ﬁrst  kind.  Let f (x) be deﬁned on the  interval  [a, ∞).  If for every 
�

number  t > a  the  function  f (x)  is  Riemann  integrable  on  [a, t],  and  if  the  limit, 
lim 
t→∞

Example.  For  t > 0,  the  integral,

exists  and  equals  sin(t).  Even  though  all  values  sin(t)  are  deﬁned  and  bounded,  the  limit, 

cos(x)dx, 

lim  sin(t), 
t→∞ 
� 
is  not  deﬁned  (essentially  because  it  never  settles  down).  Therefore  the  improper  integral,

is  not  deﬁned.

3.  Improper  integrals  of  the  second  kind.  Here  is  a  second  problem  with  the  Riemann 
integral.  Let  [a, b]  be  a  bounded  interval.  Let  f (x)  be  a  function  that  is  bounded  on  [t, b]  for  every 
�  b 
a < t < b,  but  which  is  unbounded  on  [a, b].  According  to  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral, 
a 
�  b 
is  not  deﬁned.  However,  it may  happen  that  for  every  a < t < b,  the  integral, 
f (x)dx,

is  deﬁned  and  its  value  is,

Example.  Let p be a real number in the range 0 < p < 1.  Because the function 1/xp  is unbounded 
on  [0, 1],  the  Riemann  integral,

is  not  deﬁned.  However,  for  every  0 < t < 1,  the  Riemann  integral,

4.  The  Comparison  Test.  When  is  an  improper  integral  deﬁned?  This  is  equivalent  to  asking 
when a  limit  is deﬁned.  Therefore,  every rule  for convergence of a  limit gives a rule  for convergence 
of  an  improper  integral.  There  are  2  basic  rules  for  convergence  of  a  limit.

exist, and if limx a F (x) equals limx a H (x), then limx a G(x) exists and equals the other 2 limits.

Monotone  bounded  limits. 
If  F (x)  is  monotone  increasing  and  bounded  above  on  [a, b), 
then  limx b−  F (x)  exists.  Similarly,  if  F (x)  is  monotone  decreasing  and  bounded  below,  then 
→
limx b−  F (x)  exists,  if  F (x)  is monotone  increasing  and  bounded  below,  then  limx a+  F (x)  exists, 
→
→
and  if  F (x)  is monotone  decreasing  and  bounded  above,  then  limx a+  F (x)  exists. 
→
These  give  the  following  tests  for  convergence  of  an  improper  integral.
