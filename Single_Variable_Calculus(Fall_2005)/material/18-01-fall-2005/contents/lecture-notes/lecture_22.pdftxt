1.  Surface  area  of  a  right  circular  cone.  Before  attacking  the  general  problem  of  the  surface
area of a surface of revolution,  consider the simplest case of the area of a right circular cone of base
radius  R  and  height  H .  The  slant  height  of  the  cone  is  the  length  of  any  line  segment  from  the
vertex  to  a  point  on  the  base  circle.  By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  the  slant  height  S  is, 
√

S  = 

R2  + H 2 . 

Imagine  the  cone  is  made  of  paper.  Make  an  incision  along  a  line  segment  from  the  vertex  to  the
base circle.  The resulting piece of paper may be unfolded to  form a sector of a circle.  The radius of
the  sector  is  the  slant height  s.  The  circumference  of  the  sector  is  the  circumference  of  the  original
base  circle  2πr .  The  formula  for  the  area  and  circumference  of  a  sector  of  a  circle  give  the  identity,

1 
Area  of  sector =  (Radius  of  sector) × (Circumference  of  sector). 
2 

Thus,   the  area  of  the  cone  equals,

A = (S )(2πR) =

In particular,
  the  height H  is  involved  only  indirectly  (as H  depends  on H ). 
Next, consider a conical  band  obtained from a right circular cone of base radius R1  and slant height 
S1  by  removing  the  the  top  part  of  the  cone  of  base  radius  R2  and  slant  height  S2 .  In  particular, 
the  slant  height  of  the  band  is  the  diﬀerence, 

s = S2  − S1 , 

 

18.01  Calculus

and  the  average  radius  of  the  band  is  the  average  of  R1  and  R2 , 

By  similar  triangles, 

1 
r = (R1  + R2 ). 
2 

S2 = 
S1 
. 
R1  R2 

Rearranging  gives, 

R2S1  = R1S2 . 
Using  the  formula  above,  the  area  of  the  large  cone  is, 

and  the  area  of  the  small  cone  is, 

A1  = πR1S1 , 

A2  = πR2S2 . 

The  area  A  of  the  band  is  the  diﬀerence, 
A = A1  − A2  = π(R1S1  − R2S2 ). 

Since R2S1  equals R1S2 ,  the  formula  is unchanged by adding πR2S1  and  subtracting πR1S2  to get, 
A = π(R1S1  − R2S2 ) + π(R2S1  − R1S2 ) = π((R1  + R2 )S1  − (R1  + R2 )S2 ). 
Simplifying  and  substituting  R1  + R2  = 2r  and  S1  − S2  = 2  gives, 

A =  2

2.  Surface  area  of  a  surface  of  revolution.  Given  a  segment  of  a  parametric  curve, 

x  =  x(t), 
y  =  y(t) 

a ≤ t ≤ b 

the surface  of  revolution  is the surface obtained by revolving the segment through xyz ­space about 
the  y ­axis.  What  is  the  area  of  this  surface?  The  answer  is  called  the  surface  area. 

The method  for  computing  the  surface  area  is  so  close  to  the method  for  computing  the  arc  length 
of  the  curve,  the  details  will  be  skipped.  What  is  relevant  is  the  diﬀerential  element  of  surface 
area.  Given a  small  interval  from  t  to  t + dt,  approximate  the  segment of  the parametric  curve as a 
line  segment.  The  surface  obtained  by  revolving  a  line  segment  is  precisely  a  band  of  a  cone.  The 
�� dx 
average  radius  of  the  cone  r  is  x(t).  The  slant  height  of  the  cone  is  ds.  Thus  the  area  of  the  band

and  the  diﬀerential  arc  length  of  the  line  segment  is,

Revolving  about  the  y ­axis  gives  the  sphere  of  radius  R.  Thus  the  surface  area  of  the  surface  of 
revolution  is  the  surface  area  of  the  sphere  of  radius  R. 
As  computed  in  the  previous  lecture,  the  diﬀerential  element  of  arc  length  is, 

Thus  the  diﬀerential  element  of  surface  area  is, 

ds = Rdθ . 

Integrating  gives, 

dA = 2πrds = 2πx(θ)(Rdθ) = 2π(R cos(θ))(Rdθ) = 2πR2 cos(θ)dθ.

The  fastest way  to  remember  this  is  to  observe  the  surface  area A  and  the  volume V  of  a  sphere  of

Integrating,  the  surface  area  is, 

dA = 2πrds = 2πx(t)ds = 2π(a cos  (t))(3a sin(t) cos(t))dt = 6πa 2 cos  (t) sin(t)dt.

3.  Polar  coordinate  curves.  After  the  explicit, Cartesian  form  of  a  curve  as  a  graph,  y = f (x),

the  next  most  common  representation  is  using  polar  coordinates.  Given  a  function  r  =  r(θ)  and

� 
an  interval  a ≤ θ ≤ b,  the  associated  polar  coordinate  curve  is  the  parametric  curve, 
a ≤ θ ≤ b. 
x  =  r(θ) cos(θ), 
y  =  r(θ) sin(θ) 
� 
� 
For  each  point  on  the  curve,  the  distance  of  the  point  from  the  origin  is, 
√
+r,  r ≥ 0, 
| | 
−r, 
r2  =  r = 
x2  + y 2  = 
r < 0
�

Also, assuming the point does not equal the origin, the angle of the ray from the origin to the point 

is, 

Distance  from  origin = 

Angle = tan−1 (y/x) = tan−1 (tan(θ)) = 

θ , 
r > 0, 
θ + π ,  r < 0 

This  is  one  of  the most  confusing  aspects  of polar  curves.  The  symbols  r(θ)  and  θ  are  engrained  in 
mathematical  thinking  as  the  distance  and  angle  of  a  point  in  polar  coordinates.  But  for  a  polar 
coordinate  curve  these  are  simply  parameters.  They  are  very  closely  related  to,  but  often  diﬀerent 
from,  the actual distance and angle.  This  is easiest to think about by  imagining the point swerving 
through  the  origin  along  the  radius  line  to  the  opposite  ray  of  the  ray  given  by  θ .  In  other  words, 
the  point  “goes  negative”. 

Given a polar curve, it is often possible to ﬁnd an implicit Cartesian curve containg the polar curve. 

Examples.  A.  Let  a  be  a  positive  constant  and  consider  the  polar  curve, 

r(θ) = a. 

This  gives, 

r  = a  ⇔ 
2 
x2  + y 2  = a2 . 
2
Thus  the  polar  curve  is  contained  in  the  circle  of  radius  a. 

B.  Consider  the  polar  curve, 

r(θ) = 

a 
. 
sin(θ) 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  sin(θ)  gives, 
r sin(θ) = a ⇔  y = a. 

Thus  the  polar  curve  is  contained  in  the  horizontal  line  passing  through  (0, a).

C.  Consider  the  polar  curve, 

r = 2a cos(θ), 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  r  gives, 
r 2  = 2ar cos(θ) ⇔ x  + y 2  = 2ax. 
2 

Simplifying  this  gives  the  equation, 

(x − a)2  + y 2  = a2 . 

This  is  the  equation  of  the  circle  of  radius  a  centered  at  (a, 0). 

4.  Sketching  polar  curves.  Given  a  polar  curve,  how  are  we  to  sketch  it?  For  deﬁniteness, 
consider  the  polar  curve, 
r(θ) = cos(2θ),  −π/4 ≤ θ ≤ 7π/4. 
This  curves  is  called  the  four­leaved  rose.  A  similar  curve  occurs  in  Part  II,  Problem  2  of  Problem 
Set  6. 

1.  Find  the  range  of  θ.  In  almost  every  case,  this  will  be  given.  In  this  case,  the  range  is  given 
as  −π/4 ≤  θ  ≤  7π/4.  In  some  cases,  the  range  must  be  determined.  For  instance,  to  sketch  only 
the  “leaf ”  of  the  rose  containing  (1, 0),  ﬁrst  the  endpoints  of  this  leaf must  be  found. 

2.  Determine  when  r  is  positive,  zero  or  negative.  This  is  easiest  to  keep  track  of  with  a 
table. 

θ 
−π/4 
−π/4 < θ < π/4 
π/4 
π/4 < θ < 3π/4 
3π/4 
3π/4 < θ < 5π/4 
5π/4 
5π/4 < θ < 7π/4 

r 
0 
r > 0 
0 
r < 0 
0 
r > 0 
0 
r < 0 

The curve crosses the origin when θ = −π/4, π/4, 3π/4, and 5π/4.  The curve “goes negative” when 
π/4 < θ < 3π/4  and  when  5π/4 < θ < 7π/4. 
3.  Find  the  extremal  values  of  |r|.  A  local maximum  of  r is  either  a  point where  r  is  positive  and 
| |
a  local  maximum  or  a  point  where  r  is  negative  and  a  local  minimum.  Similarly  for  local  minima 
of  |r|.  Typically,  local maxima  of  r occur  either  at  endpoints  of  the  interval  or  points where  r � (θ)
| |
is  zero  (occasionally  at  discontinuity  points,  or  nondiﬀerentiable  points).  Local  minima  occur  at 
such  points,  but  also  occur  everytime  the  curve  crosses  the  origin  (so  that  |r|  equals  0). 

 

18.01  Calculus

In  our  example,  the  local minima  are  all  points  where  r = 0,  enumerated  above.  The  derivative  of 
r  is, 
r � (θ) = −2 sin(2θ). 
The  critical  points  are  θ  = 0, π/2, π  and  3π/2.  For  θ  =  0  and  θ  =  π ,  r  is  positive  and  maximum. 
For θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/3, r  is negative and minimum.  Thus each critical point is a local maximum 
of  |r|.  The  value  of  r at  each  critical  point  is  1. 
| | 
4.  Find  the  asymptotes.  This  is  a  bit  diﬃcult  with  a  polar  curve.  What  is  easier  is  to  ﬁnd  a  line 
parallel  to  an  asymptote.  Whenever, 

lim r(θ) = +∞, 
θ→a 

(or  the  same  with  a  right­hand  limit  or  left­hand  limit),  there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  ray 
θ = a.  Whenever, 
lim r(θ) = −∞, 
θ→a 
there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  ray  θ = a + π . 
In  our  example,  r(θ)  never  limits  to  ±∞.  Thus  there  are  no  asymptotes.  But  in  Example  B., 
r  =  a/ sin(θ),  r  tends  to  +∞  as  θ  tends  to  0  from  above  and  as  θ  tends  to  π  from  below.  Thus 
there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  x­axis.  Since  the  explicit  equation  is  y  =  a,  which  is  a  line 
parallel  to  the  x­axis,  this  is  correct. 

5.  Find  the  tangent  direction  at  important  points.  This  will  be  discussed  further  next  time.  The 
most  important  tangent  directions  are  when  the  curve  crosses  the  origin,  and  critical  points  of  r . 
If  r(θ) =  0  and  r � (θ) =  0,  the  tangent  line  of  the  curve  has  angle  θ .  If  r � (θ) =  0  and  r(θ) =  0,  the 
tangent  line  has  angle  θ ± π/2,  i.e.,  the  tangent  line  is  orthogonal  to  the  radius  through  the  point. 
Both  of  these  are  consequences  of  a  more  general  formula.  The  angle  ψ  between  the  tangent  line 
and  the  radius  satisﬁes, 

r(θ)
. 
r � (θ) 
In  the  example,  r �  is  nonzero  whenever  r  is  zero.  Thus  the  tangent  direction  of  the  curve  as  it 
crosses  the  origin  is  just  the  direction  of  the  limiting  radius. 

tan(ψ) = 

This  is  now  ample  information  to  sketch  the  four­leaved  rose.  Up  to  a  rotation  of  π/4,  the  sketch 
is  the  same  as  in  Figure  16.11  on  p.  566  of  the  textbook  (the  sketch  was  also  given  in  lecture).
