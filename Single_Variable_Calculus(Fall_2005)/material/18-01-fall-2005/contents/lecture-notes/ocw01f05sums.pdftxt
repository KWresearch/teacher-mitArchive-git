1.  Velocity.	 Displacement  is  s(t).  Increment  from  t0  to  t0  + Δt  is, 
Δs = s(t0  + Δt) − s(t0 ). 
Average  velocity  from  t0  to  t0  + Δt  is,

This  is  a  derivative,  v(t)  equals  s� (t) = ds/dt.  The  derivative  of  velocity  is  acceleration,

Example.  For  s(t) = −5t2  + 20t,  ﬁrst  computed  velocity  at  t = 1  is,

Then  computed  velocity  at  t = t0  is,

−10 =  −10. 

2.  Derivative.  Let  y  =  f (x)  be  a  dependent  variable  depending  on  an  independent  variable  x, 
varying  freely.  The  increment  of  y  from  x0  to  x0  + Δx  is, 
Δy = f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 ).

3.  Examples  in  science  and  math. 

(i)  Economics. 	 Marginal  cost  is  the  derivative  of  cost  with  respect  to  some  other  variable,  for 
instance,  the  quantity  purchased. 

(ii)  Thermodynamics.  The  ideal  gas  law  relating  pressure  p,  volume  V ,  and  temperature  T  of  a 
gas  is,


Under  isothermal  conditions,  T  is  a  constant  T0  so  that, 

pV  = nRT .


p(V ) = 

nRT
0 
V 

. 

Under  adiabatic  conditions  (i.e.,  no  transfer  of  heat),  pV γ  is  a  constant  K .  Using  this  to 
eliminate  p  gives, 

T (V ) =  K 
1 
V γ−1 . 
nR 
As this illustrates, the independent variable, dependent variable and constants in an equation 
very much  depend  on  the  problem  to  be  solved. 

(iii)  Biology.  Exponential  population  growth models  the  population N (t)  after  t  years  as, 

N (t) = N0e rt , 

where  ex  is  the  exponential  function, N0  is  initial  population,  and  r  is  a  growth  factor.  Later 
we will  see, N � (t) = rN (t),  i.e.,  the  population  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  size  of  the 
population. 

(iv)  Geometry.	 The  volume  of  a  right  circular  cone  is,


1

V  =  A × h. 
3 

where A  is  the base area of  the  cone and h  is  the height of  the  cone.  The  radius  r  of  the base 
is  proportional  to  the  height, 

r(h) = ch,

for  some  constant  c.  Since  A = πr2 ,  this  gives,

The  derivative  is,

1.  Tangent  lines  to  graphs.  For  y  =  f (x),  the  equation  of  the  secant  line  through 
(x0 , f (x0 ))  and  (x0  + Δx, f (x0  + Δx))  is, 
f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 )
Δx 

(x − x0 ) + f (x0 ). 

y = 

In  the  limit,  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  through  (x0 , f (x0 ))  is, 
y = f � (x0 )(x − x0 ) + y0 . 

Example.  For  the  parabola  y = x2 ,  the  derivative  is, 
y � (x0 ) =  2x0 . 

The  equation  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
y = 2x0 (x − x0 ) =  2x0x − x2 
0 . 

For  instance,  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  through  (2, 4)  is, 
y =  4x − 4. 

2
Given  a  point  (x, y), what  are  all  points  (x0 , x0 )  on  the  parabola whose  tangent  line  contains 
(x, y)?  To  solve,  consider  x  and  y  as  constants  and  solve  for  x0 .  For  instance,  if  (x, y) = 
(1, −3),  this  gives, 
(−3) = 2x0 (1) − x0 , 
2

or, 

2 x0  − 2x0  − 3 = 0.

Factoring (x0 − 3)(x0 + 1),  the solutions are x0  equals −1 and x0  equals 3.  The corresponding 
tangent  lines  are, 
y = −2x − 1, 

and 

y = 6x − 9. 
x0  =  x ± � 
For  general  (x, y),  the  solutions  are, 
x2  − y . 
f (x)
2.  Limits.  Precise deﬁnition is on p.  791 of Appendix A.2.  Intuitive deﬁnition:  limx
→x0 
equals  L  if  and  only  if  all  values  of  f (x)  can  be  made  arbitrarily  close  to  L  by  choosing  x 
suﬃciently close  to x0 .  One  interpretation  is  the “microscope/laser  illuminator” analogy:  An 
observer  focuses  a  microscopes  ﬁeld­of­view  on  a  thin  strip  parallel  to  the  x­axis  centered 
on  y  =  L.  The  goal  of  the  illuminator  is  to  focus  a  laser­beam  centered  on  x0  parallel  to 
the  y ­axis  (but  with  the  line  x  =  x0  deleted)  so  that  only  the  portion  of  the  graph  in  the 
ﬁeld­of­view  is  illuminated.  If  for  every magniﬁcation  of  the microscope,  the  illuminator  can 
succeed,  then  the  limit  is  deﬁned  and  equals  L. 

There  is  a  beautiful  Java  applet  on  the  webpage  of  Daniel  J.  Heath  of  Paciﬁc  Lutheran 
University, 

http://www.plu.edu/~heathdj/java/calc1/Epsilon.html 
If  you  use  this,  try  a = −1. 

For  left­hand  limits,  use  a  laser  that  illuminates  only  to  the  left  of  x0 .  For  right­hand  limits, 
use  a  laser  that  illuminates  only  to  the  right  of  x0 . 

3.  Continuity.  A  function  f (x)  is  continuous  at  x0  if  f (x0 )  is  deﬁned,  limx
f (x)  is 
→x0 
f (x)  equals  f (x0 ).  Also,  f (x)  is  continuous  on  an  interval  if  it  is  contin­
deﬁned,  and  limx
→x0 
uous  at  every  point  of  the  interval.  The  types  of  discontinuity  are:  removable  discontinuity, 
jump  discontinuity,  inﬁnite  discontinuity  and  essential  discontinuity.

This  is  proved  by  mathematical  induction.  First,  the  result  is  very  easy  when  n  =  1;  it  just  says 
that  (a + b)1  equals  a1  + b1 .  Next,  make  the  induction  hypothesis  that  the  theorem  is  true  for  the

Using  Pascal’s  formula,  this  simpliﬁes  to,

This  proves  the  theorem  for  n + 1,  assuming  the  theorem  for  n. 
Since  we  proved  the  theorem  for  n  =  1,  and  since  we  also  proved  that  for  each  integer  n,  the 
theorem  for  n  implies  the  theorem  for  n + 1,  the  theorem  holds  for  every  integer. 
3.  The  derivative  of  x .  Let  f (x) = xn  where  n  is  a  positive  integer.  For  every  a  and  every  h, 
n
�  � 
the  binomial  theorem  gives, 
n 
f (a + h) = (a + h)n  = a  + na n−1h + · · · + 
a n−k hk  + · · · + hn . 
n
k
�  � 
Thus,  f (a + h) − f (a)  equals,

Thus  the  diﬀerence  quotient  is, 
f (a + h) − f (a) 
h 

Every  summand  except  the  ﬁrst  is  divisible  by  h.  The  limit  of  such  a  term  as  h 
f (a + h) − f (a)

0  is  0.  Thus, 

So  f � (x)  equals  nxn−1 . 
3.  Linearity.  For  diﬀerentiable  functions  f (x)  and  g(x)  and  for  constants  b  and  c,  bf (x) + cg(x) 
is  diﬀerentiable  and, 
(bf (x) + cg(x))�  = bf � (x) + cg � (x). 
This  is  often  called  linearity  of  the  derivative. 
4.  The  Leibniz  rule/Product  rule.  For  diﬀerentiable  functions  f (x)  and  g(x),  the  product 
f (x)g(x)  is  diﬀerentiable  and, 

(f (x)g(x))�  = f � (x)g(x) + f (x)g � (x). 

The  crucial  observation  in  proving  this  is  rewriting  the  increment  of  f (x)g(x)  from  a  to  a + h  as, 
f (a+h)g(a+h)−f (a)g(a) = f (a+h)[g(a+h)−g(a)]+f (a+h)g(a)−f (a)g(a) = f (a+h)[g(a+h)−g(a)]+[f (a+h)− 
f (a)]g(a).

5.  The  quotient  rule.  Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be  diﬀerentiable  functions.  If  g(a)  is  nonzero,  the 
quotient  function  f (x)/g(x)  is  deﬁned  and  diﬀerentiable  at  a,  and, 
(f (x)/g(x))�  = [f � (x)g(x) − f (x)g � (x)]/g(x)2 .

One way  to  deduce  this  formula  is  to  set  q(x) = f (x)/g(x)  so  that  f (x) = q(x)g(x),  and  the  apply 
the  Leibniz  formula  to  get, 
f � (x) = q � (x)g(x) + q(x)g � (x) = q � (x)g(x) + f (x)g � (x)/g(x). 
Solving  for  q � (x)  gives, 
q � (x) = [f � (x) − f (x)g � (x)/g(x)]/g(x) = [f � (x)g(x) − f (x)g � (x)]/g(x)2 . 

6.  Another  proof  that  d(xn )/dx  equals  nxn−1 .  This  was  mentioned  only  very  brieﬂy.  The 
product  rule  also  gives  another  induction  proof  that  for  every  positive  integer  n,  d(xn )/dx  equals 
nxn−1 .  For  n =  1,  we  proved  this  by  hand.  Let  n  be  some  speciﬁc  positive  integer,  and  make  the 
induction  hypothesis  that  d(xn )/dx  equals  nxn−1 .  The  goal  is  to  deduce  the  formula  for  n + 1, 

d(xn+1 ) 
dx 

= (n + 1)x n . 

By  the  Leibniz  rule, 

n+1 ) 
d(x

dx

= 

d(xn ) 
d(x) 
n 
x  + x 
dx 
dx 

= (1)x n  + x

d(xn )
dx 

. 

By  the  induction  hypothesis,  the  second  term  can  be  replaced, 

d(xn+1 )
dx 

= x  + x(nx n−1 ) = x  + nx n  = (n + 1)x . 
n 
n 
n

Thus  the  formula  for  n  implies  the  formula  for  n + 1.  Therefore,  by  mathematical  induction,  the

formula  holds  for  every  positive  integer  n.

This  can  be  proved  by  induction  on  n.  For  n  = 1, 2  and  3,  it  was  checked.  Let  n  be  a  particular

4.  The  chain  rule.  Let  y  be  a  function  of  x,  y  =  f (x),  and  let  u  be  a  function  of  y ,  u  =  g(y). 
Then  u  is  a  function  of  x,  u  =  g(f (x)).  This  function  is  a  composite  function,  and  is  denoted 
by, 
(g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)). 
What  is  the  derivative  of  a  composite  function?  The  claim  is  that, 
(g ◦ f )� (x) = g � (f (x)) · f � (x). 

This  is  often  easier  to  remember  in  the  form,

where y0  equals f (x0 ), u0  equals g(y0 ) = g(f (x0 )), Δy  equals f (x0 + Δx) − f (x0 ) = f (x0 + Δx) − y0 , 
and Δu equals g(y0 + Δy) − g(y0 ) = g(f (x0 + Δx)) − g(f (x0 )).  So long as Δy  is nonzero, the fraction 
in  the  limit  is  deﬁned.  And,  as Δx  approaches  0,  also Δy  approaches  0.  Thus  the  limit  breaks  up 
as,

Δx 0  Δx 

= g � (y0 ) · f � (x0 ). 

Δu 
(g ◦ f )� (x0 ) =  lim

Thus  (g ◦ f )� (x0 )  equals  g � (f (x0 ))f � (x0 ). 
Example.  Let  y(x)  equals  1 + x2 ,  and  let  u(y)  equal  1/y  =  y−1 .  Then  y � (x)  =  0 + 2x  = 2x  and

2.  Rules  for  exponentials  and  logarithms.  Let  a  be  a  positive  real  number.  The  basic  rules 
of  exponentials  are  as  follows. 
Rule  1.  If  ab  equals  B  and  a equals  C ,  then  ab+c  equals  B · C ,  i.e., 
c
· 
b+c 
c 
b
a  = a  a .

Rule  2.  If  ab  equals  B  and  B d  equals D,  then  abd  equals D ,  i.e., 

b )d 
bd
(a  = a . 

If  ab  equals  B ,  the  logarithm  with  base  a  of  B  is  deﬁned  to  be  b.  This  is  written  loga (B ) = b.  The 
function B →  loga (B )  is  deﬁned  for  all  positive  real  numbers B .  Using  this  deﬁnition,  the  rules  of 
exponentiation  become  rules  of  logarithms.

Rule  1.  If  loga (B )  equals  b  and  loga (C )  equals  c,  then  loga (B · C )  equals  b + c,  i.e., 
loga (B · C ) = loga (B ) + loga (C ). 

Rule  2.  If  loga (B )  equals  b  and  B d  equals D ,  then  loga (D)  equals  d loga (B ),  i.e., 

loga (B d ) = d loga (B ). 

Rule  3.  Since  logB (D)  equals  d,  an  equivalent  formulation  is  loga (D)  equals  loga (B ) logB (D),  i.e., 

loga (D) = loga (B ) logB (D). 

3.  The  derivative  of  ax .  Let  a  be  a  positive  real  number.  What  is  the  derivative  of  ax?  Denote 
the  derivative  of  ax  at  x = 0  by  L(a).  It  equals  the  value  of  the  limit, 
a − 1 
h 
. 
h

L(a) =  lim

h 0 

Then  for  every  x0 ,  the  derivative  of  ax  at  x0  equals, 
ax0+h  − ax0 
h

lim

h 0 

. 

x0 ah

By  Rule  1,  ax0+h  equals  a

.  Thus  the  limit  factors  as,

Therefore,  for  every  x,  the  derivative  of  ax  is,

h

L(a b ) =  lim

This  is  very  similar  to  Rule  2  for  logarithms.

Choose  a  number  a0  bigger  than  1,  say  a0  =  2.  Then  for  every  positive  real  number  a,  a  = 
where  b = loga0 (a).  Thus, 

b
a0 

b ) = bL(a0 ) = L(a0 ) loga0 (a). 
L(a) = L(a0

So, with a0  ﬁxed and a allowed to vary, L(a) is just the logarithm function loga0 (a) scaled by L(a0 ). 
Looking  at  the  graph  of  (a0 )x ,  it  is  geometrically  clear  that  L(a0 )  is  positive  (though  we  have  not 
proved  that  L(a0 )  is  even  deﬁned).  Thus  the  graph  of  L(a)  looks  qualitatively  like  the  graph  of 
loga0 (a).  In  particular,  for  a  less  than  1,  L(a)  is  negative.  The  value  L(1)  equals  0.  And  L(a) 
approaches  +∞  and  a  increases.  Therefore,  there  must  be  a  number  where  L  takes  the  value  1. 
By  long  tradition,  this  number  is  called  e; 

e − 1 
h 
L(e) =  lim 
→
h 0  h

= 1. 

This  is  the  deﬁnition  of  e.  It  sheds  very  little  light  on  the  decimal  value  of  e. 

Because  e  is  so  important,  the  logarithm  with  base  e  is  given  a  special  name:  the  natural  loga­
rithm.  It  is  denote  by, 

ln(a) = loge (a). 

So,  ﬁnally,  L(a)  equals, 

L(a) = loge (a)L(e) = ln(a)(1) = ln(a). 
x
This  leads  to  the  formula  for  the  derivative  of  a , 

d(ax ) 
dx 

= 

ln(a)ax . 

In  particular, 

d(ex ) 
dx 
In  fact,  ex  is  characterized  by  the  property  above  and  the  property  that  e0  equals  1. 
4.  The  derivative  of  loga (x)  and  the  value  of  e.  By  the  chain  rule, 

x = e . 

For  u = loga (x),  au  equals  x.  Thus, 

Thus, 

d(au )

= ln(a)a u

1/(ln(a)x)  . 

d ln(x) 
dx

1/x  . 

What  is the derivative of  ln(x) at x = 1?  On the one hand,  since the derivative of  ln(x) equals 1/x, 
the  derivative  at  x = 1  is  1/1 = 1.  On  the  other  hand,  the  deﬁnition  of  the  derivative  gives, 
ln(1 + h) − ln(1) 
. 
h

lim 
→
h 0 

Of  course,  ln(1)  equals  0,  so  this  simpliﬁes  to, 

Using  Rule  2  for  logarithms,  this  gives, 

1 
lim 
h 0  h→

ln(1 + h). 

lim ln((1 + h)1/h ). 
h 0→

Since  ln(y)  is  continuous,  the  limit  equals, 

ln[ lim (1 + h)1/h ]. 
h 0→

So  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  inner  limit  equals  1.  But  e  is  the  unique  number  whose  natural 
logarithm  equals  1.  This  leads  to  the  formula, 

e =  lim (1 + h)1/h . 
h 0→

Making  the  substitution  n = 1/h  leads  to  the more  familiar  form, 

lim  (1 + 1/n)n  =  e  . 
n→+∞ 

This  can  be  used  to  compute  e  to  arbitrary  accuracy.  The  ﬁrst  few  digits  of  e  are 
2.718281828459045... 

5.  Logarithmic  diﬀerentiation.  There  is  a  method  of  computing  derivatives  of  products  of 
functions that is often useful.  If y  is a product of n factors, say f1 (x) ·
f2 (x) · · · · ·
fn (x), the derivative 
of  y  can  be  computed  by  the  product  rule.  However,  it  seems  to  be  a  fact  that  multiplication  is 
more  error­prone  than  addition.  Thus  introduce, 
u = ln(y) = ln(f1 (x)) + ln(f2 (x)) + · · · + ln(fn (x)).

1.  Trigonometric  functions.  What  is  angle ?  For  a  sector  of  a  unit  circle  (a  circle  of  radius 
1),  the  angle  of  the  sector  equals  both  the  length  of  the  arc  of  the  sector  and  1/2  the  area  of  the 
sector.  Although we have  as yet  general  deﬁnitions  of neither  arc  length nor area,  this  can be used 
to  give  a  rigorous  deﬁnition  of  angle.  We  can  divide  any  sector  in  two  equal  pieces:  simply  bisect 
the  chord  of  the  sector.  We  also  know  how  to  add  two  angles,  by  laying  the  sectors  in  adjacent 
positions.  Denoting  the area of a unit  circle by  the  symbol π  (which happens  to be  the  familiar π), 
these 2 operations produce every angle of the  form mπ/2n , with m and n  integers.  Every angle can

be  approximated  arbitrarily  well  by  such  angles.  Thus,  for  every  continuous  function  of  an  angle, 
every  value  of  the  function  can  be  computed. 

The  basic  functions  are  sin(θ),  cos(θ),  tan(θ),  sec(θ),  csc(θ)  and  cot(θ).  Full  descriptions  of  these 
are  in  §9.1  of  the  textbook  by  Simmons.  The  same  information  is  contained  in  the  webpage  on 
Trigonometry  produced  by MathWorld,  part  of Wolfram  Research. 

2.  Trigonometric  identities.  For  today,  the  most  important  identities  are  the  angle  addition 
formulas,

Other  important  identities  are, 
(i)  cos(−θ)  equals  cos(θ),  i.e.,  cos(θ)  is  an  even  function, 
(ii)  sin(−θ)  equals − sin(θ),  i.e.,  sin(θ)  is  an  odd  function, 

(iii)  sin(θ + π/2)  equals  cos(θ), 
(iv)  cos(θ + π/2)  equals − sin(θ),  and 

(v)  sin2 (θ) + cos2 (θ)  equals  1  for  every  θ . 

3.  Some  trigonometric  limits.	 In computing  trigonometric  limits,  the  following  limit  is crucial, 

sin(θ)

lim 
=

θ 
0 
θ
As  explained  in  class,  this  is  essentially  the  statement  that as  θ → 0,  the quotient of  the arc  length 
by  the  chord  length  tends  to  1.  This  was  not  proved  in  lecture,  nor  is  it  proved  in  your  textbook 
in  §2.1  (despite  the author’s  claim).  However,  it  is geometrically  reasonable.  And,  of  course,  it  can 
be  proved. 

This  limit  implies  another  limit, 

cos(θ) − 1

To  see  this,  rewrite  the  term  as,

4.  Derivatives  of  sin(x)  and  cos(x).  To  compute  the  derivative  of  y  =  sin(x)  at  x =  a,  use  the 
angle  addition  formulas  to  write, 

sin(a + h) = sin(a) cos(h) + cos(a) sin(h). 

This  gives, 

sin(a + h) − sin(a) = sin(a)(cos(h) − 1) + cos(a) sin(h).

Thus  the  derivative  of  sin(x)  equals, 

d sin(x)

1.  Linear  approximations.  For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f (x),  the  linear  approximation  or 
linearization  of  f (x)  at  x = a  is  the  linear  function,

close  to  a,  the  value  of  f (x)  is  close  to  the  value  of  the  linearization.  The  notation  for  this  is, 
f (x) ≈ f (a) + f � (a)(x − a)  for  x ≈ a. 

Example.  The  linearization  of, 
f (x) = e−3x  sin(2πx) + 5e−3x cos(2πx), 

near  x = 0  is, 

f (x) ≈ 5 − (15 − 2π)x  for  x ≈ 0.

In  particular,  for  x = 0.02,  this  gives  the  approximate  answer, 
f (0.02) ≈ 5 − (15 − 2π)(0.02) ≈  4.8. 

The  actual  value  is  approximately  4.71.

3.  Combining  basic  approximations.  The  basic  approximations  can  be  combined  to  get  new 
linear  approximations. 
(i) The  linear  approximation  of  f (x)  for  x ≈ a  can  be  converted  to  a  linear  approximation  at  0  by

cf (x) ≈ cf (a

This  is  diﬀerent  than  the  previous  rule.  Also,  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x) + g(x)  for  x ≈ a  is 
the  sum  of  the  linear  approximations  of  f (x)  and  g(x), 
(f  + g)(x) ≈ f (a

(vi)  The  linear  approximation  of  g(f (x))  for  x  ≈  a  is  obtained  from  the  linear  approximation  of 
g(u)  for  u ≈ f (a)  by  substituting  in  for  u  the  linear  approximation  of  f (x)  for  x ≈ a  and  ignoring

Together,  these  6  rules  account  for  all  the  general  rules we  have  regarding  diﬀerentiation.  So  every 
rule  of  diﬀerentiation  has  an  equivalent  formulation  in  terms  of  linear  approximations. 

Example.  Using  the  rules,  the  linear  approximation  for, 
f (x) = e−3x  sin(2πx) + 5e−3x cos(2πx), 

for  x ≈ 0  is  given  by, 

which  simpliﬁes  to, 

(1 + (−3x))(2πx) + 5(1 + (−3x))(1) = 2πx + 5 − 15x, 

f (x) ≈ 5 −  − 2π)x.

4.  Quadratic  approximations.  Sometimes  the  linear  approximation  is  not  good  enough.  One 
example  is  the  linear  approximation  of  cos(x)  as  1  for  x  ≈  0.  The  linear  approximation  gives  no 
idea whether  cos(x)  is greater  than 1,  less  than 1,  concave up,  concave down,  etc.  This  is  remedied 
by  the  quadratic  approximation, 
f � (a)(x − a

Each  of  the  basic  approximations  has  an  analogous  quadratic  approximation.  Each  of  the  rules  for 
combining  linear  approximations  has  an  analogous  rule  for  quadratic  approximations. 

5.  The  mean  value  theorem.  This  was  discussed  only  very  brieﬂy.  If  a  function  f (x)  is 
diﬀerentiable on  the  interval having a and  b as  endpoints,  then  there  is a point  c  strictly between a 
and  b  so  that  the  slope  of  the  tangent  line  to  y = f (x)  at  x = c  equals  the  slope  of  the  secant  line 
to  y = f (x)  containing  (a, f (a))  and  (b, f (b)), 

f � (c) =

This  is  sometimes  useful  for  bounding  f (b) − f (a),  if  a  bound  on  the  derivative  of  f (x)  is  known.

1.  Application  of  the  Mean  Value  Theorem.  A  real­world  application  of  the  Mean  Value 
Theorem  is  error  analysis.  A  device  accepts  an  input  signal  x and  returns  an  output  signal  y .  If 
the  input  signal  is  always  in  the  range −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1/2  and  if  the  output  signal  is, 
1 
1 + x + x2  + x3 , 
what  precision  of  the  input  signal  x is  required  to  get  a  precision  of ±10−3  for  the  output  signal? 
If  the  ideal  input  signal  is  x = a,  and  if  the  precision  is  ±h,  then  the  actual  input  signal  is  in  the 
range  a − h ≤ x ≤ a + h.  The  precision  of  the  output  signal  is  f (x) − f (a) .  By  the  Mean  Value 
|
|
Theorem, 
f (x) − f (a) 
= f � (c), 
x − a 
for  some  c between  a and  x.  The  derivative  f � (x)  is, 
−(3x2  + 2x + 1) 
. 
(1 + x + x2  + x3 )2 

f � (x) = 

For −1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1/2,  this  is  bounded  by, 

|f � (x)

| ≤ 

3(1/2)2  + 2(1/2) + 1 
[1 + (−1/2) + (−1/2)2  + (−1/2)3 ]2 

= 7.04.

Thus  the Mean  Value  Theorem  gives, 
f (x) − f (a) =  f � (c

|
|

)||x − a| 

≤ 7.04 x − a ≤ 7.04h.
|
| 

Therefore  a  precision  for  the  input  signal  of, 
h =  10−3/7.04  ≈ 10−4 
guarantees  a  precision  of  10−3  for  the  output  signal. 
2.  First derivative  test.  A function f (x) is increasing, respectively decreasing, if f (a) is less than 
f (b),  resp.  greater  than  f (b),  whenever  a  is  less  than  b.  In  symbols,  f  is  increasing,  respectively 
decreasing,  if 

f (a) < f (b)  whenever  a < b,  resp.  f (a) > f (b)  whenever  a < b.

If  f (a)  is  less  than  or  equal  to  f (b),  resp.  greater  than  or  equal  to  f (b),  whenever  a  is  less  than 
b,  then  f (x)  is  non­decreasing,  resp.  non­increasing.  If  f (x)  is  increasing,  the  graph  rises  to  the 
right.  If  f (x)  is  decreasing,  the  graph  rises  to  the  left. 
If f � (a)  is positive,  the First Derivative  Test  guarantees  that f (x)  is  increasing  for all x suﬃciently 
close  to  a.  If  f � (a)  is  negative,  the  First  Derivative  Test  guarantees  that  f (x)  is  decreasing  for  all 
x suﬃciently  close  to  a. 
Example.  For  the  function  y =  x3  + x − x − 1,  determine  where  y  is  increasing  and  where  y  is 
2
decreasing. 
The  derivative  is, 

y �  = 3x 2  + 2x − 1 = (3x − 1)(x + 1). 
Thus  the  derivative  of  y  changes  sign  only  at  the  points  x = −1  and  x =  1/3.  By  testing  random 
elements,  y �  is  positive  for  x > 1/3,  it  is  negative  for  −1 < x < 1/3,  and  it  is  positive  for  x < −1. 
Therefore, by the First Derivative Test, y is increasing for x < −1, y is decreasing for −1 < x < 1/3, 
and  y is  increasing  for  x > 1/3. 
3.  Extremal  points.  If  f (x) ≤  f (a)  for  all  x near  a,  then  x is  a  local  maximum.  If  f (x) ≥  f (a) 
for  all  x near  a,  then  x is  a  local  minimum.  Because  of  the  First  Derivative  Test,  if  f � (a) > 0  and 
f  is deﬁned  to  the  right of a,  the graph of f  rises  to  the  right of a.  Thus a is not a  local maximum. 
Similarly,  if  f � (a) < 0  and  f  is  deﬁned  to  the  left  of  a,  the  graph  of  f  rises  to  the  left  of  a.  Thus 
a is  not  a  local  maximum.  In  particular,  if  f  is  deﬁned  to  both  the  right  and  left  of  a,  if  f � (a)  is 
deﬁned, and  if a is a  local maximum,  then f � (a) equals 0.  Similarly,  if f  is deﬁned to both the right 
and  left  of  a,  if  f � (a)  is  deﬁned,  and  if  a is  a  local minimum,  then  f � (a)  equals  0. 
A  point  a where  f � (a)  is  deﬁned  and  equals  0  is  a  critical  point.  By  the  last  paragraph,  if  x = a is 
a  local maximum  of  f ,  respectively  a  local minimum  of  f ,  then  one  of  the  following  holds. 

(i)  The  function  f (x)  is  discontinuous  at  a. 
(ii)  The  function  f (x)  is  continuous  at  a,  but  f � (a)  is  not  deﬁned. 
(iii)  The point a is a left endpoint of the interval where f is deﬁned, and f � (a) ≤ 0, resp.  f � (a) ≥ 0. 
(iv)  The  point	 a  is  a  right  endpoint  of  the  interval  where  f  is  deﬁned,  and  f � (a)  ≥  0,  rexp. 
f � (a) ≤ 0. 
(v)  The  function  f  is  deﬁned  to  the  left  and  right  of  a,  and  f � (a)  equals  0.  In  other words,  a is  a 
critical  point  of  f . 
Example.  For  the  function  y =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  critical  points  are  x = −1  and  x =  1/3.  By 
2
examining where  y is  increasing  and decreasing,  x = −1  is  a  local maximum  and x = 1/3  is  a  local 
minimum. 
The plurals of “maximum” and “minimum” are “maxima ” and “minima ”.  Together,  local maxima 
and  local  minima  are  called  extremal  points,  or  extrema.  These  are  points  where  f  takes  on  an 

23


18.01  Calculus 

Jason  Starr 
Fall  2005 

extreme  value,  either  positive  or  negative.  A  point where  f  achieves  its maximum  value  among  al l 
points where  f  is  deﬁned  is  a  global  maximum  or  absolute  maximum.  A  point where  f  achieves  its 
minimum  value  among  al l  points  where  f  is  deﬁned  is  a  global  minimum  or  absolute  minimum. 
4.  Concavity and the Second Derivative Test.  For a diﬀerentiable function f , every “interior” 
extremal  point  is  a  critical  point  of  f .  But  not  every  critical  point  of  f  is  an  extremal  point. 
Example.  The function f (x) = x3  has a critical point at x = 0.  But f (x) is everywhere increasing, 
thus  x = 0  is  not  an  extremal  point  of  f . 
When  is  a  critical  point  an  extremal  point?  When  is  it  a  local  maximum?  When  is  it  a  local 
minimum?  This  is closely  related to  the concavity  of f .  A  function f (x)  is concave  up,  respectively 
concave  down,  if no secant line segment to f (x) crosses below the graph of f , resp.  above the graph 
of  f .  In  symbols,  f  is  concave  up,  resp.  concave  down,  if 
(f (c) − f (a))/(c − a) ≤ (f (b) − f (a))/(b − a)  whenever  a < c < b, 
resp.  (f (c) − f (a))/(c − a) ≥ (f (b) − f (a))/(b − a)  whenever  a < c < b. 
For  a  diﬀerentiable  function  f ,  this  equation  is  close  to, 
f � (c) ≤ f � (b)  whenever  a < c < b, 
resp.  f � (c) ≥ f � (b)  whenever  a > c > b. 
This  precisely  says  that  f �  is  non­decreasing,  resp.  f �  is  non­increasing.  If  f �  is  non­decreasing, 
resp.  non­increasing,  then f  is concave up,  resp.  concave down.  Applying the First Derivative Test 
to determine when f �  is increasing, resp.  decreasing, gives the Second Derivative Test :  If f �� (a) > 0, 
then  f  is  concave  up  near  x = a;  if  f �� (a) < 0  then  f  is  concave  down  near  x = a. 
If  f  is  concave  up  near  a  critical  point,  the  critical  point  is  a  local minimum.  If  f  is  concave  down 
near  a  critical  point,  the  critical  point  is  a  local maximum.  Combined  with  the  Second  Derivative 
Test, this gives a test for when a critical point is a local maximum or local minimum:  If f � (a) equals 
0  and  f �� (a) < 0,  then  x = a is  a  local  maximum.  If  f � (a)  equals  0  and  f �� (a) > 0,  then  x = a is  a 
local minimum. 
Example.  For  y  =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  second  derivative  is  y ��  = 6x + 2.  Since  y �� (−1)  =  −4  is 
2
negative,  the  critical  point  x = −1  is  a  local maximum.  Since  y �� (1/3) = 4  is  positive,  x = 1/3  is  a 
local minimum. 
5.  Inﬂection  points.  If  f  is  diﬀerentiable,  but  for  every  neighborhood  of  a,  f  is  neither  concave 
up  nor  concave  down  on  the  entire  neighborhood,  then  a is  an  inﬂection  point.  If  f �� (a)  is  deﬁned, 
the Second Derivative Test says that f �� (a) must equal 0.  Except in pathological cases, an inﬂection 
point  is  a  point  where  f  is  concave  up  to  one  side  of  f ,  and  concave  down  to  the  other  side  of  f . 
Example.  For  y  =  x3  + x − x − 1,  the  second  derivative  y ��  = 6x + 2  is  negative  for  x < −1/3 
2
and  is  positive  for  x > 1/3.  By  the  Second Derivative Test,  y  is  concave  down  for  x < −1/3  and  y 
is  concave  up  for  x > −1/3.  Therefore  x = −1/3  is  an  inﬂection  point  for  y .

Homework.  Problem  Set  3  Part  I:  (a)–(f ).  Part  II:  Problems  1,  2  and  3.

Practice  Problems.  Course  Reader:  2C­5,  2C­10,  2C­12,  2D­3,  2D­4.

1.  Asymptotes.  An  asymptote  describes  the  behavior  of  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  as  it  becomes 
unbounded,  in  some  sense.  There  are  two main  examples.  The  function  f  has  a  vertical  asymptote 
x = a  if  at  least  1  of  the  following  holds, 
lim  f (x) = +∞,  lim  f (x) = −∞,  lim  f (x) = +∞,  lim  f (x) = −∞. 
→
→

→
x a− 
x a−

x a+ 

In  each  case,  the  graph  of  y = f (x)  becomes  unbounded,  and  becomes  arbitrarily  close  to  the  line 
x = a.  If  x = a  is  a  vertical  asymptote,  then  f (x)  has  an  inﬁnite  discontinuity  at  x = a. 
The  function  f  has  a  horizontal  asymptote  y = b  if  at  least  1  of  the  following  holds, 

lim  f (x) = b,  lim  f (x) = b. 
x→+∞ 
x→−∞ 

In  other  words,  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  becomes  arbitrarily  close  to  the  line  y  =  b  as  x  approaches 
either +∞  or −∞. 
Example.  For  the  function  y  = (x3  + x)/(x − 1)  =  x(x2  + 1)/(x − 1),  the  lines  x  =  −1  and 
2
2
x  =  −1  are  vertical  asymptotes.  There  is  no  horizontal  asymptote.  However,  the  graph  of  y  is 
asymptotic  to  the  line  y  =  x.  This  was  not  discussed  in  lecture.  A  pair  of  functions  f  and  g  are 
asymptotic  to  each  other  if  the  line  y = 0  is  a  horizontal  asymptote  of  f  − g . 
2.  Applied  maximum/minimum  problems.  Using  the  First  Derivative  Test,  the  maximum 
and minimum  of many  functions  can  be  computed.  This  is  very  important  in  applications. 
Example.  Two  long  walls  meet  at  right  angles  making  a  corner.  Using  a  length  of  10  meters  of 
fence  to  form  the  other  2  sides  of  a  rectangle,  what  is  the  largest  area  that  can  be  enclosed  in  this 
corner? 
Step  1.  Identify  parameters.  A  parameter  is  a  constant  or  variable.  The  constant  in  this 
problem  is  10 meters.  Two  variables  are  the  length  l  of  one  side  of  the  rectangle,  and  the  width  w 
of  the  remaining  side  of  the  rectangle. 
Step  2.  Draw  a  diagram.  This  was  done  in  lecture. 
Step  3.  Find  the  quantity  to  be  maximized  or  minimized.  The  quantity  to  be  maximized 
is  the  area  A  of  the  rectangle.  Since  the  area  is  the  product  of  the  length  and  width,  A  equals  lw. 
Step  4.  Use  the  constraints  to  eliminate  variables.  The  constraint  is  that  the  total  length 
of  fence  is  10 meters.  Thus  l + w  equals  10.  This  is  used  to  eliminate  w, 
w = 10 − l. 
Making  this  substitution,  A  is  now  a  function  of  l  alone, 
A(l) = lw(l) = l(10 − l) = −l2  + 10l.

Step  4 1 .  Sketch  a  graph  of  the  quantity  to  be  maximized  or  minimized.  This  is  not 
2 
absolutely  necessary.  Sometimes  it  is  impossible.  When  you  can  make  a  rough  sketch,  this  will 
typically  give  a  very  good  idea  where  the  maximum  or  minimum  lies.  In  the  example  above,  A(l) 
is  a  quadratic  equation.  Because  both  l  and  w  must  be  nonnegative,  A(l)  is  only  deﬁned  on  the 
interval  0 ≤  l ≤ 10.  Thus  the  graph  of  A(l)  is  a  segment  of  a  parabola  opening  down.  The  vertex 
of  the  parabola  is  contained  in  the  segment.  Thus  the  vertex  is  the maximum. 

Step  5.  Compute  the  derivative.  In  this  case, 
A� (l) = −2l + 10. 

Step  6.  Find  all  critical  points,  endpoints,  discontinuity  points,  etc.  In  most  cases,  it 
suﬃces  to  ﬁnd  all  critical  points  and  endpoints.  Occasionally  it  is  also  necessary  to  ﬁnd  all  points 
where  f �  is  not  deﬁned.  Rarely  it  is  necessary  to  also  consider  discontinuity  points  (although  this 
is  usually  so  obvious  that  it  does  not  require  a  separate  step).  In  this  case,  the  endpoints  are  l = 0 
and  l = 10.  The  one  critical  point  is  l = 5. 

Step  7.  Determine  the  global  maximum  or  minimum.  Checking  all  critical  points,  end­
points,  etc.,  determine  the  global  maximum  or  the  global  minimum.  In  this  case,  A(0)  equals  0, 
A(10)  equals  0  and  A(5)  equals  25.  Thus  l = 5  is  the  global maximum. 

Step  8.  Back­substitute.  Plug  in  the  value  of  the  single  remaining  independent  variable  to 
determine  the  values  of  the  remaining  independent  variables.  In  this  case,  w  equals  10 − l,  which 
is  10 − 5 = 5  for  l = 5.  Thus,  the  largest  area  25  is  enclosed  by  a  square  of  side  length  5. 
Example.  A  swimmer  is  in  the  water  at  a  distance  b1  meters  from  shore.  She  wants  to  reach  a 
point on  land b2  meters  from the water.  The point  is a meters parallel to the shore.  If the swimmer 
swims  v1  meters  per  second  and  runs  v2  meters  per  second,  at  what  distance  x  from  the  closest 
point  on  shore  should  she  aim  to  minimize  her  time  to  the  target?  Mathematically,  the  swimmer 
is  at  point  (0, b1 )  and  wants  to  reach  point  (a, −b2 ),  where  the  shore  is  the  x­axis.  At  what  point 
(x, 0)  should  she  aim? 
The  constants  are  a,  b1 ,  b2 ,  v1  and  v2 .  The  variable  is  x.  It  is  also  convenient  to  introduce  a 
variable  d1  for  the  distance  from  (0, b1 )  to  (x, 0),  and  a  variable  d2  for  the  distance  from  (x, 0)  to 
(a, −b2 ).  Although  not  obvious,  it  is  also  very  convenient  to  introduce  a  variable  θ1  for  the  acute 
angle  formed  by  the  x­axis  and  the  line  segment  joining  (0, b1 )  to  (x, 0).  Also  introduce  θ2  for  the 
acute  angle  formed  by  the  x­axis  and  the  line  segment  joining  (x, 0)  to  (a, −b2 ). 
The  time  T1  to  swim  to  point  (x, 0)  is,

This is Snel l’s Law  for refraction of light upon crossing from one medium to another.  For refraction, 
a  particle  of  light  (perhaps  ﬁctitious)  replaces  the  swimmer,  a  translucent  medium  of  one  type 
replaces  the  water,  and  a  translucent  medium  of  a  second  type  replaces  the  land.  If  light  travels 
with velocity v1  in the ﬁrst medium and with velocity v2  in the second medium, light rays will refract 
upon  crossing  the  boundary  between media.  Snell’s  Law  describes  the  angles  of  this  refraction.

1.  Related  rates.  A  situation  that  arises  often  in  practice  is  that  two  quantities,  say  x  and  y , 
depend  on  a  third  independent  variable,  say  t.  The  quantities  x  and  y  are  related  through  some 
constraint.  Using the constraint,  if the rate­of­change dx/dt is known, the rate­of­change dy/dt can 
be  inferred. 
Example.  For  a  spring  displaced  x  units  from  equilibrium,  Hooke’s  law  implies  the  potential 
energy  of  the  spring  is, 

1 
P  =  kx 2 ,
2 
where  k  is  a  constant  with  units  kg/s2 .  At  some  moment  t  =  T ,  a  spring  is  displaced  5cm  from 
equilibrium  and  has  velocity  5cm/s.  In  terms  of  the  spring  constant  k ,  describe  the  rate­of­change 
of  the  potential  energy  at  t = T .

2.  Method  for  solving  related­rates  problems.  Many  of  these  steps  apply  to  any  word­
problem  in mathematics. 

(i)  Identify  the  independent  variable.  In  the  example,  this  is  t. 

(ii)  Label  all  constants.  In  the  example,  k  is  a  constant. 

(iii)  Label  all  dependent  variables.  In  the  example,  x  and  P  are  dependent  variables. 

(iv)  Draw  a  diagram  and  carefully  label  it. 

(v)  Write  the  given  rate­of­change  and  the  unknown  rate­of­change.	 In  the  example,  dx/dt(T )  is 
given  as  5cm/s,  and  dP /dt  is  unknown. 

(vi)  Using the diagram and any other information, ﬁnd constraints among the dependent variables. 
In  the  example,  this  is  the  equation  P  = kx2/2. 

(vii)  Implicitly  diﬀerentiate  the  constraint  equations  with  respect  to  the  independent  variable.  In 
the  example,  this  gives  dP /dt = kxdx/dt. 

(viii)  Substitute  in all known quantities and  solve  for  the unknown  rate­of­change.  In  the example, 
dP /dt(T )  equals  25kcm2/s. 

Example.  A  state  trooper  waits  a  distance  a  from  a  highway  for  passing  speeders.  The  speed 
limit  is 60mph.  The trooper aims her radar gun at an angle of π/4 to the road.  The radar registers 
a  passing  car  moving  away  from  the  trooper  at  a  speed  of  50mph.  Should  the  trooper  ticket  the 
driver? 

The  independent  variable  is  time  t.  The  constants  are  the  distance  a  and  the  angle  θ  =  π/4. 
Label  a  coordinate  system  with  the  trooper  at  the  origin  and  the  highway  equal  to  the  line  y = a. 
Label  the  position  of  the  car  along  the  highway  as  x,  moving  in  the  positive  direction.  Denote  by 
r  the  distance  of  the  car  from  the  trooper.  Then  x  and  r  are  dependent  variables.  The  rate­of­
change  dr/dt(T )  is  given  as  50mph.  The  unknown  rate­of­change  is  dx/dt(T ).  The  constraint  is 
the  Pythagorean  theorem,

Example.  A  point  on  the  x­axis  moves  away  from  the  origin.  There  is  an  angle  θ  subtended  by 
the point and the unit circle with equation x2 + y 2  = 1.  In other words,  standing at the point (x, 0) 
and  staring  at  the  circle,  θ  is  the  angle  of  your  ﬁeld­of­vision  occupied  by  the  circle.  At  a moment 
t = T ,  the  point  is  at  the  position  (2, 0)  and moving with  velocity  v .  What  is  the  rate­of­change  of 
θ  at  t = T ? 

The  independent  variable  is  time  t.  There  is  no  constant.  The  dependent  variables  are  the  x­
coordinate of the point, x(t), and the angle θ(t).  The rate­of­change dx/dt(T ) is given to be v .  The 
rate­of­change  dθ/dt  is  unknown. 

The constraint is somewhat tricky.  There are two tangent lines to the circle containing (x, 0).  These 
are  the  tangent  lines  to  points  (a, +b)  and  (a, −b)  on  the  circle.  Because  the  tangent  line  to  the 
circle  at  (a, b)  is  perpendicular  to  the  radius  through  (a, b),  the  triangle  with  vertices  (0, 0),  (a, b) 
and  the  point  (x, 0)  is  a  right  triangle.  The  angle  of  the  triangle  at  (x, 0)  is  θ/2.  Since  the  radius 
has  length  1  and  the  hypotenuse  has  length  x,  the  constraint  is,

3.  Another applied max/min problem.  As review for Exam 2, this is another applied max/min 
problem.  A  trapezoid  is  inscribed  inside  the  upper  unit  semicircle,  x2  + y = 1, y  ≥  0.  The  base 
2
of  the  trapezoid  is  the  diameter  of  the  semicircle  lying  on  the  x­axis.  The  top  of  the  trapezoid 
is  parallel  to  the  x­axis  joining  (−x, y)  to  (x, y)  for  a  point  (x, y)  on  the  unit  circle  in  the  ﬁrst 
quadrant.  What  is  the maximal  area  enclosed  by  such  a  trapezoid? 

The  parameters  are  x  and  y .  The  height  of  the  trapezoid  is  y .  The  area  of  a  trapezoid  is  the 
product  of  the  height  with  the  average  of  the  parallel  sides.  Thus, 

(2 + 2x)
A = y 
2 
This  is  the  quantity  to  be maximized.  There  is  a  constraint  among  the  parameters, 

= (x + 1)y . 

2 x  + y 2  = 1. 
Also,  since  (x, y)  is  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant,  0 ≤ x ≤ 1  and  0 ≤ y ≤ 1. 
There  are  at  least  3  ways  to  proceed.  The most  direct  is  to  solve  for  y  in  terms  of  x, 
√
1 − x2 . 

y = 

Substituting  this  into  the  equation  for  A  gives,

the  critical  points  of  A  are  x  =  −1  and  x  = 1/2.  But  x  =  −1  does  not  give  a  point  in  the  ﬁrst

1.  Diﬀerentials.  An  alternative  notation  for  derivatives  is  diﬀerential  notation.  The  diﬀerential 
notation, 

dF (x) = f (x)dx, 

is  shorthand  for  the  sentence  “The  derivative  of  F (x)  with  respect  to  x  equals  f (x).”  Formally, 
this  is  related  to  the  Leibniz  notation  for  the  derivative, 

dF 
(x) = f (x),
dx 

which  means  the  same  thing  as  the  diﬀerential  notation.  It  may  look  like  the  ﬁrst  and  second 
equation  are  obtained  by  dividing  and  multiplying  by  the  quantity  dx.  It  is  crucial  to  remember 
that  dF /dx  is  not  a  fraction,  although  the  notation  suggests  otherwise. 

In  diﬀerential  notation,  some  derivative  rules  have  a  very  simple  form,  and  are  thus  easier  to 
remember.  Here  are  a  few  derivative  rules  in  diﬀerential  notation.

G(x)dF (x) + F (x)dG(x) 
d(F (x)/G(x))  =  1/(G(x))2 (G(x)dF (x) − F (x)dG(x))

2.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Recall,  the  basic  problem  of  diﬀerentiation  is  the  following. 
Problem  (Diﬀerentiation).  Given  a  function F (x),  ﬁnd  the  function  f (x)  satisfying  dF  = f (x).
dx 
The  bais  problem  of  antidiﬀerentiation  is  the  inverse  problem.

Problem  (Antidiﬀerentiation).  Given  a  function  f (x),  ﬁnd  a  function  F (x)  satisfying  dF  =

dx 
f (x). 
A  function F (x)  solving  the problem  is  called  an  antiderivative  of  f (x),  or  sometimes  an  indeﬁnite 
� 
integral  of  f (x).  The  notation  for  this  is, 

F (x) = 

f (x)dx. 

The  expression  f (x)  is  called  the  integrand.  It  is  important  to  note,  if  F (x)  is  one  antiderivative 
of  f (x),  then  for  each  constant  C ,  F (x) + C  is  also  an  antiderivative  of  f (x).  The  constant  C  is 
called  a  constant  of  integration. 
In a sense that can be made precise, the problem of diﬀerentiation has a complete solution whenever 
F (x)  is  a  “simple  expression”,  i.e.,  a  function  built  from  the  diﬀerentiable  functions  we  have  seen 
so  far.  Unfortunately,  for  very  many  simple  functions  f (x),  no  antiderivative  of  f (x)  has  a  simple 
expression.  In  large part,  this  is what makes antidiﬀerentiation diﬃcult.  Luckily, many of the most 
important  simple  functions  f (x)  do  have  an  antiderivative  with  a  simple  expression.  One  goal  of 
this unit is to learn how to recognize when a simple antiderivative exists, and some tools to compute 
the  antiderivative. 
3.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Guess­and­check.  The  main  technique  for  antidiﬀerentiation  is  edu­
cated  guessing. 
Example.  Find  an  antiderivative  of  f (x) = x2  + 2x + 1.  Since  the  derivative  of  xn  is  nxn−1 ,  it  is 
reasonable  to  guess  there  is  an  antiderivative  of  the  form  F (x) = Ax3  + Bx2  + C x.  Diﬀerentiation 
gives, 

dF 
dx 
Thus,  F (x)  is  an  antiderivative  of  f (x)  if  and  only  if, 

= 3Ax2  + 2Bx + C. 

This  gives  an  antiderivative,

3A = 1,  2B  = 2,  and  C  = 1.

3 x3  + x2  + x + E  ,

where  E  is  any  constant.

Guess­and­check is a game we can lose, as well as win.  However, there are a few rules that better the 
odds  in  this  guessing  game.  In  fact,  they  are  basically  the  same  rules  for  derivatives  in  diﬀerential

f (u(x))u� (x)dx  = 
f (u)du 

4.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Integration  by  substitution.  The  last  rule  above  is  very  important, 
and  called  integration  by  substitution. 

Example.  Find  an  antiderivative  of  x sin(x2 ).  This  time  guess­and­check  is  much  less  eﬀective. 
By  roughly  the  same  logic  in  the  last  example,  we  might  guess  an  antiderivative  has  the  form 
Ax3  sin(x2 ).  The  derivative  is  3Ax2  sin(x2 ) + 2Ax4 cos(x2 ).  The  ﬁrst  term  is  good,  but  the  second 
term is bad.  We can try to correct our guess by adding a term, Ax3  sin(x2 ) − 2/5Ax5 cos(x2 ), whose 
derivative is now 3Ax2  sin(x2 ) + 4/5Ax6  sin(x2 ).  This still doesn’t work, and is leading in the wrong 
direction. 

A  better  solution  is  to  use  integration  by  substitution.  Observe  part  of  f (x)  can  be  written  as 
a  function  of  u(x) =  x2 .  Also,  the  derivative  u� (x) = 2x  occurs  in  f (x)  through  x  = 1/2(2x) = 
u� (x)/2.  Thus, 
x sin(x  ) = sin(u(x))u� (x)/2, u(x) = x 2 .

Here  is  a  checklist  for  applying  integration  by  substition  to  ﬁnd  the  antiderivative  of  f (x). 

(i)  Find  an  expression	 u(x)  so  that  most  of  the  integrand  f (x)  can  be  expressed  as  a  simpler 
function  of  u(x).

1.  The  problem  of  areas.  The  ancient  Greeks  computed  the  areas  of  triangles,  quadrilaterals, 
and many other polygons.  Their basic method was dissection :  dissecting a polygonal region exactly 
into  smaller  regions,  usually  triangles,  having known  areas.  The area of  the  large  region  is  the  sum 
of  the  areas  of  the  small  regions.  But  the  ancient  Greeks  also  knew  the  area  of  a  circle,  which 
cannot  be  dissected  exactly  into  ﬁnitely  many  polygonal  regions.  Their  method  was  exhaustion : 
ﬁnding  polygonal  regions  approximately  equal  to  the  original  region,  and  computing  the  limit  of 
the  areas  of  the  polygons  as  the  approximation  improves. 
Example.  A  regular  N ­sided  polygon  inscribed  in  a  circle  of  radius  r  has  apothem  length  a  = 
r cos(π/N )  and  chord  length  b = 2r sin(π/N ).  Thus  the  area  of  the  polygon  is, 
sin(2π/N ) = πr 2 sin(2π/N ) 
.

As  N  increases,  2π/N  decreases  to  0.  Because  limt

the  area  of  the  polygon  approaches,

A more  sophisticated  version  of  the method  of  exhaustion  gives  the  Riemann  integral.  Here  is  the 
basic  problem. 
Problem  (Area).  Find  the  signed  area  between  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  over  the 
interval  a ≤ x ≤ b.

For a region above the x­axis,  the signed  area  is simply the area.  For a region below the x­axis,  the 
signed  area  is  the  negative  of  the  area.  For  a  region  partly  above  the  x­axis  and  partly  below  the 
x­axis,  the  signed  area  is  the  sum  of  the  signed  area  of  the  region  above  the  x­axis  and  the  signed 
area  of  the  region  below  the  x­axis. 
2.  Partitions.  A  partition  of  an  interval  [a, b]  is  a  ﬁnite  decomposition  of  the  interval  as  a  union 
of  non­overlapping  subintervals, 
[a, b] = [x0 , x1 ] ∪ [x1 , x2 ]
n−2 ] ∪
Since  an  interval  is  determined  by  its  right  and  left  endpoints,  to  specify  a  partition  of  [a, b],  it  is 
equivalent  to  give  an  ordered  sequence  of  increasing  numbers, 
a = x0  < x1  < x2  < · · · < xn−2  < xn−1  < xn  = b. 
The  k th  subinterval  of  the  partition  is  the  interval  [xk−1 , xk ],  having  length, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1 . 

∪ · · · ∪

[xn−2 , x

[xn−1 , xn ].

A partition is ﬁne  if the subintervals are small, and coarse  if the subintervals are large.  It may seem 
the  number  of  intervals  n  is  a  good  measure  of  ﬁneness:  since  the  subintervals  of  a  ﬁne  partition 
are  small,  the number n of  subintervals must be  large.  However, a partition  into many  subintervals 
may  include  a  few  subintervals  that  are  quite  large.  For  instance,  the  partition 
∪ · · ·∪ [(n−2)/2n, (n−1)/2n ∪
[n−1/2n, n/2n]∪ [1/2, 1],
[0, 1] =  [0, 1/2n]∪ [1/2n, 2/2n]∪ [2/2n, 3/2n]
]

has  n  very  small  intervals  of  length  1/2n,  but  has  one  interval,  [1/2, 1],  of  size  1/2.  The  number 
1/2 may  not  seem  large,  but  as  n  increases,  it  is  quite  large  compared  to  1/2n. 
Because  of  such  examples,  a  better  measure  of  ﬁneness  is  mesh  size:  The  mesh  size  of  a  partition 
is  the maximal  length  of  any  subinterval  in  the  partition, 
mesh = max Δxk |k = 1, . . . , n. 
3.  Riemann  sums.  Let  f (x)  be  a  function  deﬁned  on  an  interval  a ≤  x ≤  b.  Given  a  partition 
<  · · · 
<  xn  =  b  of  [a, b],  and  given  a  choice,  for  every  k  = 1, . . . , n,  of  element  x∗  in  the 
a  =  x0 
k th  subinterval,  xk−1  ≤  x∗  ≤  xk ,  the  curvilinear  region  bounded  by  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  is 
k

approximated by  a union  of n  vertical  strips.  The  k th  vertical  strip  lies  above  or below  the  interval 
on  the  x­axis,  xk−1  ≤  x ≤  xk ,  and  has  height  y ∗  =  f (x∗ 
k ).  The  width  of  the  vertical  strip  is  Δxk ,

The  sum  above  is  a  Riemann  sum.  It  is  an  approximation  of  the  signed  area  of  the  curvilinear 
region. 

There are many choices of partition.  And for each partition, there are many choices for the numbers 
x∗ 
k .  However,  there  are  some  special  choices.  On  the  k th  interval,  the  smallest  value  f (x)  takes  on 
is  denoted  by, 
yk,min  = min{f (x) xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk+1}. 
|
Similarly,  the  largest  value  f (x)  takes  on  is  denote  by, 
yk,max  = max{f (x) xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk+1}.
|
For  every  choice  of  x∗  in  the  k th  interval,  y ∗  is  trapped  between  these  two  values, 
k 
k
yk,min  ≤ y ∗ 
k  ≤ yk,max . 

Denoting, 

ΔAk,min  = yk,minΔxk ,  ΔAk,max  = yk,maxΔxk , 
the  area ΔAk  is  trapped  between  these  two  values, 
ΔAk,min  ≤ ΔAk  ≤ ΔAk,max .

Amax  = 
k=1 ΔAk,min  = 
k=1 yk,minΔxk , 
the  Riemann  sum  A  is  trapped  between  the  two  values, 
Amin  ≤ A ≤ Amax . 
Thus,  if  Amin  and  Amax  are  close  to  each  other,  the  value  of  A  does  not  depend  very  much  on  the 
choices  of  the  numbers  x∗ 
k . 
4.  The  Riemann  integral.  The  method  of  the  Riemann  integral  is  to  compute  both  Amin  and 
Amax  for a sequence of partitions whose mesh sizes approach 0.  The mesh size measures the ﬁneness 
of  the  partition,  thus  also  the  ﬁt  of  the  union  of  vertical  strips  to  the  curvilinear  region.  If  the  two 
limits, 

lim  Amax ,

are  deﬁned  and  equal,  it  is  said  the  Riemann  integral  exists,  and  the  common  limit  is  called  the

Example.  Consider  the  function  f (x) =  x  on  the  interval  0  ≤  x  ≤  L,  for  some  positive  number 
L.  Form  the  partition  with  n  subintervals  of  equal  length, 

x0  = 0 = 0L/n, x1  = 1L/n, x2  = 2L/n, . . . , xk  = kL/n, . . . xn  = nL/n = L. 

and, 

Amin  =

Every  interval has  length Δxk  = L/n.  So  the mesh  size  is L/n.  The minimum value of f (x) on  the 
interval  xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk  is  yk,min  = xk−1  = (k − 1)L/n.  The maximum  value  is  yk,max  = xk  = kL/n.

1.  The Riemann  sum  for  the  exponential  function.  The problem is to compute the Riemann 
integral,

using Riemann sums.  Choose the partition of  [0, b]  into a sequence of n equally­spaced subintervals

2.  The  Riemann  sum  for  x .  Let  r > 0  be  a  positive  real  number.  The  problem  is  to  compute 
the  Riemann  integral, 
1 
using Riemann  sums.  For  this  particular  integral,  a  diﬀerent  partition  than  usual  is more  eﬃcient. 
Let  n  be  a  positive  integer,  and  let  q  be  the  real  number, 

r x  dx, 

Choose  the  partition  of  [1, b]  into  n  subintervals  with  partition  numbers, 

q = b1/n . 

k 
xk  = q . 

Observe  that, 

1 = x0  < x1  < · · · < xn−1  < xn  = (b1/n )n  = b. 
The  length  of  the  k th  subinterval  is, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1  = q k  − q k−1  = q k−1 (q − 1). 

Observe  this  increases  as  k  increases.  So  this  is  not  the  partition  of  [1, b]  into  n  equal  subintervals. 
The mesh  size  is, 

mesh = max(Δx1 , . . . , Δxn ) = Δxn  = (q − 1)b(n−1)/n  ≤ q − 1. 

As  n  tends  to  inﬁnity,  the mesh  size  tends  to,

grable.  Precisely,  every  continuous  function,  and  every  piecewise  continuous  function  is  Riemann 
integrable. 

The  answer  to  the  second  question  is more  interesting.  Assume  f (x)  is  a  continuous  function.  Let 
� 
x = a  be  a  ﬁxed  point  where  f (x)  is  deﬁned.  Form  the  function, 
a 

F (x) = 

f (t)dt. 

x 

The  function  F (x)  is  deﬁned  whenever  f (t)  is  deﬁned  on  all  of  [a, x].  If  f (x)  is  continuous,  the

The middle term  is the diﬀerence quotient.  Consider what happens as Δx tends to 0.  Because f (t)

4.  Algorithm  for  computing  Riemann  integrals.  The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  has many 
important  applications.  The  most  obvious  is  to  give  us  a  simpler  method  for  computing  Riemann 
integrals,  under  the  hypothesis  that  we  can  compute  the  antiderivative.  If  f (x)  is  a  continuous

Observe,  the  variable  x  does  not  appear  in  this  limit.  It  is  very  convenient  to  include  the  variable 
x  in  the  notation  for  the Riemann  integral;  for  how  else  are we  to  express  the  function  integrated? 
But,  since  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral  does  not  involve  x,  x  is  really  a  dummy  variable.

This  convention  reduces  the  likelihood  of  an  error. 

2.  Variable  limits  of  integration.  The  Riemann  integral  is  often  used  to  deﬁne  functions, 
particularly  antiderivatives  having  no  simpler  expression. 
Example.  For every angle 0 ≤ θ < π/2, deﬁne f (θ) to be the area above the x­axis,  inside the unit 
� 
circle  x2  + y = 1,  and  bounded  by  the  vertical  lines, − cos(θ) ≤ x ≤ cos(θ).  This  is  an  integral, 
2
√
− cos(θ) 

1 − x2dx. 

f (θ) = 

cos(θ) 

The  problem  is  to  describe  the  rate­of­change  of  f ,  df /dθ . 

The  integral  f (θ)  is  beyond  our  current  techniques  of  integration  (though  soon  we  will  have  tech­
niques to solve  it).  The  simplest solution  is  indirect.  Here, ﬁrst,  is the direct solution.  The  integral 
f (θ)  equals  the  area  of  2  triangles  and  a  circular  sector.  By  high­school  geometry,  the  area  is, 
π − 2θ 
2

+ 2(  sin(θ) cos(θ)) = π/2 − θ +

sin(2θ). 

f (θ) =

Using  standard  rules  of  diﬀerentiation,  the  derivative  is, 

= −1 + cos(2θ). 

df 
dθ 

Notice,  by  the  double­angle  formula  for  cosine,  this  equals, 
−1 + cos(2θ) =  −
2 sin

2 (θ).

The hardest step (hidden here) was the geometric computation of f (θ).  However, this is completely 
� 
unnecessary.  Introduce  a  function, 
0 

1 − x2dx. 

G(t) =

Using  symmetry  through  the  y ­axis,  f (θ)  equals, 

f (θ) = 2G(cos(θ)). 

By  the  chain  rule,

This  gives,

The  second  method  is  indirect.  The  function  G(t)  has  no  simple  expression.  Nonetheless,  this 
method  is  faster.  In many  cases  this  is  the  only method  that  works. 
The argument above using the chain rule and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is quite general. 
It  gives  the  general  equation,  � v(x) 
u(x)  f (t)dt = f (v(x))v � (x) − f (u(x))u� (x).

3.  Geometric  area  and  algebraic  area.  The  Riemann  integral  is  the  algebraic  area, 
a 

f (x)dx =  Area  above  the  x­axis  −  Area  below  the  x­axis  . 

The  geometric  area  is  the  total  area,  both  above  and  below  the  x­axis.  Although  geometric  area 
�  b 
does  not  equal  algebraic  area,  it  has  a  simple  expression  using  the  Riemann  integral, 
a 

Geometric  area  = 

f (x)|dx.
|

Example.  Find  both  the  algebraic  area  and  the  geometric  area  bounded  by  the  x­axis  and  the 
graph  of  y = sin(x)  over  the  interval −π < x < π . 
Because  sin(x)  is  an  odd  function,  the  area  below  the  x­axis  for −π < x < 0  equals  the  area  above 
the x­axis  for 0 < x < π .  In the expression  for the algebraic area,  these areas cancel to give 0.  This 
�  π 
is  borne  out  by  computation, 
sin(x)dx = (− cos(x) π  = − cos(π) + cos(−π) = −(−1) + (−1) = 0.
|−π 
−π 
|  � 
On  the  other  hand,  the  absolute  value  sin(x)|  equals, 
− sin(x),  −π < x ≤ 0, 
| sin(x)| = 
sin(x), 
0 < x < π . 
Thus  the  geometric  area  equals,  � 0 
� π 
−π − sin(x)dx + 
sin(x)dx = 
0 
|
|
(cos(x) −π  + (− cos(x) π  = (1 − (−1)) + (−(−1) + 1) = 
0
0
Thus  the  geometric  area does not  equal  the  algebraic  area.  But  computation  of  the  geometric  area 
reduces  to  a  straightforward  Riemann  integral.

The  largest  k  for  which  dk y/dxk  occurs  in  the  equation  is  called  order  of  the  diﬀerential  equation. 
Examples.  Here  are  examples  of  ordinary  diﬀerential  equations. 
(i)  The  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation, 

= 0. 

y − sin(x 2 ) = 0, 

has order 0, because no derivatives of  y  actually occur  in  the  equation.  It has a unique  (and  rather 
trivial)  solution, 

y = sin(x 2 ). 
Because  the  solution  is  unique,  it  depends  on  0  parameters  (and  the  order  is  0). 
(ii)  The  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation, 

dy

dx = ln(|x + 1 ) + C,

Notice  the  solution  depends  on  1  parameter,  C .  And  the  order  is  1.

y =

has  order  2.  The  general  solution  was  found  in  Problem  Set  2,  Problem  4, 

The  solution  depends  on  2  parameters,  A  and  B .  And  the  order  is  2. 

y = A cos(ωx) + B sin(ωx).

for  functions  ak (x), . . . , a0 (x), b(x).  If  b(x)  is  zero,  the  equation  is  homogeneous.  Otherwise  it 
is  inhomogeneous.  Very  important  is  the  case  when  all  the  functions  ak (x), . . . , a0 (x), b(x)  are 
constant.  Then  the  diﬀerential  equation  is  called  constant  coeﬃcient.  The  solution  of  constant

2.  Separable  diﬀerential  equations.  Many  diﬀerential  equations  arising  in  applications  are 
examples  of  separable  diﬀerential  equation.  A  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  is  a  ﬁrst­
order  diﬀerential  equation, 

dy 
dx 

= F (x, y),

for  which  f (x, y)  factors  as, 

F (x, y) = g(x)/h(y). 

Example.  Find  the  equation y = f (x) of  every  curve with  the  following property:  For  every point 
(x, y)  on  the  curve,  the  tangent  line  to  the  curve  is  perpendicular  to  the  line  joining  (x, y)  to  the 
origin  (0, 0). 

The slope of the tangent  line to the curve at (x, y)  is dy/dx.  The slope of  the  line  joining (0, 0) and 
(x, y)  is  y/x.  Since  the  tangent  line  is  perpendicular  to  the  line  joining  (0, 0)  and  (x, y), 

= −x/y . 

dy 
dx 

Thus,  the  equation  y = f (x)  is  a  solution  to  this  separable  diﬀerential  equation. 


The  algorithm  for  solving  a  separable  diﬀerential  equation  is  the  following. 


(i).  Factor  f (x, y)  as  g(x)/h(y).  This  is  often  the most  diﬃcult  step.  In  the  example,  it  is  quite

easy.  Simply  take  g(x) = −x  and  h(y) = y .

(ii).  Rewrite  the  diﬀerential  equation  as  an  equality  of  diﬀerentials.  In  other  words,

rewrite  the  equation  as, 


dy 
dx 

= 

g(x) 
h(y) 

⇒ h(y)dy = g(x)dx.

ydy =  −xdx,

(iv).  If  there  is  an  inital  value,  use  it  to  ﬁnd  the  constant  of  integration.  An  initial  value 
problem  is  an  ordinary  diﬀerential  equation  together  with  some  information  for  an  initial  value  x0 
� 
of  the  independent  variable.  It  is  often  written, 

dy/dx = F (x, y), 
y(x0 ) = y0 . 

The  example  was  not  an  initial  value  problem.  However,  it  can  easily  be  made  an  initial  value 
problem  by  specifying, 

y(1) = 1, 

for  instance.  With  this  condition,  the  constant  C  satisﬁes  the  equation, 
−1
2 

1 
(1)2  = 
2

(1)2  + C. 

The  solution  is, 

C  = 1. 

(v).  Simplify  the  answer.  Often  it  is  best  to  solve  for  y  =  f (x).  Often  this  is  unnecessary.  It 
depends  on  the  problem.  In  the  example  problem,  the  simplest  answer  is  the  implicit  answer, 

So  the  solution  of  the  initial  value  problem  is,

x2  + y 2  = 2. 

Thus  every  curve  satisfying  the  geometric  property  is  a  circle  centered  at  the  origin. 

Example.  Here  is  a  somewhat  diﬀerent  example.  There  is  a  single  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential 
equation  satisﬁed  by  every  function, 
y = (x − a)3 , 
where  a  is  an  arbitrary  constant.  Find  this  diﬀerential  equation,  and  ﬁnd  all  its  solutions.

The  derivative  of  y  is,

y−2/3dy = 3dx,

Calling  the  constant −3a  gives  the  answer, 
y = (x − a)3 . 

However,  there  are  other  solutions.  For  instance,  y  =  0  is  a  solution.  The  general  solution  of  the

The  problem  is  that  in  the  step  giving  dy/y 2/3  = dx.  If  y  equals  0,  this  equation  involves  division 
by  zero.  Division  by  zero  is  not  allowed,  so  the method  breaks  down. 
Important  fact.  This  fact will  not  be  used  in  this  class.  However,  it  is  often  crucial  in  real­world

applications  to  know  the  solution  to  an  initial  value  problem  is  unique.  The  fact  is,

In  the  previous  example,  F (x, y) = 3y 2/3  is  continuous  at  y0  =  0.  But  it  is  not  diﬀerentiable  at 
y0  = 0.  Ultimately,  this  is  the  reason  for  the  extra  solutions  of  the  diﬀerential  equation. 
3.  Applications.  Separable  diﬀerential  equations  come  up  often  in  applications.  The  most 
common  separable  diﬀerential  equation  is  the  equation  for  exponential  growth,

where  k  is  a  constant.

The  solution  behaves  diﬀerently  if  k  is  positive  or  negative.  For  k  positive,  this  equation  arises  in 
population  growth  and  interest  on  savings,  among  others.  For  k  negative,  this  equation  arises  in 
radioactive  decay,  a  discharging  capactior  in  an  RC­circuit,  and  Newton’s  law  of  cooling. 

Population growth.  The simplest model of population growth is that a population N (t) (modeled 
as  continuous  for  simplicity)  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  size  of  the  population.  This  gives, 

Following  the method  gives, 

dN 
= kN . 
dt 
�  dN/N  = kdt, 
� 
1/N dN  =  kdt, 
ln(|N  ) = kt + C. 
|

Exponentiating  both  sides  gives, 

N0e . kt 
Observe  that  N (t)  increases  without  bound  as  t  increases.  When  N  is  very  large,  the  ecosystem 
cannot  support  such  a  population.  Thus  the model  is  only  valid  if N (t)  is  not  too  large. 

N (t) = 

A  slightly  more  realistic  model  hypothesizes  a  constant,  equilibrium  population  Nequi  sustainable 
indeﬁnitely.  The model  is  that  the  population  grows  at  a  rate  proportional  both  to  the  population 
N  and  the  diﬀerence Nequi  − N , 

dN 
= kN (Nequi  − N ). 
dt 
This  is  again  a  separable  diﬀerential  equation.  It  gives  the  solution, 
N0Nequi/(N0  Nequi  − N0 )e−
+ (

) = 
N (t

kNequi

t ).

The most  important  feature  is  that N (t)  approaches Nequi  as  t  increases.  This  is  called  the  steady­
state  solution.  In  general,  to  ﬁnd  the  steady­state  solution  to  a  separable  ordinary  diﬀerential 
equation,  assume  the  solution  is  constant  y  =  y1  so  that  dy/dt  is  0.  In  the  original  model  of 
population  growth,  the  only  steady­state  solution  is N  = 0.  In  the  new model,  there  are  2  steady­
state  solutions,  N  =  0  and  N  = Nequi .  In  Math  18.03,  stability  is  deﬁned,  and  a  method  is  given 
to  show  the  only  stable  steady­state  solution  is N  = Nequi . 
Radioactive  decay.  A  radioactive  isotope  decays  to  a more  stable  isotope  at  a  rate  proportional 
to  the  remaining  radioactive  isotope.  Thus  the mass m(t)  satisﬁes  a  diﬀerential  equation, 

Using  the method,  the  solution  is, 

= −km.

m(t) =  m0e−kt .

An important feature in decay problems is the half­life.  The half­life  is the length of time necessary 
for  the mass  of  radioactive  isotope  to  decrease  to  one­half  the  initial mass, 

Solving  in  the  formula  gives, 

m(Thalf ) = m0/2. 

Thalf  = 

ln(2)

/k .

Example.  The  half­life  of  a  certain  radioactive  isotope  is  20  years.  How  long  is  required  for  the 
mass  to  decrease  to  1%  of  the  initial  mass?  Using  the  formula  above,  k =  ln(2)/25.  Therefore  the 
equation  for  the mass  is, 
m(t) = m0e− ln(2)t/25 . 
Thus  the  time  tf  when  the mass  equals  0.01m0  satisﬁes, 
m0e− ln(2)tf /25  = m0/100, 

or, 

Solving  gives, 

ln(2)tf /25 = ln(100) = 2 ln(10). 

tf  = 50 ln(10)/ ln(2) = 

166  years. 

Newton’s  Law  of  Cooling.  Isaac Newton  proposed  a  law  for  the  rate­of­change  of  the  tempera­
ture T  of an ob ject placed in a large, eﬀectively inﬁnite, environment at a ﬁxed ambient temperature 
Tamb .  The law is that the rate­of­change of T  is negatively proportional to the temperature gradient

1.  Approximating Riemann  integrals.  Often, there is no simpler expression for the antideriva­
tive than the expression given by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  In such cases, the simplest 
method to compute a Riemann  integral  is to use the deﬁnition.  However,  this  is not necessarily the 
most eﬃcient  method.  Often trapezoids or segments under a parabola give a better approximation 
to  the  Riemann  integral  than  do  vertical  strips.

This  is  usually  a  better  approximation  than  either  of  the  two  approximations  individually.  Part 
of  the  reason  is  that  the  term  (yk−1  + yk )Δxk /2  is  the  area  of  the  trapezoid  containing  the  points 
(xk−1 , 0),  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , 0)  and  (xk , yk ).  In  particular,  if  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  is  a  line,  this 
trapezoid is precisely the region between the graph and the x­axis over the interval [xk−1 , xk ].  Thus, 
the  approximation  above  gives  the  exact  integral  for  linear  integrands.

Pair  oﬀ  the  intervals  as  ([x0 , x1 ], [x1 , x2 ]),  ([x2 , x3 ], [x3 , x4 ]),  etc.  Thus  the  lth  pair  of  intervals  is, 

([x2l−2 , x2l−1 ], [x2l−1 , x2l ]). 

The  idea  is  to  approximate  the  area  of  the  graph  over  the  pair  of  intervals  by  the  area  under  the 
unique  parabola  containing  the  3  points  (x2l−2 , y2l−2 ), (x2l−1 , y2l−1 ), (x2l , y2l ).  For  notation’s  sake, 
denote  2l − 1  by  k .  Thus  the  3  points  are  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , yk ),  and  (xk+1 , yk+1 )  (this  is  slightly 
more  symmetric). 

The  ﬁrst  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  the  equation  of  this  parabola.  Since  the  parabola  contains  the  point 
(xk , yk ),  it  has  the  equation, 

y = A(x − xk )2  + B (x − xk ) + yk , 
Plugging  in  x = xk−1  and  x = xk+1 ,  and  using  that  xk+1  − xk  = xk  − xk−1  equals Δx, 
yk+1  = A(Δx)2  + B (Δx) + yk , 
yk−1  = A(Δx)2  − B (Δx) + yk . 

Summing  the  two  sides  gives, 

yk+1  + yk−1  = 2A(Δx)2  + 2yk . 

Solving  for  A  gives, 

1 
2(Δx)2 (yk−1  − 2yk  + yk+1 ). 
Similarly,  taking  the  diﬀerence  of  the  two  sides  gives, 
yk+1  − yk−1  = 2B (Δx). 

A = 

Solving  for  B  gives, 

B  = 

(yk+1  − yk−1 ).

2(Δx)
Thus,  the  equation  of  the  parabola  passing  through  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , yk )  and  (xk+1 , yk+1 )  is,

Note that trapezoids overestimate the area, because 1/x is concave up.  The approximating parabo­
las  cross  the  graph  of  y  = 1/x,  thus  the  underestimation  to  the  left  of  (xk , yk )  somewhat  cancels 
the  overestimation  to  the  right  of  (xk , yk ),  explaining  the  better  approximation. 
4.  One  review  problem.  This  is  a  related  rates  review  problem  for  Exam  3.  A  particle  moves 
√
with  constant  speed  3  on  the  parabola  y = x2 .  The  particle  is moving  away  from  the  origin.  What 
is  the  rate­of­change  of  the  distance  from  the  origin  to  the  particle when  the  distance  equals  2
5? 
The  independent  variable  is  time,  t.  The  dependent  variables  are  the  x­coordinate  of  the  particle, 
x(t),  the  y ­coordinate  of  the  particle,  y(t),  and  the  distance  L(t)  from  the  particle  to  (0, 0).  The 
constant  is  the  speed  s  =  3  of  the  particle.  The  constraints  are  that  the  point  moves  on  the 
parabola,

y = x , 

and  the  Pythagorean  theorem,

1.  Diﬀerentials  revisited.  In a typical applied  integration problem, the main diﬃculty  is ﬁnding 
the  integrand  and  the  limits  of  integration.  An  unknown  quantity,  for  instance  area  A,  depends 
on  some  other  quantity,  for  instance  the  x­coordinate.  The  method  is  to  allow  the  independent 
variable  x  vary  “inﬁnitesimally”  from  x  to  x + dx  and  then  use  geometry  or  science  to  deduce  the 
corresponding  variation  dA  of  the  unknown  quantity.  The  deduction  is  usually  intuitive  rather 
than  rigorous.  What  is  important  is whether  the  deduction  leads  to  the  correct  solution.  If  so,  the 
method  of Riemann  sums usually  gives  a  rigorous proof  of  the  intuitive  answer.  But  if  the  solution 
is  incorrect,  no  argument  will  prove  it  correct.

y  =  f (x),  y  =  g(x)?  This  problem  can  be  solved  directly:  the  area  is  the  diﬀerence  of  the  area 
between  y = f (x)  and  the  x­axis  and  the  area  between  y = g(x)  and  the  x­axis.  Each  of  these  is  a 
Riemann  integral. 

The  diﬀerential  method  asks,  what  is  the  inﬁnitesimal  change  in  the  area  A  as  x  varies  from  x 
to  x + dx?  The  inﬁnitesimal  region  is  a  rectangle  of  base  dx  and  height  f (x) − g(x).  Thus  the

Of course this  is the same answer as  in the  last paragraph.  But  for other applied  integral problems, 
the  diﬀerential method may  be  the  only method  that  works. 
Example.  Find  the  area  bounded  by  the  curve  y = x(x2  − 3)  and  a  horizontal  tangent  line. 
The  horizontal  tangent  lines  are  the  tangent  lines  to  the  curve  at  critical  points.  Setting  the 
derivative  equal  to  0  gives, 

f (x) − g(x)dx. 

dA = 

A = 

x=b 

dy 
= 3x 2  − 3 = 3(x − 1)(x + 1). 
dx 
Thus the critical points are x = ±1.  The function is odd, so symmetry suggests the area is the same 
regardless of the choice of critical point.  Thus, choose the critical point x = −1.  The corresponding 
value  of  the  function  is, 
y = (−1)((−1)2  − 3) = (−1)(−2) = 2. 
This  is  the  equation  of  the  horizontal  tangent  line.  Each  intersection  point  (b, f (b))  of  the  tangent 
line  with  y = x(x2  − 3)  occurs  at  a  solution  x = b  of, 
x(x 2  − 3) = 2. 
By  hypothesis,  x = −1  is  a  solution.  Thus  the  polynomial  factors  as, 
3 x  − 3x − 2 = (x + 1)(x 2  − x − 2) = (x + 1)2 (x − 2). 
The  remaining  intersection point  is  (2, 2).  So  the area bounded by  the  curve  y = x(x2 − 3) and  the

3.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolutions:  the  disk method.  If the region  in the xy ­plane bounded 
by  x =  a,  x =  b,  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  is  revolved  through  xyz ­space  about  the  x­axis,  what  is 
the volume of  the  resulting  solid?  The  solid  is  called a  solid  of  revolution.  The disk method  applies 
the method of diﬀerentials to solve this problem.  As x increases from x to x + dx, the corresponding 
inﬁnitesimal  region  of  the  solid  is  essentially  a  disk.  The  width  of  the  disk  is  dx.  The  area  of  the 
disk  is  π [f (x)]2 .  Thus  the  inﬁnitesimal  volume  of  the  disk  is, 
dV  = Area × width = π [f (x)]2dx.

4.  The  slice  method.  A  generalization  of  the  disk  method  is  the  slice  method.  The  problem 
is  to  ﬁnd  the  volume  of  a  region  bounded  by  the  planes  x  =  a  and  x  =  b  given  the  knowledge 
of  the  area  A(x)  of  the  slice  of  the  solid  by  the  plane  containing  (x, 0, 0)  parallel  to  the  yz ­plane. 
As  x  increases  from  x  to  x + dx,  the  corresponding  inﬁnitesimal  region  of  the  solid  is  essentially 
a  cylinder.  The  width  of  the  cylinder  is  dx.  And  the  area  is  the  area  A(x)  of  the  slice.  Thus  the 
inﬁnitesimal  volume  of  the  cylinder  is, 
dV  = Area × width = A(x)dx. 
�

Thus  the  volume  is, 

A(x)dx. 

dV  =

Example.  Find  the  volume  of  the  “corner”  region  bounded  by  the  xy ­plane,  the  xz ­plane,  the 
yz ­plane,  and  the  plane  containing  (L, 0, 0),  (0, L, 0)  and  (0, 0, L). 

This  region  is bounded by  the planes x = 0 and x = L.  The x­slice  of  the  region  is a  right  isosceles 
triangle.  The  base  and  altitude  of  the  triangle  both  equal  f (x),  where  y = f (x)  is  the  equation  of 
the  line  passing  through  (0, L)  and  (L, 0).  This  equation  is, 
f (x) = L − x. 

Thus  the  slice  area  is 

1 
A(x) =  base × altitude =  (L − x)2 .

5.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolution:  the  washer  method.  A  variation  on  the  disk  method 
is  the  washer  method. A  washer  is  the  solid  obtained  by  removing  from  a  larger  disk  a  concentric 
smaller  disk  of  the  same  width.  If  the  outer  radius  of  the  washer  is  ro  and  the  inner  radius  is  ri ,

Example.  The  main  part  of  a  dog  dish  is  a  solid  of  revolution  whose  radial  cross­section  is  a 
triangle  of  height  H  whose  base  has  inner  radius  Ri  and  outer  radius  Ro .  Find  the  volume  of 
material  used  to make  the  dog  dish. 
Note.  This  integral  was  only  set­up  in  lecture.  The  derivation  will  be  completed  in  recitation. 
Here  is  the  complete  derivation.  Denote  by  x  the  height  along  the  altitude  of  the  triangle.  Thus  x 
varies  from  x = 0  to  x = H .  When  x = H ,  the  inner  radius  and  outer  radius  are  each  equal  to  the 
average  (Ri  + Ro )/2  of  the  two  radii.  Both  radii  depend  linearly  on  x. 
The  equation  for  the  inner  radius  increases  linearly  from  ri  = Ri  at  x =  0  to  ri  = (Ri  + Ro )/2  at 
x = H .  Thus, 
H − x 
Ri  + Ro  x 
. 
ri (x) = Ri 
2  H

Similarly,  the  equation  for  the  outer  radius  decreases  linearly  from  ro  =  Ro  at  x  =  0  to  ri  = 
(Ri  + Ro )/2  at  x = H .  Thus,

Since  ro  − r2

i  is  a  diﬀerence  of  squares,  it  equals,

i  = (ro  + ri )(ro  − ri ).

This  is  interesting  in  its  own  right.  Using  this  factorization,  the  net  area  of  the  region  between  the

Note  the ﬁrst  factor  is  the  circumference  of  the  center  of  the  annulus.  And  the  second  factor  is  the 
radial  width  of  the  annulus.  Thus  the  area  of  an  annulus  is  the  circumference  of  the  center  times 
the  radial  width.

Back  to  the  problem,  the  center  of  each  washer  is  the  same,

And  the  radial  width  of  each  washer  is,

Both  of  these make  sense:  The  centers  are  constant  because  the  radial  cross­section  is  an  isosceles 
triangle.  And  the  width  decreases  linearly  from  Ro  − Ri  at  x  =  0  to  0  at  x  =  H .  Thus  the

Example.  Under  ideal  conditions,  a  wire­producing  machine  produces  wire  of  uniform  radius  r0 . 
Because of  small vibrations  in  the machine,  the actual  radius of  the wire varies as a  function of  the 
length, 

r(x) = r0  + A cos(ωx). 
The  quantity  A  is much  smaller  than  r0 .  What  is  the  average  radius  of  the  wire? 
Because  the  variation  is  periodic,  the  average  value  over  any  number  of  periods  equals  the  average 
value  of  one  period.  In  other  words,  compute  the  average  for  the  interval  0  ≤  x  ≤  2π/ω .  The 
�  2π/ω 
length  of  this  interval  is  2π/ω .  Thus  the  average  value  is, 
1 
(2π/ω)  0 
Using  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus,  this  equals,

(r0x + (A/ω) sin(ωx)|0

r0  + A cos(ωx)dx. 

Average =

This  evaluates  to,

r0 (2π/ω) = r0 .

Thus,  although  the  radius  varies  and  does  not  usually  equal  its  ideal  value  r0 ,  the  average  value  is 
indeed, 

Average =  r0 . 

2.  Average  values:  non­uniform  distribution.  It  often  happens  that  the  average  value  of  f (x)  is 
desired  in  a  situation  where  the  values  f (x)  are  not  all  uniformly  likely.  Typically,  the  probability 
that  x  has  value  in  the  range  from  x0  to  x0  + Δx  is  approximately, 
Prob(x0  ≤ x ≤ x0  + Δx) ≈ ρ(x0 )Δx,

ρ(x)dx = 1. 

for some nonnegative continuous function ρ(x).  The function ρ(x) is called a probability distribution. 
Assuming this approximation becomes arbitrarily good as the length Δx approaches zero, the exact 
� 
probability  that  x  has  value  in  the  range  x0  to  x1  is, 
Prob(x0  ≤ x ≤ x1 ) = 
x0

In  particular,  because  x must  take  value  somewhere  in  the  interval  [a, b],  the  total  probability  is  1. 
In  other  words, 
a 
This  is  called  the  normalization  condition. 
The  average  value  is  computed  as  before.  But  this  time,  each  value  y ∗  = f (x∗

k 
approximate  probability  that  x  takes  value  in  the  k th  interval,  ρ(x∗

Example.  A  particle  is  ﬁred  through  a  slit  and  strikes  a  screen  on  the  other  side.  Measuring  the

3.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolution:  the  shell method.  An alternative to the disk and washer

average  radius of  the  cylinders  is  r ,  if  the width of  the  region  is w  and  if  the height of  the  cylinders 
is  h,  then  the  approximate  volume  of  the  shell  is, 
Volume ≈= Circumference × height × width = 2πrhw. 

Take  the  plane  region  bounded  by  x =  a,  x =  b,  the  x­axis  and  the  curve  y  =  f (x).  Revolve  this 
region  about  the  y ­axis.  (Please  note:  In  the  disk  and  washer  method,  the  region  was  revolved 
about  the  x­axis.)  To  compute  the  corresponding  volume,  approximate  the  region  obtained  from 
x  to  x + dx  as  a  shell.  The  radius  of  the  shell  is  x.  The  height  of  the  shell  is  y = f (x).  The  width 
of  the  shell  is  dx.  Therefore  the  diﬀerential  element  of  volume  is,

how  much  more  eﬀort  was  required  for  the  shell  method.  The  lesson  is,  if  you  have  an  alternative

Homework.  Problem  Set  6  Part  I:  (a)  ­ (e);  Part  II:  Problem  1. 
Practice  Problems.  Course  Reader:  4E­2,  4E­5,  4E­7,  4F­1,  4F­6. 
1.  Parametric  equations.  To this point  in the course, plane curves were speciﬁed  in 1 of 2 ways. 
The  explicit  form,  or  graph  form  of  a  curve  in  Cartesian  coordinates  is  the  common  form, 
y = f (x), a ≤ x ≤ b. 
The  implicit  form  of  a  curve  in  Cartesian  coordinates  is  as  the  set  of  all  solutions  of  an  equation, 

F (x, y) = 0. 

Often a subset of this curve is speciﬁed by imposing extra conditions, e.g., the upper unit semicircle 
is  the  set  of  solutions  of  x2  + y 2  = 1  satisfying  the  extra  condition  y > 0. 
There  is  a  third  important  way  to  specify  a  curve:  using  parametric  equations.  Given  a  parameter 
�

t  varying  in  an  interval  a ≤ t ≤ b  and  given  functions  f (t)  and  g(t)  on  this  interval,  the  associated 
parametric  curve, 
x  =  f (t), 
y  =  g(t) 
is  simply  the  set of all pairs  (x, y) = (f (t), g(t)) as  t varies over  the  interval a ≤ t ≤ b.  We  consider 
only  the  case  where  f (t)  and  g(t)  are  piecewise  diﬀerentiable  functions  (more  advanced  courses 
discuss  some  pitfalls  if  f (t)  and  g(t)  are merely  continuous  functions). 
Examples.  A.  One  speciﬁcation  of  the  points  on  the  circle  of  radius  r  centered  at  (0, 0)  is  using 
�

the  angle  θ .  This  gives  rise  to  a  parametric  equation  with  parameter  θ , 
0 ≤ θ < 2π . 

x  =  r cos(θ), 
y  =  r sin(θ)

� 
B.  An  ellipse  centered  at  (0, 0)  whose  axes  equal  the  coordinate  axes  has  a  parametric  equation, 
0 ≤ θ < 2π . 

x  =  a cos(θ), 
y  =  b sin(θ)

C.  A  pro jectile  is  launched  from  an  initial  position  of  (x0 , y0 )  with  an  initial  velocity  vector  of 
magnitude  v0  at  an  angle  α  to  the  horizontal,  and  under  the  inﬂuence  of  constant  graviational 
� 
acceleration −g .  According  to Newton’s  laws of mechanics,  the position of  the pro jectile after  time 
t  is, 

x  = 
v0 cos(α)t + x0 , 
y  =  −(g/2)t2  + v0  sin(α)t + y0 
This  is  a  parametric  equation  where  time  t  is  the  parameter.  Even  when  some  other  quantity  is 
the  parameter,  it  is  often  useful  to  think  of  the  parameter  as  time.  Thus  the  curve  is  the  trail  left 
by  a  point,  or  perhaps  better,  the  tip  of  a  pen,  as  it moves  in  the  plane. 
2.  Implicitization.  Under  reasonable  hypotheses,  it  is  possible  to  turn  a  portion  of  an  implicit 
curve  into an explicit curve.  Similarly,  it should be possible to turn a portion of a parametric curve 
into  an  explicit  curve.  It  is  often  simpler  to  ﬁnd  an  implicit  equation  satisﬁed  by  a  parametric 
curve.  The  process  of  ﬁnding  an  implicit  equation  is  called  implicitization. 
Examples.  A.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  A  above,  by  the  Pythagorean  Theorem, 

0 ≤ t. 

x(θ)2  + y(θ)2  = r  cos  (θ) + r 2  sin2 (θ) = r  (cos2 (θ) + sin2 (θ)) = r . 
2 
2
2
2

Thus  the  parametric  equation  satisﬁes  the  implicit  equation, 

x2  + y 2  = r2 . 

B.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  B, 

(x(θ)/a)2  + (y(θ)/b)2  = cos  (θ) + sin2 (θ) = 1. 
2

Thus  the  parametric  equation  satisﬁes  the  implicit  equation, 

x2/a2  + y 2/b2  = 1. 

C.  For  the  parametric  curve  in  Example  C,  assuming  v0 cos(α)  is  nonzero,  the  equation  for  x  can 
be  solved  for  t, 
x − x0 
x = v0 cos(α)t + x0  ⇔ t = 
. 
v0 cos(α) 
This  can  then  be  substituted  into  the  equation  for  y  to  get  an  explicit  equation  for  the  curve, 
y = −g(x − x0 )2/(2v 2 
α)(x − x0
0  cos2 (α

)) + tan(

) + 
y0 .

In  going  from  a  parametric  equation  to  an  implicit  equation,  there  are  2  important  warnings  to 
keep  in mind: 

71 

18.01  Calculus 

Jason  Starr 
Fall  2005 

•	 A  parametric  equation  may  traverse  only  part  of  the  implicit  curve.  The  most  usual  reason 
is  that  the  parameter  t  is  restricted  to  a  certain  range.  A  closely  related  reason  is  that  the 
� 
functions  of  t  are  themselves  somehow  limited,  as  in  the  parametric  curve  lying  in  the  line 
y = x, 

x  =  cos(t), 
y  =  cos(t) 

A more  interesting reason  is that the  implicit curve may have more than one connected piece, 
� 
as  in  the  parametric  curve, 

2t/(1 − t2 ), 

x  =
y  =  (1 + t2 )/(1 − t2 ) 
As  t  varies,  this  parametric  curve  sweeps  out  the  top  branch  of  the  hyperbola  y 2  − x2  = 1. 
•	 A  parametric  equation  may  sweep  out  all  or  a  portion  of  the  implicit  curve  multiple  times. 
This  is  clear  in Examples A  and B:  as  θ  is  allowed  to  vary  over  the  interval  0 ≤ θ < 2nπ ,  the 
parametric  curve  completes  n  revolutions  of  the  implicit  curve. 

− 1 < t < 1.


3.  Arc  length.  Given  a  segment  of  curve,  what  is  the  length  of  the  curve?  Imagining  the  curve 
made of some ﬂexible extensible material  like wire, what  is the  length when the wire  is pulled taut? 
The  answer  is  called  the  arc  length,  s. 
The method for expressing arc  length  is an  integral  is by now familiar.  Break the  interval a ≤ t ≤ b 
into  a  large  number  n  of  subintervals  with  endpoints, 
a = t0  < t1  < · · · < tn−1  < tn  = b. 
Approximate  the  curve  on  each  subinterval  tk−1  ≤ t ≤ tk  by  a  line  segment.  The  line  segment  runs 
from  the  point, 

(xk−1 , yk−1 ) = (x(tk−1 ), y(tk−1 )), 

to  the  point, 

(xk , yk ) = (x(tk ), y(tk )). 
The  rise  and  run  of  the  line  segment  are, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1  ≈ x� (tk )Δtk , 
Δyk  = yk  − yk−1  ≈ y � (tk )Δtk . 
� 
�	
By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  the  length  of  the  line  segment  is, 
(Δxk )2  + (Δyk )2  ≈ 
(x� (tk ))2  + (y � (tk ))2Δtk . 

Δsk  =

segments,

This  is  a  Riemann  sum.  As  the  mesh  of  the  partition  tends  to  0,  the  Riemann  sums  tend  to  a

Taking  square  roots  gives  the  equation,

Thus  the  arc  length  of  the  arc  of  the  circle  from  θ = a  to  θ = b  is, 
θ=a 

r(b − a). 

rdθ = 

ds = 

ds 
dθ 

s = 

This  is,  in  fact,  our  deﬁnition  of  the  angle:  the  angle  θ  subtended  by  an  arc  of  a  circle  equals  the 
ratio  of  the  arc  length  by  the  radius  of  the  circle.  If  this  logic  sounds  circular,  it  is  perhaps  that 
nobody  ever  told  you  before  how  to deﬁne  the  length  of  the  arc  of  a  circle!  It  is  also  an  argument 
in  favor of the more natural deﬁnition of the angle as the ratio of the area  of the sector of the circle 
by  r2/2. 

Example  2.  This  is  not  a  single  example,  but  a  class  of  examples.  A  curve  in  explicit  form, 
� 
y = f (x),  a ≤ x ≤ b,  can  always  be  put  in  parametric  form, 

x  = 
t, 
y  =  f (t) 

a ≤ t ≤ b.

Homework.  Problem  Set  6  Part  I:  (f )–(h);  Part  II:  Problem  2  (a)  and  (c). 

Practice  Problems.  Course  Reader:  4G­1,  4G­4,  4G­6,  4H­1,  4H­3. 

1.  Surface  area  of  a  right  circular  cone.  Before  attacking  the  general  problem  of  the  surface 
area of a surface of revolution,  consider the simplest case of the area of a right circular cone of base 
radius  R  and  height  H .  The  slant  height  of  the  cone  is  the  length  of  any  line  segment  from  the 
vertex  to  a  point  on  the  base  circle.  By  the  Pythagorean  theorem,  the  slant  height  S  is, 
√

S  = 

R2  + H 2 . 

Imagine  the  cone  is  made  of  paper.  Make  an  incision  along  a  line  segment  from  the  vertex  to  the 
base circle.  The resulting piece of paper may be unfolded to  form a sector of a circle.  The radius of 
the  sector  is  the  slant height  s.  The  circumference  of  the  sector  is  the  circumference  of  the  original 
base  circle  2πr .  The  formula  for  the  area  and  circumference  of  a  sector  of  a  circle  give  the  identity, 
1 
Area  of  sector =  (Radius  of  sector) × (Circumference  of  sector). 
2 

Thus,  the  area  of  the  cone  equals, 

1 
A = (S )(2πR) = 
2 

πRS 

.

In  particular,  the  height H  is  involved  only  indirectly  (as H  depends  on H ). 
Next, consider a conical  band  obtained from a right circular cone of base radius R1  and slant height 
S1  by  removing  the  the  top  part  of  the  cone  of  base  radius  R2  and  slant  height  S2 .  In  particular, 
the  slant  height  of  the  band  is  the  diﬀerence, 
s = S2  − S1 , 

75 

18.01  Calculus 

Jason  Starr

and  the  average  radius  of  the  band  is  the  average  of  R1  and  R2 , 

By  similar  triangles, 

1 
r = (R1  + R2 ). 
2 

S2 = 
S1 
. 
R1  R2 

Rearranging  gives, 

R2S1  = R1S2 . 
Using  the  formula  above,  the  area  of  the  large  cone  is, 

and  the  area  of  the  small  cone  is, 

A1  = πR1S1 , 

A2  = πR2S2 . 

The  area  A  of  the  band  is  the  diﬀerence, 
A = A1  − A2  = π(R1S1  − R2S2 ). 

Since R2S1  equals R1S2 ,  the  formula  is unchanged by adding πR2S1  and  subtracting πR1S2  to get, 
A = π(R1S1  − R2S2 ) + π(R2S1  − R1S2 ) = π((R1  + R2 )S1  − (R1  + R2 )S2 ). 
Simplifying  and  substituting  R1  + R2  = 2r  and  S1  − S2  = 2  gives, 

A =  2

2.  Surface  area  of  a  surface  of  revolution.  Given  a  segment  of  a  parametric  curve, 

x  =  x(t), 
y  =  y(t) 

a ≤ t ≤ b 

the surface  of  revolution  is the surface obtained by revolving the segment through xyz ­space about 
the  y ­axis.  What  is  the  area  of  this  surface?  The  answer  is  called  the  surface  area. 

The method  for  computing  the  surface  area  is  so  close  to  the method  for  computing  the  arc  length 
of  the  curve,  the  details  will  be  skipped.  What  is  relevant  is  the  diﬀerential  element  of  surface 
area.  Given a  small  interval  from  t  to  t + dt,  approximate  the  segment of  the parametric  curve as a 
line  segment.  The  surface  obtained  by  revolving  a  line  segment  is  precisely  a  band  of  a  cone.  The

3.  Polar  coordinate  curves.  After  the  explicit, Cartesian  form  of  a  curve  as  a  graph,  y = f (x),

the  next  most  common  representation  is  using  polar  coordinates.  Given  a  function  r  =  r(θ)  and

� 
an  interval  a ≤ θ ≤ b,  the  associated  polar  coordinate  curve  is  the  parametric  curve, 
a ≤ θ ≤ b. 
x  =  r(θ) cos(θ), 
y  =  r(θ) sin(θ) 
� 
� 
For  each  point  on  the  curve,  the  distance  of  the  point  from  the  origin  is, 
√
+r,  r ≥ 0, 
| | 
−r, 
r2  =  r = 
x2  + y 2  = 
r < 0
�

Also, assuming the point does not equal the origin, the angle of the ray from the origin to the point 

is, 

Distance  from  origin = 

Angle = tan−1 (y/x) = tan−1 (tan(θ)) = 

θ , 
r > 0, 
θ + π ,  r < 0 

This  is  one  of  the most  confusing  aspects  of polar  curves.  The  symbols  r(θ)  and  θ  are  engrained  in 
mathematical  thinking  as  the  distance  and  angle  of  a  point  in  polar  coordinates.  But  for  a  polar 
coordinate  curve  these  are  simply  parameters.  They  are  very  closely  related  to,  but  often  diﬀerent 
from,  the actual distance and angle.  This  is easiest to think about by  imagining the point swerving 
through  the  origin  along  the  radius  line  to  the  opposite  ray  of  the  ray  given  by  θ .  In  other  words, 
the  point  “goes  negative”. 

Given a polar curve, it is often possible to ﬁnd an implicit Cartesian curve containg the polar curve. 

Examples.  A.  Let  a  be  a  positive  constant  and  consider  the  polar  curve, 

r(θ) = a. 

This  gives, 

r  = a  ⇔ 
2 
x2  + y 2  = a2 . 
2
Thus  the  polar  curve  is  contained  in  the  circle  of  radius  a. 

B.  Consider  the  polar  curve, 

r(θ) = 

a 
. 
sin(θ) 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  sin(θ)  gives, 
r sin(θ) = a ⇔  y = a. 

Thus  the  polar  curve  is  contained  in  the  horizontal  line  passing  through  (0, a). 

79 

18.01  Calculus 

Jason  Starr

C.  Consider  the  polar  curve, 

r = 2a cos(θ), 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  r  gives, 
r 2  = 2ar cos(θ) ⇔ x  + y 2  = 2ax. 
2 

Simplifying  this  gives  the  equation, 

(x − a)2  + y 2  = a2 . 

This  is  the  equation  of  the  circle  of  radius  a  centered  at  (a, 0). 

4.  Sketching  polar  curves.  Given  a  polar  curve,  how  are  we  to  sketch  it?  For  deﬁniteness, 
consider  the  polar  curve, 
r(θ) = cos(2θ),  −π/4 ≤ θ ≤ 7π/4. 
This  curves  is  called  the  four­leaved  rose.  A  similar  curve  occurs  in  Part  II,  Problem  2  of  Problem 
Set  6. 

1.  Find  the  range  of  θ.  In  almost  every  case,  this  will  be  given.  In  this  case,  the  range  is  given 
as  −π/4 ≤  θ  ≤  7π/4.  In  some  cases,  the  range  must  be  determined.  For  instance,  to  sketch  only 
the  “leaf ”  of  the  rose  containing  (1, 0),  ﬁrst  the  endpoints  of  this  leaf must  be  found. 

2.  Determine  when  r  is  positive,  zero  or  negative.  This  is  easiest  to  keep  track  of  with  a 
table. 

θ 
−π/4 
−π/4 < θ < π/4 
π/4 
π/4 < θ < 3π/4 
3π/4 
3π/4 < θ < 5π/4 
5π/4 
5π/4 < θ < 7π/4 

r 
0 
r > 0 
0 
r < 0 
0 
r > 0 
0 
r < 0 

The curve crosses the origin when θ = −π/4, π/4, 3π/4, and 5π/4.  The curve “goes negative” when 
π/4 < θ < 3π/4  and  when  5π/4 < θ < 7π/4. 
3.  Find  the  extremal  values  of  |r|.  A  local maximum  of  r is  either  a  point where  r  is  positive  and 
| |
a  local  maximum  or  a  point  where  r  is  negative  and  a  local  minimum.  Similarly  for  local  minima 
of  |r|.  Typically,  local maxima  of  r occur  either  at  endpoints  of  the  interval  or  points where  r � (θ)
| |
is  zero  (occasionally  at  discontinuity  points,  or  nondiﬀerentiable  points).  Local  minima  occur  at 
such  points,  but  also  occur  everytime  the  curve  crosses  the  origin  (so  that  |r|  equals  0). 

80 

18.01  Calculus 

Jason  Starr 
Fall  2005 

In  our  example,  the  local minima  are  all  points  where  r = 0,  enumerated  above.  The  derivative  of 
r  is, 
r � (θ) = −2 sin(2θ). 
The  critical  points  are  θ  = 0, π/2, π  and  3π/2.  For  θ  =  0  and  θ  =  π ,  r  is  positive  and  maximum. 
For θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/3, r  is negative and minimum.  Thus each critical point is a local maximum 
of  |r|.  The  value  of  r at  each  critical  point  is  1. 
| | 
4.  Find  the  asymptotes.  This  is  a  bit  diﬃcult  with  a  polar  curve.  What  is  easier  is  to  ﬁnd  a  line 
parallel  to  an  asymptote.  Whenever, 

lim r(θ) = +∞, 
θ→a 

(or  the  same  with  a  right­hand  limit  or  left­hand  limit),  there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  ray 
θ = a.  Whenever, 
lim r(θ) = −∞, 
θ→a 
there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  ray  θ = a + π . 
In  our  example,  r(θ)  never  limits  to  ±∞.  Thus  there  are  no  asymptotes.  But  in  Example  B., 
r  =  a/ sin(θ),  r  tends  to  +∞  as  θ  tends  to  0  from  above  and  as  θ  tends  to  π  from  below.  Thus 
there  is  an  asymptote  parallel  to  the  x­axis.  Since  the  explicit  equation  is  y  =  a,  which  is  a  line 
parallel  to  the  x­axis,  this  is  correct. 

5.  Find  the  tangent  direction  at  important  points.  This  will  be  discussed  further  next  time.  The 
most  important  tangent  directions  are  when  the  curve  crosses  the  origin,  and  critical  points  of  r . 
If  r(θ) =  0  and  r � (θ) =  0,  the  tangent  line  of  the  curve  has  angle  θ .  If  r � (θ) =  0  and  r(θ) =  0,  the 
tangent  line  has  angle  θ ± π/2,  i.e.,  the  tangent  line  is  orthogonal  to  the  radius  through  the  point. 
Both  of  these  are  consequences  of  a  more  general  formula.  The  angle  ψ  between  the  tangent  line 
and  the  radius  satisﬁes, 

r(θ)
. 
r � (θ) 
In  the  example,  r �  is  nonzero  whenever  r  is  zero.  Thus  the  tangent  direction  of  the  curve  as  it 
crosses  the  origin  is  just  the  direction  of  the  limiting  radius. 

tan(ψ) = 

This  is  now  ample  information  to  sketch  the  four­leaved  rose.  Up  to  a  rotation  of  π/4,  the  sketch 
is  the  same  as  in  Figure  16.11  on  p.  566  of  the  textbook  (the  sketch  was  also  given  in  lecture).

Given  a  parametric  curve,

dx = f � (t)dt,  dy = g � (t)dt.

2.  Tangent  lines  for  polar  curves.  Although  the  formula  above  is  perfectly  correct,  it  is  a  bit 
long  to  remember.  There  is  a  slightly  diﬀerent  packaging  that  is much  easier  to  remember.  Deﬁne 
α  to  be  the  angle  from  the  horizontal  ray  emanating  from  (x(θ), y(θ))  in  the  positive  x­direction, 
and the tangent line.  To be precise, there are two such angles, diﬀering by π .  The deﬁning equation 
for  α  is, 

tan(α) = 

dy

tan(θ) =

x 

Deﬁne  ψ  to  be  the  diﬀerence  between  α  and  θ , 
ψ = α − θ . 

The  angle  addition/subtraction  formulas  for  tan(θ)  are, 
tan(φ1 ) + tan(φ2 ) 
,  tan(φ1  − φ1 ) = 
1 − tan(φ1 ) tan(φ2 ) 

tan(φ1  + φ2 ) = 

tan(φ1 ) − tan(φ2 ) 
.

Therefore, 

tan(ψ) = tan(α − θ) =

tan(ψ) = 

To  simplify  this,  imagine  multiplying  both  numerator  and  denominator  by  xdx  and  manipulate 
formally, 
xdy − ydx
. 
xdx + ydy

correct  equation.

To  simplify  this,  write  θ = 2(θ/2)  and  use  the  double­angle  formulas  to  get,

1 + cos(2(θ/2)) 
. 
−2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) 
− sin(2(θ/2))

2 cos2 (θ/2) 
−2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) 

= − cot(θ/2). 

Of  course  there  is  an  identity, 

− cot(u) = tan(u − π/2). 

Altogether,  this  gives, 

Therefore, 

tan(ψ) = − cot(θ/2) = tan(θ/2 − π/2). 

ψ = 

(θ − π)/2. 

Since  α  equals  θ + ψ ,  this  gives, 

(3θ − π)/2. 
α = 
In  particular,  the  angle  of  the  tangent  line  to  the  cardioid  at  θ = π/2  is  α = π/4.

3.  Arc  length  in  polar  coordinates.  As  discussed  previously,  the  formula  for  arc  length  of  a 
parametric  curve  is, 
ds = (dx/dt)2  + (dy/dt)2dt. 
In  the  case  of  a  parametric  curve,  this  becomes  a  bit  simpler.  The  diﬀerentials  are, 
dx = (r � (θ) cos(θ) − r(θ) sin(θ))dθ, 
dy = (r � (θ) sin(θ) + r(θ) cos(θ))dθ. 

Squaring  gives, 

(dx)2  = ((r � )2 cos2 (θ) − 2rr �  sin(θ) cos(θ) + r2  sin2 (θ))(dθ)2 , 
(dy)2  = ((r � )2  sin2 (θ) + 2rr �  sin(θ) cos(θ) + r2 cos2 (θ))(dθ)2 .

ds =  � 
Taking  square  roots  gives  the  diﬀerential  element  of  arc  length  for  a  polar  curve, 
[r � (θ)]2  + [r(θ)]2dθ . 

Example.  For  the  cardioid, 

the  derivative  is, 

Thus, 

r(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)), 

r � (θ) = −a sin(θ). 

(r � )2  + r  = a  (1 + cos(θ))2  + (−a sin(θ))2  = a  (1 + 2 cos(θ) + cos 2 (θ)) + a 2  sin2 (θ).

This  simpliﬁes  to,

To  simplify  this  further,  write  θ = 2(θ/2)  and  use  the  double­angle  formula  to  get, 
2a  (1 + cos(2(θ/2))) = 2a  (1 + cos 2 (θ/2) − sin2 (θ/2)) = 2a  (2 cos 2 (θ/2)) = 4a  cos  (θ/2).

is  the  surface  area  of  this  apple?

Since  we  are  revolving  about  the  x­axis,  the  radius  of  each  slice  is  y .  Therefore  the  diﬀerential 
element  of  surface  area  is, 

dA = 2πyds. 
Substituting  in  y = r(θ) sin(θ) = a(1 + cos(θ)) sin(θ),  and  substituting  in  for  ds  gives, 

dA = 2π [a(1 + cos(θ)) sin(θ)](2a cos(θ/2)dθ).

dA = 4πa 2 (2 cos 2 (θ/2))(2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)) cos(θ/2)dθ = 16πa 2 cos  (θ/2) sin(θ/2)dθ.

1.  Inverse  functions.  Let  a, b, s  and  t  be  constants.  Let  y  =  f (x)  be  a  function  deﬁned  on  the 
interval, 
a ≤ x ≤ b, 

and  whose  values  are  in  the  interval, 

s ≤ y ≤ t. 
Does  there  exist  a  function  x = g(y)  deﬁned  on  the  interval, 
s ≤ y ≤ t, 

whose  values  are  in  the  interval, 

satisfying  the  two  conditions, 

a ≤ x ≤ b, 

g(f (x)) = x,  f (g(y)) = y  ? 
If  such  a  function  g  exists,  it  is  called  an  inverse  function  of  f ,  and  it  is  denoted  by  f −1 (y).  Also, 
the original  function f (x)  is  called  invertible.  There  is  some  chance of  confusion with  the other use

of  “invertible”,  namely  that  1/f (x)  is  always  deﬁned.  We will  be  careful  to  specify  the meaning  of 
“invertible”. 
There are 2 necessary conditions for f  to have an inverse function.  Assume f  has an inverse function 
g .  Let  x1 , x2  be  a  pair  of  numbers  in  [a, b].  If  f (x1 )  equals  f (x2 ),  then  also, 

x1  = g(f (x1 )) = g(f (x2 )) = x2 , 

i.e., x1  equals x2 .  In other words,  two distinct  inputs x1  and x2  give two distinct outputs f (x1 ) and 
f (x2 ).  A  function  satisfying  this  condition  is  called  one­to­one,  because  to  every  output,  there  is 
at most  one  input.  This  is  the  ﬁrst  necessary  condition:  every  invertible  function  is  one­to­one. 
Next,  for  every  number  y  in  [s, t],  there  is  a  number  x  in  [a, b]  such  that  y  =  f (x).  In  fact,  just 
take  x  to  be  g(y);  then  f (x)  equals  f (g(y)), which  equals  y .  A  function  satisfying  this  condition  is 
called  onto.  This  is  the  second  necessary  condition:  every  invertible  function  is  onto. 
Together,  this  says  that  an  invertible  function  is  one­to­one  and  onto.  In  fact,  the  converse  is  also 
true:  every  one­to­one  and  onto  function  is  invertible.  This  is  easy  to  check,  but  we  will  not  prove 
it  in  this  class. 
Remark:  In checking that f  is one­to­one and onto, the choice of intervals [a, b] and [c, d] are vital. 
A  simple  example  comes  from  f (x) = sin(x).  For  the  interval  [−π/2, π , 2]  and  [−1, 1],  the  function 
f (x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto.  But  for  many  other  choices  of  these  intervals,  the  function  is  neither 
one­to­one  nor  onto. 
2.  The  graph  of  an  inverse  function.  How  should  we  think  of  an  inverse  function?  One  way 
is  graphically.  The  graph  of  the  function  y  =  f −1 (x)  is  the  same  as  the  graph  of  f (y) =  x.  This 
is  simply  the  usual  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  with  the  roles  of  x  and  y  reversed.  What  this  translates  to 
is,  the  graph  of  f −1  is  the  same  as  the  graph  of  f  with  the  roles  of  the  x­axis  and  y ­axis  reversed. 
The  simplest way  to  get  the  graph  of  f −1 (x)  is  simply  to  reﬂect  the  graph  of  f (x)  through  the  45◦ 
line  y = x. 
3.  The  inverse  trigonometric  functions.  The  function  sin(x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto  on 
[−π/2, π/2],  taking  values  in  [−1, 1].  Thus  there  is  an  inverse  function  sin−1 (x)  deﬁned  on  the 
interval  [−1, 1],  taking values  in  [−π/2, π/2].  The graph of sin−1 (x)  is an  increasing  function whose 
lower  left  endpoint  is  (−1, −π/2)  and  whose  upper  right  endpoint  is  (1, π/2). 
The function cos(x) is one­to­one and onto on [0, π ], taking values in [−1, 1].  Thus there is an inverse 
function  cos−1 (x)  deﬁned  on  the  interval  [−1, 1],  taking  values  in  [0, π ].  The  graph  of  cos−1 (x)  is  a 
decreasing  function  whose  upper  left  endpoint  is  (−1, π)  and  whose  lower  right  endpoing  is  (1, 0). 
The  function  tan(x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto  on  (−π/2, π/2),  taking  values  in  the  whole  real  line. 
Thus there is an inverse function tan−1 (x) deﬁned on the whole real line, taking values in (−π/2, π/2). 
The  graph  is  an  increasing  function  that  is  asymptotic  to  the  line  y  =  −π/2  as  x  →  −∞,  and 
asymptotic  to  the  line  y = +π/2  as  x → +∞. 
4.  Derivatives  of  inverse  functions.  A  particular  simple  formulation  of  the  chain  rule  is  the 
diﬀerential  formulation, 
df (u) = f � (u)du.

If  f  has  an  inverse  function  g(x),  let  u  be  g(x).  Then  this  gives, 
df (g(x)) = f � (g(x))dg(x). 

On  the  other  hand,  f (g(x))  equals  x.  This  gives  the  formula, 
dx = f � (g(x))dg(x). 

Solving  for  dg/dx  gives, 

d 
(g(x)) = 
dx 
This  is  the  formula  for  the  derivative  of  an  inverse  function. 


1/f � (g(x)). 

In  fact, we have seen this  formula before.  It  is how we computed the derivative of  ln(x),  the  inverse

x
function  of  e :

eln(x)  = 
5.  Derivatives  of  the  inverse  trigonometric  functions.  Because  the  derivative  of  sin(x)  is 
cos(x),  the  formula  above  gives,

(sin−1 (x)) =

This  isn’t  very  useful.  A  simple  argument makes  it much more  useful.  Denote  sin−1 (x)  by  θ .  Thus 
sin(θ) = x.  Also,  the  formula  for  the  derivative  is  a  bit  simpler, 

d 
(sin−1 (x)) = 
dx

cos(θ) 

By  the  Pythagorean  theorem, 

Solving  gives, 

� 
sin2 (θ) + cos 2 (θ) = 1. 
√
1 − x . 
1 − sin2 (θ) = 
cos(θ) =

This  gives  a  very  useful  formula  for  the  derivative  of  sin−1 (x), 
√
1/

1 − x2 . 

d 
(sin−1 (x)) = 
dx 

There  is  a  very  similar  derivation  that, 

d 
(cos−1 (x)) =

√
−1/

function,

Finally,  because  the  derivative  of  tan(x)  is  sec2 (x),  the  formula  gives, 
(tan−1 (x)) = 

1 
d 
. 
sec2 (tan−1 (x)) 
dx
Again  introduce  θ = tan−1 (x).  Then  the  formula  for  the  derivative  is, 
d 
1 
(tan−1 (x)) = 
. 
sec2 (θ) 
dx

But  the  Pythagorean  theorem  implies, 

2
sec 

(θ) = 1 + tan 2 (θ) = 1 + x

. 

This  ﬁnally  gives  a  very  useful  formula  for  the  derivative  of  tan(x), 
(tan−1 (x)) =  1/(1 + x2 ).

d 
dx
Notice,  in  particular,  that  the  denominator  is  never  zero.  This  is  closely  related  to  the  fact  that 
tan−1 (x)  is  deﬁned  on  the  entire  real  line. 
6.  Hyperbolic  trigonometric  functions.  The  trigonometric  functions  are  very  useful  for  dis­
� 
cussing  point  on  the  unit  circle  x2  + y 2  = 1,  because  the  circle  is  the  parametric  curve, 

x  =  cos(θ), 
y  = 
sin(θ) 
Are  there  analogous  continuous  functions  for  the  points  on  the  hyperbola  x2  − y 2  = 1? 
At  ﬁrst  blush,  the  answer  is  no.  The  problem  is  that  the  hyperbola  has  two  parts:  one  part  is  in 
the  half­plane  where  x  >  0,  and  the  other  part  is  in  the  half­plane  where  x  <  0.  Because  of  the 
intermediate  value  theorem,  a  continuous  function  x  =  f (t)  cannot  jump  from  x  >  0  to  x  <  0  or 
vice  versa  without  crossing  x  =  0.  Thus,  reﬁne  the  question:  Are  there  continuous  functions  for 
the  part  of  the  hyperbola  in  the  half­plane  where  x > 0? 
The answer to this question  is yes.  The corresponding  functions are called hyperbolic  trigonometric 
functions  or, more  often,  simply  hyperbolic  functions.  They  are  deﬁned  as  follows, 
1 
cosh(t) =  (e t  + e−t ),

The  ﬁrst  observation  is  that,

(e 2t  − 2 + e−2t ).

Taking  the  diﬀerence  of  these, most  of  the  terms  cancel, 
4 
cosh2 (t) − sinh2 (t) = 
((2) − (−2)) =  = 1. 
4 
� 

This  proves  that  the  parametric  curve, 

1

x  =  cosh(t), 
sinh(t) 
y  = 
is  contained  in  the  right­half  of  the  hyperbola  x2  − y 2  = 1.  We  will  see  next  time  that  there  is  an 
inverse  function of  sinh(t),  from which  it  follows  that  every  point  in  the  right­half of  the hyperbola 
occurs  for  exactly  one value of  t.  Thus  the parametric  curve  exactly  traces out  the  right­half of  the 
hyperbola. 

7.  The  derivatives  of  the  hyperbolic  functions.  The  derivatives  of  the  hyperbolic  functions 
are  straightforward.  The  formulas  are  very  similar  to  the  formulas  in  the  trigonometric  case,  but 
slightly  diﬀerent.  Try  not  to  confuse  them.

1.  Inverse hyperbolic  functions.  There are a few other useful formulas for hyperbolic functions; 
for  instance,  the  analogues  of  the  angle­addition  formulas, 

sinh(s + t) = sinh(s) cosh(t) + cosh(s) sinh(t), 

cosh(s + t) = cosh(s) cosh(t) + sinh(s) sinh(t). 

These  imply  the  double­angle  formulas, 

sinh(2t) = 2 sinh(t) cosh(t), 
cosh(2t) = cosh2 (t) + sinh2 (t) = 2 cosh2 (t) − 1 = 2 sinh2 (t) + 1. 
From  these  follow  the  analogues  of  the  half­angle  formulas, 
(cosh(t) − 1),

sinh2 (t/2) = 

cosh2 (t/2) =

(cosh(t) + 1).

A beautiful  feature of hyperbolic  functions  is that their  inverse  functions can be expressed  in terms 
of  simpler  functions.  The  inverse  function  sinh−1 (x)  of  sinh(x)  is  deﬁned  on  the  whole  real  line. 
By  deﬁnition, 
sinh−1 (x) = y  if  and  only  if  sinh(y) = x. 
This  second  equation  can  be  written  out  as, 
1 
(ey  − e−y ) = x. 
2 

Substituting  z = ey  gives, 

1 
(z − z−1 ) = x. 
2 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  2z  gives, 
2 z  − 1 = 2xz ⇔ z 2  − 2xz − 1 = 0. 

Completing  the  square  gives, 

Taking  square  roots  gives, 

(z − x)2  = x 2  + 1. 
√

z = x ±

x2  + 1.

Since  z  equals  ey ,  z  is  positive.  Thus,  the  correct  square  root  is, 
√
z = x + 

x2  + 1. 
√
y = ln(z ) = ln(x + 

x2  + 1). 

Finally  this  gives, 

Therefore,  the  formula  for  the  inverse  hyperbolic  sine  is, 
√
sinh−1 (x) = 
ln(x + 

x2  + 1). 

The  same  type  of  argument  also  gives,

3.  Inverse substitution.  The derivatives of inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions 
x2  − 1)  equals  cosh−1 (x) + C . 
allow  us  to  compute  more  antiderivatives  than  before,  e.g.,  dx/(
Essentially  this  comes  down  to  making  a  direct  substitution  of  an  inverse  function,  e.g.,  u  = 
cosh−1 (x).  However,  this  is  logically  equivalent  to  making  an  inverse  substition,  x  =  cosh(u). 
When  the  integrand  is  more  complicated,  inverse  substitution  is  usually  simpler  and  faster  than 
direct  substitution  of  an  inverse  function. 
� 
Example.  Compute  the  following  antiderivative, 
√
a2  − x2dx. 

This  is  not  quite  the  derivative  of  an  inverse  function  above.  However,  it  is  clear  that  inverse 
substituting  x = a sin(θ)  will  simplify  the  integrand,  because 
a  − x  = a  − (a sin(θ))2  = a  (1 − sin2 (θ)) = a  cos  (θ).

Notice,  these  two  integrals  are  the  same  type  that  occurred  with  inverse  hyperbolic  substitution. 
But  they  came  up more  quickly:  rational  inverse  substitution  is more  eﬃcient  than  inverse  hyper­
bolic  substitution  for  this  problem.  However,  both  require  a  further  inverse  trigonometric  substi­
tution.  So  inverse  trigonometric  substitution  is  the most  eﬃcient  for  this  problem.

1.  Review  of  inverse  substitution  and  another  example.  Recall  the  general  strategy  for 
� 
ﬁnding  an  antiderivative  of  the  form, 
√
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 
F (x, 
√
dx. 
G(x, 
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 
� 
For  deﬁniteness,  consider  the  example, 

√

2x
dx,
x2  − 2ax + 2a2 

where  a  is  a  constant. 
Step  1.  Complete  the  square.  Complete  the  square of  the  expression Ax2 + Bx + C ,  inside  the 
radical.  In  the  example, 
x  − 2ax + 2a 2  = (x − a)2  + a . 
2 
2

Step  2.  Make  a  linear  change  of  coordinates.  Make a linear change of coordinates to simplify 
the  quadratic  term  to  one  of  the  3  types:  a2  − x ,  x − a ,  or  x2  + a .  In  the  example,  this means 
2 
2
2
2
making  the  linear  change  of  variables, 

u = x − a, du = dx. 
� 
� 
The  new  quadratic  term  is  u2  + a ,  the  third  type.  The  new  antiderivative  is,

u2  + 2u + a

du = 

Step  3.  Use  inverse  substitution  to  eliminate  the  radicals.  There  is a choice of  inverse sub­
stitution:  trigonometric, hyperbolic or  rational.  When  starting out,  it  is a good  idea to experiment 
with  all  3.  On  an  exam,  usually  one  choice  will  be  suggested  (or  even  demanded).  When  no  other 
guidance  is given,  trigonometric substitution  is a good starting point (because you are already very 
familiar  with  trigonometric  functions). 

In  the  example,  to  eliminate  the  radical,  the  correct  inverse  trigonometric  substitution  is, 

u = a tan(θ),  du = a sec 2 (θ)dθ. 

This  is  because  the  quadratic  term  becomes, 

u  + a  = a  tan  (θ) + a 2  = a  sec  (θ). 
2

With  this  substitution,  the  new  antiderivative  is,

a2  sec2 (θ) 

a sec 2 (θ)dθ.

This  simpliﬁes  to,

Step  4.  Compute  the  new  antiderivative.  If  this were  only  as  simple  as  it  sounds,  how much 
easier  calculus  would  be!  This  step  is  often  diﬃcult  in  itself.  Often  it  requires  at  least  one  more 
direct  substitution.  Sometimes,  it  also  requires  a  partial  fractions  decomposition.  We  will  return 
to  this  step  below. 

Step  5.  Back­substitute.  This  is always a  step  for a method using direct  substitution or  inverse 
substitution.  This  step  frequently  introduces  terms  like  cos(tan−1 (x)).  Time­permitting  (or  when 
speciﬁcally  instructed  to  do  so),  these  terms  should  be  simplifed  using  the  right­triangle  method 
from  lecture, 
√
θ = tan−1 (x), x/1 = tan(θ) = Opposite/Adjacent, Hypotenuse = 
√
1/

cos(θ) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = 

1 + x , 
2

1 + 
x2 .

Step  6.  Check  your  answer.  When  feasible,  check your answer.  Since diﬀerentiation  is so much 
faster  than  antidiﬀerentiation,  it  is  usually  quite  easy  to  check  an  antiderivative  is  correct.

Example.  The  tricky  part  is,  of  course,  Step  4.  In  the  example,  the  integral  broke  into  3  terms,

antiderivatives  gives  both  of  them. 

2.  Antidiﬀerentiating  simple  rational  expressions.  A  rational  expression  is  a  fraction  of 
polynomials,  F (x)/G(x).  These  frequently  arise  in  Step  4  of  the  algorithm  above.  From  the  point 
of  view  of  antidiﬀerentiation,  the  simplest  rational  expressions  are  either  polynomials, 
+ · · ·
q(x) = anx n  + an−1x n−1 

+ a1x + a0 ,

or  else  partial  fractions,

(x − a)m

((x − a)2  + b2 )m 

C

((x − a)2  + b2 )m 

and 

These  2  kinds  come  up  less  often  than  the  ﬁrst  kind.  But  they  do  come  up,  for  instance,  when 
studying  Laplace  transforms  in  18.03.  Both  polynomials  and  partial  fractions  are  (relatively)  easy

to  antidiﬀerentiate.  The  antiderivative  of  a  polynomial  is,

3.  Simplifying  rational  expressions:  division  and  factoring Many  rational  expressions  that 
come  up  are  not  of  the  simple  kinds  above.  The  goal  is  to  express  an  arbitrary  rational  expression 
as  the  sum  of  a  polynomial  and  partial  fractions.  The  ﬁrst  step  is  polynomial  division.  Given  a 
fraction  F (x)/G(x),  apply  polynomial  division  to  get  a  factorization  with  remainder, 

F (x) = q(x)G(x) + r(x), 

where  q(x)  is  a  polynomial  and  r(x)  is  a  polynomial  of  degree  less  than  deg(G(x)).  This  leads  to 
the  reduced  form  of  a  rational  expression, 

F (x) 
G(x) 

= q(x) + 

r(x) 
. 
G(x) 

Example.  I  forgot  the  example  from  lecture.  Here  is  a  similar  example.  Find  the  reduced  form  of 
(x3  + 1)/(x2  + 3x + 2).  The  polynomial  division  algorithm  gives, 
3 x  + 1 = (x 2  + 3x + 2)(x − 3) + (7x + 7), 
Thus  q(x)  is  x − 3  and  r(x)  is  7x + 7.  So  the  reduced  form  is, 
x3  + 1 
x2  + 3x + 2 

7x+7 
x2+3x+2 .

x −

The next step is to factor the denominator into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors, 
G(x) = A(x − a1 )m1  · (x − a2 )m2

· ((x − α1 )2  + b2

Here  k  and  l  are  nonnegative  integers  and  m1 , . . . , mk , n1 , . . . , nl  are  positive  integers.  Also, 
a1 , . . . , ak ,  α1 , . . . , αl ,  and  β1 , . . . , βl  are  real  numbers.  The  last  l  factors  were  not  discussed  in 
lecture  until  the  end  of  lecture.  Although  they  are  important,  they  do  not  often  come  up  in  this 
course. 

The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Algebra  asserts  that  every  polynomial  with  real  coeﬃcients  has  a 
factorization  as  above.  However,  ﬁnding  the  factorization  can be very diﬃcult.  In  all  exercises  and 
exam problems,  either the  factorization  is easy, or the  factorization will be given to you.  Whenever 
possible,  cancel  common  factors  from  the  numerator  and  denominator. 

Example.  In  the  example,  the  quadratic  formula  gives  the  factorization, 

x 2  + 3x + 2 = 

(x

x+ 2)( + 1). 

The numerator r(x)  is 7(x + 1).  Thus the numerator and denominator have a common  factor.  This 
leads  to  a  better  reduced  form, 

x3  + 1 
x2  + 3x + 2 

= x − 3 +

x + 2

4.  Simplifying  rational  expressions:  partial  fraction  decomposition.  Using  the  last  part, 
every  rational  expression  can  be  written  in  the  form,

common  factor  with  H (x).  This  can  be  further  simpliﬁed  using  partial  fraction  decomposition.  It

One  approach,  which  always  works  but  is  quite  ineﬃcient,  is  simply  to  multiply  all  terms  by  the 
denominator H (x),  and  then  gather  coeﬃcients  of  powers  of  x.  This will  give  a  collection  of  linear 
equations  in  the  unknowns  Ci,j ,  Di,j  and  Ei,j .  There  is  a  unique  solution  of  this  set  of  linear 
equations.  Methods  of  linear  algebra,  e.g., Gauss­Jordan  elimination,  give  an  algorithm  for ﬁnding 
the  solution. 

Example.  Find  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  of, 

1 
. 
1 − x2 
In  fact  this  was  Problem  3(a),  Part  II  of  Problem  Set  4.  The  partial  fraction  decomposition  will

+ 
1 − x2 
x − 1 
=
x + 1 
Multiplying  both  sides  of  the  equation  by  x2  − 1 = (x + 1)(x − 1)  gives, 
−1 = A(x − 1) + B (x + 1) = (A + B )x + (B − A). 
�

This  gives  the  system  of  2  linear  equations  in  2  unknowns, 

A  +  B  = 0, 
+  B  =  −1
−A 
Solving  the  ﬁrst  equation  for  B  = −A  and  plugging  this  into  the  second  equation  gives, 
1 
⇔ 
−A + (−A) = −1
⇔
2A = 1  A = 
.
2 
Thus  B  = −A = −1/2.  So  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  is,

equals  the  value,

Ci,mi  = 
. 
H (x)/(x − ai )mi 
x=ai 
The  proof  is  quite  simple.  Multiply  every  term  in  the  partial  fraction decomposition  by  (x − ai )mi . 
One  term  is  (x − ai )mi (Ci,mi /(x − ai )mi ) =  Ci,mi .  Every  other  term  has  a  factor  (x − ai )  that  is 
not  cancelled  by  the  denominator.  Thus  plugging  in  x  =  ai ,  every  other  term  is  0.  And  the  only 
remaining  term  is  Ai,mi .

As  this  example  illustrates,  the  Heaviside  cover­up  method  does  not  always  determine  all  coeﬃ­
cients.  However,  it  reduces  the  number  of  coeﬃcients.  To  ﬁnd  the  remaining  coeﬃcients,  either 
clear denominators, or else substitute for x some useful numbers (where H (x) is nonzero), and solve 
the  resulting  linear  equations.

1.  Integration  by  parts.  The  diﬀerential  form  of  the  product  rule  is, 

d(uv) = udv + vdu. 

An  equivalent  form  is, 

udv = d(uv) − vdu. 
� 
� 
This  gives  a  very  useful  antidiﬀerentiation  formula, 
udv = uv −

This  formula  is  integration  by  parts.

answer. 
2.  How to use integration by parts.  The goal of integration by parts is to replace a complicated 
integral,  udv ,  by  a  simpler  integral  vdu.  What  this  usually means  is  that  du  should  be  simpler 
than  u,  and  v  should  be  no  more  complicated  than  dv .  This  was  the  case  in  the  last  example. 
However,  occasionally  this  is  not  the  case. 
� 
Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  compute  the  antiderivative, 

ln(x)dx. 

There  is very  little  choice here,  if we  are  to use  only  integration by parts.  Set u  to be  ln(x)  and  set 
dv  to  be  dx.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

u = ln(x),  dv = dx 
v = x 
du = dx/x, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 

dx. 

Using  integration  by  parts, 

� 
� 
The  new  integral  is  easy  to  evaluate.  Altogether  this  gives, 

� 
vdu, 
ln(x)dx = x ln(x) − 

ln(x)dx = 

x ln(x) − x + C . 

Notice this example does not follow the general rule.  The integral v = x is strictly more complicated 
than  dv  =  dx.  However,  du =  dx/x  is  much  simpler  than  u =  ln(x).  So  vdu =  dx  is  simpler  than 
udv  =  ln(x)dx.  The  lesson  is  to  be  ﬂexible  when  antidiﬀerentiating.  Try  diﬀerent  things,  and  see 
which  one  works.  For  example,  another  approach  to  this  problem,  which  ultimately  comes  down 
to  integration  by  parts  again,  is  to make  an  inverse  substitution, 
t 
x = e ,  dx = e tdt. 
� 
� 

The  new  integral  is, 

ln(x)dx = 

tetdt. 

Set  u = t  and  du = etdt.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

u = t, 
du = dt, 

dv = etdt 
v = et

Back­substituting  for  x  gives, 

� 

ln(x)dx =  x ln(x) − x + C . 

This  agrees  with  the  earlier  answer. 
2.  Reduction  formulas.  It  often  happens  that  an  integral  can  be  computed  only  be  repeated 
application  of  integration  by  parts.  It  sometimes  happens  that  integration  by  parts  gives  the 
induction  step  to  solve  inﬁnitely  many  integrals.  In  this  case,  the  formula  given  by  integration  by 
parts  is  called  a  reduction  formula. 
� 
Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  give  a  reduction  formula  for, 

[ln(x)]ndx. 

Now there is much more choice for u and dv .  The simplest choice is to set u = [ln(x)]n  and dv = dx. 
Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

dv = dx 
v = x 

Using  integration  by  parts, 
� 

u = [ln(x)]n , 
du = n[ln(x)]n−1/xdx, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 
x[ln(x)]n  − n � 
vdu, 
[ln(x)]n−1dx. 
[ln(x)]ndx = 
The  new  integral  is  simpler  than  the  original  integral.  And  repeated  application  of  the  formula 
� 
� 
eventually  leads  to  a  formula  for  the  integral.  Thus  this  is  a  reduction  formula.  For  instance,  this 
gives, 
[ln(x)]2dx = x[ln(x)]2  − 2 

ln(x)dx. 

� 
The  new  integral  was  already  computed.  Altogether  this  gives, 
[ln(x)]2dx =  x[ln(x)]2  − 2x ln(x

Example.  Use  integration  by  parts  to  ﬁnd  a  reduction  formula  for,

The  simplest  choice  is  to  set  u = tn  and  dv = etdt.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 

Using  integration  by  parts, 

u = tn ,

du = ntn−1dt,

3.  Advanced  reduction  formulas.  Sometimes  a  reduction  formula  can  only  be  obtained  by 
repeatedly  applying  integration  by  parts  or  by  using  some  other  identity. 
� 
Example.  Using  integration  by  parts  to  ﬁnd  a  reduction  formula  for, 
[sin(x)]ndx,  n ≥ 1. 

One  choice  is  to  set  u = [sin(x)]n−1  and  to  set  dv = sin(x)dx.  Then  u,  v ,  du  and  dv  are, 
u = [sin(x)]n−1 , 
dv = sin(x)dx 
du = (n − 1)[sin(x)]n−2 cos(x)dx,  v = − cos(x). 
� 
� 
Using  integration  by  parts, 
� 
� 
udv = uv − 
vdu, 
[sin(x)]ndx = −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x) + (n − 1) 
[sin(x)]n−2 cos  (x)dx. 
2
At  ﬁrst  blush,  this  is more  complicated  than  the  original  integral  since  it  involves  both  sin(x)  and 
� 
� 
� 
cos(x).  But  cos2 (x)  equals  1 − sin2 (x).  This  substitution  gives, 
[sin(x)]n−2dx − (n − 1) 
[sin(x)]ndx = −[sin(x)]n−1 cos(x) + (n − 1) 

[sin(x)]ndx.

1.  Indeterminate  forms.  Expressions  of  the  form  0/0,  ∞/∞,  0 × ∞,  ∞ − ∞,  0∞  and  ∞0 
are  called  indeterminate  forms.  To be precise,  none  of  these  expressions  is deﬁned  in mathematics. 
However, if a naive limit computation limx a F (x) leads to an indeterminate form, it often happens 
→
that  a more  careful  computation  using  calculus  eliminates  the  indeterminate  form. 
Example.  Let b be any real number.  Compute the limit as x approaches 0 of F (x) = (b+1/x)−1/x, 
� 
�  �  � 
x = 0.  If  we  evaluate  this  limit  in  a  naive manner,  we  get,

. 

This  is  an  indeterminate  form.  In  other  words,  the  computation  of  the  limit  failed  to  give  any 
useful  information.  The  reason  is  that  the  general  formula, 
lim [g(x) + h(x)] =  lim g(x) − lim h(x), 
x→a
x→a
x→a 

only  holds  if  all  three  limits  are  deﬁned,  which  they  are  not  in  our  case. 

Of  course  F (x)  is  simply  the  constant  function  with  value  b.  Therefore, 

lim F (x) =  lim b =

Thus,  a more  careful  computation  proves  the  limit  exists  and  gives  its  value. 

2.  The Mean Value Theorem revisited.  Recall the Mean Value Theorem:  If f (x) is continuous 
on  [a, b]  and  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b),  then  for  some  c  strictly  between  a  and  b, 
f (b) − f (a)

Thus,  given  two  such  functions  f (x)  and  g(x)  such  that  g(b) − g(a)  is  nonzero,  there  exist  two 
values  c1  and  c2  strictly  between  a  and  b  such  that, 
(f (b) − f (a))/(b − a) 
f (b) − f (a) 
f � (c1 )
. 
(g(b) − g(a))/(b − a) 
g(b) − g(a) 
g � (c2 )
Is  there  a  single  value  c = c1  = c2  where  this  equality  holds? 
The  answer  is  yes.  Form  the  function 
F (x) = (f (b) − f (a))(g(x) − g(a)) − (g(b) − g(a))(f (x) − f (a)). 

= 

=

Since  f (x)  and  g(x)  are  continuous  on  [a, b],  also  F (x)  is  continuous  on  [a, b].  Since  f (x)  and  g(x) 
are  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b),  also  F (x)  is  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b).  Moreover, 

F (a) = F (b) = 0. 

Thus,  by  the  Mean  Value  Theorem,  there  exists  a  value  c  strictly  between  a  and  b  such  that 
F � (c) = 0.  By  a  straightforward  computation, 
F � (c) = (f (b) − f (a))g � (c) − (g(b) − g(a))f � (c). 

This proves the Generalized Mean Value Theorem.  The main consequence of the Generalized Mean 
Value  Theorem  is  the  following  result. 
Proposition.  Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be  continuous  functions  on  [a, b]  that  are  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b). 
If  g � (x)  is  nonzero  on  (a, b),  then  g(x) − g(a)  is  nonzero  for  all  a < x < b  so  that  the  expression, 
f (x) − f (a) 
g(x) − g(a) 

is  deﬁned.  The  right­handed  limit, 

f (x) − f (a) 
, 
lim 
x→a+  g(x) − g(a) 
exists  if  and  only  if  the  right­handed  limit, 

f � (x)
lim 
x a+  g � (x)
→

, 

exists.  If  both  limits  exist,  they  are  equal, 
f (x) − f (a) 
lim 
x→a+  g(x) − g(a) 

f � (x)
=  lim 
x a+  g � (x)
→

. 

A  similar  result  holds  for  left­handed  limits.  The  proof  follows  by  applying  the  Generalized Mean 
Value  Theorem  to  the  interval  [a, x]  to  replace  (f (x) − f (a))/(g(x) − g(a))  by  f � (c)/g � (c).  Then  x 
approaches  a  as  c  approaches  a.

3.  L’Hospital’s  rule.  The  most  important  case  of  the  proposition  is  L’Hospital’s  rule.  This  is 
exactly  the  case  when  f (a) = g(a) = 0.  In  this  case,  a  naive  computation  would  give,

which  is  an  indeterminate  form.  Again,  the  problem  is  that  the  general  formula, 

f (x) 
lim

= 

limx a+  f (x)
→
, 
limx→a+  g(x) 

only  holds  if  all  three  limits  are  deﬁned,  and  the  limit  limx a+  g(x)  is  nonzero.  Since  the  limit  is 
→
zero,  the  formula  does  not  hold. 
However,  if  f � (x)  and  g � (x)  exist,  and  if  g � (x)  is  nonzero,  then  the  proposition  has  the  following 
consequence,  known  as  L’Hospital’s  rule,

4.  L’Hospital’s rule  for other  indeterminate  forms.  L’Hospital’s rule can be used to compute 
limits  that  naively  lead  to  indeterminate  forms  other  than  0/0.  For  instance,  if 
lim  f (x) =  lim  g(x) = ∞,

the  second  limit  is  deﬁned,  then  the  ﬁrst  limit  is  deﬁned  and  the  2  are  equal  (whether  or  not  they 
are  zero).

By  similar  arguments,  other  indeterminate  forms  can  also  be  reduced  to  L’Hospital’s  rule.  Also, 
limits  of  the  form, 

lim  F (x) 
x→∞ 
giving indeterminate forms can often be reduced to L’Hospital’s rule.  The moral is that the formula, 
f � (x)
, 
=  lim 
x→a  g � (x) 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

is  almost  always  true  if  f (a)/g(a)  is  an  indeterminate  form.  But  a  certain  amount  of  care  should 

be  used,  since  occasionally  this  fails.

1.  A  problem  with  Riemann  integrals.  Riemann  integrals  are  deﬁned  in  very  many  cases.

The result we use most often  is that  for a piecewise continuous  function f (x) on a bounded  interval 
[a, b],  the  Riemann  integral, 
f (x)dx, 
a 
exists  (and  equals  a  ﬁnite  number).  What  if  the  interval  is  unbounded,  e.g.,  [a, ∞)?  Quite  simply, 
the Riemann integral is not deﬁned.  This isn’t a problem with our methods for computing integrals. 
It  is  a  problem  with  the  very  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral.  In  fact,  this  is  only  the  ﬁrst 
of  many  problems  with  the  deﬁnition  of  the  Riemann  integral.  Eventually  these  problems  led

of  an  improper  integral.  There  are  2  basic  rules  for  convergence  of  a  limit.

1.  Sequences By deﬁnition, a sequence  of real numbers is a rule assigning to each counting number 
n  an  associated  real  number  an .  The  integer  n  is  called  the  index  of  the  sequence.  Usually  the 
index  begins with  n = 1,  but  occasionally  it  begins with  another  integer  (sometimes  0).  Sequences 
are  often  speciﬁed  by  giving  the  ﬁrst  few  values,  and  letting  the  reader  infer  the  rule,  e.g., 

1 
, . . . 
3 
It  is  always  better  to  give  a  precise  deﬁnition  of  each  sequence,  e.g., 

, a2  = 

, a3  = 

a1  = 

1
1

1
2

an  = 

1 
, n = 1, 2, . . . 
n 

The most  common  notation  for  a  sequence  is  (an )n≥1 .

A  sequence  (an )n≥1  converges  to  a  limit  L  if  the  sequence becomes arbitrarily  close  to L,  and  stays 
arbitrarily  close  to  L.  More  precisely,  the  sequence  converges  to  L  if  for  every  positive  number  �, 
there  exists  an  integer N  (depending  on  the  sequence  and  �)  such  that  for  every  integer  n ≥ N , 
an  − L < �.
|
| 
In  other  words,  the  tail  of  the  sequence  aN , aN +1 , aN +2 , . . .  are  all  numbers  in  the  interval  (L −
�, L + �).  A  sequence  cannot  have  more  than  1  limit:  given  2  potential  limits  L1  and  L2 ,  simply 
take  � =  L1 − L2 /2  in  the  deﬁnition  above.  A  sequence which  has  a  limit  is  said  to  converge,  and 
|
|
the  limit  is  denoted  by, 

L =  lim  an . 
n→∞ 
A  sequence  which  does  not  have  a  limit  is  said  to  diverge. 

Examples. 

(i)  Let  L  be  a  ﬁxed  real  number.  The  sequence  an  = L, n = 1, 2, . . .  converges  to  L. 
(ii)  The  sequence  an  = n  diverges.  In  a  precise  sense,  this  sequence  “diverges  to ∞”. 
(iii)  The  sequence  an  = (−1)n  diverges,  even  though  it  is  bounded  (it  never  gets  bigger  than  1  or 
smaller  than −1). 
(iv)  Let  r  be  a  real  number.  The  sequence  an  =  rn , n  = 0, 1, 2, . . .  converges  to  0  if  |r|  <  1  and 
diverges  if  |r|  >  1.  There  are  2  remaining  cases.  If  r  =  −1,  then  an  = (−1)n  diverges.  If 
r = 1,  then  an  = 1  converges  to  1. 

2.  Tests  for  convergence/divergence.  One useful test for convergence is the Squeezing Lemma. 
The  squeezing  lemma.  Let  (an )n≥1 ,  (bn )n≥1  and  (cn )n≥1  be  sequences  such  that  for  every  index 
n, 
an  ≤ bn  ≤ cn . 
In  other  words,  the  sequence  (bn )  is  “squeezed”  between  the  sequences  (an )  and  (cn ).  If  (an )  and 
(cn )  converge,  and  if, 

lim  an  =  lim  cn , 
n→∞ 
n→∞ 
then  also  (bn )  converges  and  its  limit  equals  the  limit  of  the  other  2  sequences. 
Another  test  for  convergence  is  the Monotone  Convergence  Test.  A  sequence  (an )n≥1  is  called non­
decreasing  if  for  every  index  n,  an+1  ≥ an .  Similarly,  a  sequence  (an )  is  non­increasing  if  for  every 
index  n,  an+2  ≤  an .  A  sequence  which  is  either  non­decreasing  or  non­increasing  (but  not  both 
increasing  and  decreasing)  is  called  monotone.  A  sequence  (an )  is  bounded  above  if  there  exists 
a  real  number  u  such  that  for  every  index  n,  an  ≤  u.  The  number  u  is  an  upper  bound  for  the 
sequence.  A sequence (an )  is bounded  below  if there exists a real number  l  such that  for every  index 
n,  an  ≥ l.  The  number  l  is  a  lower  bound  for  the  sequence.

Monotone  Convergence  Test.  A  non­decreasing  sequence  converges  if  and  only  if  it  is  bounded 

above.  In  this  case,  the  limit  of  the  sequence  is  the  least  upper  bound  for  the  sequence.  Similarly, 
a  non­increasing  sequence  converges  if  and  only  if  it  is  bounded  below  and  the  limit  is  the  greatest 
lower  bound  for  the  sequence.

3.  Series.  Given  a  sequence  (an )n≥1 ,  there  are  2  important  related  sequences.  The  ﬁrst  is  the

denoted  by,

ak  :=  lim  bn  =  lim 
ak .

n→∞ 
In  this  case  is  is  said  the  series  �k  ak  converges.  If  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums  (Bn )n≥1 
k=1 
k=1 
converges,  it  is  said  the  series 
converges  absolutely.  Although  it  is  not  obvious,  if  the 
k  ak 
series  converges  absolutely,  then  the  series  converges  (this  is  a  basic  theorem  from  course  18.100). 
If  a  series  converges  but  does  not  converge  absolutely,  sometimes  it  is  said  the  series  converges

conditional ly. 
Examples.  The harmonic sequence  is the sequence an  = 1/n.  As will be shown soon, the harmonic 
1/n  diverges  to ∞.  The  alternating  harmonic  sequence  is,

does  converge.  This  will  also  be  shown  soon.  Since  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums  for  the 
alternating sequence equals the sequence of partial sums for the harmonic sequence, the alternating 
harmonic  series  does  not  converge  absolutely.  It  only  converges  conditionally. 

The  alternating  harmonic  series, 

As  counter­intuitive  as  this  might  sound,  the  terms  in  the  alternating  harmonic  series  can  be 
rearranged  so  that  the  sum  converges  to  any  real  number  you  like!  This  sounds  ridiculous:  ﬁnite 
sums  are  independent  of  the  order  in  which  the  summands  are  added,  so  how  could  this  fail  for

� 
1/n diverges,  the  same 
inﬁnite  sums?  The  answer  is  quite  simple.  Because  the harmonic  series 
n 
is  true  for 
1/2n .  Thus,  add  it  up  a  very  large  number  of  only  the  (positive)  even  terms  in  the 
alternating  harmonic  series  to  make  the  partial  sum  bigger  than,  say,  106 .  Now  add  only  the  ﬁrst 
odd  term −1/2.  This  has  a  negligible  eﬀect.  Now  add  a  large  number  of  the  remaining  even  terms 
to  make  the  partial  sum  bigger  than  107 .  Now  add  one  more  odd  term,  −1/3.  Continuing  in  this 
way,  eventually  every  term  in  the  sequence  contributes  to  one  of  the  partial  sums.  But  because 
we  add  positive  terms  with  a  much  higher  frequency  than  negative  terms,  the  sequence  of  partial 
sums  is  diverging  to +∞.  Similarly, we  could  negative  terms with  a  very  high  frequency  and make 
the  partial  sums  diverge  to  −∞.  Now  it  is  not  so  surprising  that  by  adding  the  terms  in  a  careful 
order,  we  can make  the  partial  sums  converge  to  any  value  we  like. 
The  pathology  of  the  preceding  paragraph  occurs  with  any  conditionally  convergent  series.  It  is  a 
very  important  fact  that  every  absolutely  convergent  series  has  only  a  single  limit,  independent  of 
� 
the  order  in  which  terms  are  added.  For  this  reason,  absolutely  convergent  series  are  much  more 
useful  than  conditionally  convergent  series. 
4.  Test  for  convergence/divergence  of  series.  If  a  series 
an  converges,  then  the  sequence 
n 
(an )  converges  to  0.  To  see  this,  denote  by  L  the  limit  of  the  sequence  of  partial  sums  (bn ).  For 
every  positive  real  number  �,  using  �/2  in  the  deﬁnition  of  convergence  of  (bn ),  there  exists  an 
integer N  such  that  for  every  n ≥ N ,  bn  − L < �/2.  But  then  for  n ≥ N  + 1, 
|
| 
=  bn  − bn−1 = (bn  − L) − (bn−1  − L)
|
| ≤ |
|an |
|
|
bn  − L +  bn−1  − L < �/2 + �/2 = �.
|
|
| 
� 
�
Thus  the  sequence  (an )  converges  to  0.  Contrapositively,  if  the  sequence  (an )  does  not  converge 
to  0,  then  the  series 
n an  diverges.  This  is  the  most  basic  test  for  divergence  of  a  series.  For 
n=1 (−1)n  diverges  (arguing  the  opposite  is  a 
∞ 
example,  it  immediately  follows  that  the  series 
favorite  pasttime  of  “mathematical  cranks”). 
The most basic  test  for absolute  convergence  of  a  sequence  follows  from  the monotone  convergence

test.  The  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums,

k=1 

Bn  = 

is  a  non­decreasing  sequence.  Therefore,  by  the  monotone  convergence  theorem,  it  converges  if 
and  only  if  it  is  bounded  above.  The  most  common  technique  for  proving  the  sequence  of  partial 
absolute  sums  is  bounded  above  is  by  comparing  it  to  a  larger  series  that  is  known  to  converge.

This  gives  the  following.

(iii)  For  every  real  number  x,  the  series  converges  absolutely. 

The  real  number  R  occuring  in  Case  (ii)  is  called  the  radius  of  convergence.  By  convention,  in 
Case  (i)  the  radius  of  convergence  is  deﬁned  to  be  R  =  0.  By  convention,  in  Case  (iii)  the  radius 
of  convergence  is  deﬁned  to  be  R = ∞.  This  allows  us  to  replace  the  original  question  by  a  more 
precise  question. 
Question.  Given  a  power  series,  what  is  the  radius  of  convergence?

A  function  deﬁned  in  this  manner  is  called  an  analytic  function.  This  is  the  real  signiﬁcance  of 
power  series:  they  give  important  examples  of  functions  that  cannot  be  described  in  a more  direct 
manner.  Analytic  functions  have  nice  analytic  properties  (whence  the  name).  For  instance,  it  is  a 
theorem  (proved  in  18.100)  that an  analytic  function  f (x)  is diﬀerentiable  and  the derivative has  a

In  particular,  every  derivative  of  f (x)  is  deﬁned.  A  function  with  this  property  is  called  inﬁnitely 
diﬀerentiable  or  smooth.  Thus,  every  analytic  function  is  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable. 

This  is  only  1  of  many  useful  properties  of  analytic  functions.  Which  functions  f (x)  are  analytic 
functions?  By  the  last  paragraph,  if  f (x)  is  analytic,  then  it  is  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable.  Are  there 
other  restrictions?  Can  more  than  1  power  series  about  x  =  a  give  rise  to  the  same  analytic 
function? 
� 
To  answer  both  of  these  questions,  consider  the  analytic  function  deﬁned  by  a  power  series, 
∞
cn (x − a)n . 
n=0 

f (x) = 

Plugging  in  x = a  gives  the  equation, 
f (a) = c0  + c1 (a − a) + c2 (a − a)2 
Thus  the  ﬁrst  coeﬃcient  of  the  power  series  is  simply, 

+ · · · 

= c0  + 0 + 0 + · · · = c0 .

c0  = f (a). 

Moreover,  from  the  power  series  for  the  k th  derivative, 
f (k) (a) = k !ck  + (k + 1)!/1!ck+1 (a − a) + (k + 2)!/2!ck+2 (a − a)2 
Solving  for  ck ,  the  k th  coeﬃcient  of  the  power  series  is, 

ck  =  f (k) (a)/k !. 
Therefore,  the  power  series  deﬁning  f (x)  is, � f (n) (a)

f (x) =

(x − a)n .

= k !ck  + 0 + 0 + · · · = k !ck .

In  particular,  this  series  is  unique.  This  answers  the  second  question.  Two  absolutely  convergent 
power  series  about  x  =  a  give  the  same  analytic  function  if  and  only  if  the  power  series  are 
themselves  equal  (i.e.,  the  corresponding  coeﬃcients  of  the  2  series  are  equal). 
Moreover,  this  gives  us  alot  of  information  about  the  ﬁrst  question.  For  an  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable 
�∞ 
function  f (x)  deﬁned  at  a  point  x  =  a,  there  is  a  very  important  power  series,  the  Taylor  series

n!  (x − a)n . 
f (n) (a) 
n=0 
If  f (x)  is  analytic,  then  the  Taylor  series  converges  absolutely  to  f (x).  This  reduces  the  original 
question  to  2  new  questions.  Does  the  Taylor  series  have  a  positive  radius  of  convergence?  If  so, 
does  the  analytic  function  deﬁned  in  this  way  equal  the  original  function  f (x)?

The radius of convergence question is precisely the radius of convergence question posed earlier.  As 
there,  the  answer  can  often  be  found  by  using  the  ratio  or  root  tests.  The  second  question  is  yes 
in  every  practical  case.  There  are  examples  of  inﬁnitely  diﬀerentiable  functions  where  the  Taylor 
series has a positive radius of convergence, but does not converge to the original function.  However, 
every example is somewhat contrived;  they rarely come up “in nature”.  Just for completeness, here

3.  Algorithm  for  computing  Taylor  series.  The  method  for  ﬁnding  the  Taylor  series  of 
a  function  is  always  the  same.  For  deﬁniteness,  consider  the  Taylor  series  expansion  of  f (x) = 
(1 − x)−1  about  the  point  x = 0. 
Step  1.  Compute  all  derivatives  of  f (x).  If  this  sounds  like  alot  of  work,  it  is!  In  most 
examples,  this really comes down to ﬁnding an  inductive  formula  for the derivatives of f (x).  In the 
example,  the  “zeroth  derivative”  is, 

The  ﬁrst  derivative  is, 

The  second  derivative  is, 

f (x) =  (1 − x)−1 . 

f � (x) = −(1 − x)−2 (−1) =  (1 − x)−2 . 

f �� (x) = (−2)(1 − x)−3 (−1) =  (1 − x)−3 . 

This  begins  to  suggest  a  pattern:  The  k th  derivative  of  f (x)  will  be, 
f (k) (x) = bk (1 − x)−k−1 , 

for some real number bk .  Having made this guess, it is easy to verify by induction.  By computation, 
the  result  is  true  for  k = 0, 1  and  2 with  the  corresponding  real  numbers  b0  = 1,  b1  = 1  and  b2  = 2. 
By  way  of  induction,  assume  the  result  is  true  for  k = n,  i.e., 
f (n) (x) = cn (1 − x)−n−1 . 

Then  the  (n + 1)st  derivative  is, 
f (n+1) (x) = (f (n) (x))�  = (cn (1 − x)−n−1 )�  = cn (−n − 1)(1 − x)−n−2 (−1) = (n + 1)cn (1 − x)−n−2 . 

Thus  the  result  is  also  true  for  k = n + 1  where  cn+1  satisﬁes  the  equation, 

cn+1  = (n + 1)cn . 

126

Thus  the  result  is  proved  by  induction  on  k . 

In  fact, more  has  been  accomplished,  since  now  there  is  an  inductive  formula  for  the  numbers  cn , 
3·2·
cn  = ncn−1  = n(n−1)cn−2  = n(n−1)(n−2)cn−3  =
· · · = n(n−1)(n−2)·· · ··3c2  = n(n−1)(n−2)·· · ··
1.

This  number  has  come  up  before  in  this  class.  It  is  the  nth  factorial  number, 

cn  = n!. 

This  gives  the  ﬁnal  formula  for  the  nth  derivative  of  f (x), 
n!(1 − x)−n−1 . 

f (n) (x) = 

Step 2.  Substitute x = a into the derivatives.  Compared to the work of ﬁnding the derivatives, 
this  is  very  simple.  In  the  example,  plugging  in  x = 0  gives, 

f (n) (0) =  n!. 

Step  3.  Compute  the  coeﬃcients  of  the  Taylor  series.  By  deﬁnition,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  of 
the  Taylor  series  is, 

In  the  example,  this  gives  the  coeﬃcient, 

cn  = 

f (n) (a) 
. 
n! 

cn  =

n! 
n! 

= 

1, 

for  every  integer  n ≥ 0. 
Step  4.  Write  the  Taylor  series.  This  is  really getting  into  the “mind­numbing details”.  In  the 
example,  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  x = 0  is, 
(1 − x)−1  =  �∞ 
n=0 xn . 
Step  5.  If  possible,  ﬁnd  the  radius  of  convergence.  In  the  example,  the  Taylor  series  is 
simply the geometric series.  By the previous lecture, the geometric series converges absolutely with 
radius R = 1.  Moreover, it converges absolutely to (1 − x)−1 .  Notice, this gives another explanation 
for  the  radius  R =  1.  Since  (1 − x)−1  has  a  vertical  asymptote  at  x =  1,  the  Taylor  series  cannot 
converge on any  interval  that contains x = 1.  The  largest  interval centered at x = 0 not containing 
x = 1  is  the  interval  (−1, 1).  This  interval  has  radius  R = 1. 
4.  More  examples.  What  is  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  a  point  x  =  a 
diﬀerent  from  x  =  1?  The  fortunate  fact  is  that  Step  1  allows  to  compute  the  derivatives  f (n) (a)

for  any  a = 1,  not  just x = 0.  This  is  the  typical  case,  and  it  is  one  justiﬁcation  for doing  the work 
necessary  in  Step  1.  In  this  case,  the  answer  is, 
f (n) (a) =  n!(1 − a)−n−1 . 

Therefore,  according  the  Step  3,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  in  the  Taylor  series  expansion  is, 
n!(1 − a)−n−1 
(1 − a)−n−1 . 
= 
cn  =
n! 
Thus,  according  to  Step  4,  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  (1 − x)−1  about  x = a  is, 
(1 − x)−1  =  �∞ 
n=0 (1 − a)−n−1 (x − a)n . 
What  is  the  radius  of  convergence?  The  ratio  of  the  (n + 1)st  and  nth  terms  of  the  series  is, 
]/[(1 − a)−n−1 (x − a)n ] = (1 − a)−1 (x − a). 
[(1 − a)−n−2
(x − a)n+1
This is independent of n.  Thus, this constant sequence converges to its constant value (1 − a)−1 (x − 
a).  By  the  ratio  test,  the  sequence  is  absolutely  convergent  if  and  only  if  this  limit  has  absolute 
value  less  than  1, 
(1 − a)−1 (x − a) ≤ 1.
| 
|
Rearranging,  the  series  converges  if  and  only  if, 
x − a
|
| ≤ |

1 − a
|
.

Thus  the  radius  of  convergence  is, 

|1 − a|. 
R = 
This  is  perfectly  reasonable.  The  function  (1 − x)−1  has  a  vertical  asymptote  at  x = 1.  Therefore, 
the  power  series  cannot  converge  on  any  interval  containing  x  =  1.  The  largest  interval  centered 
at  x  =  a  not  containing  x  =  1  has  radius  equal  to  the  distance  from  x  =  a  to  x  =  1,  namely 
R = 1 − a . 
|

Example  2.  For  the  next  example,  consider  the Taylor  series  expansion  for  f (x) = ex  near  x = 0. 
In  this  case,  Step  1  is  simple.  Every  derivative  of  f (x)  is  simply, 

Therefore,  the  nth  coeﬃcient  of  the  Taylor  series  expansion  is, 

f (n) (x) =  ex .

Example  3.  Having  computed  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x =  0,  the  next  question 
is  to  compute  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x = a.  According  to  the  formula,

Thus,  all  the  even  coeﬃcients  of  the  Taylor  series  are  0.  For  an  odd  coeﬃcient,  say  n  = 2m + 1,

n = 4l,

To  compute  the  Taylor  series  expansions  of  sin(x)  and  cos(x)  about  a  point  x =  a,  we  can  follow 
the  procedure  above.  However,  it  is much  faster  to  use  the  angle  addition  formulas, 
sin(x) = sin(a + (x − a)) = cos(a) sin(x − a) + sin(a) cos(x − a), 
cos(x) = cos(a + (x − a)) = cos(a) cos(x − a) − sin(a) sin(x − a).

polynomials,  trigonometric  functions,  exponential  functions and  logarithms  (the proof of  this  is  far 
beyond  the  scope  of  this  class).  However,  it  is  quite  easy  to  write  down  a  power  series  expansion 
for  f (x).  First  of  all,  the  Taylor  series  for  e−t2  about  t = 0  is  obtained  by  substituting  x = −t2  in

2.  Taylor  series  with  remainder  term.  As  demonstrated  by  the  computation  just  done,  in 
reality only ﬁnitely many terms  in a Taylor series are used.  What can be said  in this case?  In other 
words,  how  quickly  does  the  series  converge?  How  large  is  the  remainder  after  n  terms?  To  make 
N� f (n) (a)
all  this  precise,  introduce  the  function  RN ,a (x)  deﬁned  to  be, 
RN ,a (x) = f (x) − 
n! 
n=0 
N� f (n) (a)
This  is  precisely  the  remainder  term  so  that  we  have,

(x − a)n  + RN ,a (x). 

(x − a)n . 

f (x) = 

The  precise  version  of  the  questions  above  is,  what  bounds  exist  for  RN ,a (x)? 
To  understand  the  answer,  consider  the  simplest  case  where  N  =  0.  Then  the  remainder  term  is 
simply, 
R0,a (x) = f (x) − f (a). 
By  the Mean Value Theorem,  for  every  x  there  exists  a  real  number  c  (depending  on  x)  between  a 
and  x  such  that, 
R0,a (x) = f � (c)(x − a).

Iterating  the  Mean  Value  Theorem,  for  every  integer  N ,  for  every  x,  there  exists  a  real  number  c 
(depending  on  both N  and  x)  between  a  and  x  such  that, 
(c)(x − a)N +1/(N

f (N 
+1)

+ 1)!. 

R (x
N ,a

) = 

In  particular,  if  we  can  bound  the  (N  + 1)st  derivative  of  f (x)  on  the  interval  between  a  and  c, 
then  we  can  bound  RN ,a (x). 
Example.  Bound  the  remainder  in  the Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x = a.  The  (N + 1)st 
derivative  is  simply  ex .  Therefore,  a  bound  for  f (N +1) (c)  for  c  between  a  and  x  is  simply, 

M  = e m  = e
max(a,x)

. 

This  is  independent  of N .  The  bound  on  the  remainder  term  is  then, 
|R (x)| ≤  M (x − a)N +1/(N
N ,a

+ 1)!. 

By  choosing N  suitably  large, we  can make  this  remainder  term  as  small  as possible.  For  instance, 
if  we  want  to  compute  e for  x  in  the  interval  (−1, 1),  then  M  equals  e.  To  make  the  remainder 
x
term  less  than  10−10 ,  it  suﬃces  to  take N  = 12. 
3.  Review  problems.  Each  of  the  following  problems  was  discussed  in  lecture.  Here  are  the 
problems  and  answers,  without  the  discussion. 

Problem  1.  Let  a  and  b  be  positive  real  numbers.  There  are  2  tangent  lines  to  the  ellipse  with 
equation, 

y 2

a2  + 
b2  = 1, 
containing  the  point  (a, b).  Find  the  equations  of  each  of  these  tangent  lines. 

The  2  tangent  lines  are  the  line  tangent  to  the  ellipse  at  (x, y) = (0, b)  and  the  line  tangent  to  the 
ellipse  at  (x, y) = (a, 0).  The  equations  of  these  lines  are, 

and,


y = b, 

x = a. 

Problem  2.  A grain  silo  is designed by attaching a  cylinder of ﬁxed  radius  r  and height a directly 
above  a  right  circular  cone  of  base  radius  r  and  height  b.  The  silo  has  no  top,  and  there  is  no 
bottom  between  the  bottom  of  the  cylinder  and  the  top  of  the  cone.  For  a  ﬁxed  volume  V ,  what 
choice  of  b minimizes  the  surface  area  of  the  grain  silo? 

The  choice  of  b minimizing  the  surface  area  is,
