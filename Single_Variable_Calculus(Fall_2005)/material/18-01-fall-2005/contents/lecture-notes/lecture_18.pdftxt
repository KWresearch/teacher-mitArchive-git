1.  Approximating Riemann  integrals.  Often, there is no simpler expression for the antideriva­
tive than the expression given by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.  In such cases, the simplest 
method to compute a Riemann  integral  is to use the deﬁnition.  However,  this  is not necessarily the 
most eﬃcient  method.  Often trapezoids or segments under a parabola give a better approximation 
to  the  Riemann  integral  than  do  vertical  strips.

I  = 

for a function y(x) deﬁned on the interval [a, b].  Choose a partition of the interval [a, b] into n equal

This  is  usually  a  better  approximation  than  either  of  the  two  approximations  individually.  Part 
of  the  reason  is  that  the  term  (yk−1  + yk )Δxk /2  is  the  area  of  the  trapezoid  containing  the  points 
(xk−1 , 0),  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , 0)  and  (xk , yk ).  In  particular,  if  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  is  a  line,  this 
trapezoid is precisely the region between the graph and the x­axis over the interval [xk−1 , xk ].  Thus, 
the  approximation  above  gives  the  exact  integral  for  linear  integrands. 
Writing  out  the  sum  gives,

3.  Simpson’s  rule.  Again  partition  the  interval  [a, b]  into  n  equal  subintervals.  For  reasons  that 

will  become  apparent,  n must  be  even.  So  let  n = 2m  where m  is  a  positive  integer.  Again  deﬁne,

Pair  oﬀ  the  intervals  as  ([x0 , x1 ], [x1 , x2 ]),  ([x2 , x3 ], [x3 , x4 ]),  etc.  Thus  the  lth  pair  of  intervals  is, 

([x2l−2 , x2l−1 ], [x2l−1 , x2l ]). 

The  idea  is  to  approximate  the  area  of  the  graph  over  the  pair  of  intervals  by  the  area  under  the 
unique  parabola  containing  the  3  points  (x2l−2 , y2l−2 ), (x2l−1 , y2l−1 ), (x2l , y2l ).  For  notation’s  sake, 
denote  2l − 1  by  k .  Thus  the  3  points  are  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , yk ),  and  (xk+1 , yk+1 )  (this  is  slightly 
more  symmetric). 

The  ﬁrst  problem  is  to  ﬁnd  the  equation  of  this  parabola.  Since  the  parabola  contains  the  point 
(xk , yk ),  it  has  the  equation, 

y = A(x − xk )2  + B (x − xk ) + yk , 
Plugging  in  x = xk−1  and  x = xk+1 ,  and  using  that  xk+1  − xk  = xk  − xk−1  equals Δx, 
yk+1  = A(Δx)2  + B (Δx) + yk , 
yk−1  = A(Δx)2  − B (Δx) + yk . 

Summing  the  two  sides  gives, 

yk+1  + yk−1  = 2A(Δx)2  + 2yk . 

Solving  for  A  gives, 

1 
2(Δx)2 (yk−1  − 2yk  + yk+1 ). 
Similarly,  taking  the  diﬀerence  of  the  two  sides  gives, 
yk+1  − yk−1  = 2B (Δx). 

A = 

Solving  for  B  gives, 

B  = 

(yk+1  − yk−1 ).

2(Δx)
Thus,  the  equation  of  the  parabola  passing  through  (xk−1 , yk−1 ),  (xk , yk )  and  (xk+1 , yk+1 )  is, 
y = A(x − xk )2  + B (x − xk )2  + yk ,

Plugging  in  and  using  that  xk+1  − xk  = xk  − xk−1  equals Δx,  this  is,

Back­substituting 2l − 1  for k  and (b − a)/2m  for Δx,  the approximate area  for the pair of  intervals 
[x2l−2 , x2l−2 ]  and  [x2l−1 , x2l ]  is,

Example.  Approximate  ln(2)  using  a  partition  into  4  equal  subintervals  with  the  Trapezoid  Rule 
and  with  Simpson’s  Rule. 
The  value  ln(2)  equals  the  Riemann  integral, �  2  1

The  points  of  the  partition  are  x0  = 4/4, x1  = 5/4, x2  = 6/4, x3  = 7/4  and  x4  = 8/4.  The 
corresponding values are y0  = 4/4, y1  = 4/5, y2  = 4/6, y3  = 4/7, y4  = 4/8.  Thus the Trapezoid Rule 
gives,

According  to  a  calculator,  the  true  value  is, 

ln(2) =

Note that trapezoids overestimate the area, because 1/x is concave up.  The approximating parabo­
las  cross  the  graph  of  y  = 1/x,  thus  the  underestimation  to  the  left  of  (xk , yk )  somewhat  cancels 
the  overestimation  to  the  right  of  (xk , yk ),  explaining  the  better  approximation. 
4.  One  review  problem.  This  is  a  related  rates  review  problem  for  Exam  3.  A  particle  moves 
√
with  constant  speed  3  on  the  parabola  y = x2 .  The  particle  is moving  away  from  the  origin.  What 
is  the  rate­of­change  of  the  distance  from  the  origin  to  the  particle when  the  distance  equals  2
5? 
The  independent  variable  is  time,  t.  The  dependent  variables  are  the  x­coordinate  of  the  particle, 
x(t),  the  y ­coordinate  of  the  particle,  y(t),  and  the  distance  L(t)  from  the  particle  to  (0, 0).  The 
constant  is  the  speed  s  =  3  of  the  particle.  The  constraints  are  that  the  point  moves  on  the 
parabola, 

2 
y = x , 

and  the  Pythagorean  theorem, 

Also,  since  the  speed  is  constant, 

L2  = x  + y .

This  plays  the  role  of  the  “known  rate­of­change”  in  a  typical  related  rates  problem.

√
It  is  simplest  to  relate  the  dependent  variables  y  and  L  to  x.  The  ﬁrst  step  is  to  determine  x  at 

5.  Plugging  y = x into  the  equation  for  L2  gives,

At  the  instant  when  L  equals  2

5,  L2  equals  20.  Thus,  at  that moment, 

4 x  + x 2  = 20. 

This  factors  as, 

(x 2  − 4)(x  + 5) = 0. 
2
Since  x2  is  nonnegative,  the  solution  is  x2  = 4.  Assuming  the  particle  is  in  the  ﬁrst  quadrant  (this 
√
is  not  speciﬁed  in  the  problem),  x  is  positive.  The  other  choice  leads  to  a  symmetric  problem  and 
the  same  ﬁnal  answer.  So,  at  the moment  when  L  equals  2
5,  x  equals  2. 
√
The  next  step  is  to  determine  the  “known  rate­of­change”,  dx/dt  at  the  moment  when  L  equals 
5.  Implicitly  diﬀerentiating  the  equation  y = x2  gives,
