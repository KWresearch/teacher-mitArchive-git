1.  Inverse  functions.  Let  a, b, s  and  t  be  constants.  Let  y  =  f (x)  be  a  function  deﬁned  on  the 
interval, 
a ≤ x ≤ b, 

and  whose  values  are  in  the  interval, 

s ≤ y ≤ t. 
Does  there  exist  a  function  x = g(y)  deﬁned  on  the  interval, 
s ≤ y ≤ t, 

whose  values  are  in  the  interval, 

satisfying  the  two  conditions, 

a ≤ x ≤ b, 

g(f (x)) = x,  f (g(y)) = y  ? 
If  such  a  function  g  exists,  it  is  called  an  inverse  function  of  f ,  and  it  is  denoted  by  f −1 (y).  Also, 
the original  function f (x)  is  called  invertible.  There  is  some  chance of  confusion with  the other use

of  “invertible”,  namely  that  1/f (x)  is  always  deﬁned.  We will  be  careful  to  specify  the meaning  of 
“invertible”. 
There are 2 necessary conditions for f  to have an inverse function.  Assume f  has an inverse function 
g .  Let  x1 , x2  be  a  pair  of  numbers  in  [a, b].  If  f (x1 )  equals  f (x2 ),  then  also, 

x1  = g(f (x1 )) = g(f (x2 )) = x2 , 

i.e., x1  equals x2 .  In other words,  two distinct  inputs x1  and x2  give two distinct outputs f (x1 ) and 
f (x2 ).  A  function  satisfying  this  condition  is  called  one­to­one,  because  to  every  output,  there  is 
at most  one  input.  This  is  the  ﬁrst  necessary  condition:  every  invertible  function  is  one­to­one. 
Next,  for  every  number  y  in  [s, t],  there  is  a  number  x  in  [a, b]  such  that  y  =  f (x).  In  fact,  just 
take  x  to  be  g(y);  then  f (x)  equals  f (g(y)), which  equals  y .  A  function  satisfying  this  condition  is 
called  onto.  This  is  the  second  necessary  condition:  every  invertible  function  is  onto. 
Together,  this  says  that  an  invertible  function  is  one­to­one  and  onto.  In  fact,  the  converse  is  also 
true:  every  one­to­one  and  onto  function  is  invertible.  This  is  easy  to  check,  but  we  will  not  prove 
it  in  this  class. 
Remark:  In checking that f  is one­to­one and onto, the choice of intervals [a, b] and [c, d] are vital. 
A  simple  example  comes  from  f (x) = sin(x).  For  the  interval  [−π/2, π , 2]  and  [−1, 1],  the  function 
f (x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto.  But  for  many  other  choices  of  these  intervals,  the  function  is  neither 
one­to­one  nor  onto. 
2.  The  graph  of  an  inverse  function.  How  should  we  think  of  an  inverse  function?  One  way 
is  graphically.  The  graph  of  the  function  y  =  f −1 (x)  is  the  same  as  the  graph  of  f (y) =  x.  This 
is  simply  the  usual  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  with  the  roles  of  x  and  y  reversed.  What  this  translates  to 
is,  the  graph  of  f −1  is  the  same  as  the  graph  of  f  with  the  roles  of  the  x­axis  and  y ­axis  reversed. 
The  simplest way  to  get  the  graph  of  f −1 (x)  is  simply  to  reﬂect  the  graph  of  f (x)  through  the  45◦ 
line  y = x. 
3.  The  inverse  trigonometric  functions.  The  function  sin(x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto  on 
[−π/2, π/2],  taking  values  in  [−1, 1].  Thus  there  is  an  inverse  function  sin−1 (x)  deﬁned  on  the 
interval  [−1, 1],  taking values  in  [−π/2, π/2].  The graph of sin−1 (x)  is an  increasing  function whose 
lower  left  endpoint  is  (−1, −π/2)  and  whose  upper  right  endpoint  is  (1, π/2). 
The function cos(x) is one­to­one and onto on [0, π ], taking values in [−1, 1].  Thus there is an inverse 
function  cos−1 (x)  deﬁned  on  the  interval  [−1, 1],  taking  values  in  [0, π ].  The  graph  of  cos−1 (x)  is  a 
decreasing  function  whose  upper  left  endpoint  is  (−1, π)  and  whose  lower  right  endpoing  is  (1, 0). 
The  function  tan(x)  is  one­to­one  and  onto  on  (−π/2, π/2),  taking  values  in  the  whole  real  line. 
Thus there is an inverse function tan−1 (x) deﬁned on the whole real line, taking values in (−π/2, π/2). 
The  graph  is  an  increasing  function  that  is  asymptotic  to  the  line  y  =  −π/2  as  x  →  −∞,  and 
asymptotic  to  the  line  y = +π/2  as  x → +∞. 
4.  Derivatives  of  inverse  functions.  A  particular  simple  formulation  of  the  chain  rule  is  the 
diﬀerential  formulation, 
df (u) = f � (u)du.

If  f  has  an  inverse  function  g(x),  let  u  be  g(x).  Then  this  gives, 
df (g(x)) = f � (g(x))dg(x). 

On  the  other  hand,  f (g(x))  equals  x.  This  gives  the  formula, 
dx = f � (g(x))dg(x). 

Solving  for  dg/dx  gives, 

d 
(g(x)) = 
dx 
This  is  the  formula  for  the  derivative  of  an  inverse  function. 


1/f � (g(x)). 

In  fact, we have seen this  formula before.  It  is how we computed the derivative of  ln(x),  the  inverse

function  of  e :

5.  Derivatives  of  the  inverse  trigonometric  functions.  Because  the  derivative  of  sin(x)  is 
cos(x),  the  formula  above  gives,

(sin−1 (x)) =

This  isn’t  very  useful.  A  simple  argument makes  it much more  useful.  Denote  sin−1 (x)  by  θ .  Thus 
sin(θ) = x.  Also,  the  formula  for  the  derivative  is  a  bit  simpler, 

d 
(sin−1 (x)) = 
dx

cos(θ) 

By  the  Pythagorean  theorem, 

Solving  gives,

sin2 (θ) + cos 2 (θ) = 1. 
√
1 − x . 
1 − sin2 (θ) = 
cos(θ) =

This  gives  a  very  useful  formula  for  the  derivative  of  sin−1 (x), 
√
1/

1 − x2 . 

d 
(sin−1 (x)) = 
dx 

There  is  a  very  similar  derivation  that, 

d 
(cos−1 (x)) = 
dx 

√
−1/

1 − x2 .

This  looks  remarkably  similar  to  the  previous  formula.  In  particular,  this  gives,

Therefore  the  sum  is  a  constant  function.  Checking  at  x  =  0  gives  the  value  of  this  constant 
function,

Finally,  because  the  derivative  of  tan(x)  is  sec2 (x),  the  formula  gives, 
(tan−1 (x)) = 

1 
d 
. 
sec2 (tan−1 (x)) 
dx
Again  introduce  θ = tan−1 (x).  Then  the  formula  for  the  derivative  is, 
d 
1 
(tan−1 (x)) = 
. 
sec2 (θ) 
dx

But  the  Pythagorean  theorem  implies,

sec 

(θ) = 1 + tan 2 (θ) = 1 + x

. 

This  ﬁnally  gives  a  very  useful  formula  for  the  derivative  of  tan(x), 
(tan−1 (x)) =  1/(1 + x2 ).

d 
dx
Notice,  in  particular,  that  the  denominator  is  never  zero.  This  is  closely  related  to  the  fact  that 
tan−1 (x)  is  deﬁned  on  the  entire  real  line. 
6.  Hyperbolic  trigonometric  functions.  The  trigonometric  functions  are  very  useful  for  dis­
� 
cussing  point  on  the  unit  circle  x2  + y 2  = 1,  because  the  circle  is  the  parametric  curve, 

x  =  cos(θ), 
y  = 
sin(θ) 
Are  there  analogous  continuous  functions  for  the  points  on  the  hyperbola  x2  − y 2  = 1? 
At  ﬁrst  blush,  the  answer  is  no.  The  problem  is  that  the  hyperbola  has  two  parts:  one  part  is  in 
the  half­plane  where  x  >  0,  and  the  other  part  is  in  the  half­plane  where  x  <  0.  Because  of  the 
intermediate  value  theorem,  a  continuous  function  x  =  f (t)  cannot  jump  from  x  >  0  to  x  <  0  or 
vice  versa  without  crossing  x  =  0.  Thus,  reﬁne  the  question:  Are  there  continuous  functions  for 
the  part  of  the  hyperbola  in  the  half­plane  where  x > 0? 
The answer to this question  is yes.  The corresponding  functions are called hyperbolic  trigonometric 
functions  or, more  often,  simply  hyperbolic  functions.  They  are  deﬁned  as  follows,

cosh(t) =  (e t  + e−t ),

The  ﬁrst  observation  is  that, 

cosh2 (t) =

(e t  + e−t )2  = (e 2t  + 2 + e−2t ),

sinh2 (t) =  (e t  − e−t )2  = 
(e 2t  − 2 + e−2t ).

Taking  the  diﬀerence  of  these, most  of  the  terms  cancel, 
4 
cosh2 (t) − sinh2 (t) = 
((2) − (−2)) =  = 1.

� 

This  proves  that  the  parametric  curve,

x  =  cosh(t), 
sinh(t) 
y  = 
is  contained  in  the  right­half  of  the  hyperbola  x2  − y 2  = 1.  We  will  see  next  time  that  there  is  an 
inverse  function of  sinh(t),  from which  it  follows  that  every  point  in  the  right­half of  the hyperbola 
occurs  for  exactly  one value of  t.  Thus  the parametric  curve  exactly  traces out  the  right­half of  the 
hyperbola. 

7.  The  derivatives  of  the  hyperbolic  functions.  The  derivatives  of  the  hyperbolic  functions 
are  straightforward.  The  formulas  are  very  similar  to  the  formulas  in  the  trigonometric  case,  but 
slightly  diﬀerent.  Try  not  to  confuse  them.
