1.  Using  power  series  to  solve  calculus  problems.  The  reason  power  series  are  useful  is 
� 
because  they  allow  us  to  describe  functions  that  have  no  direct  description.  For  instance,  consider 
the  function, 
e−t2 
dt, 
f (x) = 
0 
for  x  ≥  0.  By  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus,  this  function  exists  and  is  diﬀerentiable 
with  derivative  f � (x) =  e−x2 .  Unfortunately,  there  is  no  simple  expression  for  f (x)  involving  only

polynomials,  trigonometric  functions,  exponential  functions and  logarithms  (the proof of  this  is  far 
beyond  the  scope  of  this  class).  However,  it  is  quite  easy  to  write  down  a  power  series  expansion 
for  f (x).  First  of  all,  the  Taylor  series  for  e−t2  about  t = 0  is  obtained  by  substituting  x = −t2  in

This  is  the  Taylor  series  expansion  for  f (x)  about  x = 0.  For  instance,  using  this  series,  it  is  easy

2.  Taylor  series  with  remainder  term.  As  demonstrated  by  the  computation  just  done,  in 
reality only ﬁnitely many terms  in a Taylor series are used.  What can be said  in this case?  In other 
words,  how  quickly  does  the  series  converge?  How  large  is  the  remainder  after  n  terms?  To  make 
N� f (n) (a)
all  this  precise,  introduce  the  function  RN ,a (x)  deﬁned  to  be, 
RN ,a (x) = f (x) − 
n! 
n=0 
N� f (n) (a)
This  is  precisely  the  remainder  term  so  that  we  have,

(x − a)n . 

f (x) = 

The  precise  version  of  the  questions  above  is,  what  bounds  exist  for  RN ,a (x)? 
To  understand  the  answer,  consider  the  simplest  case  where  N  =  0.  Then  the  remainder  term  is 
simply, 
R0,a (x) = f (x) − f (a). 
By  the Mean Value Theorem,  for  every  x  there  exists  a  real  number  c  (depending  on  x)  between  a 
and  x  such  that, 
R0,a (x) = f � (c)(x − a).

Iterating  the  Mean  Value  Theorem,  for  every  integer  N ,  for  every  x,  there  exists  a  real  number  c 
(depending  on  both N  and  x)  between  a  and  x  such  that, 
(c)(x − a)N +1/(N

+ 1)!.

N ,a

) = 

In  particular,  if  we  can  bound  the  (N  + 1)st  derivative  of  f (x)  on  the  interval  between  a  and  c, 
then  we  can  bound  RN ,a (x). 
Example.  Bound  the  remainder  in  the Taylor  series  expansion  for  ex  about  x = a.  The  (N + 1)st 
derivative  is  simply  ex .  Therefore,  a  bound  for  f (N +1) (c)  for  c  between  a  and  x  is  simply, 

M  = e m  = e
max(a,x)

. 

This  is  independent  of N .  The  bound  on  the  remainder  term  is  then, 
|R (x)| ≤  M (x − a)N +1/(N
N ,a

+ 1)!. 

By  choosing N  suitably  large, we  can make  this  remainder  term  as  small  as possible.  For  instance, 
if  we  want  to  compute  e for  x  in  the  interval  (−1, 1),  then  M  equals  e.  To  make  the  remainder 
x
term  less  than  10−10 ,  it  suﬃces  to  take N  = 12. 
3.  Review  problems.  Each  of  the  following  problems  was  discussed  in  lecture.  Here  are  the 
problems  and  answers,  without  the  discussion. 

Problem  1.  Let  a  and  b  be  positive  real  numbers.  There  are  2  tangent  lines  to  the  ellipse  with 
equation, 

y 2 
x2 
a2  + 
b2  = 1, 
containing  the  point  (a, b).  Find  the  equations  of  each  of  these  tangent  lines. 

The  2  tangent  lines  are  the  line  tangent  to  the  ellipse  at  (x, y) = (0, b)  and  the  line  tangent  to  the 
ellipse  at  (x, y) = (a, 0).  The  equations  of  these  lines  are, 

and,


y = b, 

x = a. 

Problem  2.  A grain  silo  is designed by attaching a  cylinder of ﬁxed  radius  r  and height a directly 
above  a  right  circular  cone  of  base  radius  r  and  height  b.  The  silo  has  no  top,  and  there  is  no 
bottom  between  the  bottom  of  the  cylinder  and  the  top  of  the  cone.  For  a  ﬁxed  volume  V ,  what 
choice  of  b minimizes  the  surface  area  of  the  grain  silo? 

The  choice  of  b minimizing  the  surface  area  is, 

b =  2
