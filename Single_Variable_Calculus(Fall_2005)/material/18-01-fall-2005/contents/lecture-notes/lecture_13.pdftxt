1.  Diﬀerentials.  An  alternative  notation  for  derivatives  is  diﬀerential  notation.  The  diﬀerential 
notation, 

dF (x) = f (x)dx, 

is  shorthand  for  the  sentence  “The  derivative  of  F (x)  with  respect  to  x  equals  f (x).”  Formally, 
this  is  related  to  the  Leibniz  notation  for  the  derivative, 

dF 
(x) = f (x),
dx 

which  means  the  same  thing  as  the  diﬀerential  notation.  It  may  look  like  the  ﬁrst  and  second 
equation  are  obtained  by  dividing  and  multiplying  by  the  quantity  dx.  It  is  crucial  to  remember 
that  dF /dx  is  not  a  fraction,  although  the  notation  suggests  otherwise. 

In  diﬀerential  notation,  some  derivative  rules  have  a  very  simple  form,  and  are  thus  easier  to 

remember.  Here  are  a  few  derivative  rules  in  diﬀerential  notation.

d(F (x)/G(x))  =  1/(G(x))2 (G(x)dF (x) − F (x)dG(x)) 

The  chain  rule  has  a  particularly  simple  form,

Example.  Using  diﬀerential  notation,  the  derivative  of  sin(

x2  + 1)  is, 
2 (x2  + 1)−1/2 )d(x2  + 1) = 
d sin((x2  + 1)1/2 ) = cos((x2  + 1)1/2 )d(x2  + 1)1/2  = cos((x2  + 1)1/2 )( 1

2.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Recall,  the  basic  problem  of  diﬀerentiation  is  the  following. 
Problem  (Diﬀerentiation).  Given  a  function F (x),  ﬁnd  the  function  f (x)  satisfying  dF  = f (x).
dx 
The  bais  problem  of  antidiﬀerentiation  is  the  inverse  problem.

Problem  (Antidiﬀerentiation).  Given  a  function  f (x),  ﬁnd  a  function  F (x)  satisfying  dF  =

dx 
f (x). 
A  function F (x)  solving  the problem  is  called  an  antiderivative  of  f (x),  or  sometimes  an  indeﬁnite 
� 
integral  of  f (x).  The  notation  for  this  is, 

F (x) = 

f (x)dx. 

The  expression  f (x)  is  called  the  integrand.  It  is  important  to  note,  if  F (x)  is  one  antiderivative 
of  f (x),  then  for  each  constant  C ,  F (x) + C  is  also  an  antiderivative  of  f (x).  The  constant  C  is 
called  a  constant  of  integration. 
In a sense that can be made precise, the problem of diﬀerentiation has a complete solution whenever 
F (x)  is  a  “simple  expression”,  i.e.,  a  function  built  from  the  diﬀerentiable  functions  we  have  seen 
so  far.  Unfortunately,  for  very  many  simple  functions  f (x),  no  antiderivative  of  f (x)  has  a  simple 
expression.  In  large part,  this  is what makes antidiﬀerentiation diﬃcult.  Luckily, many of the most 
important  simple  functions  f (x)  do  have  an  antiderivative  with  a  simple  expression.  One  goal  of 
this unit is to learn how to recognize when a simple antiderivative exists, and some tools to compute 
the  antiderivative. 
3.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Guess­and­check.  The  main  technique  for  antidiﬀerentiation  is  edu­
cated  guessing. 
Example.  Find  an  antiderivative  of  f (x) = x2  + 2x + 1.  Since  the  derivative  of  xn  is  nxn−1 ,  it  is 
reasonable  to  guess  there  is  an  antiderivative  of  the  form  F (x) = Ax3  + Bx2  + C x.  Diﬀerentiation 
gives, 

dF 
dx 
Thus,  F (x)  is  an  antiderivative  of  f (x)  if  and  only  if, 

= 3Ax2  + 2Bx + C. 

This  gives  an  antiderivative,

3A = 1,  2B  = 2,  and  C  = 1. 

(x 2  + 2x + 1)dx =  1 
3 x3  + x2  + x + E  ,

where  E  is  any  constant.

Guess­and­check is a game we can lose, as well as win.  However, there are a few rules that better the 
odds  in  this  guessing  game.  In  fact,  they  are  basically  the  same  rules  for  derivatives  in  diﬀerential

4.  Antidiﬀerentiation.  Integration  by  substitution.  The  last  rule  above  is  very  important, 
and  called  integration  by  substitution. 

Example.  Find  an  antiderivative  of  x sin(x2 ).  This  time  guess­and­check  is  much  less  eﬀective. 
By  roughly  the  same  logic  in  the  last  example,  we  might  guess  an  antiderivative  has  the  form 
Ax3  sin(x2 ).  The  derivative  is  3Ax2  sin(x2 ) + 2Ax4 cos(x2 ).  The  ﬁrst  term  is  good,  but  the  second 
term is bad.  We can try to correct our guess by adding a term, Ax3  sin(x2 ) − 2/5Ax5 cos(x2 ), whose 
derivative is now 3Ax2  sin(x2 ) + 4/5Ax6  sin(x2 ).  This still doesn’t work, and is leading in the wrong 
direction. 

A  better  solution  is  to  use  integration  by  substitution.  Observe  part  of  f (x)  can  be  written  as 
a  function  of  u(x) =  x2 .  Also,  the  derivative  u� (x) = 2x  occurs  in  f (x)  through  x  = 1/2(2x) = 
u� (x)/2.  Thus, 
x sin(x  ) = sin(u(x))u� (x)/2, u(x) = x 2 .

Here  is  a  checklist  for  applying  integration  by  substition  to  ﬁnd  the  antiderivative  of  f (x). 

(i)  Find  an  expression	 u(x)  so  that  most  of  the  integrand  f (x)  can  be  expressed  as  a  simpler 
function  of  u(x). 
(ii)  Compute  the  diﬀerential  du(x) = u� (x)dx. 
(iii)  Inside  the  diﬀerential  f (x)dx,  try  to  ﬁnd  du = u� (x)dx  as  a  factor. 
(iv)  Try  to  write  f (x)dx  as  g(u)du.  If  you  cannot  do  this,  the  method  does  not  apply  with  the 
� 
given  choice  of  u. 
(v)  Find  an  antiderivative G(u) =  g(u)du  for  the  simpler  integrand  g(u)  (if  this  is  possible). 
(vi)  Back­substitute  u = u(x)  to  get  an  antiderivative  F (x) = G(u(x))  for  f (x).

Example.  Compute  the  antiderivative, 

sin(x)3 cos(x)dx. 

Most  of  the  integrand  is  a  function  of  sin(x).  So  substitute  u(x) =  sin(x).  The  diﬀerential  of  u  is 
du = cos(x)dx.  The diﬀerential sin(x)3 cos(x)dx contains du = cos(x)dx as a factor.  The remainder

of  the  integrand  is  sin(x)3  = u .  So,  according  to  integration  by  substitution,

sin(x)3 cos(x)dx =
