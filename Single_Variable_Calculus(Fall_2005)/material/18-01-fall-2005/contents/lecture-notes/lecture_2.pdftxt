1.  Tangent  lines  to  graphs.  For  y  =  f (x),  the  equation  of  the  secant  line  through 
(x0 , f (x0 ))  and  (x0  + Δx, f (x0  + Δx))  is, 
f (x0  + Δx) − f (x0 )
Δx 

(x − x0 ) + f (x0 ). 

y = 

In  the  limit,  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  through  (x0 , f (x0 ))  is, 
y = f � (x0 )(x − x0 ) + y0 . 

Example.  For  the  parabola  y = x2 ,  the  derivative  is, 
y � (x0 ) =  2x0 . 

The  equation  of  the  tangent  line  is, 
y = 2x0 (x − x0 ) =  2x0x − x2 
0 . 

For  instance,  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  through  (2, 4)  is, 
y =  4x − 4.

Given  a  point  (x, y), what  are  all  points  (x0 , x0 )  on  the  parabola whose  tangent  line  contains 
(x, y)?  To  solve,  consider  x  and  y  as  constants  and  solve  for  x0 .  For  instance,  if  (x, y) = 
(1, −3),  this  gives, 
(−3) = 2x0 (1) − x0 ,

or, 

2 x0  − 2x0  − 3 = 0.

Factoring (x0 − 3)(x0 + 1),  the solutions are x0  equals −1 and x0  equals 3.  The corresponding 
tangent  lines  are, 
y = −2x − 1, 

and 

y = 6x − 9. 
x0  =  x ± � 
For  general  (x, y),  the  solutions  are, 
x2  − y .

2.  Limits.  Precise deﬁnition is on p.  791 of Appendix A.2.  Intuitive deﬁnition:  limx
→x0 
equals  L  if  and  only  if  all  values  of  f (x)  can  be  made  arbitrarily  close  to  L  by  choosing  x 
suﬃciently close  to x0 .  One  interpretation  is  the “microscope/laser  illuminator” analogy:  An 
observer  focuses  a  microscopes  ﬁeld­of­view  on  a  thin  strip  parallel  to  the  x­axis  centered 
on  y  =  L.  The  goal  of  the  illuminator  is  to  focus  a  laser­beam  centered  on  x0  parallel  to 
the  y ­axis  (but  with  the  line  x  =  x0  deleted)  so  that  only  the  portion  of  the  graph  in  the 
ﬁeld­of­view  is  illuminated.  If  for  every magniﬁcation  of  the microscope,  the  illuminator  can 
succeed,  then  the  limit  is  deﬁned  and  equals  L. 

There  is  a  beautiful  Java  applet  on  the  webpage  of  Daniel  J.  Heath  of  Paciﬁc  Lutheran 
University, 

http://www.plu.edu/~heathdj/java/calc1/Epsilon.html 
If  you  use  this,  try  a = −1. 

For  left­hand  limits,  use  a  laser  that  illuminates  only  to  the  left  of  x0 .  For  right­hand  limits, 
use  a  laser  that  illuminates  only  to  the  right  of  x0 . 

3.  Continuity.  A  function  f (x)  is  continuous  at  x0  if  f (x0 )  is  deﬁned,  limx
f (x)  is 
→x0 
f (x)  equals  f (x0 ).  Also,  f (x)  is  continuous  on  an  interval  if  it  is  contin­
deﬁned,  and  limx
→x0 
uous  at  every  point  of  the  interval.  The  types  of  discontinuity  are:  removable  discontinuity, 
jump  discontinuity,  inﬁnite  discontinuity  and  essential  discontinuity.
