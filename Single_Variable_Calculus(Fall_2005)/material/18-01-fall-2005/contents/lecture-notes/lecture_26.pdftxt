1.  Review  of  inverse  substitution  and  another  example.  Recall  the  general  strategy  for 
� 
ﬁnding  an  antiderivative  of  the  form, 
√
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 
F (x, 
√
dx. 
G(x, 
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 
� 
For  deﬁniteness,  consider  the  example, 

√

2x
dx,
x2  − 2ax + 2a2 

where  a  is  a  constant. 
Step  1.  Complete  the  square.  Complete  the  square of  the  expression Ax2 + Bx + C ,  inside  the 
radical.  In  the  example, 
x  − 2ax + 2a 2  = (x − a)2  + a . 
2

Step  2.  Make  a  linear  change  of  coordinates.  Make a linear change of coordinates to simplify 
the  quadratic  term  to  one  of  the  3  types:  a2  − x ,  x − a ,  or  x2  + a .  In  the  example,  this means 
2 
2
2
2
making  the  linear  change  of  variables, 

u = x − a, du = dx. 
� 
� 
The  new  quadratic  term  is  u2  + a ,  the  third  type.  The  new  antiderivative  is, 
2

2

u2  + 2u + a
√
u2  + a
2

du. 

(u + a)2 
√
u2  + a
2

du = 

Step  3.  Use  inverse  substitution  to  eliminate  the  radicals.  There  is a choice of  inverse sub­
stitution:  trigonometric, hyperbolic or  rational.  When  starting out,  it  is a good  idea to experiment 
with  all  3.  On  an  exam,  usually  one  choice  will  be  suggested  (or  even  demanded).  When  no  other 
guidance  is given,  trigonometric substitution  is a good starting point (because you are already very 
familiar  with  trigonometric  functions). 

In  the  example,  to  eliminate  the  radical,  the  correct  inverse  trigonometric  substitution  is, 

u = a tan(θ),  du = a sec 2 (θ)dθ. 

This  is  because  the  quadratic  term  becomes, 

u  + a  = a  tan  (θ) + a 2  = a  sec  (θ). 
2

� 
With  this  substitution,  the  new  antiderivative  is, 
� 
a2  tan2 (θ) + 2a2  tan(θ) + a
2
a2  sec2 (θ) 

a sec 2 (θ)dθ. 

18.01  Calculus 

This  simpliﬁes  to, 

� 

2 a 

� 
This  can  be  written  as  a  sum  of  3  terms, 

(tan 2 (θ) + 2 tan(θ) + 1) sec(θ)dθ.

sec(θ)dθ. 

Step  4.  Compute  the  new  antiderivative.  If  this were  only  as  simple  as  it  sounds,  how much 
easier  calculus  would  be!  This  step  is  often  diﬃcult  in  itself.  Often  it  requires  at  least  one  more 
direct  substitution.  Sometimes,  it  also  requires  a  partial  fractions  decomposition.  We  will  return 
to  this  step  below. 

Step  5.  Back­substitute.  This  is always a  step  for a method using direct  substitution or  inverse 
substitution.  This  step  frequently  introduces  terms  like  cos(tan−1 (x)).  Time­permitting  (or  when 
speciﬁcally  instructed  to  do  so),  these  terms  should  be  simplifed  using  the  right­triangle  method 
from  lecture, 
√
θ = tan−1 (x), x/1 = tan(θ) = Opposite/Adjacent, Hypotenuse = 
√
1/

cos(θ) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = 

1 + x ,

1 + 
x2 .

Step  6.  Check  your  answer.  When  feasible,  check your answer.  Since diﬀerentiation  is so much 
faster  than  antidiﬀerentiation,  it  is  usually  quite  easy  to  check  an  antiderivative  is  correct.

Example.  The  tricky  part  is,  of  course,  Step  4.  In  the  example,  the  integral  broke  into  3  terms, 

2
a 

tan  (θ) sec(θ)dθ + 2a 2 
2

sec(θ) tan(θ)dθ + a 2 

sec(θ)dθ. 

� 
The  last  antiderivative  was  actually  Problem  3(b)  from  Part  II  of  Problem  Set  4.  It  turns  out  to 
be, 
√
√
� 
u2  + a2 ) + C  =  a2  ln(x − a + 
sec(θ)dθ = a 2  ln(u + 
1 + tan2 (θ). So  the  middle  term 

2 a 
The  middle  antiderivative  is  simply  the  derivative  of  sec(θ)  = 
� 
is, 

√
√
sec(θ) tan(θ)dθ = 2a 2  sec(θ) + C  = 2a
a2  + u2  + C  =  2a
But the ﬁnal term does not simplify in an obvious way.  In such cases, it is best to express everything

in  terms  of  sin(θ)  and  cos(θ)  to  get  a  fresh  perspective,

The  new  antiderivative  is,

How  do  we  compute  this  antiderivative?  That  is  the  topic  of  partial  fractions.

Remark:  In  lecture  the  solution  was  done  a  bit  diﬀerently.  This  led  to  a  slightly  diﬀerent  an­
tiderivative,

(1 − z 2 )2

Notice  the  diﬀerence  of  these  2  antiderivatives  is, 
(1) − (z 2 )
(1 − z 2 )2 

dz = 

1 
dz . 
(1 − z 2 ) 

This  was  computed  in  Problem  3(a),  Part  II  of  Problem  Set  4.  Thus,  computing  either  of  the  2 
antiderivatives  gives  both  of  them. 

2.  Antidiﬀerentiating  simple  rational  expressions.  A  rational  expression  is  a  fraction  of 
polynomials,  F (x)/G(x).  These  frequently  arise  in  Step  4  of  the  algorithm  above.  From  the  point 
of  view  of  antidiﬀerentiation,  the  simplest  rational  expressions  are  either  polynomials, 
+ · · ·
q(x) = anx n  + an−1x n−1 

+ a1x + a0 ,

or  else  partial  fractions, 

A 
. 
(x − a)m 
There  are  2  other  kinds  of  partial  fractions  which  were  not  emphasized  in  lecture, 
B (x − a) 
((x − a)2  + b2 )m 

C 
. 
((x − a)2  + b2 )m 

and 

These  2  kinds  come  up  less  often  than  the  ﬁrst  kind.  But  they  do  come  up,  for  instance,  when 
studying  Laplace  transforms  in  18.03.  Both  polynomials  and  partial  fractions  are  (relatively)  easy 
� 
to  antidiﬀerentiate.  The  antiderivative  of  a  polynomial  is,

3.  Simplifying  rational  expressions:  division  and  factoring Many  rational  expressions  that 
come  up  are  not  of  the  simple  kinds  above.  The  goal  is  to  express  an  arbitrary  rational  expression 
as  the  sum  of  a  polynomial  and  partial  fractions.  The  ﬁrst  step  is  polynomial  division.  Given  a 
fraction  F (x)/G(x),  apply  polynomial  division  to  get  a  factorization  with  remainder, 

F (x) = q(x)G(x) + r(x), 

where  q(x)  is  a  polynomial  and  r(x)  is  a  polynomial  of  degree  less  than  deg(G(x)).  This  leads  to 
the  reduced  form  of  a  rational  expression, 

F (x) 
G(x) 

= q(x) + 

r(x) 
. 
G(x) 

Example.  I  forgot  the  example  from  lecture.  Here  is  a  similar  example.  Find  the  reduced  form  of 
(x3  + 1)/(x2  + 3x + 2).  The  polynomial  division  algorithm  gives, 
3 x  + 1 = (x 2  + 3x + 2)(x − 3) + (7x + 7), 
Thus  q(x)  is  x − 3  and  r(x)  is  7x + 7.  So  the  reduced  form  is, 
x3  + 1 
x2  + 3x + 2 

7x+7 
x2+3x+2 .

The next step is to factor the denominator into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic factors, 
G(x) = A(x − a1 )m1  · (x − a2 )m2 
· · · · · (x − ak )mk 
· ((x − α1 )2  + b2

Here  k  and  l  are  nonnegative  integers  and  m1 , . . . , mk , n1 , . . . , nl  are  positive  integers.  Also, 
a1 , . . . , ak ,  α1 , . . . , αl ,  and  β1 , . . . , βl  are  real  numbers.  The  last  l  factors  were  not  discussed  in 
lecture  until  the  end  of  lecture.  Although  they  are  important,  they  do  not  often  come  up  in  this 
course. 

The  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Algebra  asserts  that  every  polynomial  with  real  coeﬃcients  has  a 
factorization  as  above.  However,  ﬁnding  the  factorization  can be very diﬃcult.  In  all  exercises  and 
exam problems,  either the  factorization  is easy, or the  factorization will be given to you.  Whenever 
possible,  cancel  common  factors  from  the  numerator  and  denominator. 

Example.  In  the  example,  the  quadratic  formula  gives  the  factorization, 

x 2  + 3x + 2 = 

(x

x+ 2)( + 1). 

The numerator r(x)  is 7(x + 1).  Thus the numerator and denominator have a common  factor.  This 
leads  to  a  better  reduced  form, 

x3  + 1 
x2  + 3x + 2 

= x − 3 +

x + 2

This  can  now  be  integrated  to  give,

4.  Simplifying  rational  expressions:  partial  fraction  decomposition.  Using  the  last  part, 
every  rational  expression  can  be  written  in  the  form, 

,

F (x) 
G(x) 

r(x) 
= q(x)+ 
H (x)

r(x)

1 )n1 
where  q(x)  is  a  polynomial,  the  degree  of  r(x)  is  less  than  the  degree  of  H (x),  and  r(x)  has  no 
common  factor  with  H (x).  This  can  be  further  simpliﬁed  using  partial  fraction  decomposition.  It

Here  all  the  terms  Ci,j ,  Di,j  and  Ei,j  are  real  constants.  This  sum  of  partial  fractions  is  called  the 
partial  fraction  decomposition  of  r(x)/H (x).  The  diﬃculty  is  precisely  to  ﬁnd  the  constants  Ci,j , 
Di,j ,  and  Ei,j .

One  approach,  which  always  works  but  is  quite  ineﬃcient,  is  simply  to  multiply  all  terms  by  the 
denominator H (x),  and  then  gather  coeﬃcients  of  powers  of  x.  This will  give  a  collection  of  linear 
equations  in  the  unknowns  Ci,j ,  Di,j  and  Ei,j .  There  is  a  unique  solution  of  this  set  of  linear 
equations.  Methods  of  linear  algebra,  e.g., Gauss­Jordan  elimination,  give  an  algorithm  for ﬁnding 
the  solution. 

Example.  Find  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  of, 

1 
. 
1 − x2 
In  fact  this  was  Problem  3(a),  Part  II  of  Problem  Set  4.  The  partial  fraction  decomposition  will 
have  the  form, 

B 
1 
A
+ 
. 
1 − x2 
x − 1 
=
x + 1 
Multiplying  both  sides  of  the  equation  by  x2  − 1 = (x + 1)(x − 1)  gives, 
−1 = A(x − 1) + B (x + 1) = (A + B )x + (B − A). 
�

This  gives  the  system  of  2  linear  equations  in  2  unknowns, 

A  +  B  = 0, 
+  B  =  −1
−A 
Solving  the  ﬁrst  equation  for  B  = −A  and  plugging  this  into  the  second  equation  gives, 
1 
⇔ 
−A + (−A) = −1
⇔
2A = 1  A = 
.
2 
Thus  B  = −A = −1/2.  So  the  partial  fraction  decomposition  is,

The  Heaviside  cover­up  method.  The  Heaviside  cover­up  method  is  a  method  for  deter­
5. 
mining  many  of  the  coeﬃcients  Ci,j .  For  each  highest  power  of  a  linear  factor  occuring  in  H (x), 
�� � �

say  (x − ai )mi ,  cover­up  that  term,  and  substitute  x = ai  in  the  remaining  polynomial.  Then Ci,mi 
equals  the  value, 
r(x)
Ci,mi  = 
. 
H (x)/(x − ai )mi 
x=ai 
The  proof  is  quite  simple.  Multiply  every  term  in  the  partial  fraction decomposition  by  (x − ai )mi . 
One  term  is  (x − ai )mi (Ci,mi /(x − ai )mi ) =  Ci,mi .  Every  other  term  has  a  factor  (x − ai )  that  is 
not  cancelled  by  the  denominator.  Thus  plugging  in  x  =  ai ,  every  other  term  is  0.  And  the  only 
remaining  term  is  Ai,mi .

As  this  example  illustrates,  the  Heaviside  cover­up  method  does  not  always  determine  all  coeﬃ­
cients.  However,  it  reduces  the  number  of  coeﬃcients.  To  ﬁnd  the  remaining  coeﬃcients,  either 
clear denominators, or else substitute for x some useful numbers (where H (x) is nonzero), and solve 
the  resulting  linear  equations. 
Example.  Find  the  full  partial  fraction  decomposition  of,

The  rational  expression  is  unchanged  by  the  substitution  z  ↔ −z .  Thus  the  same  is  true  for  the 
partial  fraction  decomposition.  Therefore  C2,1  equals −C1,1 .  This  gives,
