1.  Inverse hyperbolic  functions.  There are a few other useful formulas for hyperbolic functions; 
for  instance,  the  analogues  of  the  angle­addition  formulas, 

sinh(s + t) = sinh(s) cosh(t) + cosh(s) sinh(t), 

cosh(s + t) = cosh(s) cosh(t) + sinh(s) sinh(t). 

These  imply  the  double­angle  formulas, 

sinh(2t) = 2 sinh(t) cosh(t), 
cosh(2t) = cosh2 (t) + sinh2 (t) = 2 cosh2 (t) − 1 = 2 sinh2 (t) + 1. 
From  these  follow  the  analogues  of  the  half­angle  formulas, 
(cosh(t) − 1),

sinh2 (t/2) = 

cosh2 (t/2) = 

1
(cosh(t) + 1).

A beautiful  feature of hyperbolic  functions  is that their  inverse  functions can be expressed  in terms 
of  simpler  functions.  The  inverse  function  sinh−1 (x)  of  sinh(x)  is  deﬁned  on  the  whole  real  line. 
By  deﬁnition, 
sinh−1 (x) = y  if  and  only  if  sinh(y) = x. 
This  second  equation  can  be  written  out  as, 
1 
(ey  − e−y ) = x. 
2 

Substituting  z = ey  gives, 

1 
(z − z−1 ) = x. 
2 

Multiplying  both  sides  by  2z  gives, 
2 z  − 1 = 2xz ⇔ z 2  − 2xz − 1 = 0. 

Completing  the  square  gives, 

Taking  square  roots  gives, 

(z − x)2  = x 2  + 1. 
√

z = x ±

x2  + 1.

Since  z  equals  ey ,  z  is  positive.  Thus,  the  correct  square  root  is, 
√
z = x + 

x2  + 1. 
√
y = ln(z ) = ln(x + 

x2  + 1). 

Finally  this  gives, 

Therefore,  the  formula  for  the  inverse  hyperbolic  sine  is, 
√
sinh−1 (x) = 
ln(x + 

x2  + 1). 

The  same  type  of  argument  also  gives, 
cosh−1 (x) =

ln(x + 

x2  − 1),  x ≥ 1,

2.  Derivatives  of  the  inverse  hyperbolic  functions.  By  the  same  methods  used  to  compute 
the derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions, the derivatives of the inverse hyperbolic functions 
are,

These  can  also  be  computed  using  the  formulas  for  the  inverse  functions.

3.  Inverse substitution.  The derivatives of inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions 
x2  − 1)  equals  cosh−1 (x) + C . 
allow  us  to  compute  more  antiderivatives  than  before,  e.g.,  dx/(
Essentially  this  comes  down  to  making  a  direct  substitution  of  an  inverse  function,  e.g.,  u  = 
cosh−1 (x).  However,  this  is  logically  equivalent  to  making  an  inverse  substition,  x  =  cosh(u). 
When  the  integrand  is  more  complicated,  inverse  substitution  is  usually  simpler  and  faster  than 
direct  substitution  of  an  inverse  function. 
� 
Example.  Compute  the  following  antiderivative, 
√
a2  − x2dx. 

This  is  not  quite  the  derivative  of  an  inverse  function  above.  However,  it  is  clear  that  inverse 
substituting  x = a sin(θ)  will  simplify  the  integrand,  because 
a  − x  = a  − (a sin(θ))2  = a  (1 − sin2 (θ)) = a  cos  (θ).

4.  Three  diﬀerent  kinds  of  integrals,  three  kinds  of  inverse  substitution.  The  type  of 
� 
antiderivative  where  inverse  substitution  is most  successful  has  the  form, 
√
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 
F (x, 
√
dx, 
G(x, 
Ax2  + Bx + C ) 

where A, B  and C  are constants, and F (x, y) and G(x, y) are polynomial functions  in the two argu­
ments.  Inverse  substitution  together  with  partial  fractions  solves  all  such  antiderivative  problems.

For  each  of  these  types,  there  are  3  possible  inverse  substitutions:  trigonometric,  hyperbolic  and 
rational.  A  ﬂow  chart  of  the  9  possible  outcomes  will  be  posted  on  the  course  webpage.  Here  are 
a  couple  of  examples.  In  each  example,  the  inverse  rational  substitution  is  given,  although  it  was 
only  brieﬂy  discussed  in  lecture.

The  ﬁrst  of  these  terms  is  just  a2  tan−1 (u).  However,  the  second  term  requires  another  inverse

substitution.  All  in  all,  this  is  not  a  very  eﬃcient  approach.

Finally,  the  rational  inverse  substitution  is,


The  point  is  that, 

Thus  the  new  antiderivative  is,

Notice,  these  two  integrals  are  the  same  type  that  occurred  with  inverse  hyperbolic  substitution. 
But  they  came  up more  quickly:  rational  inverse  substitution  is more  eﬃcient  than  inverse  hyper­
bolic  substitution  for  this  problem.  However,  both  require  a  further  inverse  trigonometric  substi­
tution.  So  inverse  trigonometric  substitution  is  the most  eﬃcient  for  this  problem.
