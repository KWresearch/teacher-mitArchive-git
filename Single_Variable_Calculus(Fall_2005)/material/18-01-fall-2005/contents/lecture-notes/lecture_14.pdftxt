1.  The  problem  of  areas.  The  ancient  Greeks  computed  the  areas  of  triangles,  quadrilaterals, 
and many other polygons.  Their basic method was dissection :  dissecting a polygonal region exactly 
into  smaller  regions,  usually  triangles,  having known  areas.  The area of  the  large  region  is  the  sum 
of  the  areas  of  the  small  regions.  But  the  ancient  Greeks  also  knew  the  area  of  a  circle,  which 
cannot  be  dissected  exactly  into  ﬁnitely  many  polygonal  regions.  Their  method  was  exhaustion : 
ﬁnding  polygonal  regions  approximately  equal  to  the  original  region,  and  computing  the  limit  of 
the  areas  of  the  polygons  as  the  approximation  improves. 
Example.  A  regular  N ­sided  polygon  inscribed  in  a  circle  of  radius  r  has  apothem  length  a  = 
r cos(π/N )  and  chord  length  b = 2r sin(π/N ).  Thus  the  area  of  the  polygon  is, 
sin(2π/N ) = πr 2 sin(2π/N ) 
.

As  N  increases,  2π/N  decreases  to  0.  Because  limt

the  area  of  the  polygon  approaches,

A more  sophisticated  version  of  the method  of  exhaustion  gives  the  Riemann  integral.  Here  is  the 
basic  problem. 

Problem  (Area).  Find  the  signed  area  between  the  graph  of  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  over  the 
interval  a ≤ x ≤ b.

For a region above the x­axis,  the signed  area  is simply the area.  For a region below the x­axis,  the 
signed  area  is  the  negative  of  the  area.  For  a  region  partly  above  the  x­axis  and  partly  below  the 
x­axis,  the  signed  area  is  the  sum  of  the  signed  area  of  the  region  above  the  x­axis  and  the  signed 
area  of  the  region  below  the  x­axis. 
2.  Partitions.  A  partition  of  an  interval  [a, b]  is  a  ﬁnite  decomposition  of  the  interval  as  a  union 
of  non­overlapping  subintervals, 
[a, b] = [x0 , x1 ] ∪ [x1 , x2 ]
n−2 ] ∪
Since  an  interval  is  determined  by  its  right  and  left  endpoints,  to  specify  a  partition  of  [a, b],  it  is 
equivalent  to  give  an  ordered  sequence  of  increasing  numbers, 
a = x0  < x1  < x2  < · · · < xn−2  < xn−1  < xn  = b. 
The  k th  subinterval  of  the  partition  is  the  interval  [xk−1 , xk ],  having  length, 
Δxk  = xk  − xk−1 . 

∪ · · · ∪

[xn−2 , x

[xn−1 , xn ].

A partition is ﬁne  if the subintervals are small, and coarse  if the subintervals are large.  It may seem 
the  number  of  intervals  n  is  a  good  measure  of  ﬁneness:  since  the  subintervals  of  a  ﬁne  partition 
are  small,  the number n of  subintervals must be  large.  However, a partition  into many  subintervals 
may  include  a  few  subintervals  that  are  quite  large.  For  instance,  the  partition 
∪ · · ·∪ [(n−2)/2n, (n−1)/2n ∪
[n−1/2n, n/2n]∪ [1/2, 1],
[0, 1] =  [0, 1/2n]∪ [1/2n, 2/2n]∪ [2/2n, 3/2n]
]

has  n  very  small  intervals  of  length  1/2n,  but  has  one  interval,  [1/2, 1],  of  size  1/2.  The  number 
1/2 may  not  seem  large,  but  as  n  increases,  it  is  quite  large  compared  to  1/2n. 
Because  of  such  examples,  a  better  measure  of  ﬁneness  is  mesh  size:  The  mesh  size  of  a  partition 
is  the maximal  length  of  any  subinterval  in  the  partition, 
mesh = max Δxk |k = 1, . . . , n. 
3.  Riemann  sums.  Let  f (x)  be  a  function  deﬁned  on  an  interval  a ≤  x ≤  b.  Given  a  partition 
<  · · · 
<  xn  =  b  of  [a, b],  and  given  a  choice,  for  every  k  = 1, . . . , n,  of  element  x∗  in  the 
a  =  x0 
k th  subinterval,  xk−1  ≤  x∗  ≤  xk ,  the  curvilinear  region  bounded  by  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  is 
k
k 
approximated by  a union  of n  vertical  strips.  The  k th  vertical  strip  lies  above  or below  the  interval 
on  the  x­axis,  xk−1  ≤  x ≤  xk ,  and  has  height  y ∗  =  f (x∗ 
k ).  The  width  of  the  vertical  strip  is  Δxk ,
k 
thus  the  signed  area  is, 
ΔAk  = y ∗Δxk .

The  total  area  of  the  union  of  vertical  strips  is  simply  the  sum  of  the  areas  of  individual  vertical

The  sum  above  is  a  Riemann  sum.  It  is  an  approximation  of  the  signed  area  of  the  curvilinear 
region. 

There are many choices of partition.  And for each partition, there are many choices for the numbers 
x∗ 
k .  However,  there  are  some  special  choices.  On  the  k th  interval,  the  smallest  value  f (x)  takes  on 
is  denoted  by, 
yk,min  = min{f (x) xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk+1}. 
|
Similarly,  the  largest  value  f (x)  takes  on  is  denote  by, 
yk,max  = max{f (x) xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk+1}.
|
For  every  choice  of  x∗  in  the  k th  interval,  y ∗  is  trapped  between  these  two  values, 
k 
k
yk,min  ≤ y ∗ 
k  ≤ yk,max . 

Denoting, 

ΔAk,min  = yk,minΔxk ,  ΔAk,max  = yk,maxΔxk , 
the  area ΔAk  is  trapped  between  these  two  values, 
ΔAk,min  ≤ ΔAk  ≤ ΔAk,max .

Amax  = 
k=1 ΔAk,min  = 
k=1 yk,minΔxk , 
the  Riemann  sum  A  is  trapped  between  the  two  values, 
Amin  ≤ A ≤ Amax . 
Thus,  if  Amin  and  Amax  are  close  to  each  other,  the  value  of  A  does  not  depend  very  much  on  the 
choices  of  the  numbers  x∗ 
k . 
4.  The  Riemann  integral.  The  method  of  the  Riemann  integral  is  to  compute  both  Amin  and 
Amax  for a sequence of partitions whose mesh sizes approach 0.  The mesh size measures the ﬁneness 
of  the  partition,  thus  also  the  ﬁt  of  the  union  of  vertical  strips  to  the  curvilinear  region.  If  the  two 
limits, 

lim  Amax , 
lim  Amin ,

are  deﬁned  and  equal,  it  is  said  the  Riemann  integral  exists,  and  the  common  limit  is  called  the 
Riemann  integral, 
lim  Amin  = 
lim  Amax .

Also,  f (x)  is  said  to  be  Riemann  integrable  on  the  interval  [a, b].  Another  name  for  the  Riemann 
integral  is  the  deﬁnite  integral.

Example.  Consider  the  function  f (x) =  x  on  the  interval  0  ≤  x  ≤  L,  for  some  positive  number 
L.  Form  the  partition  with  n  subintervals  of  equal  length, 

x0  = 0 = 0L/n, x1  = 1L/n, x2  = 2L/n, . . . , xk  = kL/n, . . . xn  = nL/n = L. 

and, 

Amin  = 

Amax  = 

Every  interval has  length Δxk  = L/n.  So  the mesh  size  is L/n.  The minimum value of f (x) on  the 
interval  xk−1  ≤ x ≤ xk  is  yk,min  = xk−1  = (k − 1)L/n.  The maximum  value  is  yk,max  = xk  = kL/n.

Since  the  two  limits  are  equal,  f (x) = x  is  Riemann  integrable  on  the  interval  [0, L],  and,

This  agrees  with  the  familiar  result  from  high­school  geometry:  the  area  of  a  triangle  equals  one 
half  of  the  base  times  the  height,  since  both  the  base  and  height  of  this  triangle  are  L.
