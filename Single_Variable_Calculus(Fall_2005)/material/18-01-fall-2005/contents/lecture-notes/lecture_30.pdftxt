1.  Sequences By deﬁnition, a sequence  of real numbers is a rule assigning to each counting number 
n  an  associated  real  number  an .  The  integer  n  is  called  the  index  of  the  sequence.  Usually  the 
index  begins with  n = 1,  but  occasionally  it  begins with  another  integer  (sometimes  0).  Sequences 
are  often  speciﬁed  by  giving  the  ﬁrst  few  values,  and  letting  the  reader  infer  the  rule,  e.g., 

1 
, . . .

It  is  always  better  to  give  a  precise  deﬁnition  of  each  sequence,  e.g., 

,  a3  = 

1
2

a1  = 

,  a2  =

The most  common  notation  for  a  sequence  is  (an )n≥1 .

A  sequence  (an )n≥1  converges  to  a  limit  L  if  the  sequence becomes arbitrarily  close  to L,  and  stays 
arbitrarily  close  to  L.  More  precisely,  the  sequence  converges  to  L  if  for  every  positive  number  �, 
there  exists  an  integer N  (depending  on  the  sequence  and  �)  such  that  for  every  integer  n ≥ N , 
an  − L < �.
|
| 
In  other  words,  the  tail  of  the  sequence  aN , aN +1 , aN +2 , . . .  are  all  numbers  in  the  interval  (L −
�, L + �).  A  sequence  cannot  have  more  than  1  limit:  given  2  potential  limits  L1  and  L2 ,  simply 
take  � =  L1 − L2 /2  in  the  deﬁnition  above.  A  sequence which  has  a  limit  is  said  to  converge,  and 
|
|
the  limit  is  denoted  by, 

L =  lim  an . 
n→∞ 
A  sequence  which  does  not  have  a  limit  is  said  to  diverge. 

Examples. 

(i)  Let  L  be  a  ﬁxed  real  number.  The  sequence  an  = L, n = 1, 2, . . .  converges  to  L. 
(ii)  The  sequence  an  = n  diverges.  In  a  precise  sense,  this  sequence  “diverges  to ∞”. 
(iii)  The  sequence  an  = (−1)n  diverges,  even  though  it  is  bounded  (it  never  gets  bigger  than  1  or 
smaller  than −1). 
(iv)  Let  r  be  a  real  number.  The  sequence  an  =  rn , n  = 0, 1, 2, . . .  converges  to  0  if  |r|  <  1  and 
diverges  if  |r|  >  1.  There  are  2  remaining  cases.  If  r  =  −1,  then  an  = (−1)n  diverges.  If 
r = 1,  then  an  = 1  converges  to  1. 

2.  Tests  for  convergence/divergence.  One useful test for convergence is the Squeezing Lemma. 
The  squeezing  lemma.  Let  (an )n≥1 ,  (bn )n≥1  and  (cn )n≥1  be  sequences  such  that  for  every  index 
n, 
an  ≤ bn  ≤ cn . 
In  other  words,  the  sequence  (bn )  is  “squeezed”  between  the  sequences  (an )  and  (cn ).  If  (an )  and 
(cn )  converge,  and  if, 

lim  an  =  lim  cn , 
n→∞ 
n→∞ 
then  also  (bn )  converges  and  its  limit  equals  the  limit  of  the  other  2  sequences. 
Another  test  for  convergence  is  the Monotone  Convergence  Test.  A  sequence  (an )n≥1  is  called non­
decreasing  if  for  every  index  n,  an+1  ≥ an .  Similarly,  a  sequence  (an )  is  non­increasing  if  for  every 
index  n,  an+2  ≤  an .  A  sequence  which  is  either  non­decreasing  or  non­increasing  (but  not  both 
increasing  and  decreasing)  is  called  monotone.  A  sequence  (an )  is  bounded  above  if  there  exists 
a  real  number  u  such  that  for  every  index  n,  an  ≤  u.  The  number  u  is  an  upper  bound  for  the 
sequence.  A sequence (an )  is bounded  below  if there exists a real number  l  such that  for every  index 
n,  an  ≥ l.  The  number  l  is  a  lower  bound  for  the  sequence.

Monotone  Convergence  Test.  A  non­decreasing  sequence  converges  if  and  only  if  it  is  bounded 

above.  In  this  case,  the  limit  of  the  sequence  is  the  least  upper  bound  for  the  sequence.  Similarly, 
a  non­increasing  sequence  converges  if  and  only  if  it  is  bounded  below  and  the  limit  is  the  greatest 
lower  bound  for  the  sequence.

3.  Series.  Given  a  sequence  (an )n≥1 ,  there  are  2  important  related  sequences.  The  ﬁrst  is  the 
� 
sequence  of  partial  sums,  (bn )n≥1 ,  deﬁned  by, 
n
ak .
k=1 
� 
The  second  is  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums,  (Bn )n≥1 ,  deﬁned  by,

Bn  = |a1 +  a2
ak |.

� 
If  the  sequence  of  partial  sums  (bn )n≥1  converges,  the  limit  is  called  the  series  of  (an )n≥1 ,  and  is 
denoted  by, 
∞
n
� 
ak  :=  lim  bn  =  lim 
ak . 
n→∞ 
n→∞ 
In  this  case  is  is  said  the  series  �k  ak  converges.  If  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums  (Bn )n≥1 
k=1 
k=1 
converges,  it  is  said  the  series 
converges  absolutely.  Although  it  is  not  obvious,  if  the 
k  ak 
series  converges  absolutely,  then  the  series  converges  (this  is  a  basic  theorem  from  course  18.100). 
If  a  series  converges  but  does  not  converge  absolutely,  sometimes  it  is  said  the  series  converges

conditional ly. 
Examples.  The harmonic sequence  is the sequence an  = 1/n.  As will be shown soon, the harmonic 
1/n  diverges  to ∞.  The  alternating  harmonic  sequence  is,

does  converge.  This  will  also  be  shown  soon.  Since  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums  for  the 
alternating sequence equals the sequence of partial sums for the harmonic sequence, the alternating 
harmonic  series  does  not  converge  absolutely.  It  only  converges  conditionally. 

The  alternating  harmonic  series, 

As  counter­intuitive  as  this  might  sound,  the  terms  in  the  alternating  harmonic  series  can  be 
rearranged  so  that  the  sum  converges  to  any  real  number  you  like!  This  sounds  ridiculous:  ﬁnite 
sums  are  independent  of  the  order  in  which  the  summands  are  added,  so  how  could  this  fail  for

� 
1/n diverges,  the  same 
inﬁnite  sums?  The  answer  is  quite  simple.  Because  the harmonic  series 
n 
is  true  for 
1/2n .  Thus,  add  it  up  a  very  large  number  of  only  the  (positive)  even  terms  in  the 
alternating  harmonic  series  to  make  the  partial  sum  bigger  than,  say,  106 .  Now  add  only  the  ﬁrst 
odd  term −1/2.  This  has  a  negligible  eﬀect.  Now  add  a  large  number  of  the  remaining  even  terms 
to  make  the  partial  sum  bigger  than  107 .  Now  add  one  more  odd  term,  −1/3.  Continuing  in  this 
way,  eventually  every  term  in  the  sequence  contributes  to  one  of  the  partial  sums.  But  because 
we  add  positive  terms  with  a  much  higher  frequency  than  negative  terms,  the  sequence  of  partial 
sums  is  diverging  to +∞.  Similarly, we  could  negative  terms with  a  very  high  frequency  and make 
the  partial  sums  diverge  to  −∞.  Now  it  is  not  so  surprising  that  by  adding  the  terms  in  a  careful 
order,  we  can make  the  partial  sums  converge  to  any  value  we  like. 
The  pathology  of  the  preceding  paragraph  occurs  with  any  conditionally  convergent  series.  It  is  a 
very  important  fact  that  every  absolutely  convergent  series  has  only  a  single  limit,  independent  of 
� 
the  order  in  which  terms  are  added.  For  this  reason,  absolutely  convergent  series  are  much  more 
useful  than  conditionally  convergent  series. 
4.  Test  for  convergence/divergence  of  series.  If  a  series 
an  converges,  then  the  sequence 
n 
(an )  converges  to  0.  To  see  this,  denote  by  L  the  limit  of  the  sequence  of  partial  sums  (bn ).  For 
every  positive  real  number  �,  using  �/2  in  the  deﬁnition  of  convergence  of  (bn ),  there  exists  an 
integer N  such  that  for  every  n ≥ N ,  bn  − L < �/2.  But  then  for  n ≥ N  + 1, 
|
| 
=  bn  − bn−1 = (bn  − L) − (bn−1  − L)
|
| ≤ |
|an |
|
|
bn  − L +  bn−1  − L < �/2 + �/2 = �.
|
|
| 
� 
�
Thus  the  sequence  (an )  converges  to  0.  Contrapositively,  if  the  sequence  (an )  does  not  converge 
to  0,  then  the  series 
n an  diverges.  This  is  the  most  basic  test  for  divergence  of  a  series.  For 
n=1 (−1)n  diverges  (arguing  the  opposite  is  a 
∞ 
example,  it  immediately  follows  that  the  series 
favorite  pasttime  of  “mathematical  cranks”). 
The most basic  test  for absolute  convergence  of  a  sequence  follows  from  the monotone  convergence

test.  The  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums,

Bn  = 

is  a  non­decreasing  sequence.  Therefore,  by  the  monotone  convergence  theorem,  it  converges  if 
and  only  if  it  is  bounded  above.  The  most  common  technique  for  proving  the  sequence  of  partial 
absolute  sums  is  bounded  above  is  by  comparing  it  to  a  larger  series  that  is  known  to  converge.

This  gives  the  following.

A number of common convergence tests in calculus textbooks come to nothing more than combining 
the comparison test with an analysis of the geometric series.  Let r be a real number and let (an )n≥0

(by  convention,  if  r = 0,  the  ﬁrst  term  a0  is  deﬁned  to  be  1).  By  high  school  algebra,  if  r = 1,  the

sequence.  Assuming  r  =  1,  the  geometric  sequence  rn+1  converges  if  and  only  if  |r|  <  1.  In  this 
case,  the  sequence  of  partial  absolute  sums,

As  n  tends  to ∞,  the  natural  logarithms  ln(n)  also  tend  to ∞  (although  very  slowly  –  ln(n)  does 
not  get  bigger  than  a  ﬁxed  real  number  R  until  n  gets  bigger  than  the  much  larger  number  eR ). 
Therefore the partial sums diverge.  By the comparison test,  the harmonic series also diverges (very 
slowly).
