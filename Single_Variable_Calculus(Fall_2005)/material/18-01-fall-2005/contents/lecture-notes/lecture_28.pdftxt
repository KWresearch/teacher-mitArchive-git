1.  Indeterminate  forms.  Expressions  of  the  form  0/0,  ∞/∞,  0 × ∞,  ∞ − ∞,  0∞  and  ∞0 
are  called  indeterminate  forms.  To be precise,  none  of  these  expressions  is deﬁned  in mathematics. 
However, if a naive limit computation limx a F (x) leads to an indeterminate form, it often happens

→
that  a more  careful  computation  using  calculus  eliminates  the  indeterminate  form. 

Example.  Let b be any real number.  Compute the limit as x approaches 0 of F (x) = (b+1/x)−1/x,

x = 0.  If  we  evaluate  this  limit  in  a  naive manner,  we  get,

This  is  an  indeterminate  form.  In  other  words,  the  computation  of  the  limit  failed  to  give  any 
useful  information.  The  reason  is  that  the  general  formula, 
lim−
x→ h(x),

a

only  holds  if  all  three  limits  are  deﬁned,  which  they  are  not  in  our  case.


Of  course  F (x)  is  simply  the  constant  function  with  value  b.  Therefore,

Thus,  a more  careful  computation  proves  the  limit  exists  and  gives  its  value. 

2.  The Mean Value Theorem revisited.  Recall the Mean Value Theorem:  If f (x) is continuous 
on  [a, b]  and  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b),  then  for  some  c  strictly  between  a  and  b, 
f (b) − f (a)

Thus,  given  two  such  functions  f (x)  and  g(x)  such  that  g(b) − g(a)  is  nonzero,  there  exist  two 
values  c1  and  c2  strictly  between  a  and  b  such  that, 
(f (b) − f (a))/(b − a) 
f (b) − f (a) 
f � (c1 )
. 
(g(b) − g(a))/(b − a) 
g(b) − g(a) 
g � (c2 )
Is  there  a  single  value  c = c1  = c2  where  this  equality  holds? 
The  answer  is  yes.  Form  the  function 
F (x) = (f (b) − f (a))(g(x) − g(a)) − (g(b) − g(a))(f (x) − f (a)). 

=

Since  f (x)  and  g(x)  are  continuous  on  [a, b],  also  F (x)  is  continuous  on  [a, b].  Since  f (x)  and  g(x) 
are  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b),  also  F (x)  is  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b).  Moreover, 

F (a) = F (b) = 0. 

Thus,  by  the  Mean  Value  Theorem,  there  exists  a  value  c  strictly  between  a  and  b  such  that 
F � (c) = 0.  By  a  straightforward  computation, 
F � (c) = (f (b) − f (a))g � (c) − (g(b) − g(a))f � (c). 

This proves the Generalized Mean Value Theorem.  The main consequence of the Generalized Mean 
Value  Theorem  is  the  following  result. 
Proposition.  Let  f (x)  and  g(x)  be  continuous  functions  on  [a, b]  that  are  diﬀerentiable  on  (a, b). 
If  g � (x)  is  nonzero  on  (a, b),  then  g(x) − g(a)  is  nonzero  for  all  a < x < b  so  that  the  expression, 
f (x) − f (a) 
g(x) − g(a) 

is  deﬁned.  The  right­handed  limit, 

f (x) − f (a) 
, 
lim 
x→a+  g(x) − g(a) 
exists  if  and  only  if  the  right­handed  limit, 

f � (x)
lim 
x a+  g � (x)
→

, 

exists.  If  both  limits  exist,  they  are  equal, 
f (x) − f (a) 
lim 
x→a+  g(x) − g(a) 

f � (x)
=  lim 
x a+  g � (x)
→

. 

A  similar  result  holds  for  left­handed  limits.  The  proof  follows  by  applying  the  Generalized Mean 
Value  Theorem  to  the  interval  [a, x]  to  replace  (f (x) − f (a))/(g(x) − g(a))  by  f � (c)/g � (c).  Then  x 
approaches  a  as  c  approaches  a.

3.  L’Hospital’s  rule.  The  most  important  case  of  the  proposition  is  L’Hospital’s  rule.  This  is 
exactly  the  case  when  f (a) = g(a) = 0.  In  this  case,  a  naive  computation  would  give, 

f (a)
f (x)
“=” 
lim 
→
x a+  g(x) 
g(a)

0 
, 
0

which  is  an  indeterminate  form.  Again,  the  problem  is  that  the  general  formula, 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a+  g(x) 

= 

limx a+  f (x)
→
, 
limx→a+  g(x) 

only  holds  if  all  three  limits  are  deﬁned,  and  the  limit  limx a+  g(x)  is  nonzero.  Since  the  limit  is 
→
zero,  the  formula  does  not  hold. 
However,  if  f � (x)  and  g � (x)  exist,  and  if  g � (x)  is  nonzero,  then  the  proposition  has  the  following 
consequence,  known  as  L’Hospital’s  rule, 

limx→a+  f (x)/g(x

x→a+  f � (x)/g � (x).

4.  L’Hospital’s rule  for other  indeterminate  forms.  L’Hospital’s rule can be used to compute 
limits  that  naively  lead  to  indeterminate  forms  other  than  0/0.  For  instance,  if 
lim  f (x) =  lim  g(x) = ∞, 
→
→
x a+ 
x a+ 

then  the  naive  computation  gives, 

f (x)
lim 
→
x a+  g(x)

Now  observe  that, 

lim  (1/f (x)) =  lim (1/g(x)) = 0.

x a+ 
Therefore,  if  both  g(x)  and  g � (x)  are  nonzero  on  (a, b),  then  L’Hospital’s  rule  gives, 
−f � (x)/f (x)2 
(1/f (x))�

Solving  gives, 

x→a+  f � (x)/g � (x),
) = lim
if both  limits are deﬁned and nonzero.  In  fact,  a better  result  is  true  (with a more  subtle proof ):  if 
the  second  limit  is  deﬁned,  then  the  ﬁrst  limit  is  deﬁned  and  the  2  are  equal  (whether  or  not  they 
are  zero). 

limx→a+  f (x)/g(x

Example. 

ln(x − π/2) 
sec(x) 

1/(x − π/2)
= lim 
x→π/2+  sec(x) tan(x)

By  similar  arguments,  other  indeterminate  forms  can  also  be  reduced  to  L’Hospital’s  rule.  Also, 
limits  of  the  form, 

lim  F (x) 
x→∞ 
giving indeterminate forms can often be reduced to L’Hospital’s rule.  The moral is that the formula, 
f � (x)
, 
=  lim 
x→a  g � (x) 

f (x) 
lim 
x→a  g(x) 

is  almost  always  true  if  f (a)/g(a)  is  an  indeterminate  form.  But  a  certain  amount  of  care  should 
be  used,  since  occasionally  this  fails.
