1.  Diﬀerentials  revisited.  In a typical applied  integration problem, the main diﬃculty  is ﬁnding 
the  integrand  and  the  limits  of  integration.  An  unknown  quantity,  for  instance  area  A,  depends 
on  some  other  quantity,  for  instance  the  x­coordinate.  The  method  is  to  allow  the  independent 
variable  x  vary  “inﬁnitesimally”  from  x  to  x + dx  and  then  use  geometry  or  science  to  deduce  the 
corresponding  variation  dA  of  the  unknown  quantity.  The  deduction  is  usually  intuitive  rather 
than  rigorous.  What  is  important  is whether  the  deduction  leads  to  the  correct  solution.  If  so,  the 
method  of Riemann  sums usually  gives  a  rigorous proof  of  the  intuitive  answer.  But  if  the  solution 
is  incorrect,  no  argument  will  prove  it  correct. 
2.  Areas  between  curves.  Given  an  interval  a ≤  x ≤  b  and  two  functions  f (x) ≥  g(x)  deﬁned 

on  the  interval,  what  is  the  area  of  the  region  bounded  by  the  lines  x  =  a, x  =  b  and  the  curves

y  =  f (x),  y  =  g(x)?  This  problem  can  be  solved  directly:  the  area  is  the  diﬀerence  of  the  area 
between  y = f (x)  and  the  x­axis  and  the  area  between  y = g(x)  and  the  x­axis.  Each  of  these  is  a 
Riemann  integral. 

The  diﬀerential  method  asks,  what  is  the  inﬁnitesimal  change  in  the  area  A  as  x  varies  from  x 
to  x + dx?  The  inﬁnitesimal  region  is  a  rectangle  of  base  dx  and  height  f (x) − g(x).  Thus  the 
inﬁnitesimal  change  in  A  is, 

Integrating  gives, 

dA = height × base = (f (x) − g(x))dx.

x=a 
Of course this  is the same answer as  in the  last paragraph.  But  for other applied  integral problems, 
the  diﬀerential method may  be  the  only method  that  works. 
Example.  Find  the  area  bounded  by  the  curve  y = x(x2  − 3)  and  a  horizontal  tangent  line. 
The  horizontal  tangent  lines  are  the  tangent  lines  to  the  curve  at  critical  points.  Setting  the 
derivative  equal  to  0  gives, 

f (x) − g(x)dx. 

dA = 

A = 

x=b 

dy 
= 3x 2  − 3 = 3(x − 1)(x + 1). 
dx 
Thus the critical points are x = ±1.  The function is odd, so symmetry suggests the area is the same 
regardless of the choice of critical point.  Thus, choose the critical point x = −1.  The corresponding 
value  of  the  function  is, 
y = (−1)((−1)2  − 3) = (−1)(−2) = 2. 
This  is  the  equation  of  the  horizontal  tangent  line.  Each  intersection  point  (b, f (b))  of  the  tangent 
line  with  y = x(x2  − 3)  occurs  at  a  solution  x = b  of, 
x(x 2  − 3) = 2. 
By  hypothesis,  x = −1  is  a  solution.  Thus  the  polynomial  factors  as, 
3 x  − 3x − 2 = (x + 1)(x 2  − x − 2) = (x + 1)2 (x − 2). 
The  remaining  intersection point  is  (2, 2).  So  the area bounded by  the  curve  y = x(x2 − 3) and  the

3.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolutions:  the  disk method.  If the region  in the xy ­plane bounded 
by  x =  a,  x =  b,  y  =  f (x)  and  the  x­axis  is  revolved  through  xyz ­space  about  the  x­axis,  what  is 
the volume of  the  resulting  solid?  The  solid  is  called a  solid  of  revolution.  The disk method  applies 
the method of diﬀerentials to solve this problem.  As x increases from x to x + dx, the corresponding 
inﬁnitesimal  region  of  the  solid  is  essentially  a  disk.  The  width  of  the  disk  is  dx.  The  area  of  the 
disk  is  π [f (x)]2 .  Thus  the  inﬁnitesimal  volume  of  the  disk  is, 
dV  = Area × width = π [f (x)]2dx. 
�

�

x=a 

Thus  the  volume  is, 

π [f (x)]2dx. 

dV  = 

V  =

Example.  Find  the volume of a  right  circular  cone whose base has  radius R  and whose vertex has 
height H  above  the  base. 
The  cone  is  the  solid  of  revolution  for  the  plane  region  bounded  by  x = 0,  the  x­axis,  and  the  line 
containing  (0, R)  and  (H, 0).  The  equation  of  this  line  is, 
(H − x)R 
.

Thus  the  area  of  an  inﬁnitesimal  disk  is,

In  particular,  the  antiderivative  of  u2  is  responsible  for  the  denominator  3  in  the  formula  for  the

4.  The  slice  method.  A  generalization  of  the  disk  method  is  the  slice  method.  The  problem 
is  to  ﬁnd  the  volume  of  a  region  bounded  by  the  planes  x  =  a  and  x  =  b  given  the  knowledge 
of  the  area  A(x)  of  the  slice  of  the  solid  by  the  plane  containing  (x, 0, 0)  parallel  to  the  yz ­plane. 
As  x  increases  from  x  to  x + dx,  the  corresponding  inﬁnitesimal  region  of  the  solid  is  essentially 
a  cylinder.  The  width  of  the  cylinder  is  dx.  And  the  area  is  the  area  A(x)  of  the  slice.  Thus  the 
inﬁnitesimal  volume  of  the  cylinder  is, 
dV  = Area × width = A(x)dx. 
�

�

x=a 

Thus  the  volume  is, 

A(x)dx. 

dV  = 

V  = 

x=b 

Example.  Find  the  volume  of  the  “corner”  region  bounded  by  the  xy ­plane,  the  xz ­plane,  the 
yz ­plane,  and  the  plane  containing  (L, 0, 0),  (0, L, 0)  and  (0, 0, L). 

This  region  is bounded by  the planes x = 0 and x = L.  The x­slice  of  the  region  is a  right  isosceles 
triangle.  The  base  and  altitude  of  the  triangle  both  equal  f (x),  where  y = f (x)  is  the  equation  of 
the  line  passing  through  (0, L)  and  (L, 0).  This  equation  is, 
f (x) = L − x. 

Thus  the  slice  area  is 

1 
A(x) =  base × altitude =  (L − x)2 .

Thus  the  inﬁnitesimal  volume  is,

Evaluating  gives,

Thus  the  “corner”  takes  up  one  sixth  of  the  corresponding  cube  of  edge  length  L.

5.  Volumes  of  solids  of  revolution:  the  washer  method.  A  variation  on  the  disk  method 
is  the  washer  method. A  washer  is  the  solid  obtained  by  removing  from  a  larger  disk  a  concentric 
smaller  disk  of  the  same  width.  If  the  outer  radius  of  the  washer  is  ro  and  the  inner  radius  is  ri , 
then  the  net  area  of  the  washer  is, 

A = πr 2  − πr

i  = π(r

Example.  The  main  part  of  a  dog  dish  is  a  solid  of  revolution  whose  radial  cross­section  is  a 
triangle  of  height  H  whose  base  has  inner  radius  Ri  and  outer  radius  Ro .  Find  the  volume  of 
material  used  to make  the  dog  dish. 
Note.  This  integral  was  only  set­up  in  lecture.  The  derivation  will  be  completed  in  recitation. 
Here  is  the  complete  derivation.  Denote  by  x  the  height  along  the  altitude  of  the  triangle.  Thus  x 
varies  from  x = 0  to  x = H .  When  x = H ,  the  inner  radius  and  outer  radius  are  each  equal  to  the 
average  (Ri  + Ro )/2  of  the  two  radii.  Both  radii  depend  linearly  on  x. 
The  equation  for  the  inner  radius  increases  linearly  from  ri  = Ri  at  x =  0  to  ri  = (Ri  + Ro )/2  at 
x = H .  Thus, 
H − x 
Ri  + Ro  x 
. 
ri (x) = Ri 
2  H 
H 
Similarly,  the  equation  for  the  outer  radius  decreases  linearly  from  ro  =  Ro  at  x  =  0  to  ri  = 
(Ri  + Ro )/2  at  x = H .  Thus,

Since  ro  − r2 
2
i  is  a  diﬀerence  of  squares,  it  equals,

− r
i  = (ro  + ri )(ro  − ri ).

This  is  interesting  in  its  own  right.  Using  this  factorization,  the  net  area  of  the  region  between  the

(ro  − ri ).

Note  the ﬁrst  factor  is  the  circumference  of  the  center  of  the  annulus.  And  the  second  factor  is  the 
radial  width  of  the  annulus.  Thus  the  area  of  an  annulus  is  the  circumference  of  the  center  times 
the  radial  width.

Back  to  the  problem,  the  center  of  each  washer  is  the  same, 
ri  + ro  Ri  + Ro 
= 
2

. 

And  the  radial  width  of  each  washer  is, 
H − x
ro  − ri  = (Ro  − Ri ) 
H 
Both  of  these make  sense:  The  centers  are  constant  because  the  radial  cross­section  is  an  isosceles 
triangle.  And  the  width  decreases  linearly  from  Ro  − Ri  at  x  =  0  to  0  at  x  =  H .  Thus  the 
cross­section  area  at  height  x  is,

A(x) = 2π

and height H  as  the dish, and whose  (constant)  radial width equals  the average  radial width of  the
