Skills  checklist.  Be  able  to  do  each  of  the  following. 

1.  Find  the  secant  line  to  a  graph  at  two  points.  Find  the  slope  of  the  secant  line. 

2.  Compute  the  diﬀerence  quotient. 

3.  Recognize continuity and discontinuity.	 Use this to evaluate  limits, and know when  limits are 
undeﬁned.  Identify  a  discontinuity  as  a  removable,  jump,  inﬁnite  or  essential  discontinuity. 

4.  Compute  the  derivative  as  the  limit  of  a  diﬀerence  quotient. 

5.  Find  the  equation  of  the  tangent  line  to  a  graph  at  a  point. 

6.  Find  the  velocity  and  acceleration  of  a  particle. 

7.  Diﬀerentiate  a  polynomial. 

8.  Diﬀerentiate  a  ratio  of  polynomials. 

9.  Know  the  product,  quotient,  chain  and  power  rules  for  diﬀerentiation. 

10.  Compute  higher  derivatives. 

11.  Compute  with  exponential  and  logarithm  functions.
