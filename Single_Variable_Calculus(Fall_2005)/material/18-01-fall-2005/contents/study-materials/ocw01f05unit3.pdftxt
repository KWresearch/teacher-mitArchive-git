Skills  checklist.  Be  able  to  do  each  of  the  following. 

1.  Solve  related  rates problems:  Determine  an unknown  rate­of­change using  a  constraint  equa­
tion  and  a  known  rate­of­change. 

2.  Use  Newton’s method  to  approximate  the  zeros  of  a  diﬀerentiable  function. 

3.  Compute  diﬀerentials  of  diﬀerentiable  functions. 

4.  Compute  antiderivatives  of  simple  functions,  e.g.,  polynomial  functions. 

5.  Use  substitution  to  compute  antiderivatives  of more  complicated  functions. 

6.  Compute  simple  Riemann  sums  by  induction. 

7.  Use  the  Fundamental  Theorem  of  Calculus  to  compute  deﬁnite  integrals. 

8.  Solve  separable  diﬀerential  equations.
