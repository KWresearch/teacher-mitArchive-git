Skills  checklist.  Be  able  to  do  each  of  the  following. 

1.  Compute the angle of the tangent line to a polar curve.  This is a carry­over from the previous 
unit. 

2.  Compute the area of a region bounded by polar curves.  This is a carry­over from the previous 
unit. 

3.  Compute  antiderivatives  using  inverse  trigonometric  substitution. 

4.  Compute  antiderivatives  using  inverse  hyperbolic  substitution. 

5.  Use the Heaviside cover­up method to compute the partial fraction decomposition of a fraction 
of  polynomials. 

6.  Compute  antiderivatives  using  integration­by­parts. 

7.  Use  integration­by­parts  to  ﬁnd  reduction  formulas  for  integrals.
