Skills  checklist.  Be  able  to  do  each  of  the  following. 
1.  Compute  derivatives  of  trigonometric  functions. 

2.  Determine  the  linear  and  quadratic  approximations  to  a  function  at  a  point. 

3.  Using  the  mean  value  theorem,  the  value  of  the  function  at  one  point,  and  bounds  on  the 
derivative in a neighborhood of this point, bound the function in the neighborhood of a point. 

4.  Find  the  critical  points  of  a  function. 

5.  Use  the  First  Derivative  Test  to  determine  whether  a  function  is  increasing  or  decreasing. 

6.  Use  the  Second  Derivative  Test  to  determine  the  concavity  of  a  function. 

7.  Find all  local extrema and  inﬂection points of a  function.  Determine which  local extrema are 
absolute maxima/minima. 

8.  Give  a  rough  sketch  of  the  graph  of  a  function,  labelling  all  local  extrema,  inﬂection  points, 
and  vertical  and  horizontal  asymptotes. 

9.  Solve  applied maximum  and minimum  problems.
