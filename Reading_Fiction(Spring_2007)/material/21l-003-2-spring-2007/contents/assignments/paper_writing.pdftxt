GENERAL PAPER-WRITING GUIDELINES 

 
1.  All papers need an argument.  It is not enough to simply state a fact about the book that 
you’ve read:  “Jamaica Kincaid’s essay, A Small Place, sounds very angry.”  Your argument 
should be one that another person might argue against:  “The tone in Jamaica Kincaid’s 
essay, A Small Place, highlights the powerlessness of a nation like Antigua in its attempts to 
function as an independent nation.”  This is a stronger thesis because it is already 
contemplating the “how” and “why” of the angry tone.  It also allows the space for another 
person to say, “I don’t think that’s true at all,” and develop his or her own thesis in 
opposition to it. 
 
2.  Give your paper a title.  Your paper should have a title that is both interesting and indicates 
the angle of your argument. 
(cid:121)  “Paper #1” or “Satire in A Small Place” are not strong titles. 
(cid:121)  “The Antiguan Library as a Metaphor for Cultural Decay in Jamaica Kincaid’s A Small 
Place” is a clear and informative title that adequately prepares your reader for your essay. 
 
3.  Avoid generalizations.  Avoid sweeping statements that detract from the close reading you 
are performing.  Comments about “all readers,” “all novels,” or “the human condition” place 
you on a slippery slope towards generalizations.  Kincaid may be writing about Antigua, but 
this text does not necessarily apply to the Caribbean as a whole, or to former colonies as a 
whole.  Rather than thinking about a text as “representative of,” think about what makes it 
unique.  This will strengthen your close readings. 
 
4.  Do not summarize the plot.  Since the text has already been written, there is no need for you 
to write it again.  You are creating your own narrative about your reading of the text, so plot 
summary is not necessary.  Assume that your reader already has some familiarity with the 
text.  Although it is sometimes necessary to give context (this happens after this or before 
that) that is all that your informed reader will need.  Your analysis is what really interests 
your reader. 
 
5.  Use multiple levels of analysis.  Your essay should vary the level of analysis so that it 
remains lively and engaging.  Include the micro-level of close reading (looking at language, 
word-choice, etc.) and also expand to the level of the idea (what do these linguistic choices 
mean) and the larger structure (what happens to the text as a result of these choices). 
 
6.  Support your quotations.  As you use evidence to support your thesis, be sure to set up the 
quotation for the reader through clearly stating the point you are making with this evidence.  
“Unpack” the evidence by commenting on the specific features of the quotation that resonate 
with your argument. 
 
7.  Avoid intentional fallacy.  Intentional fallacy is the attribution of intent to an author when it 
is not appropriate.  We can’t ever know what an author intended or thought, and authorial

intent is not really the most important, or interesting, issue in a text.  Instead discuss what an 
author’s language accomplishes, or how a scene works, or in what position a certain 
character places the reader. 
 
8.  Strive for clarity, not impressiveness, in your writing.  A dictionary is a better friend than 
a thesaurus—you are looking for precision in your language, not grandeur.  Your language 
should be concise, efficient, lively, and clear.  Avoid stock phrases or clichés. 
 
9.  Be conscious of your structure.  Your essay should move logically and should always have 
smooth transitions between paragraphs.  It should not be a simple list or enumeration of your 
points.  Laundry-list essays are often a sign of a descriptive or obvious thesis.  Work to 
include some twists and surprises, but keep to a logical structure. 
 
10. Know your reader and your writer!  The assumption when writing an essay for class is 
that you are writing for the professor.  This is true.  Another assumption is that you are 
writing for a grade.  This is also true, but neither of these assumptions is true in the way that 
many people think.  In other words, don’t write your essay for me, or for a grade.  Write an 
essay for a person who would be interested in the topic and the text (who is a person similar 
to, but not exactly your professor), and write an essay that is for you!  You need to be 
interested in your topic and in the text that you choose.  Your enthusiasm for your own work 
speaks volumes on the written page.  So have fun (or as much fun as you can) with it and feel 
free to share it with anyone (friends, family, thefacebook) who might also be interested. 

 
Some other incidentals: 
(cid:121)  Number your pages!!!!!! 
(cid:121)  Use a normal (Times New Roman, Garamond, etc.) 12 point font and 1 inch margins.  If 
you like to use Courier the font size should be 10. 
(cid:121)  Cite quotations correctly.  Consult the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers or 
The Chicago Manual.  These are the industry standards.  Parenthetical quotations are fine 
for a short paper like this.
