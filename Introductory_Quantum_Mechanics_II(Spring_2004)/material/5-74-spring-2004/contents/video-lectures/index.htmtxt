***** Breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation in Diatomic Molecules
*****
Lectures by Professor Robert Field
This lecture series was offered during January 2005 as a follow-up to topics
covered in 5.74.Â  Attendance was voluntary and open to any students with a
background in quantum mechanics (5.61 or equivalent) and an interest in
molecular dynamics.
These files are also available on iTunes_U and YouTube.

       Introduction to the Spectroscopic Effective Hamiltonian
       Description
1      The Born-Oppenheimer approximation and matrix elements of (RM_-_144.3MB)
       terms in the effective molecular Hamiltonian that violate (MP3_-_19MB)
       the BO approximation. Vibration, rotation, spin-orbit,
       interelectronic interaction. Hund's coupling cases.
       Spectroscopic Pertubations, Predissociation, and
2      Autoionization                                            (RM_-_130.3MB)
       Description                                               (MP3_-_17MB)
       Introduction to dynamical processes.
       Semiclassical Methods for Calculating Vibrational Overlap
       Integrals
       Description
       All coupling processes are mediated by vibrational
3      overlap integrals, which are computed numerically.        (RM_-_118.1MB)
       Semiclassical calculation of overlaps reveals physical    (MP3_-_16MB)
       factors controlling computed values: the length of the
       stationary phase region is controlled by the slopes of
       the potential curves at the intersection and the velocity
       in the crossing region.
       Wavepackets and Landau-Zener                              (RM_-_167.6MB)
4      Description                                               (MP3_-_22MB)
       What happens in the vicinity of a curve crossing?
