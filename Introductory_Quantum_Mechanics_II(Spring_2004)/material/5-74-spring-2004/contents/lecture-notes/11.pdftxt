TIME-CORRELATION FUNCTIONS 

> 	 T.C.F.s are statistical measures of the time-evolution of an observable under equilibrium

conditions.  →  They describe an ensemble.   


> 	 T.C.F.s can be used to describe spectroscopy and other time-dependent phenomena.   

> 	 They are generally applicable to any time-dependent process for an ensemble, but are 

commonly used to describe random or stochastic processes in condensed phases.  


Qualitatively: 
•	 A correlation function describes how long a given property of a system persists until it is 
averaged out by microscopic motions of system.   
It describes how and when a statistical relationship has vanished.   
•	
•	 T.C.F.s describes the dynamics associated with a dynamical variable A(t), averaged over 
the ensemble.

If we look at this behavior there seems to be little information in the random fluctuations of A, but 
there are characteristic time scales and amplitudes to these changes.  We can characterize these by 
comparing the value of A at time t with the value of A at time t’ later. 

Correlation functions are defined as a time-dependent quantity,  A t  ) , multiplied by that quantity 
(
at some later time,  A t ′(
) , and averaged over ensemble: 

CAA  ( t , t ′ ) ≡  A  t  A  t ′ )

CAB  ( t , t ′ ) ≡  A  t ) B  t ′ )

These are products of a pair of dynamical variables.

over the expansion coefficients, since at equilibrium all phases are equally probable:

Properties of Quantum Correlation Functions 

There are various properties of quantum correlation functions that can be obtained using the 
properties of the time-evolution operator.

observables are often related to the real or imaginary part of correlation functions, or other 
combinations of correlation functions.

More on Stationary Processes1 

We stated that correlation functions are stationary:  they do not depend on the absolute point of 
observation, but rather the time-interval between observations.   

Let’s look at this a bit more:  the ensemble average value of  A  can be expressed as a time-average 
or an ensemble average.  For an equilibrium system:   

A

lim
1 
= 
T → ∞  2T

t

… =  time
 

− average

 

 

A 

= ∑ e−βE n 
Z 
n

n  A  n 

…  = equil. ensemble average 

These quantities are equal for an ergodic system  A  = A .  We assume this property for our 

correlation functions. 

So, the correlation of fluctuations can be written:   

lim 
1 T 
A t A  0  ) =
