THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U(t,t0) AND cn(t) 

For a time-dependent Hamiltonian, we can often partition 


H = H0  + V t
( ) 

H0 :  time-independent;  V t( ) :  time-dependent potential.  We know the eigenkets and  

eigenvalues of  H0 :  


H0 
= En
We describe the initial state of the system  (t  = t 0 ) as a superposition of these eigenstates: 

n 

n 

ψ ( t 0 ) 

= ∑ c  nn 
n 

For longer times 
these kets: 

t 
, we would like to describe the evolution of 

ψ

 in terms of an expansion in 

ψ(t )  = ∑ cn (t
n 

) n 

The expansion coefficients  ck ( ) are given by
t

ck ( ) =t

kψ t( )  =  k U   t, t 0( 

)ψ t0(  ) 

Alternatively we can express the expansion coefficients in terms of the interaction picture 

wavefunctions

so that

This equation is an exact solution.  It is a set of coupled differential equations that describe how 
probability amplitude moves through eigenstates due to a time-dependent potential.  Except in 
simple cases, these equations can’t be solved analytically, but it’s often straightforward to 
integrate numerically. 

Exact Solution:  Resonant Driving of Two-level System 

Let’s describe what happens when you drive a two-level system with an oscillating potential. 

V t  ) = V  cos  ω  = Vf  ( t )

This is what you expect for an electromagnetic field interacting with charged particles:  dipole 
transitions.  The electric field is 

E t  ) = E cos  ωt

For a particle with charge  q  in a field  E , the force on the particle is 

which is the gradient of the potential 

F q  E

⇒  V = −qE

qx  is just the  x  component of the dipole moment µ.  So matrix elements in V look like:

More generally, 

So, 

k |  V( t )  |  (cid:65)  = −qE   k  | x |  (cid:65)  cos  ωt

V = − E ⋅µ.

We will now couple our two states  k  +  (cid:65)  with the oscillating field.  Let’s ask if the system 
starts in  (cid:65)  what is the probability of finding it in  k  at time  t ? 

The system of differential equations that describe this situation are:

We can drop (2) and (3).  For our case,  Vii = 0 .  


We also make the secular approximation (rotating wave approximation) in which the 

nonresonant terms are dropped.  When ωk(cid:65)  ≈ω, terms like  e ±iωt  or  ei (ω +ω)t  oscillate very 
k (cid:65)
rapidly and so don’t contribute much to change of  cn .

Note that the coefficients are oscillating out of phase with one another. 

Now if we differentiate (1):

and substitute (4) and (2) into (3), we get linear second order equation for  b k  .

Amplitude oscillates back and forth between the two states at a frequency dictated by the 

coupling. 


p. 32 

Resonance: To get transfer of probability amplitude you need the driving field to be at the same 

frequency as the energy splitting. 


Note a result we will return to later: Electric fields couple states, creating coherences!   


On resonance, you always drive probability amplitude entirely from one state to another.
