Time-Correlation Function Description of Absorption Lineshape 

Let’s express the absorption of radiation by dipoles as a dipole correlation function.   

Start with the rate of absorption and stimulated emission between an initial st ate 
k  induced by monochromatic field: 

(cid:65)  and final state

Now this is written for two discrete states, but in general we will want to sum over all possible

and the matter, where the matter is described by σ(ω) —the absorption lineshape.

The absorption lineshape is the Fourier transform of the dipole correlation function.   

The correlation function describes the time-dependent behavior or spontaneous fluctuations in the 
dipole moment in absence of  E  field and contains information on states of system and broadening 
due to relaxation. 

p. 84 

Different spectroscopies are described by different forms of the dipole operator. 

Rotational spectroscopy 

The dipole operator is the permanent dipole moment: µ= µ = µuˆ

The lineshape is the Fourier transform of the rotational motion of the permanent dipole vector in 
the laboratory frame.  The frequency of the resonance would depend on the rate of rotation – the 
angular momentum and the moment of inertia. Collisions or other damping would lead to the 
broadening of the lines.  Quantum mechanically we expect a distribution of resonances for 
different populated rotational states which we would sum over when performing the equilibrium 
ensemble average. 

IR Vibrational Spectroscopy 
We take the dipole operator to be weakly dependent on the displacement of nuclear coordinates

Here the first expansion term is the permanent dipole moment and the second term is the transition 
dipole moment. If we are performing our ensemble average over vibrational states, the lineshape 
now becomes the Fourier transform of a correlation function in the vibrational coordinate 
2∂µ +∞

The vector nature of the transition dipole has been dropped here.  So the time dependent dynamics 
of the vibrational coordinate dictate the IR lineshape.

Raman Spectroscopy 
We can replace the dipole operator with an induced dipole moment, the polarizability tensor to get 
the correlation function for Raman spectroscopy.

where we have written the polarization components of the incident (i) and scattered (s) light.  The 
polarizability tensor is a second rank tensor that tells you how well a light field polarized along i 
can induce a dipole moment (light-field-induced charge displacement) in the s direction.  For 
cylindrically symmetric systems this usually takes the form

ENSEMBLE AVERAGING and LINE BROADENING 

An absorption lineshape can represent the dynamics of the dipole or energy relaxation (i.e., 
coupling to continuum).  It can also reflect ensemble averaging effects.
