FERMI’S GOLDEN RULE 

p. 43 

We have calculated the probability of observing the system in a state  k  after applying a 
perturbation to  (cid:65)  .  Often we are interested in transition probability not to an individual eigenstate, 
but a distribution of eigenstates.  Often the set of eigenstates form a continuum of accepting states, 
for instance, vibrational relaxation or ionization.   

Transfer to a set of continuum (or bath) states forms the basis for a describing irreversible 
relaxation.  Qualitatively, you expect deterministic, oscillatory feedback between discrete quantum 
states.  However, the amplitude of one discrete state coupled to a continuum will decay due to 
destructive interferences between the oscillating frequencies for each member of the continuum. 

So we are interested in calculating transition probability to a distribution of final states:   Pk  .

Let’s make two assumptions: 
	ρ Ek(
) doesn’t vary much with frequency.  
There are many final states:  continuous.   
Also, t is relatively long. 

1) 

2) 	

The matrix element  Vk(cid:65)  is invariant across 

the final states.   


These assumptions allow those variables to be factored out of integral

We have chosen the limits  −∞ → + ∞  since ρ(Ek ) is broad relative to  Pk .  Using

The total transition probability is linearly proportional to time.  Often, for instance in relaxation 
processes, we will be concerned with the transition rate,  w k(cid:65) : 

=w k(cid:65) 

w k(cid:65)  =

This is Fermi’s Golden Rule.  Note rates independent of time.  It is very common for chemical rate 
processes:  matrix element squared + D.O.S.   

Remember that  Pk  is centered sharply at  Ek  = E (cid:65) .  So we may write ρ(Ek  = E(cid:65) ) or more 
commonly in terms of δ(Ek  − E(cid:65) ) :

Range of validity: 

For discrete states we saw: 

Vk(cid:65)  << (cid:61)ωk(cid:65) 

Also Pk  never varies much from initial values.   

Pk  = w k(cid:65)  ( t − t 0 )

Golden Rule Rate for Harmonic Perturbations 

If we want to calculate the transition rate to a continuum of final states induced by harmonic 
perturbation, we follow derivation of F.G.R. from before.

detailed balance 

The ratio of the rates upward and downward is given by the ratio of the density of states of the 
photons in the electric field. 
(More commonly this is seen written for matter in the form that 
relates the rates for discrete states to the thermal occupation of those states: 
 w ji  = exp  ( −β ωij ) .
