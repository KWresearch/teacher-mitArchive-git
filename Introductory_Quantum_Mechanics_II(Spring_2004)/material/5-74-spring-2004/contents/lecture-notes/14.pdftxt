Förster Energy Transfer 

Nonradiative transfer of electronic excitation from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule:   

*
*
D + A → D + A

The transfer arises from dipole-dipole coupling, but does not involve a light field.  In general, 
there are four states to worry about:

Let’s just consider the case where we have already excited the donor electronic transition, and 
the acceptor is in the ground state.  We will state that the system can only exist either with the 
donor excited and acceptor in the ground state, or vice-versa.  If the system is weakly coupled 
through a dipole-dipole interaction, we can write:   

H H 0  + V

which could be more properly written  D n   A nA  ).

The interaction between donor and acceptor takes the form of a dipole-dipole interaction:

For the dipole moment, we can factor out the orientational contribution 
as a unit vector, i.e., 

µA  = uˆ A µA 

where µA is the dipole operator.  This allows us to write:

Now we can write the rates of transition from Fermi’s Golden Rule:   
2π 
(2δωk  − ω )
Vk(cid:65) 
(cid:65)
2(cid:61)
*
*
where the initial state  (cid:65) =  D A  and the final state  k =  A D  . 

wk(cid:65)  = 

We also know we can express Fermi’s Golden Rule as a correlation function in the interaction 
Hamiltonian:   

wk (cid:65)  = 

2π

(cid:61)

We have also neglected rotational motion of the dipoles.  Most generally,

The expression for  w ET  is a time integral over a product of correlation functions.  Since we can 
express the T.C.F.s an inverse F.T.s over lineshapes:

We can express the energy transfer rate as an overlap integral between the donor fluorescence 
and acceptor absorption spectra:   

wET

(Here  σ  is the lineshape normalized to  µ  .)  So the energy transfer rate scales inversely with 
(cid:4)
r 6 , depends on the strengths of the electronic transitions for donor and acceptor molecules, and 
requires resonance between donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption.  The rate of energy 
transfer is usually written in terms of an effective distance R0, and the fluorescence lifetime of 
the donor: 

=wET 

1   R0  6 
  r  
 
τ fluor  

At the critical transfer distance R0, defined by the overlap integral above, the rate (or probability) 
of energy transfer is equal to the rate of fluorescence.

Electron transfer for weakly coupled donor and acceptor states, i.e., non-adiabatic E.T. 

Page 103 

This closely follows the formulation of energy transfer where 

*
*
D + A → A + D 

now represents the transfer of an electron.  The difference in this case is that the nuclear 
coordinate mediates the electron transfer.   

Normally we associate the rates of electron transfer with the free-energy along the electron 
transfer coordinate Q, but here we will start just by writing the transfer rates in terms of the 
potential energy as before:
