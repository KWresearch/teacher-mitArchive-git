We are interested in describing  E  and  B in terms of a scalar and vector potential. 
This is required for our interaction Hamiltonian.   

Generally:  A vector field  F  assigns a vector to each point in space, and:

Some useful identities from vector calculus are:

We now introduce a vector potential  A (r , t ) and a scalar potential ϕ r , t(

Using (3), we have:

From (9), we see that a scalar product exists with:

E  =

So we see that the potentials  A  and ϕ determine the fields  B  and  E :

We are interested in determining the wave equation for  A  and ϕ.  Using (15) and 
differentiating (16) and substituting into (4):   

 ∂ 2A

Using (10):

From (14), we have:

∇ ⋅ E  = −

− ∇2ϕ

and using (2): 

(19)

− ∇2ϕ= ρ/ ∈0 

Notice from (15) and (16) that we only need to specify four field components 
( Ax ,  Ay,  Az ,ϕ) to determine all six  E  and  B  components.  But  E  and  B  do not 
uniquely determine  A  and ϕ.  So, we can construct  A  and ϕ in any number of 
ways without changing  E  and  B .  Notice that if we change  A  by adding  ∇χ 
where χ is any function of  r  and  t , this won’t change  B  (∇ × (∇ ⋅ B) = 0) .  It 
∂χ .  Then  E  and
will change  E  by  (−  ∂ ∇χ), but we can change ϕ to ϕ′ = ϕ−

∂t 
B  will both be unchanged.  This property of changing representation (gauge) 
without changing  E  and  B  is gauge invariance.  We can transform between 
gauges with: 

(20)

Up to this point,  A′  and  Q  are undetermined.  Let’s choose a χ such that: 

Lorentz condition 

(22)  ∇ ⋅ A  + ∈0  µ0 

∂ϕ
∂t 

= 0 

then from (17):  

(23) 

−∇ 2 A  + ∈0  µ0

= µ0J 

The RHS can be set to zero for no currents.   


From (19), we have:    


4 

∂2ϕ
(24) 	 ∈0  µ0  ∂t 2  − ∇2ϕ= 

ρ 
∈0 

Eqns. (23) and (24) are wave equations for  A  and ϕ .  Within the Lorentz gauge, 
we can still arbitrarily add another χ (it must only satisfy 22).  If we substitute 
(20) and (21) into (24), we see: 

∂2 χ

(25) 	 ∇2 χ− ∈0  µ0  ∂t 2  = 0 
So we can make further choices/constraints on  A  and ϕ as long as it obeys (25). 

For a field far from charges and currents,  J  = 0  and ρ= 0 .

We now choose ϕ= 0  (Coulomb gauge), and from (22) we see:   

(28) 	 ∇ ⋅ A = 0 

So, the wave equation for our vector potential is: 

(29)

The solutions to this equation  are plane waves.

k   is the wave vector which points along the direction of propagation and has a 
magnitude:

Since (28)  ∇  ⋅ A  = 0 

5 

− k ⋅ A0 cos(ωt − k  ⋅ r + α)= 0 

(33) 	 ∴  k ⋅ A0  = 0 

k ⊥ A0 

A0  is the direction of the potential → polarization.  From (15) and (16), we see 
that for ϕ= 0 :

E  = −
