Today:  classes of pluck → classes of wavepacket

transfer rate operator

Quantum Beats are usually simple, few-level coherences.
Wavepackets are usually more complex, many-level coherences.
h
Both are the result of a pluck where ∆t < 
∆E .
Kinds of pluck:
* merely short
* genuinely localized

A localized pluck prepares a zero-order non-eigenstate.  The localized state character of this non-eigenstate
is distributed (“fractionated”) over eigenstates that span an energy range ∆Elocalized.

If the pluck is sufficiently short, it prepares an a priori known initially localized excitation.

If the pluck is not sufficiently short, it prepares an ill-specified coherent superposition

“genuinely localized”

Classes of localization

“merely short”

*  polarization quantum beats (angularly localized)
*  population quantum beats (spatially localized or localized in state space, e.g., vibrational
wavepacket)

Polarization QB - easiest kind to observe, even with a long excitation pulse.  Why?

Larmor precession of magnetic moment about z direction.  Transition dipole moves because it is attached to
the molecule frame and a magnetic moment that is fixed in the molecule frame precesses in the
laboratory frame.

Has anyone looked at fluorescence from an atomic 1P — 1S transition excited by a linearly polarized laser?

If the polarization axis of the exciting radiation is pointing toward you, you see no fluorescence.  The
transition moment is fixed in space.

*  can force the transition moment to rotate in external magnetic field
*  more complicated if there are other nonzero angular momenta
*  even more complicated if it is a molecule and not an atom

What is that?  Several schemes possible.  (Alignment is a  Tq

At t = 0 prepare S1 which is not an eigenstate.  S1 is capable of fluorescing.  T is not.

As coherent superposition evolves, becomes predominantly T in character.  Fluorescence rate decreases
because T cannot fluoresce.

It is as if population flows back and forth between bright and dark state.

mathematical consequence
of rephasings in e–Et/h?

There will always be rotational recurrences in a pulse-excited vibration rotation spectrum.  Do the rotational
recurrences dephase when vibrational bright state dephases?  Dispersion of B-values?  Depends on nature of
detection scheme.

If excitation covers several bands, could have vibrational wavepacket with rotational coherences
superimposed.  Vibrational coherence can be “genuinely localized” or “merely short pulse” excitation.

Genuinely localized electronic coherences are rare, except for Rydberg states.
