Today:

Convert from Quantum Mechanical Heff to equivalent Classical Mechanical Heff. 

Why? 	The QM Heff is vastly simpler than the exact QM H.  In addition, the parameters in Heff are 
determined by experimental observations.  So we have a QM representation of reality and we would 
like to obtain an equivalent CM representation.  It is easier to gain insight from the form of 
trajectories than from attempting to discern the nodal structure of a QM wavefunction. 

Begin with Heisenberg’s Correspondence Principle 

But first an aside about classical mechanics 

H is a function of pairs of conjugate variables 

i.e.

one angle: 
∂H  = − I˙ = 0 , thus I is
other angle:  θ, associated with I, does not appear in H, which implies that

conserved.  (This is the assumed block-diagonalization of Heff into polyads.) 

Let H = E and I is conserved.  This means we have one equation that relates the non-conserved I  to the
z
non-conserved ψ.  This is a trajectory! 

Iz(E, I, ψ) or ψ(E, I, Iz) 

So all information about the exploration of action-angle space is given by single equation.  A different 
choice of E, I gives a different trajectory. 

We can determine the time-dependence for motion on this trajectory by integrating

But how do we look at all of this?  Phase space trajectories.

When there is only one non-conserved action and one non-conserved conjugate angle, it is possible to 
display how trajectories explore all of phase space with a single family of 2-dimensional phase space 
trajectory maps (Fig. 9.13ab) or polyad phase spheres (Fig. 9.13cd).  P = vR + vL = v  + va = 3 for H2O.  4

eigenstates. 

*	 One Map (or sphere) for each value of I.  In CM I is not necessarily integer. 
*	 Trajectories plotted at each QM eigen-energy.  In CM E is not quantized, so we can vary E 
continuously if we wish.  It is informative to see the specific CM trajectory that corresponds to a 
particular eigen-energy in a particular polyad. 

The phase space trajectories can be mapped in either the Local Mode (Iz, ψ) representation or the Normal 
Mode ( I z,  ψ ) representation.  Both pictures contain the same information even though they look very 
different.  These differences arise from flat projection onto 2D (Fig. 9.13ab) rather than onto the surface of a 
sphere (Fig 9.13cd). 

The information on the phase space maps: 

dotted line:  separatrix.  Divides phase space into two non-communicating regions.  No trajectory 
can cross the separatrix.  On one side is local mode behavior (trajectories 1a, 1b and 2a, 2b) and on 
the other is normal mode behavior (trajectories 3, 4) 

Letters A, B, and C respectively stable (A and C) and unstable (B) “fixed points”.  Trajectories that 
surround a fixed point are named by the character of that fixed point.  As E is varied at constant I, a 
trajectory can collapse onto a fixed point, “fall through it”, and emerge as a qualitatively different 
class of trajectory on the other side of the separatrix, disappear, or bifurcate into two new classes of 
trajectories. 

5.74 RWF Lecture #19

19 – 6 

Bold curves 1a, 2a and 1b, 2b are two superposed local mode eigen-trajectories.  The a,b specify two 
branches of the same trajectory. 

The qualitative structures can change as I is varied.  Bifurcations.  Qualitative changes in the way 
phase space is explored. 

We label trajectories #1, 2 as “local” because they explore the full 0 to 2π range of ψ.  We label 
trajectories #3, 4 as “normal” because they explore the full 0 to 2π range of  ψ .  This is a rigorous 
classification criterion. 

The complete trajectories are not shown in Figure 9.13.  For that you also need the non-conserved angle, θ, 
associated with the conserved action, I. 
∂H
θ is not conserved because 
is expressed in terms of non-conserved I  and ψ.  θ is time -dependent even
∂I
z
though I is conserved.  See Figure 9.14 for the invariant torus. 

Figures removed due to copyright reasons. 

The full trajectories lie on the surface of such a torus.  The θ angle corresponds to rotation around the torus. 
The position on one invariant torus is specified by Iz, ψ, and θ. 

For each E, there is another torus nested inside (or outside) the previous one. 
One can intersect the torus with a plane.  The one shown could be the normal mode  Iz , ψ , one or the local 
mode Iz, ψ one.  As the trajectory runs for a long time (and the winding number is not an integer) it will cut 
many times through the 2-D dividing surface.  If a mark is placed on the dividing surface each time the 
trajectory crosses it, we have the solid curve trajectory on the Iz, ψ or  Iz , ψ , ψ plane.  This is called a 
“SURFACE OF SECTION”. 

Qualitative changes in the motion on the phase sphere are shown in Figures 9.15, 9.16, and 9.17.

Figure 9.16.  Shows the evolution of the phase space structure for H2O as P = 1 (two states) up to P = 5 (six 
states).  At P = 1 (a) both states are normal.  At P = 2 (b) the lowest energy state (#1) has become local.  At 
P = 5, 4 states are local and 2 are normal.

Figure 9.17.  Shows the QM wavefunctions and the configuration space trajectories for all 6 states in the 
H2O P = 5 polyad. 

When there are more degeres of freedom, the task of mapping the exploration of phase space becomes more 
complicated.  Surfaces of section provide a useful way of seeing key structures and qualitative changes.

Figure 9.18.  Shows surface of section for the [Nbend, l] = [4, 0] and [8, 0] polyads of acetylene.  For [4, 0] 
there are only 2 families of quasi-periodic trajectories which surround the normal mode cis-bend and trans-
bend periodic trajectories (the separatrices ψb = ±π/2).  For [8, 0], chaos has emerged (unconnected dots) as 
well as 2 qualitatively new classes of trajectories.  Can you see what they are? 

Figures removed due to copyright reasons. 

Figure 9.19 shows the evolution of the surface of section as one explores energies from the bottom (13,861 
cm–1) to the top (15,461 cm–1) of the [Nbend = 22, l = 0] polyad.  Qualitative features on the 14,661 cm–1 SOS 
appear as different classes of configuration space trajectories.  1 and 2 refer to the left and right HCC local 
benders.  Lots of chaos in the middle E region of the polyad.
