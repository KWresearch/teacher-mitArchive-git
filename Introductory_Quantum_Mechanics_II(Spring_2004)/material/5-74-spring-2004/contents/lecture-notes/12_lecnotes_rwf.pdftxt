Last time:
Non-degenerate perturbation theory for interaction between quasi-eigenstates with finite 
level-width 

If we allow H(0) to have complex energies along the diagonal, we have a basis for calculating how 
quasi-eigenstates share the property of decay rate. 

Illustration that sharing of decay rate (NOT LIFETIME) is just like sharing of Zeeman tuning rate

*  energy denominator is complex - rationalize and get corrections to ε and Γ

Note that Ψ(Q,t) cannot remain normalized to 1 at all t because P(t) = e 
–tΓ/h!

So we are stuck with two awkwardnesses about normalization: 

*  cannot insist on normalization to 1 at all t 
*  usual normalization integral can give a complex number 

We handle this by expressing the ortho-normalization condition as 
˜j i = δij
˜j j
− Γ j  h
(the factor  ˜j j  in the denominator cancels the  e t 
decay of probability) 
and completeness as

But the important point is that if either δε or δΓ = 0, the two quasi-eigenstates have the same width. 

We knew that δΓ = 0 would have this effect from non-degenerate p. t.  The δε = 0 result is not a surprise 
because, in the ordinary 2-level problem, when δε = 0, get 50/50 mixing.  There is no difference in any 
property (including the width) except for the energy (E+ – E– = 2V).

↔E2 interaction 
The imaginary part of E+ – E– shows that the difference in level widths is reduced by the E1
EXCEPT, when δΓ2/4 >> V2, a narrow level tunes through resonance with a broad level without any 
significant change in width. BIG SURPRISE! 

No level repulsion and no width sharing in the weak coupling limit!


The broad level is a doorway state broadened by its interaction with the dark continuum.


When the doorway state becomes broader than the sharp~broad matrix element, the interaction effectively

turns off.  The doorway state has “dissolved” in the bath.

One can tune EA relative to EB using ∆BJ(J + 1) or using a magnetic field.

Once can adjust the interaction matrix element using an electric field (ψB has the wrong parity for excitation

Figure 9.10.  Level Anticrossings between states with complex energies in the strong and weak coupling limits.   The quantum 
beat frequency, ωQB, the difference between the widths of the levels at higher and lower real energy, Γ+ - Γ-, and the intensity of 
the quantum beat, I QB, are plotted vs. the difference between the real part of the zero-order energy, δε, at constant coupling 
strength (V), for three values of the difference  between the imaginary parts of the zero-order energy, dΓ: strong coupling 
(V = 5δΓ), intermediate coupling (V = δΓ), and weak coupling (V = δΓ/5).  Note the use of different vertical scales for the three 
Γ+ - Γ- and IQB plots.  The ωQB plots illustrate the reduction in level repulsion from the strong coupling value of minimum (ωQB) = 
2V that occurs in the weak coupling limit.  That the sharp level tunes, without level repulsion, through the broad level in the weak 
coupling limit, is illustrated by the linearity of the vee-shaped ωQB curve and the discontinuity in the Γ+ - Γ- curve.  The IQB curves 
illustrate that, in the weak coupling limit, the product of mixing fractions is significantly reduced at the level crossing (dynamical 
decoupling) but the FWHM of the IQB = 2 α α 2*  mutually-mixed region is increased (figure prepared by Kyle Bittinger).
