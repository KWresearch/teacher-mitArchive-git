As the bright state is systematically tuned (perhaps by changing rotational level), it can mix either indirectly 
or directly with the continuous, dark bath. 

Our goal is to find a shortcut for dealing with the interaction between a bright state and a bath, especially via 
a doorway state.

We can develop an intuitive understanding for a two- or three-level problem much more easily than for a 
large-dimension random matrix problem.  It is also computationally much quicker.

We can think of decay rate as a property of a “quasi-eigenstate”.  We can just tack the decay rate onto the 
normal Ψj(Q,t) without changing anything.  Seems to be too good to be true! 

One bad thing about allowing Heff to have complex energies along the diagonal is that Heff is no longer 
Hermitian.  We will soon see the difficulties this causes and how to patch them up. 

We would like to use non-degenerate and quasi-degenerate perturbation theory to describe the effects of 
interactions between states with finite lifetimes.  [Decay rates is better concept than lifetimes. 
Why?] 

Are decay rates shared between interacting states the way other properties are shared?  Let’s review what 
perturbation theory tells us about sharing of properties.  Use the Zeeman tuning coefficient (g-value) 
as the shared property.

The sum of a renormalization-corrected zero-order term (nominal character) plus expectation values of 
HZeeman weighted by the fractional character of each “remote perturber” state (borrowed character).  This is

exactly what we would expect for sharing of properties other than energy.


What about sharing of decay rates?

This means that the borrowing and lending of decay rate follows the usual perturbation theory form, except 
for two subtle modifications, one in the numerator and one in the denominator.  There is also a

The usual orthogonality integral is not 0 and is pure imaginary.  Something is wrong!  Cannot use either

orthogonality or completeness to expand 
.  So we cannot use the results of ordinary non-degenerate
perturbation theory without a correction. 

The concept of “biorthogonality” saves us.
