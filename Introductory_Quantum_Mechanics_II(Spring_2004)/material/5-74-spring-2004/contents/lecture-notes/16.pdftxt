QUANTUM MECHANICAL TREATMENT OF FLUCTUATIONS* 

Introduction and Preview 
Now the origin of frequency fluctuations is expected to be interactions of our molecule (or more 
appropriately our electronic transitions) with its environment.  This we can treat with our D.H.O. 
model, which is a general approach to coupling to nuclear vibrations.   

We found that 

tµ ( ) µ ( 0 )  = ∑ p n

We can write this in terms of the Hamiltonian that describes the electronic energy gap’s 
dependence on  Q  (deviation relative to ωeg ):

Now if we believe there are interactions that lead to fluctuations in the energy group—variations 
in  d or ω0 , then our  Heg  is now time-dependent!

So we have an expression for how the time-dependence of the energy gap Hamiltonian leads to 
the lineshape.

Note that this looks very much like a Hamiltonian that describes the coupling of an electronic

Fluctuations in coupling to bath could lead to line broadening!  Equivalently, coupling to a bath 
of many harmonic oscillators should lead to line-broadening.

If we want to rewrite this in terms of  Heg , we are changing representation to a new Hamiltonian.  
Similar to the transformation to the interaction picture, we will choose a new frame of reference:  
the ground state  Hg  and the dynamics of the excited state will be represented in reference to the 
ground state through  Heg :

So, the interaction of an electronic transition with a frequency distribution of nuclear coordinates 
(a bath) leads to line broadening and irreversible relaxation.  The effect is to damp the nuclear 
oscillations on electronic states. 

More commonly we would think of our electronic transition coupled to a particular nuclear 
coordinate  Q  which may be a local mode, but the local mode feels a fluctuating environment—a 
friction.   

Classically, we would understand the fluctuations as Brownian motion, described by a 
generalized Langevin equation:

So, going back to our displaced H.O. problem, we can rewrite our Hamiltonian to include the 
interaction of one primary vibration with a bath, which leads to damping:
