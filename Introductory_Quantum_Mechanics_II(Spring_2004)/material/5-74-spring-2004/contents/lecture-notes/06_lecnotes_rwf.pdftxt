The autocorrelation function of the wavepacket created by a short pulse at t = 0 generates the absorption
spectrum.  Our picture is usually in coordinate space only.  What is missing?

We get a microscopic, particle-like picture (F = ma = p·  ) that explains the qualitative features of the
autocorrelation function.

Identifies the local features of the V′
spectrum.

e potential that account for the important features in the absorption

Could we get the same information in a time domain experiment?  Certainly.  Short pulse pump/probe.  We
need to create the wavepacket and thus monitor its time evolving overlap with its t = 0 self.

How would we do such an experiment?
What would we observe?
Would there be additional effects that might complicate the picture?

One color pump/probe?  What do we detect?  fluorescence? ionization?  absorption?
Two color pump/probe?

Let's discuss experimental schemes.

Discussion of observation of |〈Ψ(t)|Ψ(0)〉|2 directly in a time domain experiment:

1.

One-color pump-probe:

signal (either absorption or stimulated emission) observed by pulse   2

2.

One-color pump-probe with polarization selectivity.

* 
* 

first pulse is circularly polarized
second pulse is linearly polarized.  It is incident on a crossed polarizer.  The spatial
anisotropy written into the sample by the first pulse alters the polarization state of the second
pulse, permitting some radiation to leak through the blocking polarizer.

3.

One color pump-probe with fluorescence or ionization detection.

* 

time resolution does not permit discrimination against signal produced by first pulse.  Total
signal results from two pulses as a function of delay between pulses.  How does this work?
Problem set!

4.

two-color pump-probe with fluorescence-dip or ionizaiton detection.  Stimulated Emission Pumping.
Zewail experiment.

If we try to make the wavepacket envisioned in the Heller picture, how do we deal with non-
idealities?

µ(Q ) - usually slow variation with Q, but not when there is a qualitative change in geometry
short pulse, centered at correct λ
negative wavepacket on ground state?
multiphoton processes
spatial and temporal distribution of molecules affected by laser pulse?

This is much better because we have implicitly integrated over the wavefunctions.  It is a matrix of
numbers.  Populations (time independent) along the diagonal and coherences (time
dependent) off-diagonal.

Every element of ρρρρ(t) is separately time dependent, so there is too much information to look at here
without some sort of magic filter.

This is beginning to look like a mechanism, but it is necessary to know what to look for.  How to
choose a good ψF?  This is always a serious problem.  Things look simple only when you have found
the right way to look at them!

9.1.46, 9.1.47, 9.1.49 and 9.1.50).  PI(t) and PI→F(t) are shown for mixing angles θ=0, π/8, π/4 (maximum amplitude), and π/2
