Stationary Phase for Vibration-Electronic Spectra

The classical Franck-Condon principle specifies ∆R = 0, ∆P = 0.  If ∆P = 0, then the kinetic energy, KE(R), 
must also be unchanged upon excitation 

KE ′ ( ) =  E ′ − V ′ ( )

which can only be satisfied at special values of R, each of which is a stationary phase point. 

The choice of transition frequency from a given vibrational level of either the lower or upper electronic state 
determines the stationary phase point.  This is the R-value (or R-values) at which the transition occurs and 
the region where a piece of the initial state wavefunction is transferred onto the final state potential.

Rsp may be swept through a small region of the initial state vibrational wavefunction by systematic variation 
of the center frequency of the probe laser, ν.  As Rsp sweeps through lobes of the initial state wavefunction, 
the transition amplitude increases and decreases.  The maximum transition amplitude is obtained when Rsp is 
at the maximum of the outermost lobe of the vibrational wavefunction (because the outer turning point is 
always softer than the inner turning point). 

A similar Franck-Condon-like principle applies to Rydberg-Rydberg transitions

Case (1) shows that rsp is small (inside the core) when n″ is small and m is large.  High-n wavepackets are 
launched from inside the core.

let n″= 1, l = 0, rsp = 1a0 (1a0 = 0.529Å). 

Case (2) implies that rsp can be very large.  The rsp lies near the outer turning point of the lower state. 

n″ = 4, l = 3, m = 1 (5g ← 4f)

r  = 16a0

You should verify that there is no stationary phase point for n = 5, l = 2 ← n = 4, l = 3!  All upward (i.e. 
∆n > 0) Rydberg-Rydberg transitions have a strong ∆l = +1 propensity rule. 

By adjusting n″ and n′ (via choice of initial state and center transition frequency), one can build a Rydberg 
wavepacket that looks like the inner or outer lobe of the initial n″,l″ eigenstate.  Simple physical pictures are 
based on this!

Heller’s Fractionation Index


This provides a simple measure of how strongly a single bright state gets diluted into a bath of dark states.


Three cases:


1) 

Suppose

B 

is bright and 

You have an Heff and can look at all of the eigenvectors.

{ ψ

which implies that the single Bright state is delocalized into N + 1 states, N of which are dark. 

Alternatively, you can ask how fractionated a single eigenstate is with respect to the zero-order basis 
in which it is expressed.

This fractionation index depends on the choice of basis set, just as the Bright state fractionation 
index is determined by the specific basis set to which the Bright state belongs.

An eigenstate-resolved spectrum.

Heller’s fractionation index is, where Ii is the relative intensity of the i-th line,

The fractionation index tells us what fraction of symmetry and energetically accessible state or phase 
space is accessed by our pluck. 

1 
Fraction of space accessed = Nf 

when f = 1/N, the fraction accessed = 1 (all of it!)

when f = 1, the fraction accessed = 1/N.
