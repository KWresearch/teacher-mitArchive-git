strong coupling limit V2 >> δε2 + δΓ2/4:  if either δε = 0 or δΓ = 0, the two quasi-eigenstates have 
the same width.  Otherwise no major surprises. 

weak coupling limit V2 << δε2 – δΓ2/4:  if δε = 0 we get no level repulsion and no level-width 
sharing.  Big surprise! 

Quantum beats between two decaying quasi-eigenstates.  I(t) expressed in terms of 8 parameters (I+,

Today:

begin study of vibrational dynamics, leading eventually to replacement of the quantum mechanical

eff by a classical mechanical HHHH eff.  Tricks to get 〈A〉 without use of Trace(ΑΑΑΑρρρρ(t)).

The second choice is vastly preferable because:


1.	 it is in the form of a traditional fit model; 
2.	 it does not require diagonalization of the full H because H(1) is block diagonalized 
into polyads (actually need to perform a Van Vleck transformation to fold out-of-
polyad matrix elements of the selected anharmonic resonances into the quasi-
degenerate polyad blocks); 
3.	 it does not require extensive use of non-degeneragte perturbation theory to convert 
anharmonic terms in V(Q) (k′s) into anharmonic terms in E(V) (x′s) [x-k relationships: 
Ian Mills].

Suppose we have a polyad involving three vibrational normal modes connected by two anharmonic 
resonances (we are going to use this model for several lectures). 

ω1 ≈ ω3 ≈ 2ω2 
ω1 is symmetric stretch: 
ω3 is antisymmetric stretch: 
ω2 is bend:	

totally symmetric 
anti-symmetric (need even number of quanta to be totally symmetric) 
totally symmetric 
(a further level of complexity could be a doubly degenerate bending 
mode)

(interpolyad dynamics), and dynamics of the resonance and transfer rate operators.  Next time.  Also final
