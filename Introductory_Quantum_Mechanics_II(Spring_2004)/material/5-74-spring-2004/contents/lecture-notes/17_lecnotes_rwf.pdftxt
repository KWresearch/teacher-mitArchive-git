Whenever you have two identical subsystems, energy will flow rapidly between them unless 
something special makes them dynamically different: 
*  anharmonicity 
* 
interaction with surroundings

Morse Oscillator

The Morse oscillator has a physically appropriate and mathematically convenient form.  It turns out to give 
a vastly more convenient representation of an anharmonic vibration than

If we use

rrr = –6a3De

rrrr = 14a4De 
f

in the framework of nondengenerate perturbation theory, we get much better results than we expect or 
deserve. 

Why?  Because the energy levels of a Morse oscillator have a very simple form:

This works better than we could ever have hoped, and therefore we should never look a gift horse in the 
mouth.  We always use Morse rather than an arbitrary power series representation of V(r).  Sometimes we 
even use a power series  ∑ an [1 − exp(− ar

Armed with this simplification, consider two anharmonically coupled local stretch oscillators.  WHY? 
What promotes or inhibits energy flow between two identical subsystems?

*	 Local and Normal Mode Pictures are opposite limiting cases 
*	 Heff contains antagonistic terms that preserve and destroy limiting behavior

Extremely complicated algebra 

1.  HLocal defined identically to H Local, but with diagonal anharmonicity. 
2.	 Convert to dimensionless P, Q, H and then to a,a†. 
3.	 exploit the convenient V(Q) ↔ E(v) properties of VMorse. 
4.	 van Vleck transformation to account for the effect of out of polyad coupling terms from 
[G PRPL + kRLQRQL] BUT NOT from VMorse.

5.	 Simplest possible fit model — relationships (constraints) between fit parameters imposed by 
the identical Morse oscillator model. 
6.	 Next time — transformation from HLocal to HNormal.

This enables us to use Harmonic-Oscillators for basis set but Morse simplification for the separate local 
oscillators. 

We are going to expand Vanh(Q) and keep only the Q3 and Q4 terms and treat them, respectively, by second-
order and first-order perturbation theory, as we did for the simple Morse oscillator.
