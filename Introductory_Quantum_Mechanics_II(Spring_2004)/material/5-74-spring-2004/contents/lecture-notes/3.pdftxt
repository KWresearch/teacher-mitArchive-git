SCHRÖDINGER AND HEISENBERG REPRESENTATIONS 

The mathematical formulation of the dynamics of a quantum system is not unique.  Ultimately 
we are interested in observables (probability amplitudes)—we can’t measure a wavefunction.   

An alternative to propagating the wavefunction in time starts by recognizing that a unitary 
transformation doesn’t change an inner product.   

ϕjϕ = ϕj U †Uϕ
i 
i 

For an observable: 

Aϕi  = (ϕj  U† )A U  ϕ ) =	 ϕ U † AUϕ
(
i 
j
i 
Two approaches to transformation:   


ϕj 

1)  Transform the eigenvectors:   ϕi  → U ϕi 

.  Leave operators unchanged. 


2)  Transform the operators:   A → U† AU  .  Leave eigenvectors unchanged.

Schrödinger Picture:  Everything we have done so far.  Operators are stationary. 

(  ). 
Eigenvectors evolve under  U t , t0


Heisenberg Picture:  Use unitary property of  U  to transform operators so they evolve 
in time.  The wavefunction is stationary.  This is a physically appealing picture, because 
particles move – there is a time-dependence to position and momentum.

We have talked about the time-development of  ψ , which is governed by

ψ ( )

If  A  is independent of time (as it should be in the Schrödinger picture) and commutes with  H , it 
is referred to as a constant of motion.

we choose to define the operator in the Heisenberg picture as:

Also, since the wavefunction should be time-independent

So, 

ψS(t ) = U t, t(  0 )ψH

THE INTERACTION PICTURE 

When solving problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians, it is often best to partition the 
Hamiltonian and treat each part in a different representation.  Let’s partition 

( ) = H0  + V t
( ) 
H t

H
0  :  Treat exactly—can be (but usually isn’t) a function of time. 

V t( ) :  Expand perturbatively (more complicated).   

The time evolution of the exact part of the Hamiltonian is described by

where we have used the composition property of  U t , t

For transitions between two eigenstates of H0, l and k: The system 
evolves in eigenstates of H0 during the different time periods, with the 
time-dependent interactions V driving the transitions between these 
states.  The time-ordered exponential accounts for all possible 
intermediate pathways.
