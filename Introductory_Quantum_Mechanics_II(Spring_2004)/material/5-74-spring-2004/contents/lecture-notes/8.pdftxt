Interaction of Light with Matter 

p. 54 

We want to derive a Hamiltonian that we can use to describe the interaction of an electromagnetic 

field with charged particles:  Electric Dipole Hamiltonian.   


Semiclassical:  matter treated quantum mechanically 

Field:  classical 


Brief outline of electrodynamics:  See nonlecture handout.  Also, see Jackson, Classical 

Electrodynamics, or Cohen-Tannoudji, et al., Appendix III. 

>  Maxwell’s Equations describe electric and magnetic fields  (E , B ). 

>  For Hamiltonian, we require a potential.


(
>  To construct a potential representation of  E  and  B , you need a vector potential  A  r , t

). 
(
scalar potential ϕ F , t

) and a 

>  A  and ϕ are mathematical constructs that can be written in various representations (gauges).   

We choose a gauge such that ϕ= 0  (Coulomb gauge) which leads to plane-wave description of  E 
and  B : 

−∇ 2A  r , t
(

) + ∈0  µ0 

∂ 2 A  r , t
(
∂t 

) = 0

∇ ⋅ A = 0 

This wave equation allows the vector potential to be written as a set of plane waves:   

) = A0  ∈ei (k ⋅r −ωt 
) + A0  ∈e 
* ˆ  −i (k ⋅r −ωt )

ˆ 
since  ∇ ⋅ A = 0,  k ⋅  ˆ 
∈= 0  ⇒  k ⊥ ˆ 
∈ where  ˆ

Hamiltonian for radiation field interacting with charged particle 

We will derive a Lagrangian for charged particle in field, then use it to determine classical 
Hamiltonian, then replace classical operators with quantum.   

Start with Lorentz force on a charged particle:  
= ( 
 B ) 
v
F q  E  + ×

where  r(cid:5)  is the velocity.  In one direction  (x ) , we have: 

F  = q
x

(

x  + yB  − zBy )

(cid:5)

The generalized force for the components of the force in the  x  direction in Lagrangian Mechanics 
is: 

∂U d   ∂U  
xF  = −  
+ 
 ∂x(cid:5)  
 
dt
∂x 
 

U is the potential. Using our relationships for  E  and  B  in terms of  A  and ϕ in eq. (2) and 
working it into the form of eq. (3), we can show that:   

U q= ϕ − q

(cid:5) ⋅ A 
 r
 

See CTDL, app. III, p. 1492.  Confirm by plugging into (3).   

Now we can write a Lagrangian 

L = T − U 

=  2 m r(cid:5) 2  + q  r  ⋅ A − ϕ
(cid:5) 
q

Now the Hamiltonian is related to the Lagrangian at:   

(cid:5)

Now substituting (7) into (6), we have:

This is the classical Hamiltonian for a particle of charge  q  in an electromagnetic field.  So, in the 
Coulomb gauge  (ϕ= 0) , we have the Hamiltonian for a collection of particles in the absence of a 
field:



H = ∑ ( 1  ( pi  − q

Generally the last term is considered small—energy of particles high relative to amplitude of 
potential—so we have:

H = H0  + V t( )  
V t( ) = ∑ qi  (pi ⋅ A  + A ⋅ pi ) 
i  2m i 

Now we are in a position to substitute the quantum mechanical momentum for the classical:   

p  = − i(cid:61)∇ 
V t( ) = ∑ i (cid:61)  qi(∇ ⋅ A + A ⋅ ∇i )

i  2m i 
Notice  ∇ ⋅ A  = (
) + A ⋅ ∇  (chain rule), but we are in the Coulomb gauge (∇ ⋅ A  = 0), so 
∇ ⋅ A
∇ ⋅ A = A ⋅ ∇

Electric Dipole Approximation 

If the wavelength of the field is much larger than the molecular dimension (λ→ ∞)( k  → 0), then 
ik ⋅ re → 1. 


If  r0  is the center of mass of a molecule:

For UV, visible, infrared—not X-ray— k  ri − r0  << 1, set  r0 = 0 

ei k ⋅ r  → 1 . 

We do retain higher-order terms to describe higher order interactions with the field.   

Retain second term for quadrupole transition moment:  charge distribution interacting with 
gradient of electric field and magnetic dipole.

Harmonic Perturbation:  Matrix Elements
