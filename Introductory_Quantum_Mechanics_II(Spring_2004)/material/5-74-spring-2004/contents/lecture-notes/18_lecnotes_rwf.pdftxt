Classical mechanical treatment of two 1 : 1 coupled local Harmonic Oscillators 
Simple transformation decouples the sub-systems. 

quantum Mechanical treatment of Morse oscillator

V(r) = De (1 – exp – ar)2

E(v)/hc = ω(v + 1/2) + x(v + 1/2)2 
(x is usually negative)

Expand V(r), use 1st-order p.t. for r4 and 2nd-order for r .  Get exact result for energies!

Incompatible Terms in Heff 

18 – 2 

Often we have a choice between two zero-order basis sets.  These correspond to two limiting cases for the 
dynamics.  In one case, one term causes an on-diagonal energy splitting that preserves the limiting case and 
another term causes an off-diagonal matrix element that destroys the limiting case.  In the other limiting 
case, the roles of the two terms are reversed. 

Consider the following illustration for a 2 level system:

Here parameter A lifts the degeneracy and tries to preserve limit #2.

Parameter B controls the off-diagonal elements that try to destroy limit #2.


Parameters A and B play antagonistic roles, but their roles are reversed going from limit #1 to limit #2.


This sort of behavior is universal, even in much larger dimension problems than 2 × 2.

High energy part of  H Local  polyad goes toward normal mode limit faster than low energy part of polyad. 

Anharmonicity creates large level spacings (between coupled levels) near bottom of polyad that resists 
transition toward normal mode limit. 

Convert to normal mode limit: 

*	 analytic transformation of basis states 
*	 analytic transformation of H 
*	 define T†HT transformation numerically:  set case preserving constant to zero and diagonalize. 
Apply to H where case preserving parameter is not zero.

It is insightful to know relationships among fit parameters 
* 
recognize unlikely assignments 
*  simplify dynamics.  simplest possible description of a pluck. 
* 
recognize opposing forces toward or away from opposite limits 

But it is difficult to map out the local vs. normal character of the individual eigenstates in each polyad and 
the evolution toward global normal or local dynamics. 

What are we supposed to look for, especially when there is more than one coupling mechanism? 

*  division between mostly-local and mostly-normal eigenstates 
*  appearance of qualitatively new (and unexpected) classes of motion. 
*  chaos.  Fraction of phase space that is chaotic. 
level spacing distribution 
relative intensity distribution 

*  statistical measures
