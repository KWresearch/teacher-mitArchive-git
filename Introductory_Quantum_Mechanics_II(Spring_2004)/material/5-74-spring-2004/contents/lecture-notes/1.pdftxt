5.74  TIME-DEPENDENT QUANTUM MECHANICS 

The time evolution of the state of a system is described by the time-dependent Schrödinger 
equation (TDSE): 

i(cid:61)  ∂
(
ψ r , t
∂t 

) = Hˆ ψ r , t
(

)

Most of what you have previously covered is time-independent quantum mechanics, where we 
mean that  Hˆ   is assumed to be independent of time:   Hˆ  = H  rˆ (  ). 

We then assume a solution of the form: 

ψ(r , t ) = ϕ r 
(  )T t
( ) 
ˆ ( )ϕ r
( )  
1  ∂  ( ) =  H r 
i(cid:61) 
T t
ϕ r
( ) ∂t 
T t
( )  

Here the left-hand side is a function of  t  only, and the right-hand side is a function of  r  only. 
This can only be satisfied if both sides are equal to the same constant,  E 

∴ 

ˆ ( )ϕ r 
( )
H r
( )
ϕ r 

= E 

⇒

Solution: 

T t( ) =  A exp (− iEt / (cid:61) ) =  A exp (− iωt ) 

So, for a set of eigenvectors ϕ ( ) with corresponding eigenvalues  En , there are a set of
r
n 
corresponding eigensolutions to the TDSE.

The probability density 

P =  ψ (r , t )ψ(r , t )d
( 
∫  *
r = ψ r , t

( 
)
ψ r , t

)

may be time dependent for  ψ ( r ,  t  ) , but is independent of time for the eigenfunctions  ψ ( r , t  ) . 
n 
Therefore, ϕ r( ) are called stationary states. 

However, more generally a system may be represented as a linear combination of eigenstates:   

ψ(r , t ) = ∑ c ψ (r , t ) = ∑ c e n
(r )
− iω tϕ
n
n 
n 
n

n 

For such a case, the probability density will oscillate with time:  coherence. 

e.g., two eigenstates 

ψ(r , t ) = c1ϕ1e

−iω1t  + c2ϕ2e− iω2  t

p t( ) = ψψ= c1ϕ + c2ϕ + c1  c2ϕ*ϕ2e

probability density oscillates as  cos(ω2  −ω )t1 

This is a simple example of coherence (coherent superposition state).  Including momentum (a 
wavevector) of particle leads to a wavepacket.

TIME EVOLUTION OPERATOR 

More generally, we want to understand how the wavefunction evolves with time.  The TDSE is 
linear in time.  Since the TDSE is deterministic, we will define an operator that describes the 
dynamics of the system:   

ψ(t ) = U t, t 0(
For the time-independent Hamiltonian:   

)ψ(t0 ) 

∂
(
ψ r , t
∂t 

) + 

iH 
(
ψ r , t
(cid:61) 

) = 0  

(1)

To solve this, we will define an operator  T = exp(−iHt  / (cid:61)) , which is a function of an operator. 
A function of an operator is defined through its expansion in a Taylor series:   

T  = exp[−iHt (cid:61)] = 1 −
= f H( )  

iHt

+

2!  (cid:61)   − (cid:34) 

Multiplying eq. 1 from the left by  T − = exp (iHt / (cid:61)) we have:

Time-evolution of a coupled two-level system (2LS) 

It is common to reduce or map problem onto a 2LS.  We then discard remaining degrees of 
freedom, or incorporate them as a heat bath,  H H 0  + H bath
.
= 

 

Let’s discuss the time-evolution of a 2LS with a time-independent Hamiltonian.   


Consider a 2LS with two (unperturbed) eigenstates ϕ and ϕb  with eigenenergies ε and εb ,

which are then coupled through an interaction  Vab .

H =

If we define the variables 

E = 

∆ =

ε + εb

ε − εb

Then we can solve for the eigenvalues of the coupled systems:   

ε± = E  ± ∆2  + V 2 

Because the expressions get messy, we don’t choose to find the eigenvectors for the coupled 
system,  ϕ±  , using this expression.  Rather, we use a substitution where we define: 

tan 2θ= 

V

We now find that we can express the eigenvalues as 

ε± = E  ± ∆ sec 2θ

We now want to find the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian,  ϕ H

(a) Weak coupling (V/∆ << 1).  Here θ ≈ 0, and  ϕ+  corresponds to  ϕ  perturbed by the  Vab

(b) Strong coupling (V/∆ >> 1). Now θ = 45º, and the a/b basis states are indistinguishable.  
The eigenstates are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations: 
~ 1  (

ϕ ± ϕ

ϕ± 

)

Whether + or − corresponds to the symmetric or asymmetric combination depends on whether V 
is positive or negative. (For −V >> ∆, θ = −45°) 

We can schematically represent the energies of these states:   

ε−Ε

These eigenstates exhibit avoided crossing.

The time-evolution of this system is given by our time-evolution operator.

Now ϕ  and ϕb  are not the eigenstates—preparing ϕ  will lead to time-evolution!

Let’s prepare the system so that it is initially in state 

ϕ .
a 
(t0  = 0)  ψ(0) = ϕa 

What is the probability that it is found in state  ϕb  at time  t ?

tPba ( ) =  ϕb ψ t( )   = 

ϕb 

(
U t , t 0

)ϕ

To evaluate this, you need to know the transformation from the  ϕa ,b  to the  ϕ±  basis, given 
above. This gives: 

tPba ( ) = 

V 2 
2  sin 2 Ω Rt 
V 2

where the Rabi Frequency  Ω R  = 

1 
(cid:61)

Ω R  represents the frequency at which probability amplitude oscillates between ϕ  and ϕb  states.

Pure vs. Mixed States 

Why would we need the density matrix?  It helps for mixed states.
