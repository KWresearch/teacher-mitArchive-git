ROTATIONAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND SPHERICAL TENSOR OPERATORS 
3-j for coupled↔uncoupled 
transformation of operators as well as basis states 
6-j, 9-j for replacement of one intermediate angular momentum magnitude by another 

patterns — limiting cases — simple dynamics 
minimum number of control parameters needed to fit or predict the I(ω) or I(t) 

Today:

Rotation as a way of classifying wavefunctions and operators 
Classification is very powerful — it allows us to exploit universal symmetry properties to 
reduce complex phenomena to the unique, system specific characteristics 

Recall finite group theory 

*	 Construct a reducible representation — a set of matrix transformations that reproduce the 
symmetry element multiplication table 
represent the matrices by their traces: characters 
*	
*	
reduce the representation to a sum of irreducible representations 
*	 each irreducible representation corresponds to a symmetry species (quantum number) 
*	 selection rules, projection operators, integration over symmetry coordinates 
the full rotation group is an ∞ dimension example, because the dimension is ∞, there are an 
*	
infinite number of irreducible representations:  the J quantum number can go from 0 to ∞ 
*	 because the symmetry is so high, most of the irreducible representations are degenerate:  the MJ 
quantum number corresponds to the 2J+1 degenerate components. 

All of the tricks you probably learned in a simple point group theory are applicable to angular momentum 
and the full rotation group. 

Rotation of Coordinates 
two coordinate systems: 

XYZ fixed in space 
xyz attached to atom or molecule

2 angles needed to specify orientation of z wrt Z

one more angle needed to specify orientation of xy by rotation about z


EULER angles - difficult to visualize — several ways to define — you will need to invest some effort if you 
want a deep understanding

If A can be expanded as a sum of terms that transform under rotation as angular momentum basis functions, 
then the integral is a sum of products of D(φ,θ,χ)  matrices. 

 

But the integral cannot depend on the specific values of φ, θ, χ. 

This tells us that, if we can partition A into a sum of terms, each of which has the rotational transformation 
properties of an angular momentum basis state, we will be able to evaluate the angular part of the integral 
implied by the matrix element.  This is actually how the Wigner-Eckart Theorem is derived. 

Spherical tensor expansion is like a multipole expansion.  Anything can be broken up into angular 
momentum-like parts, including what a laser writes onto a molecular sample.

Transformations between SPACE and molecule fixed coordinate systems 

A rotational wavefunction specifies the probability amplitude distribution of orientation of the molecule 
fixed axis system in the laboratory axis system.  Origin of both coordinate systems is fixed at 
molecular center of mass. 

We can express the relationship between LAB and molecule frame quantities.  For example, radiation is 
specified in the LAB, but transition moments are tied to the molecule frame.  The 
molecule↔radiation interaction ε·µ  is a dot product between quantities specified in different 
coordinate systems.  We must transform one of these into the coordinate system of the other.
