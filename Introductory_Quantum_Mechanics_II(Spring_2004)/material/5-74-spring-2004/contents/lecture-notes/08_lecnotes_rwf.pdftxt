Resonance Operators:  Equation of Motion 
Last time: tools for describing a pump/probe wavepacket experiment 

*	 ρρρρ(t ≤ 0) incoherent, populations on diagonal 

*	 E(0) excitation matrix.  Transforms initial state into coherent superposition:  for electronic 
transition get  g v g ′′
, 
translated vertically onto upper potential surface 

*	 U(t,0) = e–iHt/h time evolution of t = 0 prepared wavepacket.  If ρρρρ(0) = E(0)ρρρρ(t ≤ 0)E† is expressed 
in the eigenbasis, U has simple diagonal form.  Otherwise need to express everything in zero-
order basis and transform.

Why?  The pluck is almost always a simple zero-order non-eigenstate.

ρρρρ(t) = U(t,0)E(0)ρρρρ(t ≤ 0)E†(0)U†(t,0) 

*	 Now describe the specific nature of the detection operation 
I(t) = Trace(Dρρρρ) 

If you want to sample the ρρρρ
ij(t) element of ρρρρ(t), you want a detection matrix with non-zero Dji element.

We build a toy model Heff with the goal of reproducing the early time dynamics.  We want to be able to look 
at the toy model and identify the most important dynamical features of that model.

Today:  useful ways of monitoring and describing the mechanism of the dynamics encoded in ρρρρ(t). 

What do I mean by encoded?  N × N ρρρρ(t) matrix.  Since ρρρρ is Hermitian, there are 
independent t-dependent elements.  Too much information.

Ehrenfest’s Theorem also allows us to describe (and simplify) the dynamics in “state space” rather than 
coordinate-momentum space.  This can be very useful. 
Suppose we can write  H = ∑  h j  + ∑  h jk

hj describes isolated sub-systems.  It is the basis for a choice of  H ( ) = ∑ h j  that defines basis states

as 1,n1
〉2,n2
〉 …N,nN
〉.  Simple (and convenient) product basis (there are often several 
useful choices, e.g. normal vs. local modes of vibration). 

hjk describes couplings between subsystems.  It is responsible for dynamics if the pluck produces a 
single product basis (non-eigen) state.

. closeness to “resonance” 

This algebra is especially useful when there are several different resonance operators. 

This algebra allows us to ask what is the fractional importance of each resonance operator for the dynamics 
of any conceivable pluck.  See page 649 of HLB-RWF.
