Point of View 

1-1 

Isolated (gas phase) molecules:  no coherences (intra- or inter-molecular).

At t = 0 sudden perturbation:

“photon pluck” 
visualization of dynamics 

ρρρρ(0) [need matrix elements of µ(Q )] 
ρρρρ(t) [need H for evolution] 

H = H(0)  + H(1) 

intramolecular coupling terms (not t-dependent) 
initially localized, nonstationary state

What do we need?


pre-pluck initial state: simple, localized in both physical and state space 
nature of pluck: 
usually very simple 
single orbital 
single oscillator 
single conformer (even if excitation is to energy above the isomerization 
barrier) 

post-pluck dynamics

nature of pluck determines best choice of H(0)


need H =  H(0) + H(1) to describe dynamics 

*  Reduce H to Heff 
good for a “short” time 
* 
transformations between basis sets 
*  evaluate matrix elements of Heff and µ(Q) 

Visualize dynamics in reduced dimensionality 

∗ ψ(Q)*ψ(Q) contains too much information
*  develop tools to look at individual parts of system — in coordinate and state space 

Detection? 
*  how to describe various detection schemes? 
*  devise optimal detection schemes 

1st essential tool is Angular Momentum Algebra 

define basis sets for coupled sub-systems

electronic ψ — symmetry in molecular frame, orbitals

rotational ψ — relationship between molecular and lab frame


alternative choices of complete sets of commuting operators

(note that if Hz were ∝ (L  + Sz), the HSO and HZeeman simplified operators would commute and both

So we have to choose between coupled and uncoupled basis sets.


Which do we choose?  The one that gives a better representation of the spectrum and dynamics

without considering off-diagonal matrix elements!  (You are free to choose either basis, but one is

always more convenient for specific experiment.)

Landé interval rule. 
Patterns in both frequency and time domain get destroyed.  Assignments are based on recognition of

patterns.  Selection rules for transitions get bent.

Extra lines, intensity anomalies (borrowing, interference).

We must do extra work to describe both ρ(0) and ρ(t).


Limiting cases are nice 

simple patterns (sometimes too simple to determine all coupling constants — restrictive 
selection rules) 
easy to compute matrix elements 
dynamics is often simple with periodic grand recurrences 

Deviations from limiting cases 
terms that can no longer be ignored have matrix elements that are difficult or tedious to 
evaluate.  Large Heff matrix must be diagonalized to describe dynamics.

Other kinds of useful transformations 

3-j are good to go from coupled↔uncoupled:  trade J for ML or MS

6-j and 9-j are useful to go between different coupled basis set:  trade one intermediate angular momentum 
magnitude for another 

Suppose you have 3 nonzero sub-system angular momenta 

s, llll, and I (nuclear spin) 
H = HSO + Hmhfs 
Hmhfs = aI·j

projection quantum number instead of MF, must perform coupled → uncoupled transformations followed by
