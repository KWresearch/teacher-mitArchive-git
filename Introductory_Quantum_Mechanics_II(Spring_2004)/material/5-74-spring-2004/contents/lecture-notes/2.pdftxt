The motion of a particle is described by a complex wavefunction  ψ ( r ,  t  )   that gives the 
probability amplitude of finding a particle at point  r  at time  t . If we know  ψ(
) , how does it
r , t0
change with time? 

? 
ψ r , t( 
) → ψ r , t(  ) 
0 

t > t 0

We will use our intuition here (largely based on correspondence to classical mechanics) 

We start by assuming causality:  ψ( )
t
0

 precedes and determines 

( )
ψ t

.

Also assume time is a continuous parameter:   


lim ψ(t
 )  = ψ( ) 
t0
t →t 0 

Define an operator that gives time-evolution of system.   

ψ t( ) = U t, t( 

)ψ t(  ) 
0 
0 

This “time-displacement operator” is similar to the “space-diplacement operator” 

ψ ( r )  = e 
ik ( r − r0 )

ψ ( r0  ) 

which moves a wavefunction in space.  

U  does not depend on  ψ .  It is a linear operator.

Composition property:

Let’s write the time-evolution for an infinitesimal time-step, δt. 
lim U  t 0  + δt , t  ) = 1

We expect that for small δt , the difference between  U t0 , t ) and  U t 0  + δt ,

Knowing the change of U during the period  δt allows us to write a differential equation for the 

time-development of  U t , t(

The definition of our infinitesimal time step operator says that 
( 
(
 t  ) = U  t ,
 t  ) − Ωδt =  − Ωδt .  So we have: 
i  
1 i
U t  + δt ,

∂U t , t(  0) = − iΩU t, t(

You can now see that the operator needed a complex argument, because otherwise probability 
amplitude would not be conserved (it would rise or decay).  Rather it oscillates through different 
states of the system.   

Here  Ω has units of frequency.  Noting (1) quantum mechanics says  E = (cid:61)ω and (2) in classical 
mechanics Hamiltonian generates time-evolution, we write 

HΩ =
(cid:61) 
) = HU t , t 0

Ω can be a function of time!

We are also interested in the equation of motion for  U †  .  Following the same approach and

Evaluating U(t,t0):  Time-Independent Hamiltonian 

Direct integration of  i(cid:61) ∂U ∂t = HU suggests that  U can be expressed as:

Since  H  is an operator, we will define this operator through the expansion:

You can confirm the expansion satisfies the equation of motion for  U .

Evaluating the time-evolution operator:  Time-Dependent Hamiltonian

confirm it; however, we are treating  H  as a number.

This is generally not the case in optical + mag. res. spectroscopy.  It is only the case for special 
Hamiltonians with a high degree of symmetry, in which the eigenstates have the same symmetry 
at all times.  For instance the case of a degenerate system (for instance spin ½ system) with a 
time-dependent coupling.

Special Case: If the Hamiltonian does commute at all times, then we can evaluate the time-

From this expansion, you should be aware that there is a time-ordering to the interactions.  For 
the third term, τ′′ acts before τ′ , which acts before τ:  t 0  ≤ τ′′ ≤ τ′ ≤ τ≤ t . 

Notice also that the operators act to the right.
