Correction of misconceptions from Lecture #15 
Overtone Spectroscopy 
Classical treatment of 2 coupled harmonic oscillations 

Consider excitation of a molecule, like H2O, with two short pulses of radiation.  The two pulses have 
different center frequencies and the second pulse can be delayed by τ relative to the first pulse, for 
0 ≤ τ ≤ 10ps.  After the two pulses have exited the sample, populations in the two-step excited eigenstates 
are measured by an unspecified method.  The measured quantity is ρff(τ) for each of the eigenstates in the 
two-step excited polyad (see figure) on page 16-3. 

At t = 0 prepare Ψ(0)〉 = A〉 

** Only µ aA and µbB  (basis state to basis state) transition moments are non-zero.

The population in each of the two-step excited eigenstates, ρff(τ), as a function of delay between the two

pulses is

Populations in (1234) are modulated by coherences in (A,B) polyad weighted by difference in a–A and b–B 
transition probabilities.  These transition probabilities often have simple quantum number inter­
relationships.  In this simple (A,B) case, all populations are modulated at the same frequency, ω
+–, but with 
different amplitudes.  More complicated when there are more than 2 states in the intermediate polyad. 

So we sample dynamics in (AB) polyad through τ-dependent populations in (abcd) polyad.  We do not 
sample dynamics in (abcd) polyad. 

Multi-step dynamics in frequency domain?  See next example.

Expect increasing width as you go to higher overtone.  Intensity decreases by factor of 10 to 100 per

What do we see in the R–H fundamental region (actually 5R–H + 1R–H)? 

*	 extent of mixing of 5 R–H into bath.  For each quantum of R–H transferred into the bath, the 
density of dark states increases but the coupling matrix elements decrease (sequential vs. direct 
coupling mechanism?). 

*	

intensity (area) of each anharmonically split out clump tells fractionation into lower # of quanta 
of RH and width tells rate of transfer n → n – 1. 

We see where the 5R–H pluck goes, and how fast.  Early steps in the relaxation are typically dependent on a 
doorway state lying near the bright state.  If this near degeneracy does not occur, there is a bottleneck in the 
energy flow. 

What would you observe in an experiment with two short pulses (5ω) τ (1ω) with variable delay?
