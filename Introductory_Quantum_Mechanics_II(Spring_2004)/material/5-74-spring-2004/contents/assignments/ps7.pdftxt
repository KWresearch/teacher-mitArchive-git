Suppose you were going to monitor P(t - τ) in a fluorescence-dip scheme. 
Describe this one-color pump-probe fluorescence-dip experiment in the 
ρρρρ(0), E, U, D formulation. 

Consider an experiment in which you have a cw laser oscillating at

The goal of this problem is to discover how (or whether) it is possible to 
determine experimentally the sign of k122.  This sign is physically significant 
because, if k122 > 0, then when bond 1 (Q1) is stretched the oscillation frequency 
of bond 2 is increased, and, if k122 < 0, stretching bond 1 decreases the oscillation 
frequency of bond 2. 

The energy levels of this two-mode oscillator are described by an Heff that has 
diagonal elements

and, because ω1  ≈ 2ω2, is arranged in quasi-degenerate polyad blocks, each block 
with polyad quantum number P = 2v1 + v2.  The off-diagonal matrix elements 
within each polyad block are

and the nonzero elements follow the selection rule 2∆v1 = –∆v2. 

A. 

Set up the P = 10 polyad block of H.  This is a 6 × 6 matrix.  Let 
1 = 1000 cm–1, ω2 = 500 cm–1, x11 = 10 cm–1, x22 = 5 cm–1, x12 = 0, and 
ω
122 = ±100 cm–1.  Solve for the energy levels for k122 = 100 cm–1 and 
k
122 = –100 cm–1.  Is the sign of k122 an observable quantity?  If it is not, 

k

you can skip part B, unless you have a clever idea for how to sample the 

sign of k122 in the time domain. 

B.	

Use the operator algebra from Lecture #8 (Resonance Operators: 

Equations of Motion) to propose a time domain observable quantity that is 

sensitive to the sign of k122.

E. 

Examine the time dependence of

single basis-state plucks of the P = 10 polyad.  Which pluck is most 

for each of the six possible

sensitive to the value of k122? 

Examine the time dependence of the expectation value 〈ΩΩΩΩ  + ΩΩΩΩ †〉
t for each 
of the six possible single basis-state plucks of the P = 10 polyad.  Which 

pluck is most sensitive to the value of k122? 

If you conclude that the sign of k122 is not an observable quantity, replace 
h

h12  = k1122 (a  + a 1 ) (a  + a 2 )
