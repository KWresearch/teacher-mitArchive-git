b)  From the second term, derive the matrix elements for electric quadrupole 
transitions in analogy to the electric dipole moment, and show that it is a

Using Fermi’s Golden Rule for the rate of transfer from an initial state  (cid:65)  to a 

continuum of states  k  under a constant perturbation V, show that the rate 

kw (cid:65)  
can be written in a interaction picture representation as a correlation function in 
the time-dependent perturbation
