Problem Set # 6 

DUE: 

At the start of Lecture on Monday, April 12. 

Reading:  HLB–RWF 9.1.3, 9.1.4, 9.1.7. 

Problems: 

1.  Return to problem 1D of Problem Set #5.  Use spherical tensor algebra and the Wigner-Eckart Theorem 
p ←  6s transitions from J  = 3,  
(cid:1)
to compute the relative transition amplitudes for all of the allowed n
(cid:1)
MJ  =  2  of  6s5d  3D3  into  the  various  L-S -J -MJ  states  of  the  n
p5d  conﬁguration.  The  transition 
moment operator is of the T1 (q1 ) form where q1  refers to the position coordinate of electron 1.  Your 
L-S -J -MJ  states are coupled with respect to L andS  and with respect to electron 1 and electron 2. 

2.  Return  to  problem  2  of  Problem  Set  #5.	 Use  spherical  tensor  algebra  to  relate  ζ (N , L, S ) and  
C (N , L, S, J )  for  the  1P1  and  3PJ  states  of  6snp  and  the  1D2  and  3DJ  states  of  6s5d  of  137Ba to 
the single-orbital parameters ζnp , ζ5d , a6s , anp , a5d , b6s  bnp  and b5d .  The single-orbital parameters are 
most “fundamental” because they are transferable from one state to another and are even scalable as 
a function of quantum number n and nuclear charge (isoelectronic series). 

3.  Return  to  problem  2C  of  Problem  Set #5.  Use  spherical  tensor  techniques  to  compute  the  relative 
transition  amplitudes  into  the  ﬁne,  hyperﬁne  components  of  6snp  3PJ  from  the  various  hyperﬁne 
components of 6s5d 3DJ  J = 3 and J = 2.  

4.  Return to problem 2D of Problem Set #5.  Let 

ζnp  = (6/n)3 ζ6p 
−1 
ζ6p  = 832 cm
a6s  = 0  
−3 ζnp 
anp  = 10
−1 
b6s  = 1  cm
bnp  = 0  

Find the 3 values of n for which ζnp  = 10  b6s , ζnp  = b6s , and  ζnp  = 0.1 b6s .  Compute the level structure, 
transition  amplitudes,  and  quantum  beating  signal  for  pulsed  excitation  from  6s5d  3DJ  (J  = 3  and 
J = 2)  to  6snp 3P. [Ignore the eﬀects of 1P1  ∼  3P1  spin-orbit interactions.]
