(For this set, do Problem 1 and either Problem 2 or Problem 3). 

 
 
 
 
 
1.  Consider a two-level system with Hamiltonian:   
 
  H0 = (cid:65) ε(cid:65) (cid:65)
 
  A time-dependent potential connects the two levels 
 
V t( ) = (cid:65) Vlk t( ) k + k Vkl t( ) (cid:65)
V t( ) = −µE cosωt
  
 
  At time  t=0 , the system is in   (cid:65)  .  What is the probability of finding it in state   k   
at time  t ?

a)  Find  Pk(t)  by exactly solving the coupled differential equations that describe the 
time-dependent expansion coefficient for these states.   

b)  Find Pk(t) using time-dependent perturbation theory to lowest nonvanishing order. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Vibrational Excitation by a Shock Wave.  We are going to study the excitation of 
higher lying vibrational levels of an anharmonic potential that would occur in a 
molecular crystal or liquid subjected to an shock wave. A strong shock wave in a 
molecular crystal could be launched by applying an abrupt pressure of 5 GPa, 
launching a shock wave that travels at about 5 nm/ps, leading to the compression of a 
solid by about 20%.  The compression can lead to vibrational excitation and heating 
of molecules in the shock zone, which can induce chemical reactions (like detonation 
of explosives). 
 
We will study a simplified model that captures the effects of such an excitation.  We 
will partition the Hamiltonian as

transient compression. The effect of a shock wave would most likely include 
couplings that deform the potential and also kinetic couplings.  Here we will choose 
the simplest form −the leading term in an expansion− in which the compression wave 
is linearly coupled to the oscillator

Here f(t) is the normalized time-profile of the shock wave and A is an amplitude 
factor that describes the strength of coupling of the shock wave to the oscillator. 
 
In this problem, we will study the time-dependent excitation of vibrational eigenstates 
of H0 by directly numerically solving the coupled linear differential equations that 
describe the time-evolution of bn, the expansion coefficients in the eigenstates of H0:

We will start by (a) calculating the vibrational eigenenergies and wavefunctions for 
eq. 2, (b) calculate the matrix elements in V, and then (c) numerically solve eqs. 4.   
 
(a)  To begin, we need to know the eigenenergies En and nuclear wavefunctions 
( )
of our system.  We will use the parameters used for H
2:  
n rψ
De/hc = 38297 cm-1; α = 2πνe(µ/2De)1/2; νe/c = 4403.2 cm-1; Re = 0.741 Å. 

Alumni of 5.73 will be familiar with numerical (or analytic) methods of 
calculating these and the matrix elements in (b).  You should feel free to use any 
method you’re comfortable with. I followed more primitive procedures described 
in I. N. Levine, Quantum Chemistry, 5th ed., Sec. 4.4 and 13.2. This describes a 
fairly simple routine using a set of reduced variables. 

Tabulate the eigenenergies for v = 0 to 5, and plot the corresponding nuclear 
wavefunctions.  

 
(b) Use the results of (a) to calculate the matrix elements Vmn(t).  Use any method 
you feel comfortable with.  Levine, Sec. 13.2, also describes a numerical 
approach to this. 

 

 
 

 

 

Tabulate Vmn for m,n = 0 to 5.  
 

 

(c)  For a system initially occupying the ground vibrational state, b0(0)=1, calculate 
how the system responds when subjected to a Gaussian compression:

where the compression width is σ=2 fs.  (This is a particularly fast shock wave).   
 
Show the time-developing probability of occupying the v=0 to 5 states through the 
course of the shock wave, using an amplitude A that leaves the ground state 90% 
depleted after the compression. What amplitude is in these states after the 
compression? 
 
This will require numerically solving the set of six coupled first-order linear 
differential equations that describe the time-evolution of the expansion 
coefficients in the v=0 to 5 eigenstates. (You can neglect couplings to higher 
lying states). You will need to numerically integrate the differential equations, 
probably using a mathematical software package like MatLab or MathCad.  Most 
of these packages have a function call that uses the Runga-Kutta method.  
Generally speaking these routines require real valued numbers to solve the 
equations.  If so, you will need to separate the real and imaginary parts of each 
equation, giving 12 coupled differential equations.  To see these, expand eq. 4 
using  bk = Re[bk] + i Im[bk], and then separate the real and imaginary variables. 

 
(d)  Plot the time-dependent displacement of the nuclear coordinate, 

( )R t
(e)  Show the wavepacket launched by the shock wave, by plotting the probability 
amplitude for the nuclear wavefunction for the system P(r,t) = 〈Ψ(r,t)|Ψ(r,t)〉 
before, during, and after the compression. 
(f)  Estimate the power in the compression pulse. 
(g) Describe the role of the compression pulse width and amplitudes on the efficiency 
of vibrational up-pumping.

3.   Electronic excitation by electron scattering.   
  An electron passes by a He+ (Z=2) atom with 
a velocity v in the y direction.  At the time of 
closest approach, (t = 0), the ion is separated 
by a distance B (the impact parameter) along 
the x direction.  At any other time, the 
distance between the atom and electron is

Through Coulombic interactions as it passes 
by, the electron will act to mix the electronic 
states of the atom, which we will take to be 
real hydrogen-like wavefunctions.  
 
 
The time dependent Hamiltonian for this problem could be written in terms of the 
Hamiltonians for the atom and for the electron, as well as a time-dependent 
( )
.  Let’s consider how a weak 
interaction between them

interaction mixes the atomic eigenstates. This is an appropriate picture if 
|V(t)|<<|Hatom|.  To just consider the induced changes to the electronic wavefunction 
of the atom, we will write 
 
 

( )

and treat the problem in the interaction picture. We will assume that we prepare the 
atom at t = −∞ in the 1s orbital [b1s(−∞) = 1] and follow time dependent interactions 
that couple the 1s state to the n = 2 states. This would hold for relatively large impact 
parameters, so we will assume that the separation of the free electron from He+ 
nucleus and the He+ electron are approximately equal:   R
.  We can

take the frame of reference to be the atomic nucleus. 
 
(a)  Write out an explicit form of the Hamiltonian in eq. 7 in terms of kinetic and 
potential energies involved.  Assume that you can neglect the kinetic energy of 
the nucleus. Neglect any interactions between the particles other than the 
Coulomb terms (for instance spin).

To evaluate these matrix elements, we choose the nucleus as the frame of 
reference and write the problem in terms of spherical coordinates.  Write the

Here  R ( t ) and r  are vectors from the nucleus to the electrons, but R(t) and r are 
scalars. 

Evaluate all of the matrix elements. Show their dependence on the impact 
parameter, the Bohr radius a0, electron velocity, and time.   

 
(c)  Using the methods developed in problem 2, numerically solve the coupled 
differential equations for the time-dependent interactions between the electronic 
states.  Show the time-dependent probabilities of occupying the n=1 and n=2 
states, from large negative times to large positive times.  You can take the 
energy of the 1s state to be En=1=0 and the energies of the degenerate n=2 states 
to be En=2 = 82,000 cm-1.  To start, choose B = 2a0.  Chose what you would call 
relatively low or high velocities for these parameters. What time point would 
effectively constitute t = −∞? Discuss the influence of the velocity and impact 
parameter on the observed time-dependence.  

 
(d)  Make sequential contour plots of the time-dependent electron probability 
density in the x-y plane for several times from t<0 to t>0. 

 
(e)  Compare the results in (c) with the results of first order perturbation theory.
