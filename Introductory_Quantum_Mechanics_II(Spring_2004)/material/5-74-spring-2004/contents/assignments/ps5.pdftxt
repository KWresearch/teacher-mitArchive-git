Photon Plucks 

The ﬁrst excited state of Ba is the metastable 6s5d 3D state.  Consider the J = MJ  = 3 component of 
3D 

|3D3  3 =  s0α d2α .

(cid:2)
A  photon  pluck  promotes  one  e−  via a ∆(cid:9) = ±1,  ∆m(cid:3)  = 0, ±1,  ∆s = ∆ms  =  0  transition.  If  the 
photon is linearly polarized along the z–direction, the selection rule is ∆m(cid:3)  = 0.  

A.	 What are all of the (cid:9)1m(cid:3)1 s1ms1 (cid:9)2m(cid:3)2 s2ms2  basis states accessible via a z–polarized photon pluck?

The only things not speciﬁed are the relative amplitudes within the 6snp Rydberg series, within

the 5dn
p Rydberg series, and for the 6snp series relative to the 5dn
p series.  These are given by 
the radial integrals

What  is  the  form  of  the  Ψ(t)  that  results  from  this  single-photon  pluck  of  Ba  �6s 5d 3D3  3 ? 
I  have  not  provided  suﬃcient  information  about  eigen–energies,  photon  center-frequency,  and 
photon pulse duration.  You should make reasonable choices for these quantities. 
The ionization threshold for the 6sn(cid:9) Rydberg series (n → ∞) is 42032·4 cm−1 , which is consid-
(cid:2)  → ∞)  at  46906·3 cm−1  (for  J  = 3/2).

Suppose  you  probe  the  coherent  superposition  state  from  part  D  with  a  detection  pulse  at  an 
energy just above the 6s∞(cid:9) limit but below the 5d∞(cid:9) limit.  You detect photo-ions as a function 
of delay between the excitation and detection pulses.  What will you see?  Which coherences will 
be detected by this pump/probe scheme and which coherences will be destroyed?

The  3P  states  of  the  n
p5d  and  np6s Rydberg  series  interact with  each  other  via  the  1/r12  in-

terelectronic repulsion operator.  The Kepler period of a Rydberg wavepacket  is proportional to 
−1 .  Owing to the diﬀerence in energy of the series limits, the isoenergetic members of the

are inside the ion-core.  If you could monitor the amplitude in the np6s wavepacket as a function 
of time, what would you expect to see?

For two-electron atoms 

HSO = ξ (r1 )(cid:2)1 · s1 + ξ (r2 )(cid:2)2 · s2 .

Hmhfs = [a(r1 )(cid:2)1 + a(r2 )(cid:2)2 + b(r1 )s1 + b(r2 )s2 ]  I.

Under special conditions (to be speciﬁed by you), HSO  and Hmhfs  simplify to

“Hmhfs” =  C (N , L, S, J )I J·

and Hmhfs
where N  refers to the electronic conﬁguration.  These simpliﬁed forms of HSO

Starting  from  the  137Ba 6s5d  3D3  level  (with  hyperﬁne  F –components  F  = 3/2, 5/2, 7/2,  and 
9/2  thermally  populated),  draw  a  level  diagram  on which  you  illustrate  all  of  the  allowed  ﬁne-
hyperﬁne transitions from 3D3  to 3PJ,F .  The rigorous selection rule for electric dipole transitions 
(a vector operator) is ∆F  = 0, ±1.  The nearly rigorous selection rules ∆J = 0, ±1, ∆L = 0, ±1, 
and ∆S = 0 may also be taken seriously here.

3DJ =3,F  transitions, you need to compute all of the relative transition amplitudes for the short-

All of the beat notes in your quantum beating signal are explicitly known half-integer multiples of

(cid:7)
a common factor with relative amplitudes controlled by  6d z np(cid:2) (cid:7)np z 5d(cid:2) times factors computed 
by you.  Would the relative intensities and phases of the beat notes be aﬀected if the pump and 
probe  lasers were polarized perpendicularly (i.e., x, z ) rather than parallel (i.e., z ,  z)?  Optional: 
compute and compare the beat patterns for probe (z ), pump (z ) to probe (x), pump (z ). 

D.	 As the principal quantum number of the 6snp 3P state increases, the spin-orbit coupling constant 
−3  but  the  contribution  of  the  6sms  spin-orbital  to  the  b(r1 )s1 ·I  hyperﬁne  term 
decreases  as  n
remains constant.  At some point the hyperﬁne splittings become larger than the spin-orbit split-
tings.  What happens to the level structure and quantum beat amplitudes?  A qualitative answer 
is acceptable.  HINT: The hyperﬁne structure of Ba+  6s2S is highly relevant here.
