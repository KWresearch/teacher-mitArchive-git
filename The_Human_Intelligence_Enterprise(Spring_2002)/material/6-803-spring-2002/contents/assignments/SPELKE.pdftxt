Assignment  
Imagine that you are a graduate student working in an Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. 
Your research supervisor says, roughly, “I would like you to go to this conference on 
infant perception to see what this stuff is all about. Put together a little trip report for me 
when you get back.” Because the conference is to be held in Sveti Stefan, a beautiful 
medieval town, converted into a resort, on the Adriatic Sea, you instantly agree.  
Unfortunately, because of the time difference and the 9:30 am start time, you sleep 
through all the sessions.  
Fortunately, the conference organizers have prepared a proceedings. Also, just after the 
conference concludes, you meet some attendees in a bistro, who tell you that the only talk 
worth going to was the one delivered by Spelke, and that talk was highly congruent with 
the material in her paper. You are saved.  

• 

•  Produce the requested trip report. Start with something like "The conference 
involved little of interest to people working in Artificial Intelligence, except for 
the paper presented by Spleke..." Use either a slide show or ordinary prose format, 
whichever you like. Include salient ideas and your personal assessment overall.  
In your report, be sure to define in a few words Spelke's principles of cohesion, 
continuity, and contact.  
•  Also, identify the big surprise in Spelke's descriptions of infant expertise.  
•  Also, recall in your report that Sajit Rao asserts that he was much inspired and 
guided by Spelke's work. Speculate on how that inspiration and guidance might 
have shaped what Rao actually did.  

When you think you are finished, go back over your report to be sure that you have 
provided a few interesting, specific details.
