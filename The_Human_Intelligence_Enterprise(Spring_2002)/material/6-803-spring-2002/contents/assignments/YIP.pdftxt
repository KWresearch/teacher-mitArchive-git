Paper  
Yip, K., Sussman, G. J. “Sparse Representations for Fast, One-Shot Learning”, MIT 
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Paper, November 1997. 
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
You are to write an MIT press release for the Yip/Sussman work.  
Your press release should have the elements suggested in the sample below, including the 
usual jouralistic requirement for who, what, where, when, and how, all of which are 
illustrated in the first paragraph.  
Include in your press release, and mark for my easy identification, the following:  

•  Your choices for the vision, contribution, and what was actually done.  
•  Your choices for salient, surprise, and slogan.  
•  Your sense of the potential impact of the work.  
•  Your sense of whether the paper is about learning or phonology.  

Note: This assignment seems to invite humor, and if you feel like writing something 
funny, do so. But also be sure to take the paper seriously, and interdigitate a serious 
assessement with your jokes.

STUDENTS DEMONSTRATE COLD FUSION TO SATISFY SUBJECT 
REQUIREMENT  

CAMBRDIGE, MA, April 1, 2001. Charles Vest, president of MIT, announced that a 
group of computer-science students has just found a way to produce abundant energy 
through cold fusion at essentially zero cost. Dr. Vest indicated that the student group 

serendipitously stumbled across the essential ideas during the past month while working 
on a term project.  

Blah, blah, blah, ... vision, contribution, what was actually done, salient, surprise, slogan, 
potential impact, ... blah, blah, blah  

A spokesperson for the student group explained that some of the members were upset that 
they would not benefit financially from the discovery, inasmuch as one of the group's 
members had once visited the MIT Media Laboratory, which requires that all visitors sign 
a complex intellectual property agreement. Professor Nicholas Negroponte, founder of 
the Media laboratory, explains that innovation is not limited to science and technology. 
"Law is the next frontier for creative minds," he said, "The transitivity clause in our 
intellectual property agreement soon will apply to 95% of the earth's population."  

According to reliable sources, other members of the group worried about whether their 
project would be viewed as A-level work by their instructor Professor Patrick H. 
Winston. As the project was presented to him, he was heard to say, "I don't care how 
important it is, it's not AI." Then he added, "Anyway, the slides had too many words."  

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology educates men and women of high potential 
through degree programs in engineering, science, business, architecture, and the 
humanities. The Institute is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
