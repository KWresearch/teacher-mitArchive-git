Paper  
Gentner, D., Markman, A.B. “Structure Mapping in Analogy and Similarity”, American 
Psychologist, American Psychological Association, January 1997, 45-56. 
Assignment  
Part A  

In class we discussed report format, and I explained that some committees write reports 
that consist of slides supplemented by explanatory legends, with the legends capturing 
what a presenter would say or adding useful detail beyond what is captured in the slides. 
The legends range in length from a sentence to a page, tending to peak at a half page.  
Prepare a few slides, with supplementary legends as needed of not more than a few 
sentences, for the paper. Include in your slides, or legends, or both, a demonstration that 
you have read and understood the paper by providing answers to the following questions:  

•  What is the difference between similarity and analogy?  
•  Are similarity judgments symmetric?  
•  Given a situation for which you desire a precedent, is your mind more likely to 
retrieve a precedent base on object descriptions or interobject relations?  

Part B  

With a big red pencil, or equivalent, identify salient, slogan, symbol, and surprise (if 
any), in your slides or legends.  

Other Things to Think About  

Think about the following, but you need not write up your answers:  

•  How could Ullman's stream/counterstream idea be put to use in analogy?  
•  Why is learning about how Macbeth is like Hamlet unhelpful when learning about 
how electrical circuits are like water pipes?  
•  How do we know what someone means when they say that someone is like a fox?
