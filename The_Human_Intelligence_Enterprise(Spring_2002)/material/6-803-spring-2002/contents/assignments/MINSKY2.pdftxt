Assignment  
You may find the questions in this assignment highly interrelated. Think about all 
the questions before you write answers for any. Also, you may choose to interdigitate 
your answers to multiple questions, but if so, clearly indicate that you are doing so.  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  You are David Marr, and you have just read the K-lines paper. A close collegue 
and like minded thinker, Tomasso Poggio, has heard about the K-lines paper, but 
not read it. Compose an email message, of the sort you think Marr would have 
written, describing the paper and assessing its contribution. You message should 
be in the style of a biased abstract, perhaps highly biased.  
•  Explain how the K-line paper suggests a shift in Minsky's thinking since he wrote 
Steps toward Artificial Intelligence.  
•  Describe similarities and differences between the ideas and/or style of the K-lines 
paper and Ullman's Stream and Counter-Stream paper.  
•  Few, if any, have claimed to have implemented Minsky's K-Lines proposal. 
Speculate on why. Include in your speculation an assessment of what is hard to do 
in AI research.
