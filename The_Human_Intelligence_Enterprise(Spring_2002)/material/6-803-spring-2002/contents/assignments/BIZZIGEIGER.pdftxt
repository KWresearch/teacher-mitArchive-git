Assignment  
The piece de resistance is the Geiger paper. You can skim the Bizzi paper. 
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  The subject of dyslexia turns up in a conversation you are having with friend who 
happens to be dyslexic. “Well,” says the friend, “I recently heard about an article 
appearing in that eminent scientific journal, The Boston Globe (“Abnormal Brain 
Patterns Indicate Dyslexia Has Physical Explanation”, by Richard Saltus, Globe 
Staff), that says MRI studies on dyslexics demonstrate that my brain is, 
regretably, defective, and that accounts for my inability to read.” You read the 
article, via the link, and having read it, write a letter to the scientists mentioned, 
commenting on the conclusions reached, based on what you have learned in 
Geiger's paper. Because you presume that the authors have not read the Geiger 
paper, include a V-S-N-C summary. Also, plainly state the goal are you trying to 
achieve in your letter. Identify V-S-N-C and the goal; be prepared to be paraded 
through building 10 in Winston's next dream if you forget.  
•  You are asked by a frog for help in competitive jumping. You have heard, from a 
reliable source, that it takes longer to relax a muscle than it does to contract it, and 
you have read Bizzi's paper. Then, following one of the principles of knowledge 
engineering, you decide to watch the frog at practice. What would you 
particularly look for in the frog's approach to competitive jumping, and in its 
absense, recommend? Note: if the answer is not obvious, you may want to ask a 
track-and-field athlete for help on this one.
