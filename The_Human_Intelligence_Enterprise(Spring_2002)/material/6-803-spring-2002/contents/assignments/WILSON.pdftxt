Assignment  
You have decided you are so thrilled by 6.xxx, you will write a textbook covering the 
material. You arrange an appointment with Professor Winston, during which you go into 
such matters as dealing with publishers, handling reviewers, structuring royalty rates, and 
handling international sales. Winston mutters something about maybe talking about the 
same sort of stuff in class at some point.  
Then, as you turn to the writing of the book itself and Winston explains that it is 
extremely important to do a good job on the chapter openings. Unfortunately, your time 
is up just when he is about to explain the standard components in his chapter-opening 
template.  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  Reverse engineer the sample chapter openings from the books Artificial 
Intelligence and On To Java and exhibit the slots that seem to constitues 
Winston's chapter-opening frame, where "slot" and "frame" are used in the 6.034 
sense, whatever that means. Add any others that seem especially important to you.  
•  Write an introduction to a chapter on Spelke's work, as reported in the Hermer-
Vazquez–Spelke–Katsnelson paper, demonstrating use of whatever frame slots 
seem appropriate for the material.  
•  Write an introduction to a chapter on Wilson's work, as reported in the Wilson–
McNaughton paper, demonstrating use of whatever frame slots seem appropriate 
for the material.
