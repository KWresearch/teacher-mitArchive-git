Science, 1982, 205- 254. 
WRT: 1.75 hours  
The Feldman and Ballard paper contains a great deal of soporific detail. Look at some of 
the detail carefully, to get the flavor, and skim the rest.  
Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  The Feldman and Ballard paper already has an abstract (Four or five sentences, 
just before the section titled Introduction; not the 2 1/3 page commentary, written 
by somebody else, which you can ignore completely). Identify its principle 
defects, and rewrite it, correcting those defects.  
•  Also, supply a conclusion, being sure to conform to classroom discussion about 
how to do conclusions.  
•  Comment on the argument F & B offer, in section 1, against symbols.  
•  Speculate on how knowledge would have to be expressed in a connectionist-
inspired system.
