Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
Imagine that you are Mriganka Sur. It is 1990. You have just published Cross-modal 
plasticity ..., and you are seeking financial support for the work that eventually leads to 
the paper eventually published in 2000, but that work still lies in the future.  
You learn that Winston, during a period of temporary insanity, has taken a leave from 
MIT to work for two years at the National Science Foundation, where he has started a 
program titled “Nouveau Neuroscience.”  

•  You decide to write a so-called letter proposal to Winston. Construct a list 
defining what you think you should accomplish in your letter so as to persuade 
Winston to ask for a formal proposal.  
•  Write a letter based on your list.
