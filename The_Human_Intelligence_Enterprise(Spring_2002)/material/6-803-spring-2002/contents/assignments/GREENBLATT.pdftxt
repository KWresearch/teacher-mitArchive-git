Assignment  
The piece de resistance is the computational part of Vaina and Greenblatt. You can skim 
the Sutherland paper.  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
There is too much to read, particularly if you are interested in multiple fields. 
Accordingly, you decide to start a new journal named The MIT Alumni Reader's 
Electronic Digest, which you expect to go by the nom de guerre, The Reader's Digest. 
The idea is to produce each month, in electronic form, in a section titled Steps toward 
Visions, a half-dozen or so half-page reviews of articles appearing in Science, Nature, and 
other top-drawer scientific journals. There is to be a section titled-Hero of the Month, in 
which a randomly chosen MIT professor identifies a few of his/her favorite classics for 
the half-page treatment.  
Curiously, Winston is the first professor randomly selected, and he selects the thread 
memory and courage papers. Your job is to write the two half-page synopses, duly 
attending to V–S–N, contributions, and detail. According to journal policy, you are also 
to offer your views on who should read the unabridged article and what they would get 
out of reading that beyond what they get from your summary.
