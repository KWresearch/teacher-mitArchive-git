Assignment 
This assignment is due in one or two years, as circumstances dictate. 

You have just decided to apply for something that requires you to submit 
recommendations. Fortunately, you know you can rely on your UROP supervisor to help 
out, and your advisor, once prompted with your name, will scribble out something pro 
forma and pretty much useless, as all s/he can do is recite your transcript and say that s/he 
has never observed you do drugs in her/his presence. Alas, the application asks for three 
recommendations. 

Fortunately, you took 6.xxx, so you know Winston has read a lot of stuff you have 
written and maintains a dossier of your 6.xxx work. Also, the dossier is augmented from 
time to time as you send him notes describing how you are progressing through life and 
how 6.xxx has been of use. Accordingly, you send Winston the following note: 

Professor Winston: 

I am applying for graduate school/law school/medical school/a faculty job/etc. 

Do you think you know me well enough, from my 6.xxx work, to write a favorable 

recommendation for such a position? If so, I append a few talking points, which I  

think will save you some time and strengthen what you can say. Also, if you can  

help, I will, of course, arrange to come by for a chat and drop off copies of all the 

material I am submitting.


Your job is to supply the talking points in bulletized form. Mention gradepoint average 
along with any explanation you would like to have delivered if it is not high. Explain 
UROP work, if any, with special emphasis on what was fun. Describe extracurricular 
activities and achievements, if any. Explain passions and goals. Detail reasons for 
wanting the position applied for explaining why it will be fun while you do it, why you 
will be a better person for having done it, why the world will be better off if you do it, 
and how having you will enhance the reputation of the place that takes you on. 

Then, in a separately marked section, supply an explanation of characteristics the 
deciding organization is known to look for, how you fit the profile, and how that fit might 
be expressed or emphasized. 

Then, in a separately marked section, supply bullets that will be useful to Winston in 
understanding you, even if the bulletized material would be unlikely to be used explicitly 
in Winston's letter. In this category, you might mention heroes (possibly in multiple 
categories), how you plan to change the world, most influential book, most enjoyable 
book, most influential subject (other than 6.xxx), most enjoyable subject (other than 
6.xxx), favorite music, high-impact experiences, and so on. 

In all sections, remember to use the press release style: 

•  Most important things first 
•  Write in a way that chunks can be used with minimal rephrasing
