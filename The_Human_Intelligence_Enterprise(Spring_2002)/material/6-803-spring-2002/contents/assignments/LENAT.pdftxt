Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  Comment on the relation between the paper's title and its content.  
•  Your boss, Scrooge McDuck, noted venture capitalist, has heard that Lenat is a 
pretty smart person. He orders you by EMail to read something he has written. 
You stumble across Lenat's agent paper, from which you learn all you know about 
his technology, its potential applications, and Lenat himself. Compose an EMail 
message to Scrooge with your evaluation of Lenat's prospects and 
recommendations for follow up, if any. Pay particular attention to Lenat's criteria 
for early CYC applications and what a venture capitalist would think of them. 
Note that VCs are typically quite binary, so I expect you to be hard over, on 
either the positive side or the negative side.
