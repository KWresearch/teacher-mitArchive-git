On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
A quad chart consists of  

•  A logo labeled with a slogan  

together with three collections of bullets with the following titles  

Impact  
• 
•  Why novel  
•  Milestones  

Construct a quad chart for Yuret's work. Use your imagination to concoct milestones for 
future work; try to include combinations of Yuret's idea with other salient ideas in the 
subject. Use bracketed text to explain, if good slide technique makes your meaning 
obscure.  
Be absolutely sure your impact bullets are focused on practical applications, not 
scientific progress.
