Paper  
Borchardt, G. “Causal Reconstruction”, MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Memo 
No. 1403, February 1993. 
 
WRT: 2.0 hours  
General Instructions  
Slide elements should be extremely terse; where you think explanation for me is needed, 
of the sort you would provide orally in a talk, enclose what you write in parentheses.  
You may borrow freely from illustrations that appear in the paper. Do not fight with 
slide making software or fret about not having such software. You may cut and 
paste or roughly trace material from the paper or provide your own rough sketches 
of what you have in mind.  
Assignment  
•  Create about six key slides for this work, including the following:  
o  A slide labeled Vision (or Context).  
o  A slide labeled Contributions.  
o  A slide labeled Key Example.  

The Key Example slide is to show a sketch cum transistion-space description 
of a person walking to a ball lying on the ground, picking it up, and carrying 
it off. You are to use Borchardt's vocabulary in your description (A, D, delta, 
+, -, not A, not D, not delta, not +, and not -).  

Identify in your slides those elements that you think would best serve as the 
following:  
o  The slogan (handle, verbal)  
o  The symbol (handle, visual)  

You may find what you want in the paper or you may have to invent what you 
need.  

Identify in your slides or express in a sentence or two the following:  
o  The salient  
o  The surprise  

You may find what you want in the paper or you may have to invent what you 
need.
