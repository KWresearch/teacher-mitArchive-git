In the table below, "Communication assignment" refers to the form that the
student's written assignment should take. For example, if the assignment refers
to "press release," the student's submission should be in the form of a press
release. "Communication hors d'oeuvre" refers to the introductory first half
hour of class that is spent discussing communication heuristics.
Some assignments may refer to "WRT," which stands for "Winston's Reading Time"
â the length of time the professor needed to read the paper, which students
can use to estimate their reading time, once they have calibrated themselves
against the professor on the first few assignments.
