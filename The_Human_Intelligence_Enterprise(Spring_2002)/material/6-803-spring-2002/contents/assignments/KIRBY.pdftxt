Paper  
Kirby, S., “Language Evolution without Natural Selection”, Edinburgh Occasional 
Papers in Linguistics, April 1998. 
WRT: 1.75 hours  
General Instructions  
Slide elements should be terse; where you think explanation for me is needed, of the 
sort you would provide orally in a talk, enclose what you write in parentheses.  
You may borrow freely from illustrations that appear in the paper. Do not fight with 
slide making software or fret about not having such software. You may cut and 
paste or roughly trace material from the paper or provide your own rough sketches 
of what you have in mind.  
If practicable, provide your slides two or three to the page.  
Assignment  
•  Create about six key slides for this work, including a first and final slide and 
whatever technical material in between that you think is most essential.  
•  Supply a list of titles for the slides you would use in a 10-15 slide presentation, 
including the slides you actually prepare.
