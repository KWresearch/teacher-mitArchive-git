Assignment  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
You are scheduled to have breakfast with Vest. You have heard he is interested in Marr 
and his legacy. Prepare yourself for the meeting by writing out a bulletized list of three or 
four items of the sort that Marr might have included in a final section labeled 
Contributions in his paper. Remember that a contribution can be a better-framed 
problem, a problem solution, a methodology, a point of view, a conclusion—anything 
that plainly constitutes an advancement of knowledge.  
Further prepare yourself for your breakfast with Vest by outlining what you would say 
should Vest ask the following questions:  

•  Vest says: "I understand Marr is critical of AI research. Why?"  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Minsky would think of Marr's paper?"  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Marr would think of Minsky's paper, Steps ...?"  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Marr would think about Brooks's work?  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Marr would think about connectionism?  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Marr would think Deep Blue?  
•  Vest says: "What do you think Chomsky would think of Marr's paper?  

Finally, list two or three other questions you think you should anticipate.
