Assignment  
On part of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
On a total of one half of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with 
standard interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  List informally, in bullets, the vision, the steps, and the news you would use in 
constructing an abstract/introduction as if the paper consisted only of sections 6, 
7, and 8.  
•  List informally, in bullets, the contributions you would use in constructing a 
conclusion for Brooks's paper as if the paper consisted only of sections 6, 7, and 
8.  

Be prepared to discuss the following in class:  

•  Having written an abstract/introduction and conclusion for sections 6, 7, and 8, 
think about whether Brooks has demonstrated the point he makes in the first two 
sentences in his abstract.  
•  Brooks argues—both near the beginning and near the end of the paper—that 
language and problem solving must be easy, relative to moving around and 
surviving, on the ground that evolution has spent hardly any time on language and 
reasoning. Be ready to argue for or against Brooks's position.  
•  Brooks argues against simulated worlds, because he believes it is too easy to be 
led astray by our introspections. Minsky argues against building real robots, 
because he believes most/all that can be learned from creatures can be learned by 
operating them in simulation, so building real robots is a tremendous waste of 
time. How do their views on intelligence contribute to their positions on 
simulation? What is your position?
