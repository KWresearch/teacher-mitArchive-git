Paper  
Rao, S. “Visual Routines and Attention”, Ph.D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, February 1998. 
  
You are to read the first and final chapters. Look through the rest, whatever that means.  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  
You are Rao. You have just finished your thesis, and you think it would be a good idea to 
send a copy to Professor Famous Winner, a noted authority on vision research. You know 
that Winner is busy, and unlikely to read a word of your thesis, but you hope nevertheless 
that he will read your cover letter.  
Construct a suitable cover letter, including in it the following:  

•  Vision, step(s), and news.  
•  An enumeration of your contributions. In one of your items, include a word such 
as complement, contest, supersede, extend, refine, or support to explain the 
relation between your work and Ullman's and explain your word choice.  
•  An explanation of the influence of Winston and Brooks, as reflected in the first 
and final chapters, explaining which was written for Winston and which for 
Brooks.  
•  An explanation of the extent to which your work is grounded, directly or 
indirectly, if at all, in system neuroscience and cognitive science.  

Also, separately but still on one page, explain which comes first in the first chapter: the 
discussion of motivation or the discussion of accomplishment? What is the principle 
danger associated with the order given?  
Finally, think about the following:  
Suppose Rao is your student. You admire his work and ask all your colleagues to attend 
his thesis defense, which is terrible. No VSN. No identifiable contributions. No symbol, 
slogan, salient, or surprise. You know this has to be fixed. Eventually, Rao will need a 
job and have to give “job talks.” Hence the questions: what do you tell Rao about his 
talk? When do you tell him?
