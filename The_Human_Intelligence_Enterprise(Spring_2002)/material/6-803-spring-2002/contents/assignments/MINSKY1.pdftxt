Paper  
Minsky, M. Steps toward Artificial Intelligence. 
WRT: 2.0 hours  
 
This paper is a slog in parts, as Minsky is often telegraphic or vague or both in his 
explanations, because this is, after all, a survey of nascent ideas. Do not get bogged down 
in the occasional mathematics and obscure examples. Be sure to read the first few and the 
last few pages when you are fresh.  
Assignment  
On one sheet of paper:  

•  Construct two-level broken-glass summaries for Turing's paper and for Minsky's 
paper.  

On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  Discuss similarities and differences in the views expressed by Turing and Minsky. 
Include remarks on how their research programs coincide and differ. Use your 
summaries as a guide.  
•  Recall the blocks-world arch-learning program described in 6.034. Comment on 
the degree to which it is anticipated in Minsky's section on learning.  
Identify the strengths and weaknesses of Minsky's conclusion and supply your 
own conclusion without the weak points.  

• 

Also, be prepared to Identify the strengths and weaknesses of Minsky's introduction in 
class discussion.
