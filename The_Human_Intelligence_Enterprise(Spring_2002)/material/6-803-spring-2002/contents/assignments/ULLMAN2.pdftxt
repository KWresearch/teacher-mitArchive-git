Assignment  
You may find the questions in this assignment highly interrelated. Think about all 
the questions before you write answers for any. Also, you may choose to interdigitate 
your answers to multiple questions, but if so, clearly indicate that you are doing so.  
On a total of one side of one sheet of paper, using 10 pt type or larger, with standard 
interline spacing and margins, respond to all the following:  

•  Write an abstract for this work. Write as if you are the author.  

•  Write an conclusion for this work centered on a bulletized list of contributions. 
Write as if you are the author.  

•  Mark up your abstract, showing where you have included the vision, the step, and 
the news. Be sure your abstract includes an enumeration of the basic operations 
that Ullman proposes as visual-routine components.  
•  Support or contest the following: Ullman claims that our low-level visual 
attention is attracted to odd-man-out locations, such as those that have a 
distinguishing color, or shape, or combination of shape and color.  
•  Support or contest the following: Ullman believes that the vision system interacts 
with the language system as if through a diode. That is, information flows from 
the visual system to the language system, but little, if any flows back.  
•  Support or contest the following: If you are going to study vision, then you might 
as well study pigeons as people, because the questions answerable by the pigeon 
visual system are the same as the questions answerable by the human visual 
system. That is, the pigeon's view of the world is the same as ours.
