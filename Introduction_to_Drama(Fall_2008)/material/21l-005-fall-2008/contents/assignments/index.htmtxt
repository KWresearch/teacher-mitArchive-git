***** Course Assignments *****
   1. Attendance and participation in all classes. (30%) More than 1 absence or
      repeated lateness will affect the final grade. This also includes:

      Two written weekly questions/comments, on one or more reading from the
      week's assignment, directed toward the class for the purposes of
      stimulating class discussion, and pointing toward particular passages of
      the reading under discussion. These should consist of a lengthy
      paragraph, approximately Â½ page, single-spaced, and must include a
      passage of 5-10 lines from the text you are discussing in each question/
      comment. Due Tuesdays in class (not accepted late).
   2. One assigned close reading of a passage from Medea, 5-pp. This will be
      revised. (15%)
   3. One 5-page paper (20%) in which you will develop one of your comments/
      questions on a play (other than Medea) into a short paper discussing your
      ideas about the text in more detail, with particular reference to the
      language of the text. This paper is meant to be thoughtful rather than
      argumentative, and to enable you to further develop your close reading
      skills.
   4. Paper (15%): an essay review of 5 pages on a drama or performance piece
      you have seen this term. We will do some preparation for this assignment
      in class. Sorry, no late papers are accepted.
   5. Presentation (20%): 3 students, 15 minutes: Present one playwright not
      covered in the course and argue why it should be included. Use one work
      to illustrate the playwright/performer's major concerns. Or a 5-minute
      scene from one of the plays studied in the course followed by a
      discussion of performance choices and methods.
Note: Group must demonstrate that work has been distributed evenly among its
members. A proposal of your project, listing participants and describing your
presentation in paragraph form, is due by Week #10.
