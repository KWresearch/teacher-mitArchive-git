The eponymous protagonist of Euripides’ Medea 1  perfectly epitomizes the 

proverbial ‘woman scorned’. Betrayed by her husband Jason for whose sake she has 

abandoned her own country, Medea swears to “make dead bodies” (370) of her enemies. 

The play chronicles the ensuing bloodbath, and is as fraught with complex themes as it is 

with grisly detail. As Medea’s tragic plight unfolds, the reader is led to ponder issues of 

life and death, male and female gender roles, loyalty, and a host of other thematic 

concerns that lurk within the dark passions of the play. This essay seeks to explore, by 

critical examination of a section (130-165) of the text, the ways in which these themes, 

and the often intricate relationships between them, are elucidated. 

Enter the chorus, whose role in Greek theater is to comment on, rather than to 

participate in, the dramatic action of a piece. Stage directions in this play specify ‘a 

chorus of Corinthian women’ – a choice which unapologetically foregrounds gender and 

which also serves to highlight the dynamic associations between the chorus, the nurse and 

Medea herself. To the extent that all three of these characters/character functions are 

explicitly female, they can be thus categorized, and in a sense, be considered allies and/or 

equals. The chorus, after all, does arrive to inquire about the “the sad wife” (148) and 

attempt to console her, as any friend would. To the nurse, however, Medea is “mistress” 

(138) indicating the former’s inferior social status as slave. By equating these two 

characters on the basis of their gender, the text subtly suggests that to be woman is to be 

slave, a point more explicitly expressed elsewhere in Medea’s views on marriage: “it is 

required/For us to buy a husband […]/A master” (230-32). Similarly, Medea can be

differentiated from the chorus based on her origin; she is “Colchis’ wretched daughter” 

(131), and therefore an outsider to Corinthian society. The chorus only hears her cry from 

“within” (133) the court, thus spatially separating them from Medea, whom we can 

assume is ‘without’. Ironically, the chorus itself, because it functions peripherally and 

necessarily cannot participate in the unfolding of events, is like Medea (and further, like 

us) in its ‘otherness’. From these and other considerations emerges a gestalt, a network of 

inextricable relations between the classifications ‘slave’, ‘woman’ and ‘foreigner’, that 

persists within the larger context of the play as a whole and informs reader response to its 

central character. 

Enter Medea; or more accurately, her voice. That she is introduced by her absence 

reinforces the nihilistic strains that course through this play. Medea never really exists 

within the space of this text, as she is twice exiled and consequently “utterly lost” (275) 

with no sense of family or community: “I have no mother or brother, nor any relation” 

(255). The chorus, in its first few lines, unwittingly answers the question ‘why’. It refers 

to Medea as “daughter” (131) and to the nurse as “mother” (132), highlighting some of 

the roles Medea plays as woman. Notably, these are the same roles she betrays with her 

acts of murder that include patricide and infanticide: “…I shall kill my own children” 

(776). Given her loathing of Jason and the fact that she is replaced by the new bride, she 

also obviously fails as “wife” (148) and thus effectively severs her moorings to any 

recognizable social construct. She inflicts upon herself the very wrongs she laments and 

tries to avenge. 

And lament she does. She asks rhetorically, “Oh, what use have I now for life?” 

(143) and as readers we answer involuntarily, ‘none’, sinking with her even as we do,

into abysmal hopelessness and despair. “That lightning from heaven would split my 

head” (142) is a hyperbolic restatement of the less dramatic but more ambiguous “I 

would find my release in death” (144). As the first statement exaggerates Medea’s death 

wish to spectacular proportions, it simultaneously undermines it because the odds of the 

described phenomenon actually occurring are nil. Further, the second statement begs the 

question ‘whose death’. Medea does indeed “leave hateful existence behind” (145) in the 

form of her (also) “hateful husband” (162) and all he represents. ‘Hateful’ here could 

describe either the feelings he evokes in her (‘exciting hate’ 2 ) or Jason’s own 

‘malignancy’ and ‘repulsiveness’ 3 . Medea herself is, however, still very much alive in the 

corporeal sense at the end of the play. This fact is ironic because after destroying both 

loved ones and enemies, she is the one left behind in the wake of her murderous rampage. 

Like Sophocles’ Oedipus, Medea achieves her particular ‘non-existence’ or ‘death’ by 

killing others (homicidal suicide, if you will), and ultimately, in exile, having failed at 

being daughter, sister, mother, wife or loyal citizen. The parallelism between lines 143 

and 144, ending “…life” and “…death” respectively, structurally highlights the 

aforementioned dichotomy, but reminds us that the boundary between life and death is 

more fluid than it may seem. Medea basically dies ‘a living death’4 . 

The grim inevitability in question is euphemistically referred to by the chorus as 

“that appalling rest” (150), so called because although it mimetically recalls sleep or rest, 

death’s absolute permanence, its “final end” (151), terrifies. Thus in retrospect, the 

chorus’ earlier enquiry about Medea, “… is she not yet/At rest” (132-3) can be read both

as concern for her wellbeing, and impatience for her to die. Although the first 

interpretation fits better with the superficial positioning of the chorus as Medea’s ally, the 

second cannot be ignored, especially since the chorus is Corinthian, and Medea not. 

Like the “double gates/Of the court” (133-4) which simultaneously demarcate 

‘within’ and ‘without’, several other choices the text makes function in such a two-fold 

manner as the already discussed pun on ‘rest’. When the chorus hears “her cry” (134), we 

cannot help but wonder what is meant: the noun – a detached cry issued forth by Medea, 

or the verb – the physical act of Medea sobbing, this latter of which makes her sadness 

more immediate and affecting because it presents a familiar image. Whatever the case 

may be, the chorus sibilantly expresses condolences, “I am sorry/For the sorrow of this 

home” (134-5) and then proceeds to fish for gossip in true womanly fashion, “O, say, 

what has happened?” (135) The serpentine connotations of the alliteration, coupled with 

the fact that ‘double’ sometimes means ‘duplicitous’, again makes us doubt the supposed 

good-intentions of the chorus. 

‘Home’ as used above means more than just the house or “room” (140) to which 

Medea, in grief, has confined herself. It is a metonymy that represents family unity and 

the institution of marriage that forms its foundation. When the nurse responds “there is no 

home” (136), she essentially paraphrases her earlier statement “love is diseased” (16). 

Medea’s love for Jason is now turned to hatred because he has “betrayed both her bed 

and her marriage” (205). ‘Bed’ itself is another metonymy that symbolizes the physical 

relationship between a man and his wife. For his treachery, for giving “honor/To another 

woman’s bed” (154-5), Medea prays that Jason, “his bride and all their palace [will be] 

shattered” (162). The use of ‘shattered’ suggests that this new alliance is already fragile,

like glass. Medea suffers the same ill fate she prays for, but she uses ‘palace’ instead of 

‘home’ to emphasize that this new alliance is a “royal wedding” (137), one that has 

political implications for Jason. In the same way “my country” (164), for Medea, 

encapsulates her origins, her sense of belonging, her role as citizen and all the other ties 

she is freed from when she is exiled. 

Medea prays this request for vengeance to Themis, goddess of justice, and to 

Artemis virgin goddess of fertility. By so doing, she aligns herself, not with slaves or 

foreigners, but with goddesses, who although they are female, are powerful and not 

subject to the social frameworks that govern Medea’s world, in which women are 

hierarchically inferior. The invocation of Artemis is also ironic because rather than 

nurture them, Medea takes away the lives of her own children, contradicting in the worst 

possible way, the necessarily (as yet) female condition of fertility and pursuant childbirth. 

Commenting on this text’s preoccupation with pairs, dichotomy, things that both 

are and are not, is an interesting way to end this endeavor because not only are these 

ideas pervasive in the play, they aid in our understanding of the characters, and inform 

our judgment of their actions. “Earth and Heaven” (146), life and death, male and female, 

slave and master, insider and outsider, honor and dishonor, true and false, even the two 

children Medea slays could be considered functions, all of which serve to show that as 

human beings, we are, at the very core, “split” (141), an assertion that reverberates with 

Freudian echoes. Medea is neither good nor bad; she is both, she is human.
