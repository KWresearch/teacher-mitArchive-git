***** Course Description *****
Drama might be described as a game played with something sacred. It tells
stories that go right to the heart of what people believe about themselves. And
it is enacted in the moment, which means it has an added layer of interpretive
mystery and playfulness, or "theatricality." This course will explore theater
and theatricality across periods and cultures, through intensive engagement
with texts and with our own readings.
***** Course Goals *****
At the end of the course, the student will have a general overview of dramatic
movements and ideas across countries and historical periods, a sense of how to
write about these ideas in relation to specific texts, and a sense of why drama
matters to them.

***** MIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism *****
Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a
serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who
plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will
forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all
information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated
in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken
from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations
from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own
work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the
style guides available at the Writing_and_Communication_Center and the MIT_Web
site_on_Plagiarism.
