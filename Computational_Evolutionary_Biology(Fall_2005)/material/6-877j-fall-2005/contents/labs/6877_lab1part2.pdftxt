Laboratory 1 Part 2: Forces of evolution 
The  purpose  of  this  part  of  the  lab  is  to  explore  the  effects  of  various  combinations  of  natural 
selection,  genetic  drift,  migration,  and  mutation.  For  partial  guidance,  we  present  several 
questions below  that you should specifically answer.  While we have not covered genetic drift in 
any  detail,  for  the  purposes  of  this  part,  you  can  envision  drift  to  be  the  effect  of  sampling 
variation when  the  population  size  is  less  than  ‘arbitrarily  large’.  The  object  of  this  exercise  is 
really  to  give  you  some  feel  for  how  gene  frequencies  are  expected  to  change  in  natural 
populations.  In Part  2a, we use Populus;  in Part 2b, we use  instead  the PopG model,  because  it 
allows one to more easily study the effect of migration along with all the other forces. 
Part 2a. Brief Synopsis of Assumptions and Questions 
For  all  simulations and  problems  in  this part make  the  following  assumptions. Assume  that  coat 
color  in  a  certain  strain  of  mice  is  controlled  by  one  gene  with  2  alleles.  One  allele  codes  for 
black coats (A allele), and  the other codes for white coats (a allele).  In  the population you find 3 
coat phenotypes: black (AA), gray (heterozygotes – Aa), and white (aa). Now, assume we have a 
stable  population  of mice  living  on  an  island with  no  owls.  For  convenience,  let’s  assume  that 
there  are  just  as many  “A”  alleles  in  the  population  as  “a”  alleles  (unless  otherwise  noted),  and 
the population starts out in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 
2a.1  Simulation  1.  Here we will  assume  we  have  a  very  large,  isolated mouse  population with 
no appreciable mutations in coat color alleles, and random mating.  When owls find  their way  to 
the  island,  it  suddenly  becomes  somewhat  more  dangerous  to  be  a  white  mouse.  We  want  to 
know how the mouse population evolves in response to this selection pressure.  How strong does 
selection have to be in order for there to be a response to it? 
1.  Open up Populus and go to the Selection Models.  Choose Selection on a Diallelic Autosomal 
Locus (by the way, what is a diallelic autosomal locus?). 
2.  Set plot options to “genotypic frequencies vs. t.” 
3.  Choose “Fitness” (rather than “Selection”).  Fitness is expressed relative to other genotypes. 
a.  For the fitness of AA, enter 1.0. 
b.  For the fitness of Aa, enter 1.0. 
c.  For the fitness of aa, enter 0.7 
4.  For initial conditions, choose one initial frequency and enter 0.5.  Set number of generations 
at 130. 
5.  Hit “view.” 
6.  If  you  select  “6  Initial  Frequencies”  the  plot  shows  p  vs.  t  for  6  computer-generated  initial 
frequencies  of  the  A  allele.  However,  you  can’t  plot  genotypic  frequencies  vs.  time  for  this 
choice.  If  you  want  to  examine  genotype  frequencies  for  different  initial  conditions,  you  must 
enter them one at a time (see question e below). 
7.  Save copies of the most relevant graphs.  (For your purposes – you won’t have to send them 
to me!)
8.  Answer the following questions. 
a.  Identify the lines representing the 3 genotypes.  What happens to each one? 
b.  If AA and Aa have equal fitness, why does the frequency of AA go up and the 
frequency of Aa go down? 

c.  If aa is bad, why doesn’t that genotype disappear entirely?  Why doesn’t the a allele 
disappear?  In fact, go back to the Plot Options box and check “p vs. t”.  This shows how 
the allele frequency (p = frequency of allele A) changes over time.  What do you see? 
d.  What does this simulation tell us about the relationship between fitness and genotypic 
frequency? 
e. Change the initial frequency of the A allele to 0.1 (leave everything else the same).  In 
other words, we’re assuming that for whatever reason, white mice outnumber dark mice 
on the island prior to the arrival of owls.  So, why does the aa line start so high and drop 
so fast?  Why does Aa increase, then decrease? 
g.  Plot “p vs. t” for this scenario.  What does this tell you about how selection can work? 
2a.2  Simulation  2.  Here  we  will  simulate  the  same  large,  isolated  population  of  mice  with  no 
appreciable  mutation  in  coat  color  alleles,  random  mating,  and  where  individuals  with  white 
coats  are  spotted  most  frequently  by  predators,  individuals  with  black  coats  are  the  next  most 
frequently  spotted,  and  gray  individuals  are  rarely  spotted  by  predators.  In  the  same  Populus 
model,  using Selection  on  a Diallelic Autosomal  Locus,  set  everything up  as  before,  except  that 
this time, set the fitness of the AA allele at 0.9 (with Aa at 1.0 and aa at 0.7). 
Questions: 
a.  What is the equilibrium condition? 
b.  What are the major differences between this simulation and the previous one? 

Part 2b. Systematic exploration of the forces – a summary study 
OK, now  that you’ve had some practice investigating  the basics we would  like to give you some 
feel  for  how  gene  frequencies  are  expected  to  change  in  natural  populations.  To  that  end,  we’d 
like  you  to  explore  the  effects  of  various  combinations  of  natural  selection,  genetic  drift, 
migration,  and mutation. For  this purpose,  you will  use  the PopG program  –  it  is not  as  flexible 
as  Populus,  but  it  does  one  thing  well:  one-locus,  two  allele  simulations,  with  selection, 
mutation, migration,  and drift.  Drift  is built-in because  you  specify  the population  size.  (Please 
refer to the web page cited for instructions on how to use PopG given in lab 1 part 1.) 
You  might  want  to  start  with  no  mutation  and  no  migration  and  look  at  the  effects  of  natural 
selection  including  overdominance,  as  suggested  below.  Then  perhaps  look  at  the  effect  of 
mutation  versus  selection.  You  may  also  want  to  examine  the  effect  of  genetic  drift  alone  by 
making all fitnesses equal, and  the sizes of  the other effects necessary  to have a noticeable effect 
on  the  outcome  in  the  face  of  drift.  Be  creative,  but  with  some  ability  to  compare  results  with 
other cases that differ  in useful ways.  After you’re done, write up what  you’ve found out  in 2-5 
pages.  To  provide  a  bit  of  framework,  we  pose  the  following  specific  questions,  which  you 
should address in your report.  You should make sure your report does answer each of them – but 
in  addition,  goes  beyond  just  a  point-by-point  answer  to  attempt  some  generalizations.  (In 
particular,  I  don’t  provide  any  focused  questions  on  drift  –  but  you  should  still  investigate  that 
and include a discussion in your report.) 
Selection 
Consider  a  number  of  populations  (8-10  is  fine)  that  have  their  population  size  (N)  being  1000 
individuals, and no mutation. 

1.  Try  cases with  no mutation  and  no migration  and  all  fitness  values  set  to  1.0  (i.e.  there  is  no 
selection). Does genetic drift  in  a population of  size 1000  accomplish  roughly  the  same  changes 
in  1000  generations  as  genetic  drift  in  a  population  of  size  100  does  in  100  generations?  By 
running a number of simulations, check whether  the probability  that an allele  is  fixed by genetic 
drift is equal to its initial frequency in the populations – is this true or not? 
2. Try a case with no mutation and migration, with the A allele favored by natural selection (with 
fitness  of  the  AA  genotype  set  highest  and  fitness  of  the  aa  genotype  set  lowest).  Start  with  a 
small  frequency of A.  Is  it  always  fixed?  If  one  starts with  a  single  copy  of  the  allele,  how does 
the  probability  that  A  is  fixed  compare  with  the  selection  coefficient  favoring  it  in  the 
heterozygote  (compared  to  the  fitness of  the aa genotype?  Is  this  fixation probability  larger  than 
the one you would get with the same initial frequency with no selection? 
3.  Try  overdominance  (Aa  having  the  highest  fitness).  Does  the  gene  frequency  converge 
towards  an  equilibrium?  Why  does  it  vary  from  this  equilibrium  frequency?  How  large  do  the 
selection  coefficients  have  to  be  to  cause  the  gene  frequency  to  stay  away  from  fixation  or  loss 
for  large amounts of time? In particular, what happens when  the fitness values of AA, Aa, and aa 
are 0.99, 1.0, and 0.99, respectively?
4. Try underdominance (Aa having the lowest fitness). Is there a starting gene frequency that will 
result  in  some  populations  heading  for  fixation,  and  others  heading  for  loss?  If  you  add  a  small 
amount of migration, what will happen if you add a small amount of mutation in both directions? 
5.  Comparison: With migration  but  no  selection  or mutation,  how much migration  is  needed  to 
make  the  gene  frequency  curves  from  questions  1-4  above  all  wind  up  quite  similar  to  each 
other? How much is needed to make them all end up at the same gene frequency? 

Mutation alone & mutation vs. selection 
6. With mutation but  no  selection  or migration,  how much mutation  is needed  to  cause  the gene 
frequencies to converge on a mutational equilibrium gene frequency? How does this value relate 
to the population size? 
7. If an allele is selected against, can you set up mutation rates that will maintain it at low 
frequency in the population? 
8.  Also  try  different  migration  rates  from  0  up  to  0.1.  For  each,  start  the  population  with  gene 
frequency  0.5.  Describe  the  outcomes.  I  am  not  looking  for  detailed  graphs  of  all  runs  but  a 
general  verbal  description.  However,  distinguish  between  what  happens  with  the  different 
parameter values. 
Migration alone & migration vs. selection 
9. Consider the number of individuals migrating into a typical population in one generation. 
What is it in terms of the population size N and the migration rate m? 
10. Can you  find  a  value of  this number  of  new  migrants,  above which  the  outcome  is  different 
than  below  it  (i.e.  some  value  that  is  roughly  the  border  between  two  kinds  of  behavior  of  the 
simulations)? What is the value? 
11. With nonzero migration rates, do you ever find that the populations permanently fix for 
different alleles? 
Drift alone & drift vs. the other forces. 
Please don’t forget to explore this!  PopG makes it easy to investigate this interaction…when 
would you judge that a population becomes ‘arbitrarily large’ in this two allele case?
