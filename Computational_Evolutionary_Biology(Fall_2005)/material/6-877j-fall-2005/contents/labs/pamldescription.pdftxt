PAML description (note ! = dN/dS rate ratio)1. Format sequences into a modified phylip format (see below). You can use Se-Al to edit the multiplealignment, and then export sequences into phylip format. The file starts with two numbers: # sequences# base pairs. The name of the sequence should be 10 characters in length including spaces; the last twocharacters must be spaces. Since we are analyzing codon data, the sequence length must be a multiple ofthree and no stop codons allowed.  Save file with Unix line breaks using text edit such as bbedit. Placefile in PAML folder. Example:2   9species1atgagtcgaspecies2atgcgagag2. Generate a tree using Phylip, PAUP*, MrBayes or other program. Save file with Unix line breaks usingtext editor such as bbedit. Place file in PAML folder. Example tree: ((Species1,Species2),Species3)3. Modify the codonml.ctl file to perform the analyses you want, save it with unix line breaks in PAMLfolder. Not all options in the command file are used. Typically modified options are:Seqfile= any name you want for the phylip formatted aligned sequencesTreefile= any name you want for the treefile. No treefile needed for pairwise estimatesRunmode= use “0” for site and lineage variation analyses, use “-2” for pairwiseModel=0 if performing variation in the ! ratio between sites. 0 means one ! ratiofor all lineages. For different ! ratios for each lineage (“free ratio” model) use 1.NSsites= This parameter sets variation between sites. Use 0 for one ! ratio. The nestedmodels typically used for variation between sites are:Model 1 (neutral) versus Model 2 (selection)Model 7 (beta, ! ratio between 0,1) versus Model 8 (beta+!, additional !)You can specify multiple models to be run, for example: NSsites= 1 2 7 8Fix_omega=0 for estimating the ! ratio, 1 to fix ! to test for significanceOmega=1. Start or fixed !. To check for convergence, you should run the analysis a minimum of twicestarting from different ! (< and >1, for example 0.2 and 2). If using Fix_omega, this is the value of !.ncatG= 1. The number relates to NSsites parameter, but is set automatically when multiple models aretested. Set to 1 for pairwise estimates and lineage variationCommon parameter setting for other options:Seqtype=1 for all codon comparisonsCodonFreq=3 calculated codon table frequencies4. The run the program, open the terminal window. Change in the directory that contains the PAMLprogram, your sequence file and treefile. The > prompt, type: ./codeml codonml.ctl5. View output in the outfile name you specified and the rst file automatically generated. Both will belocated in the folder from which you executed the program.Typical analyses performed in PAML:1. Pairwise estimates. This averages the dn/ds ratio across all sites. You usually want to determine if the ! ratiois significantly different from 1. Run the program twice with different control files, such as:To get the maximum likelihood estimates of !:To get the likelihood with dn/ds = 1:Seqfile= whatever Seqfile= whateverOutfile= whatever you want Outfile= whatever, but different from previousrunmode = -2 runmode = -2model=0 model=0NSsites=0 NSsites=0Fix_omega=0 Fix_omega=1Omega=1The analysis is to compare the log likelihood where you estimate the ! ratio to the log likelihood where! was fixed. The negative of twice of difference is compared to "2 with 1 degree of freedom (1 in this case)2. Variation in the ! ratio between sites. You want to compare the likelihood of a model where the ! ratio isconstrained to be equal or less than 1 to the likelihood of a model where a class of sites is allowed to have a! ratio greater than 1.  You can run all models by executing one command file with the following:Seqfile= whatever you want to name the sequence fileOutfile= whatever you want outfilerunmode = 0model=0NSsites= 1 2 7 8Fix_omega=0Omega= try different values such as 0.3 and 3 to check for convergence.The analysis is to compare the likelihood of the neutral versus the selection model. You compare thetwice the difference between the log likelihood (lnl) of model 1 to model 2, and model 7 to model 8 with "2distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters. This should be runwith different stating ! values (< and > 1) to check for convergence.3. Variation in the ! ratio between lineages. You want to compare the likelihood where every lineage has thesame ! ratio to the likelihood where each lineage (or a specific lineage of interest) has a different ! ratio. Youcompare twice the difference between the log likelihood (lnl) of the models with the "2 distribution with degreesof freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters. The command files should have the following:One ratio:Free ratio:runmode = 0 runmode = 0model=0 model=1NSsites= 0 NSsites= 0
