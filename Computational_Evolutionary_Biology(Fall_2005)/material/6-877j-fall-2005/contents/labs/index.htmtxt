***** Overview *****
Instructions for using the software for each laboratory will be provided. Most
of the programs and all the data will be available for download to PCs,
MacintoshÂ®, and LinuxÂ®-based systems. Alternatively, you may use MIT servers'
computational resources.
    * Goals: The aim of the lab work is to make sure that you get a chance to
      apply the theory to real data. We can talk and talk about evolutionary
      models, but in our experience, getting your hands dirty may be the best
      way to learn.
    * Mechanics: In general, the labs will involve computer work with modeling
      and application to 'live' data sets. The computational models and data
      will always be available to either download to your own computer (either
      PC, MacintoshÂ®, or LinuxÂ® box), with the data available on the MIT
      server. We will arrange for a separate laboratory section in the MIT
      cluster in the basement of the Stata building that will serve as a
      question-answer time in general and for lab questions in particular.
      During the latter part of the course, we can use this time to talk about
      projects.
    * Format: Each lab will be divided into three parts: first, a 'warmup'
      section to get familiar with the computational tools; second, brief
      questions that review and extend the lecture material; and third, a
      substantive application to a real data set drawn from the literature. We
      anticipate that each laboratory will take about two weeks, unless
      otherwise noted. In general, you won't need to do your own programming in
      C++, Perl, JavaÂ®, etc. - rather, we will use off-the-shelf tools.
      However, some questions and projects later on may require some elementary
      skills with manipulating data, that you should be able to do via Perl, or
      MATLABÂ® - almost any such set of tools. If you find that challenging, do
      not despair. Please just talk to me: we can team up people that have
      complementary skill sets, or substitute alternative questions, etc.
    * Lab Reports: We will strive to make this a 'paperless' class. Lab reports
      should be written up as Web pages, with the final URL sent to me.
    * Policy on Cooperative Work: We strongly encourage cooperation. You are
      free to work in groups, but please do write up your lab yourself
      (however, the Final Project is a team effort and requires only one write-
      up).

***** Lab Supporting Files *****
The supporting files are needed to complete the lab exercises. Each lab
explains the files and procedures needed to perform the various exercises and
comparative tests in PAML, the software used in the course. In order to use
PAML, users must provide a control (.ctl) file which specifies the particular
model and estimation method to use and a data sequence (.phy) file given in the
proper format.
***** The Population Genetics and Evolution Simulation *****
The Populus JavaÂ® computer program, version 5.3 that is needed to complete Lab
1 is available at the University of Minnesota Web_site. Make sure you have
checked for JavaÂ® compatibility according to the instructions on that page. A
PDF file of instructions for all modules is available here. (PDF_-_5.2_MB)
