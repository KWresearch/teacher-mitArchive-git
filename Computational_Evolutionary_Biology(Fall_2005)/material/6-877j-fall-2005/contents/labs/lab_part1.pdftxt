0. Definitions and descriptive statistics for DNA sequences 

Heterozygosity  (also  known  as  ‘gene  diversity’)  is  the  probability  that  two  random  sequences 
are different.  To calculate it, one can straightforwardly examine all sequence pairs and coun 
the fraction of the pairs in which the two sequences are different from each other.  It is often 
faster  to  start  by  counting  the  number  of  copies  of  each  type  in  the  data.  Let  ni  denote  the 
number of copies of  type i and  let n be the sum of all  these types.  Then  the heterozyosity  is 
estimated by: 

Number  of  segregating  sites.  A  ‘segregating  site’  is  a  site  that  is  polymorphic  in  the  data.  The 
number of sites is usually denoted S (or Sn  if referring to n samples). 

Mean  pairwise  difference.  Let  kij  denote  the  number  of  nucleotide  site  differences  between 
sequences of type i and sequences of type j. The mean pairwise difference is: 

Mean pairwise difference per nucleotide. If the sequences are L bases long, we can standardize 
the above value by the length: 

Mismatch  distribution.  A  histogram  whose  ith  entry  is  the  number  of  pairs  of  sequences  that 
differ  by  i  sites.  Here  i  ranges  from  0  through  the maximal  difference  between  pairs  in  the 
sample. 
Site  frequency  spectrum.  A  histogram  whose  ith  entry  is  the  number  of  polymorphic  sites  at 
which  the mutant allele is present  in  i copies within  the sample.  Here,  the indexing i ranges 
from 1 to n–1. 
Folded  site  frequency  spectrum.  Often  one  cannot  tell  which  allele  is  the  mutant  and  which  is 
ancestral.  In  that  case,  we  combine  the  entries  for  i  and  n–i  so  the  new  i  ranges  from  1 
through n/2. 

Neutral  substitutions.  The  rate  at  which  neutral  mutants  are  substituted  into  the  population 
depends on several factors. 

H=1!nin"#$%&’i(ni!1n!1"#$%&’=kijnin!"#$%&i<j’(njn)1!"#$%&!="/LThe number of new mutant genes introduced per generation. In a population of 2N genes, this 
number is 2Nu. 

The fraction of  those mutants that eventually become fixed.  If drift continues long enough, all 
but  one of  the genes  in  the  current  population will be  lost,  and  the one  that  survives will  be 
fixed. Each gene has a probability of 1/(2N) of increasing to fixation (its initial frequency). 

The  rate of  substitution  is  the number  of  new mutants per  generation  (2Nu)  times  the probability 
that  a  given  mutant will  be  fixed,  1/(2N).  So  this  product  is  just  u:  remarkably,  the  substitution 
rate  is  just  equal  to  the  rate  of mutation  of  neutral  alleles.  It  does  not  depend  on  the  size  of  the 
population or the extent of subdivision within it. 

We now turn to the problem set questions. 

Question 1. Effective population size. 
We  have  seen  that  the  effective  population  size,  Ne,  plays  a  crucial  role  in  all  the  theoretical 
accounts of evolution.  Since we multiply  this (typically  large) number by another (typically very 
small)  factor,  s,  u, m, or  r  (recombination rate),  to get  the  crucial  value of  theta,  it’s  important  to 
get  this  value  as  correct  as  we  can  make  it,  because  this  will  have  profound  impact  on  the 
outcome  of  polymorphism  patterns.  Thus,  it’s  actually  extremely  important  to  figure  out  how  to 
correct  for  different  variations  that  are  actually  seen  biologically.  In  class  (and  the  slides),  we 
saw  how  to  correct  for  fluctuating  population  size  by  ‘back  calculating’  what  the  population 
‘should  have  been’  in  order  to  get  the  same  change  in  variance  as  would  be  produced  by  a 
Wright-Fisher  model.  This  idea,  viewed  from  another  perspective,  is  also  covered  in  the  Rice 
book,  pages 111–112.  Here’s another  common  correction  that  is often  encountered  in biological 
situations. 
Elephant  seals  possess  an  interesting  system  of  mating.  One  alpha-male  lies  in  the  center  of  a 
harem  of  females and  attempts  to mate with  as many of  these  females as possible  throughout  the 
course of  the mating season.  The harem  is also surrounded by 5 beta-males, usually younger and 
smaller, who  lie  around  the harem  and protect  it  from  invasion by  other males.  When  the  alpha-
male  starts  to  mate,  the  beta-males  use  his  distraction  to  do  some  mating  of  their  own  with  the 
females  at  the  outer  edges  of  the  harem.  Other males,  not  alphas  or  betas,  stay  in  the water  and 
are  not  allowed  to  mate  at  all.  One  would  think  that  the  alpha  male  sires  the  most  offspring  in 
this situation, however, recent genetic studies have found that beta-males as a group actually have 
at  least as much mating success as the alpha-male.  From a typical harem 50% of  the children are 
sired from beta males and 50% are sired from the alpha.  Given that there are 40 alpha-males, and 
2000  females  in  the  population,  assuming  that  each  of  the  harems  is  exactly  the  same  size, 
assuming  that  all  beta-males  have  exactly  the  same  probability  of  having  an  offspring,  and 
assuming  that  all  females are  fertile  and available for mating,  calculate  the  effective population 
size  for  this  population  of  elephant  seals.  NOTE:  assume  non-overlapping  generations  for 
simplicity. 
To solve this problem, you should read  the relevant section in the Rice  textbook, pages 113–114; 
please show  the details of your work and how you arrive at your answer (not just a final number!) 
(And,  Yes,  one  can  just  go  through  the  Rice  book  and  follow  that  derivation,  but  it’s  more 
interesting to work out the details as applied to this particular case.) 

Question  2.  Neutral  evolution  and  drift.  How would  an  increase  in  population  size  affect  the 
rate of neutral substitutions in the generations immediately following the increase? 

Question  3. Neutral  evolution  and drift.  Consider  a  stretch  of  noncoding,  nonfunctional DNA 
that  is  1,  000  nucleotides  long.  Assume  that  the  mutation  rate  is  high  –  2  changes  per  site  per 
million generations. 

Question 3(i) In a population of 10,000 individuals, how many new alleles will be created in the 
population each generation? 

Question 3(ii) What fraction of these new alleles will ultimately be fixed? 

Question 3(iii) What is the rate of molecular evolution? (substitutions per site per generation) 

Question  3(iv)  In  a  population  of  50  individuals  with  the  same  mutation  rate,  how  many  new 
alleles will  be  created  per  generation?  What  fraction  of  these will  ultimately  be  fixed?  What  is 
the rate of molecular evolution? 

Question 3(v) Which population will have greater heterozygosity at any one time?  Why? 

Question 4.  The neutral theory of evolution 

Question  4(i)  In  a  population  of  10,000  individuals  with  a  neutral mutation  rate  of  1  nucleotide 
change per site per 10 million generations, what is the expected heterozygosity per site? 

Question  4(ii)  What  is  the  expected  heterozygosity  for  a  protein  that  is  500  amino  acids  long? 
Express the meaning of this result in a sentence (i.e., express it in words). 

Question 4(iii) What is the expected heterozygosity if there are 12 individuals in the population? 

Question 5. Segregating sites, S. 
What  is  the  ratio  between  the  expected  value  of  S  in  a  sample  of  100  DNA  sequences  and  the 
expected value  in a  sample of 200?  (You should do  the calculation, and,  if you want  to go a little 
further, try to derive the ratio mathematically). 

Question 5.  Nucleotide polymorphisms and the number of segregating sites, S 
Here  is  a  set  of  10  (real)  DNA  sequences,  each  with  40  sites,  taken  from  a  mitochondrial  DNA 
sample: 

seq1 
seq2 
seq3 
seq4

seq6 
seq7

Each column corresponds to a different site.  Periods indicate sites that are identical to the site in �
sequence 1.  To save typing, the file is available for download in the labs section: 
Question 5 sequence data. �Use these data to answer the following questions.�

Question 5(i).  Calculate the mean pairwise difference among the sequences, the nucleotide�
diversity  π.�

Question 5(ii).  Use this value to estimate θ.�

Question 5(iii).  Calculate the number of segregating sites, S, given this sample (more properly�
denoted S10).�

Question 5(iv).  Use this value to provide a second estimate of θ.�

Question 5(v).  What can you infer from the similarity (or dissimilarity) of these two estimates?�

To  ease  your  computation,  I  have  posted  a  very  simple  awk  script  piS that  computes  the�
diversity  statistic  π and  an  estimate of  θ based on  the Waterston  segregating  sites  statistic  (along�
with  some  other  things,  viz,  Tajima’s  D  statistic),  for  a  set  of  aligned  sequences  like  this.  The�
script  is available in the labs section.  and ought  to  run  (i.e.,  it’s been  tested on)  any  linux box;�
Mac OS X,  etc. (you can download it as a text file and run it locally – I will check re getting it going
on the MIT server).
It is invoked this way:�

awk –f piS.awk <name of sequence file> > <myhomedir> myoutputfile.txt�

where you should make sure myoutputfile.txt is a file in your home directory.  Running 
this program will give you output like the following, 

pi: 53.626812 �
Segregating sites: 184/1878�
theta_hat[estimated from S]: 49.273068�
 Tajima's D: 0.354335 �
a1=3.734292 a2=1.602387 b1=0.362319 b2=0.242754�
c1=0.094530 c2=0.067558 e1=0.025314 e2=0.004345�

The a1, a2, etc. coefficients are those needed to compute Tajima’s D, as part of the variance 
calculation devised by Tajima. 
Part 2: Analyzing some real polymorphism data 
The  same program  can  be used  to  analyze  full-size data  sets.  As  an  example,  consider  the paper 
by  Hey  et  al.  (1993)  in  Genetics  that  examined  a  1.9kb  stretch  of  one  locus,  the  per  locus,  in 
Drosophila  melanogaster  and  three  sister  species.  They  were  interested  in  details  about 
speciation history, and common ancestors, and so were eventually drawn  to a coalescent analysis. 
Here, we’ll start to get our hands dirty by taking a look at the whole dataset. 
 
The  full  Drosophila  dataset  as  used  in  the  original  Hey  Genetics  paper  and  in  this  question  is 
available for download: Sites Drosophila data set .  (We provide this format for completeness 
because it  can be used  later on  in Hey’s own program,  later on.) For now,  though, we need  the in 
the form that the awk program likes; that data set is in the labs section. 

Question 6. Repeat Questions 5(i)–(v)  for  this dataset.  Be  sure to  think about  the fact  that  this is 
not  data  all  drawn  from  a  single  species –  in particular,  it might  not meet  the  requirements of  the 
infinite  site  model  either.  (Please  examine  the  data  at  least  briefly  for  this  possibility  –  whether 
this  has  an  effect  on  the  analysis  is  a  different  story,  of  course.  In  addition,  as  the  Hey  paper 
notes,  there  is  the  possibility  of  population  growth  and  migration,  none  of  which  is  taken  into 
account by these summary statistics.) 

In addition, at  this point you should  take a look at the description of Tajima’s D, and go back and 
consider what  it means  in  terms of  the data  for  both Question 5  and Question 6.  (We’ll  push on 
this same data more later on.)  For a description of Tajima’s D, see below. 

Question 7.  Tajima’s D. 
Fumio Tajima introduced a statistic that is widely used to test the null hypothesis of mutation-drift 
equilibrium  and  constant  population  size.  Tajima  considered  two  statistics:  the  mean  pairwise 
difference π and the number S of segregating sites. Under the null hypothesis, the expected values 
of these statistics are: 

where θ=4Nu, 2N is the haploid population size, u is the mutation rate per generation, and a1 is 
deﬁned below, and should be familiar you from the coalescent process as the expected total length 
of time to coalescence, hence the time available for mutation: 

Under the null hypothesis, both π and S/a1  estimate θ, so they should be roughly equal in value. If 
they  are  about  equal  in  value,  then we  cannot  reject  the hypothesis.  If  they  are  very different,  on 
the  other  hand,  we  reject  the  hypothesis.  But  how  different  is  “very  different”?  The  answer 
depends  on  how  variable  these  two  statistics  are  from  sample  to  sample.  Tajima  obtained  a 
formula for the sampling variance of these statistics, and so deﬁned D this way: Let 

denote the sampling variance of the difference between the two estimates. Then Tajima’s D is: 

It  expresses  the  difference  between  the  two  estimates  relative  to  their  standard  error.  If  the 
difference  between π and  S/a1  were  normally  distributed,  then we  could  expect D  to  lie  between 
negative  2  and  +2  about  95%  of  the  time.  In  fact,  this  difference  is  not  normally  distributed 
(technically,  Tajima  argued  that  it  has what  is  called  a  beta  distribution)  but  it  is  not  too  far  off. 
We  should  be  suspicious  of  values  of  D  that  are  much  outside  the  interval  [–2,  2].  Later  in  the 
second  part  of  this  Lab,  we  shall  see  how  to  use  coalescent  programs  to  generate  confidence 
intervals via simulation. 

Although D  is  simple  in  concept,  it  is  tedious  to  calculate. We  need  three  pieces  of  data:  S,  and 
the  number,  n,  of  DNA  sequences  in  the  sample.  Given  these  data,  Tajima  used  the  fact  that  the 
variance in the estimate of S derived from nucleotide diversity can be expressed this way: 

If  we  go  through  a  (fairly  sophisticated)  calculation  of  the  difference  in  the  variance  of  the  two 
estimators of θ (which we omit here), as it turns out we need the following numbers: 

V=Var[!"S/a1]Var[ˆ!T]=n+13(n"1)!+29!2E[!]="E[S]=a1"a1=1ii=1n!1"D=!"S/a1VAnd finally, the D value is computed as: 

Question  7  (at  last). Lynn  Jorde’s  lab  has published  a  large  sample  of DNA  sequences  from  the 
D-loop of the human mitochondrial genome. There are 630 sites. For the Asian sample, we get: 

77 sequences, 630 sites �
pi: 8.438483�
Segregating sites: 103/630�
theta_hat[estimated from S]: 20.958331 �
Tajima’s D: -2.021749 �
a1=4.914514 a2=1.631862 b1=0.342105 b2=0.228184 c1=0.138626 c2=0.086985�
e1=0.028208 e2=0.003374�

For the African sample: 
72 sequences, 630 sites �
pi:15.339984�
Segregating sites: 88/630 �
theta_hat[estimated from S]: 18.155855 �
Tajima’s D: -0.525801 �
a1=4.846921 a2=1.630948 b1=0.342723 b2=0.228612 c1=0.136406 c2=0.085989�
e1=0.028143 e2=0.003423�

In one case, D is strongly negative and in the other case weakly negative.  How would you 
interpret these results? 
(This (almost) ends Part I of the laboratory.)
