Laboratory 3: Detecting selection 

Handed out: November 28 
Introduction 
In  this  laboratory  we  shall  apply  evolutionary  models  to  genomic  data  –  from  the  very  lowest 
levels,  nucleotides  and  amino  acids,  to  the  question  of  whole-genome  duplication.  Our  major 
goal will  be  to  have you  become  familiar with modern methods  for  detecting  natural  selection  at 
the  level  of  genes  and  proteins,  as  well  as  to  engage  some  current  recent  questions  in  gene 
duplication.  The  lab will  consist  of  two parts:  the first  will have you  get  familiar with  the  tools, 
including volatility  analysis, while  the  second  turns  to  the maximum  likelihood method, which  is 
the current ‘state of the art.’ 

Due: December 14 

Part 1: Detecting selection – two basic methods and a new, noncomparative approach 

Part 1.1 Detection of selection using synonymous/nonsynonymous ratios in primate 
lysozyme enzymes 

Objective: Analyze the pattern of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions between genes. 

Dataset: 
Already-aligned  lysozyme C precursor DNA  sequences  from  different  species of  apes  (including 
. 
human)  in  FASTA  format  may  be  found in the labs section. Please  download  and  save  this  file 
to  your  local computer, for use in the next step. 

Procedure: 
You can use the perl-based SNAP utility at the HIV database: 
http://hiv-web.lanl.gov/SNAP/WEBSNAP/SNAP.html. 
This  program will  calculate  overall  numbers  for  KA  and  KS  (it  uses  the  terms  dN  dS  instead),  as 
well as a cumulative plot of these values, codon by codon as we move through a coding region, as 
well  as  some  simple  statistics  for  these  counts. 
It  can  also  use  the  dN  and  dS  values  as  a 
‘distance’  metric  to  construct  a  ‘nearest  neighbor’  or  ‘neighbor  joining’  (NJ)  phylogenetic  tree 
relating the species that you are comparing. 

Procedure: 
Here is how to use it once you’ve navigated to this site (see snapshot below): 
1.	 For “Format”, select “Fasta” in the drop-down box. 
2.	 Use  “Choose  file”  to  select  the  local  fasta  file  on  your  computer  that  you’ve  already 
downloaded. 
3.	 Check  all  the  next  four  boxes  to  select  all  the  analyses  and  the  two  possible  “Neighbor 
joining”  (NJ)  phylogenetic  trees,  one  based  on  synonymous  substitutions;  one  based  on 
nonsynonymous. 
4.  Hit the “Run Snap” button. 
The program will do its calculations and then display a page with five links to the results. 

This  program  uses  the  Nei-Gojobori  ‘corrected  path  counting’  method,  which  adjusts  for  counts 
via Jukes-Cantor plus the weighting of pathways from one codon to another according to an equi-
probable model for each possible  codon-to-codon path; for details on  this approach, you can read 
the  original  paper Nei, Masatoshi, and Takashi Gojobori. "Simple methods for estimating the 
numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions." Molecular Biology and 
Evolution 3, no. 5 (1986): 418-426. 

Please also take a look at theREADME link for the SNAP utility, here: 
http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/hiv-db/SNAP/README.html. 

If you prefer to do some of your own hacking with this method, the perl source code is available 
for Unix, Macs, and PCs, at these ftp locations: 

For Unix: ftp://ftp-t10.lanl.gov/pub/aids-db/PROGS/Snap 
For Macintosh: ftp://ftp-t10.lanl.gov/pub/aids-db/PROGS/Snap.mac 
For PC: ftp://ftp-t10.lanl.gov/pub/aids-db/PROGS/Snap.pc 

Questions. 
1.	 Using  the  nonsynonymous/synonymous  ratio  test,  is  there  any  evidence  for  positive 
selection on the lyz C gene in ape-like primates? 

2.	 What  is the overall dN/dS  ratio for  the lyz C genes in  the alignment? Is there an excess of 
silent or coding mutations? 

3.	 Are the phylogenetic trees based on dN and dS different?  What do you think this means? 

4.	 Discuss  the  results  of  this  analysis.  Why  might  the  lyz  C  genes  among  these  species 
differ? Given  the  results,  how  strong  is  the  evidence  that  natural  selection  is  responsible?

Part 1.2 Detecting selection with Tajima’s D test 

Objective: 
You’ve already had a chance to use this polymorphism-type detector for positive selection in the 
previous laboratory.  Now we apply it in a more systematic way, comparing methods. 

Dataset: 
Fetch  the  sequence  alignment  of  Plasmodium  falciparum  (malaria)  apical  membrane  antigen  1 
gene  sampled  according  to  different  geographic  regions from the labs section  and  save  the  sequences 
on  your local computer. 

Procedure: 
(For the next part we assume that you all have access to PCs running Windows…if not, please see

me;  it  may  also  run  on  a  Mac  under  VirtualPC,  and,  possibly,  under  Unix  using  WINE.)

Download and install DnaSP on your local PC; the web site is:

http://www.ub.es/dnasp/dnasp4104.exe.

The main web site is: http://www.ub.es/dnasp/.

This  file  is  a  self-extracting,  and  you  just  run  it  to  install  the  program  itself.  You  will  use  the

program to analyze nucleotide diversity and test selection with respect to this dataset via Tajima’s

D but now using a sliding window of appropriate size.


You can then use DnaSP as follows. 

•	 Start the program DnaSP and from the “File” menu open the faliciparum.fas file that 
you’ve saved locally.  The program will put up a short summary window, which you can 
then close.  The window looks like this:

•	 Select  “Overview”  from  the menu  panel,  selecting  the  only  item  in  the  pull-down menu, 
and  click  “OK”  to  the  resulting  dialog  box  (which  selects  all  1311  sites  to  compare)  and 
run  the  program  to  obtain  summary  statistics  that  include  an  estimated  number  of 
‘haplotypes’  as well  as  summary  calculations of  selection  neutrality  (Tajima’s D,  Fu  and 
Li’s D*, etc.) – record these. Note that these are calculations for the gene as a whole. 

•	 Carry out  a  sliding window  analysis of  the nucleotide diversity:  under  the  “Analysis”  tab 
select “Tajima’s Test”  and  then from resulting pop-up Options window,  look on  the right 
where  one  selects  a  ‘sliding  window’  analysis,  so  that  one  can  see  how  D  varies  from 
gene  region  to  gene  region.  Check  the  ‘Compute’  box  –  but  you  will  have  to  do  some 
experimenting to figure out the step size should be (try the default first?).  After you click 
“OK” you will get a pane that has text output and a table. The table will have a check-box 
to produce a graph  that plots nucleotide (DNA) position on  the X-axis and Tajima’s D on 
-
the Y axis, as follows:

Questions. 
1.	 What does Tajima’s D  tell you about this gene as a whole? What form of selection 
is this? (Neutral, diversifying, purifying, balancing?)  Please briefly explain.  What 
do  any  of  the  other  Tajima-type  tests  say  differently,  if  anything?  (These  include 
Fu  and  Li’s D*,  Fu  and Li’s  F*  – we  haven’t  covered  these  in  detail,  but,  briefly, 
Fu  and Li's Tests DnaSP  computes  the D, D*,  F  and F*  test  statistics proposed by 
Fu  and  Li  (1993)  to  test  various  predictions  made  by  the  neutral  theory  of 
molecular  evolution  (Kimura  1983).  The  test  statistics  D  and  F  require  data  from 
intraspecific  polymorphism  and  from  an  outgroup  (a  sequence  from  a  related 
species),  and  D*  and  F*  only  require  intraspecific  data.  DnaSP  uses  the  critical 
values obtained  by Fu  and Li  (1993)  to determine  the  statistical  significance of D, 
F, D* and F* test statistics. DnaSP can also conduct the F test statistic (Fu 1997). 

2.	 Using the sliding window method,  see if you can  locate any region  in the gene that 
seems to be under  selection, as opposed  to  the gene as a whole (below we ask you 
to see if you can figure out why these sites might be under selection). 

Here  is  some  detailed  information  on  this  gene,  P.  falciparum  PF11_0344,  an  apical  membrane 
precursor,  622  amino  acids  long.  It  resides  on  Chromosome  11  of  P.  falciparium,  spanning 
locations 1290767 – 1292635.  I  have placed  a  link  to  the NCBI  entry on  this gene  and  a  link  to 
the  plasmodium  database  entry  for  this  gene  below.  You  can  use  these  links  to  view  the  gene’s 
amino  acid  sequence,  nucleotide  sequence,  and  even  the  3-D  structure  of  part  of  the 
corresponding  protein  (structure  1HN6).  Some  snapshots  from  the  plasmodium  database  are 
below.  Perhaps  the  best  description  is  the  link  that  follows,  from  the  TIGR,  which  gives  a good 
overview of the functioning of the protein associated with this gene and a great browser view.

The  full  open  reading  frame  (ORF)  sequence  (so  far)  of  the  entire  falciparum  chromosome  11 

may  be  found here  in fasta  format.  Please download  it from the labs section  to  your  local machine,

for  the next  part  of the lab.

(Note: this is a 1.5 MB download!)

(This includes just predicted ORFs larger than 50 amino acids long.)


The full nucleotide sequence for gene AMA1 (PF11_0344) may be found in the labs section. 

Part 1.3.  Codon volatility and selection 

Objective: 
We will next attempt to test in a noncomparative way whether this apical membrane gene is under 
positive selection. 

Dataset: 
As in the previous section. 

Procedure: 
You  will  use  J.  Plotkin’s  volatility  server,  at  http://volatility.cgr.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/volatility.pl, 
and run  it over all of  the ORFs in chromosome 11 to see whether  the PF11_0344 gene stands out. 
(The  server  takes  fasta  format  as  input,  so  you  can  use  the  chromosome  11  sequence  in  the  lab 
directory,  above.)  Please  go  ahead  and  do  this  now,  as  follows:  Go  to  the  volatility  server  and 
upload  the  entire  chromosome  11sequence  from  your  local  computer  that  you  had  downloaded 
above.  Next… 

Questions. 
1.	 What  do  you  think  the  kappa  value  (transition/transversion  rate  ratio)  should  be?  Take  a 
look  at  the  kappa  values  used  for  other  genomes  that  have  been  already  placed  on  this 
server,  by  selecting  the  “Upload  a  fasta  file” pull-down menu  – you’ll  note  that  th  for  the 
whole  falciparum genome Plotkin  used  a kappa value of  1.0  (Click  on  the  ‘About  kappa’ 
box and you will see that for the example sequences on this site, kappa has been estimated 
via  a  maximum  likelihood  analysis.  See  if  you  can  figure  out  how  to  use  DnaSP  to 
estimate kappa, or do a bit of research on how this is done.) 

2.	 Run  the volatility  analysis. After  you  run  the program,  you  can  download  the  result  to  an 
excel  spreadsheet  locally. Then  you’ll  have  to do a bit  of  grepping  to find  the PF11_0344 
gene  (but  it’s not  that hard).  See what  its computed  volatility  is – does  it  agree with your 
previous analysis  from  section  1.2? How does  demographic  change  enter  into  this picture 
(if  at  all)?  What  do  you  think  this  agreement  or  disagreement  means? The citation for 
      Plotkin's Nature paper describing his method is Plotkin, J. B., J. Dushoff, and H. B. Fraser.

the  tabulation  from  the web  output  is  a  bit  ‘off’,  but  it  should  be  downloaded  into  a  spreadsheet 
anyway, as suggested on the web page itself.

Part 1.4. Going further 
Let’s do a bit more digging on this one – a more open-ended question. The analysis in section 1.2 
looked  at  parts  of  a  single  gene,  while  the  volatility  analysis  compares  whole  genes  against  the 
rest  of  a  genome.  If  you  have  located  the  regions  within  this  gene  that  seem  to  be  undergoing 
selection,  look  at  which  amino  acid  residues  they  correspond  to.  Can  you  locate  them  in  the 
actual  3-D  structural map  that  the  protein  structure  database  PDB  provides?  (I  know  you might 
have to ask your resident bioinformatics person in class about some of the details about how to do 
this, or the biochemistry – that is OK – just do your best and please work together.)
