Detailed instructions for how the tools were used can be found in the lab
assignments in the labs section.
***** Populus *****
Populus is produced by Don Alstad at the University of Minnesota to foster
instruction in population biology. The Populus software contains a set of
simulations that are used to teach population biology and evolutionary ecology.
For more information and to download Populus, visit their Web_site.
***** PopG *****
PopG is a one-locus, two-allele genetic simulation program created by
University of Washington and Joseph Felsenstein. To download PopG, visit their
Web_site.
***** CoalFace *****
CoalFace is a simulation of the coalescent process with the visual display of
gene genealogies, developed by Wayne Delport &amp; Michael Cunningham at the
University of Pretoria. CoalFace has been developed predominantly as a teaching
tool, yet some basic coalescent simulation analyses can be performed.
Both WindowsÂ® and LinuxÂ® (Intel) executables are available at their Web_site.
***** PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) *****
PAML is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or protein
sequences using maximum likelihood. It is maintained and distributed for
academic use free of charge by Ziheng Yang. To download source files and the
software documentation, visit their Web_site.
