6.877 Lecture Notes, 11/30/05: the cost and benefits of sex 

1. The cost of sex: why sex? 

There  is  a  two-fold  cost  to  sexual  reproduction  in  stable  populations  (diploid).  Each 
female, whether sexual or not, will leave behind, on average,  two offspring.  On average, 
in  sexual  species,  one  of  the  two  offspring  will  be  male,  and  the  other  female.  Each  of 
these offspring carries one haploid complement of the female’s genetic material; the other 
haploid  genome  come  from  the  male  parent.  A  parthenogenetic  female  will  also  leave 
behind  two  offspring,  but  both  will  be  female  because  they  are  clones  of  their  mother. 
Moreoever, all of the genetic material, four haploid complements, come from the mother. 
Thus,  the parthenogenetic  female  leaves behind  twice  as much of  her  genetic material  as 
does the sexual material. 

Imagine  a  sexual  species  in  which  a  dominant  mutation  arises  that  causes  such 
parthenogenesis.  The genome carrying the mutation will appear  in two  individuals in the 
next  generation,  four  after  that,  and  so  on,  doubling  in  number  each  generation. 
Meanwhile,  all  genomes  without  the  mutation  will  be  replacing  themselves  once  every 
generation,  on  average. 
Eventually,  the  species  will  be  made  up  entirely  of 
parthenogenetic individuals.  This is the two-fold cost of sexual reproduction. 

There  must  be  some  problem  with  this  scenario  or  else  all  species  would  be 
parthenogenetic.  One  possibility  is  that mutations  to  parthenogenesis  either  do  not  occur 
or  else  are  so  deleterious  that  they  swamp  their  two-fold  advantage.  However,  in many 
groups  of  species  parthenogenesis  does  recur,  so  we  must  look  elsewhere  for  an 
explanation of its ultimate failure. 

Sex  in  diploids  is  associated  with  both  segregation  and  meotic  crossing  over; 
parthenogenetic  species  have  neither.  A  natural  place  to  look  for  the  advantage  of  sex  is 
in  the  examination  of  segregation  and  recombination.  Both  can  confer  advantages  to  a 
species.  Let’s see how. 

2.  Two possible explanations for overcoming the two-fold cost of sex 

2.1 Kirkpatrick’s Rocket: segregation can overcome the two-fold cost 

A 1989 paper by Kirkpatrick and  Jenkins builds a model showing  that  the  substitution of 
an  advantageous  mutation  for  a  less  favorable  form  requires  two mutations  in  a  lineage, 
whereas  substitution  in  a  sexual  species  requires  only  one  mutation.  If  the  evolutionary 
success  of  a  species  depends  on  its  ability  to  evolve  rapidly,  and  if  advantageous 
mutations are  relatively  rare,  then  it  is easy  to  imagine  that  the parthenogens will  be  at  a 
distadvantage. 

This is plausible, but the argument isn’t convincing unless it can be shown to enhance the 
fitness  of  sexual  species  sufficiently  to  overcome  their  two-fold  cost  of  sex.  The 
Kirkpatrick model did this by first finding the number of loci in a parthenogenetic species 
that  are  waiting  for  a  second  mutation  that  allows  the  fixation  of  the  advantageous 

mutation  and  then  calculating  the  cost  of  being  heterozygous  at  these  loci.  Here’s  how 
their model works. 

We  assume  that  the  fixation  of  an  advantageous  mutation  in  a  parthenogen  (asexual 
species)  occurs  in  two  steps,  as  illustrated  below.  In  the  beginning,  a  typical  locus  is 
imagined to be fixed for the A2 allele, with the fitness of the genotypes as follows: 

Genotype: 
Fitness: 

A2A2 
1 

A1A2 
1+hs 

A1A1 
1+s 

The A1  allele is favored, so s>0.  The symbol h denotes the usual heterozygote factor  that 
diminishes  the  fitness  of  the  heterozygote with  respect  to  the  homozygote  A1A1  form,  so 
h<1.  The  rate  of  mutation  to  the  A1  allele  is  u.  The  population  size  is  N.  So,  each 
generation,  2Nu  A1  mutations  enter  the  population,  on  average.  However,  as  we  have 
earlier  shown  from  the  diffusion  approximation,  only  some  of  these  will  fix,  due  to 
stochastic effects; you may recall that the fixation probability is approximately 2s, or 2hs, 
if there is a heterozygous effect.  Thus the rate of entry of A1 alleles into the population is: 
4Nush 
If  there  are  L  homozygous  loci  experiencing  this  sort  of  selection,  then  the  rate  of 
conversion from homozygous A2A2  forms to heterozygous A1A2 forms is: 
4NuLsh 
The  environment  is  assumed  to  be  changing  in  such  a way  that  L  is  constant  rather  than 
decreasing with the substitution of each advantageous mutation. 

Now we imagine the second stage in this process, the conversion of A1A2 heterozygotes to 
A1A1 homozgyotes (which are the most fit forms).  We will again do this by introducing a 
diffusion  approximation,  and  then  find  the  steady-state  point  at  which  the  rate  of  flow 
producing  A1A2  heterozygotes  is  equal  to  the  conversion  rate  to  A1A1  homozygotes.  By 
calculating  the  fitness of  this mixed  heterozygote/homozygote population  and  comparing 
to  the most fit situation, we will see how much more fit a sexual species (which does not 
have to use this two-stage approach) can be than an a-sexual species. 

For the second stage then, we require the fixation of an A1 allele on the chromosomes that 
have  an  A2  allele,  in  the  heterozygotes.  The mean  number  of  A1  mutations  entering  each 
generation  at  one  locus  is  2Nu  (rather  than  4N  this  time,  because  each  individual we  are 
talking about  is an A1A2 heterozygote).  The survival probability of  these mutations is, by 
the  diffusion  approximation  as  before,  twice  the  selective  advantage  of  A1A1  over  A1A2 . 
This selection coefficient of an A1A1 homozygote relative to  the A1A2 heterozygote, call  it 
s ', can be found by solving: 

So, the rate of conversion of a particular locus from a population of heterozygotes to one 
of homozygotes is: 

1+s'=1+s1+hs, sos'=s(1!h)1+hs2Nus(1!h)1+hsIf n loci are currently heterozygous (at some point in time), then the total rate of 
conversion from A1A2  to A1A1 for the whole genome is: 

The  equilibrium  or  steady-state  number  of  heterozygous  loci  is  found  by  setting  the  rate 
of  conversion  to  heterozygotes  (the  number  flowing  in  to  the  heterozygous  A1A2  pool 
from  the A2A2  pool)  equal  to  the  rate of  conversion  from A1A2  to A1A1  ,  and  then  solving 
for n: 

We  now  show  that  this  induces  a  ‘fitness’  load  on  a  heterozygous/homozygous  mixed 
population  that does not arise in  the  sexual case.  In a sexual species,  the A1  allele sweeps 
through the population without waiting for a second mutation: it can get two A1 alleles by 
segregation,  from  another  individual.  The  asexual  species  is  at  a  relative  disadvantage 
while waiting for the second mutation  to sweep  through.  How much of a disadvantage is 
this?  We  can  calculate  it  as  follows.  The  fitness  contribution  of  each  of  the 
heterozygous  loci  to  the  particular  individual’s  overall  fitness  is  1+hs.  If  the  overall 
fitness is the product of  the fitnesses of  individual  loci (multiplicative gene interaction or 
epistasis  –  remember,  that  multiplicative  epistasis  says  that  the  effects  of  genes  on  an 
individual’s  survival  probability  are  independent.),  then  the  total  fitness  contribution  of 
heterozygous loci is 
. The relative advantage of the sexual species is thus:

This  is  the

nefit  of  sex. When  does  this  beat  the  two fold  cost  of  sex? 
Suppose,  e.g., 
s=0.01, L=100, h=1/2, then the steady-state value 
that
can be computed as 201, and the 
Ws  value works out  to 2.7, which  is sufficient.  (This is a pretty high selection coefficient 
of  1%;  if  s=0.001,  .1%,  then we  need more  than 100  loci  involved  –  in  fact,  you  should 
be  able  to work  out  that  693 different  loci  need  to be  selected  in  this  fashion. You might 
want to reflect on the biological plausibility of this number.) 

2.2 Kondrashov’s Hatchet: benefits of recombination can over-come the two-fold 
cost of sex 

We  saw  in  an  earlier  lecture  that  sex  might  help  by  recombination:  it  allows  for  the 
removal  of  deleterious  mutations  that  otherwise  accumulate  in  the  “Muller’s  ratchet” 
fashion.  One problem with that model is that it assumed multiplicative epistasis, which is 
not clearly seen  in actual data.  It is contradicted by a number of experimental studies.  In 
one  example,  T.  Mukai  (1968)  accumulated  mutations  on  the  second  chromosome  of 
Drosophila  melanogaster  for  60  generations,  under  conditions  that  minimized  natural 
selection. As the mutations accumulated,  the relative viability of  the second chromosome 
when homozygous decreased (viability as measured by survival of the adult flies).  Mukai 
estimated  that  the  mutation  rate  to  deleterious  mutations  with  measurable  effects  was 

2Nuns(1!h)1+hs4NuLs=2Nuˆns(1!h)1+hs, orˆn=2Lh(1+hs)1!hˆn(1+hs)ˆnWs=1+s1+hs!"#$%&ˆnˆnˆn0.1411  per  second  chromosome  per  generation. 
In  60  generations,  a  typical  second 
chromosome  would  have  60  x  0.1411  =  8.46  mutations.  We  can  graph  #  of  mutations 
against  viability  and  get  a  scatter  plot,  then  see  whether  multiplicative  epistasis  fits  this 
data. (The rightmost point would correspond to 8.46 mutations, on the x-axis.)

When we look  at  this figure, we can see that  there  are three basic types of curves we can 
try  to  fit,  corresponding  to  three models of  epistasis.  A  convex  curve  is characteristic of 
multiplicative epistasis, of the form: 

where  n  is  the  number  of  deleterious  mutations,  s  is  a  measure  of  the  effect  of  each 
mutation,  and  wn  is  the  relative  viability  of  a  fly  with  n  homozygous  deleterious 
mutations. 
A  straight  line  is  characteristic  of  additive  epistasis,  where  each  gene  chips  in  an 
incremental amount that accumulates by a constant with each new mutation: 
wn= 1–sn 
A concave curve is characteristic of synergistic  epistasis, a quadratic model with: 

This  curve  fits  the  data  much  better  than  additive  or  multiplicative  epistasis.  With 
synergistic epistasis,  fitness drops off faster  than expected from  the effects of mutation  in 
isolation – things go ‘from bad to worse.’  This does not invalidate Muller’s ratchet, but it 
does change  its  rate.  What  is worse,  though,  is  that  it  violates  the  assumptions on which 
we built  the model for the ratchet – a Poisson distribution of the number of mutations per 
genome. 

To  remedy  this, Kondrashov  (1988)  proposed  a direct model  of synergistic  epistasis,  and 
showed  that  this  alone  could  be  used  to  demonstrate  that  sexual  recombination  could 
eliminate  deleterious  mutations  better  than  asexually  reproducing  species  could.  Let’s 
see how  this model works.  Kondrashov proposed  a model  of  truncation  selection where 
the  number  of  deleterious  mutations  can  accumulate,  up  until  some  threshold  k;  before 

wn=(1!s)nws=1!sn!an2the  threshold  is  reached,  there  is no  effect; with k or more mutations,  the organism  dies 
– the hatchet falls. 

Intuitively, the difference between asexual and sexual populations will then be as follows. 
In asexual populations, as before in the Muller’s ratchet model, deleterious mutations can 
only  accumulate  more  and  more,  until  they  reach  the  threshold  k.  Then,  one  more 
mutation  will  kill  individuals,  and  of  course  there  is  still  some  chance  that  individuals 
will get 0 new mutations, and survive.  In this situation, all individuals are ‘crowded’ in a 
peak  at  k  and  the  variance of  the population  is  quite  small.  Thus,  if  there  is,  say,  a 50% 
chance of a new mutation, ½ of  the population will die (since ½ will move from k to k+1 
mutations).  In  contrast,  consider  a  sexually  recombining  population.  In  this  case,  by 
recombination,  it  is  possible  for  a  new  individual  to  move  from  k  to  k-1  mutations. 
Below,  the  black  dots  are  deleterious  mutations  along  the  two  chromosomes  and  the 
dotted  lines  are  the  cross-over  points,  resulting  in  one  new  chromosome  with  fewer 
deleterious mutations than before (2 instead of  3): 

Thus, overall,  in a sexual species the total probability mass can be distributed much more 
broadly,  over  the  full  range  of  0,  1,  2,  …,  k–1 mutations.  If  we  now  apply  a  chance  of 
one  more  deleterious  mutation,  this  will  fall  not  on  the  entire  population  as  before,  but 
only  on  a  much  smaller  fraction,  say,  10%.  Thus,  the  selective  death  of  the  sexual 
population will  be much  less,  compared  to  the  asexual  one –  its overall  fitness  is  higher. 
It  is  this  selective  advantage  that  the  Kondrashov  model  can  quantify,  and  we  shall  see 
that  it can easily be much  larger  than  the 2-fold disadvantage of  sex.  We can summarize 
the model via the following picture: 

To  pursue  the  model  then.  We  start  by  considering  an  asexual  population.  Mutation  is 
added  as  with  the  Muller’s  ratchet  case:  each  generation,  every  offspring  receives  a 
Poisson-distributed number of new deleterious mutations.  The mean of  the Poission  is u. 
Through  time,  the  number  of  deleterious  mutations  in  any  asexual  lineage  will  increase 
until it reaches k.  From then on, any offspring with additional mutations will die.  After a 
sufficient period of time, every individual in the population will have exactly k mutations. 
From  this  point  on,  the  frequency  of  offspring  in  the  population  with  no  additional 
-u
mutations  is  just  the  0th  order  term  in  the  Poisson  distribution  with  mean  u,  i.e.,  e  . 
-u
Therefore, the probability that an offspring has one or more mutations (killing it) is 1–e  . 

At steady state, the mean fitness of the asexual population is thus: 

On  the  assumption  that  1  denotes  ‘the maximum  fitness,  and  anything  less  is worse,  we 
thus  have  that  the  ‘selectional  load’  L,  or  the maximum  fitness minus  the  actual  fitness, 
-u
relative to  the maximum fitness,  is 1–e  .  For example,  if  the (Poisson) mean number of 
new mutations is 2, then the load is 1–e-2, or 0.86. 

Now  consider  a  sexually  reproducing  population.  (It  is  perhaps  easiest  to  imagine  an 
asexual  population  turning  sexual.)  With  meiosis  and  crossing  over,  individuals  would 
appear  that  have  fewer  than  k  deleterious  mutations.  They  along  with  those  with  k 
mutations,  would  live,  while  those with more  than  k mutations would  die.  The  result  is 
that  the mean number of  deleterious alleles would be  less  than  in  the  asexual  population. 
With  sex,  selection  lowers  the mean number  of mutations per  individual, while mutation 
increases the number.  Eventually, steady state is reached where the selectional load must 
be lower than in the asexual case – let us see where the balance is. 

Kondrashov’s  hatchet  kills  off  all  offspring  with  more  than  k  mutations,  which  reduces 
the  average  number  of  deleterious  mutations  per  individual  by  an  amount  that  is  by 
definition  the  selectional  differential,  S,  where  S  is  the  mean  value  of  the  phenotype  of 
individuals  after  selection.  That  is,  S  measures  the  amount  by  which  selection  changes 
the  some  property  of  the  individuals,  in  this  case,  their  mean  number  of  mutations  –  it 
lowers  this,  as  remarked.  (If  this  were  some  other  quantitative  trait,  say,  number  of 
bristle  hairs  on  a  Drosophila,  or  height,  then  S  would  measure  how  much  selection 
‘pushes’  that  value  in  one  generation.)  At  steady  state,  S=u;  that  is,  the mean  number  of 
mutations  being  removed  by  selection  balances  the  mean  number  being  introduced. 
What  is the mutational  load at  this balance point?  We want  to know if this is sufficiently 
smaller than the asexual fitness ‘load’ to overcome the cost of sex. 

To  compute  this,  we  need  one  formula  that we  have  not  yet  derived,  which  is  called  the 
the  proportion  of  the  population  selected

the  total  number  of  mutations  per  individual  (the  spread  of  the  mutation  distribution). 
In  the  case  of  Drosophila,  Kondrashov  argued  that  u=2  and

=10,  which  means  that  i(p)  =  0.2.  If  we  do  some  numerical  computations  relating 
i(p)  back  to  the  actual  proportion  of  individuals  that must  be  ‘killed off’  (see below), we 
find  that  this  intensity  occurs  when  about  10%  of  the  population  is  killed  off  in  each 
generation.  This  is  the  ‘selectional  load’  of  a  sexual  population  at  steady-state.  Recall 
now  that  the  load  for  the  asexual  population with  the  same mutation  rate  u=2  was  0.86. 
The  ration  of  sexual  to  asexual  mean  fitness  for  each  is  one  minus  these  loads,  so  is 
roughly 0.9/0.14, or 6.4, easily  larger  than  the 2-fold cost of sex.  If u=1,  then  the benefit 
of sex also exceeds the cost.  This is another example, then, where we can plausibly show 
that the two-fold cost of sex might be countered by another force. 

Derivation of intensity of selection 
To  derive  the  formula  for  the  intensity  of  selection,  we  assume  that  the  parental 
phenotype  follows  a  normal  distribution  (e.g.,  the  distribution  of  number  of  deleterious 
alleles  is  normally  distributed).  So  we  get  a  picture  like  this,  where  α  represents  the 
proportion of parents that are selected.  The mean midpoint of selection parents, as shown 
S
in the figure is  , the selection differential. 

If  we  denote  by  VP  the  variance  of  the  parental  phenotypes,  then  the  probability  density 
of the parents with mean 0 is this: 

The proportion 

p 
that is selected is the hatched area from  on, or: 
α

where  α  is  the  largest  number  that  is  less  than  the  values  of  the  selected  parents.  The 
proportion  may  be  simplified  by  changing  the  variable  of  integration  to 

yielding:

the shaded  area in  the figure.  The density of  the  selected parents  (parents can be dense), 
is the truncated normal density, 

where C is chosen to make the integral of the density equal to one, 

The mean of the selected parents is thus 

We simplify this by changing the variable of integration as before to
