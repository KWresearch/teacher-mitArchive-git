Outline of Lecture 1, 9/7 

1.	 What does a theory of evolution have to explain about the world around us – if anything? 
•	 Adaptation.  Why  do  organisms  ‘fit’  their  environment?  (Like  a  lock  and  key ).  This 
characteristic  of  ‘good  design’ was  a  key  element  of  the  ‘natural  theologians’  account  of 
the  ‘goodness’  of  the  Creator’s  universe.  Example:  orchid  and  insect  with  long  tongue 
than  can  fertilize  it.  Darwin’s  book:  Various  Contrivances  by  which  Orchids  and 
Fertilized  by  Insects,  documented  that  the  intimate  relationship  between  insects  and  the 
flowers  that  they pollinated was matched by  their structural compatibility and  the insect’s 
behavior. On  the strength of his observations, Darwin made bold  to predict  that  the insect 
that  pollinated  an  orchid  (Angraecum  arachnites,  found  in  Madagascar)  with  nectaries 
that were  11  inches  long would  be a moth with  a  proboscis  that  long!  125  years  later  the 
moth (Panogena lingens) was discovered. 
•	 Historical  change.  Organisms  change  over  time.  (How  do  we  know  this?  Question:  why 
do they change over time?) Is ‘evolution’ to be equated with ‘historical change’? 
•	 Complexity.  Why  isn’t  the  universe  filled  with  a  uniform  grey  goo?  Why  do  organisms 
have  structure  at  all  –  is  this  an  intrinsic  property  of  organisms  or  an  extrinsic  one  (or 
both)? Is it just because the environment is complex? 
•	 Variation.  Organisms  differ.  Why  are  there  so  many  different  kinds  of  organisms?  In 
detail:  why  do  all  fish  have  vertical  fins,  but  all  cetaceans  (whales,  dolphins,…) 
horizontal  fins?  (both  seem  to  work  equally  well).  We  seem  to  have  two  amino  acid 
differences  in  a  certain  protein,  FOXP2,  implicated  in  motor-neural  development,  as 
compared  to  our  nearest  relatives,  chimpanzees  (Pan  paniscus),  and  it’s  been  asserted 
that  this  difference  plays  a  role  in  why  we  talk  and  chimps  don’t.  Was  there  ‘selection’ 
for  the  gene  that  codes  for  this  protein?  How  could  we  figure  this  out?  Can  we  figure 
this out? 
Similarity. The flip side of variation – organisms resemble each other, at almost any  level 
of description you  can  name –  from  the bones  in  a bird’s wing  and  a person’s  arm,  to  the 
individual nucleotides  in  their DNA.  The  three  taxon  hypothesis  says  that  all  life  can  be 
organized into a ‘family resemblance tree’ such  that any two organisms will have a (least) 
common ancestor (LCA), and  that ancestor will, in  turn, be related  to the third organism – 
the  LCA  and  the  other  organism  will  themselves  have  a  joint,  least  common  ancestor. 
This  implies  evolution  by  descent  – Darwin’s  theme.  Is  it  true?  How  can  we  tell? Much 
of current genomic research is, of course, predicated on  this assumption. 
•	 Clumping.  Putting  variation  and  similarity  together:  organisms  seemed  to  be  ‘clumped’ 
into  groups,  no  matter  how  you  want  to  measure  them  (by  their  morphology,  gene 
frequencies ,  whatever).  We  may  imagine  drawing  a  (huge)  space  with  ‘notional’  axes 
representing  each  possible  dimension  of  variation,  fo r  example,  the  set  of  all  genome 
sequences.  No matter  what measure we pick,  the  space will be very , very  sparsely  filled 
(do you believe this?). 

•	

2.	 We  might  depict  any  model  for  ‘evolutionary’  change  as  a  sequence  of  states  over  time,  x1, 
x2, … where  there  is  some map , T,  that  carries  the  state x  into  a next  state x’.  In general, we 
say  that  a  discrete  dynamical  system  consists  of  a  map  T  from  a  space  x  onto  itself.  (We 
haven’t  said  anything much yet  about  constraints  that  characterize T or x,  e.g., x  could be  the 
set  of  all  the  genes  in  an  organism,  or  their  frequencies  in  the  overall  population  of 
organisms; or  it  could  be  a  list of all  the  traits  in  a  (set of organisms) –  whatever  a  ‘trait’  is  -
and T  could be differentiable).  As  is usual , we may  imagine  that  this map  can  be  iterated: x, 
Tx, T(Tx),...Tkx . This  sequence  is  called  the orbit of x. It will  be convenient to write  the map 

in  the form, x´= Tx, or as x´-x= Tx-x .  Equations of the  second  type are called reccurrence or 
difference equations. We give an explicit example short ly. 

3.	 The  general  problem  is  one  of  constructing  a  state  space  that  will  be  dynamically  sufficient, 
and  a  set  of  laws  of  transformation  in  that  state  space  that  will  transform  all  the  state 
variables.  The  laws  also  have  to  be  empirically  sufficient.  This  entails  an  interchange 
between  finding  the  laws  and  picking  the  right  state  variables,  to  predict  a  future  state  x´ 
given  a  current  x. The  transformational  laws  cannot  be  arbitrary  –  usually  they  contain  some 
parameters  P  that  are  not  themselves  a  function  of  time  or  the  state  of  the  system.  Second, 
the  laws  contain  the elapsed  time except  in  the case of equilibrium, and may or may not  refer 
specifically  to  the absolute  time  t  depending on whether  the  system carries  in  its present state 
some  history  of  the  past.  Finally, most  importantly,  the  laws  of  transfo rmation must  contain 
the  present  state  of  the  system  and  suffice  to  produce  the  next  state.  Example  –  you  can’t 
predict  the future position of a satellite from its current position alone. You need  to know 3-D 
position, velocity, and acceleration – 9 variables in all, and that is dynamically sufficient. 

4.	 So  what  about  for  evolutionary  theory?  What  is  the  state  space?  What  are  the  laws  of 
transformation?  It  is  important to stress  that we can’t go out and describe the world any way 
we want  and demand  that  an  explanatory  and descriptive  theory  be built on  that  description – 
it  might  be  dynamically  insufficient.  This  has  important  consequences,  because  to  model 
evolution we will necessarily build such dynamical sys tems – but  this  takes some care.  What 
kind of ‘force’ is evolution?  What are the state variables? 

5.	 Much  of  the  remainder  of  this  course  will  consist  in  characterizing  and  exploring  the 
dynamical  system  behavior  of  T  and  x: 
rate  of  evolution;  convergence  times;  stability 
properties; measurement  and  inference problems  – how can  we  tell  from a current  state, what 
has  happened  in  the  past;  how  can  we  measure  the  ‘forces’  of  evolution;  how  various 
characterizations of T and x; how sensitive our these models to our assumptions. 

6.	 We  may 
for  evolutionary  change, 
‘modes’  of  accounting 
two  distinct 
identify 
transformational  and  variational.  Transformational  theories  have  been  the  most  widespread 
for  explaining  historical  change.  The  prototypical  transformational  example  is  stellar 
evolution.  In  transformational  evolution,  the  properties of  each  individual  in  a group  change, 
and,  as  a  result,  the  overall  group  compositional  properties  change.  This  explanatory  mode 
was  also  common  to  perhaps  the most  popular  view  of  biological  evolutionary  change  in  the 
1700s,  given  the  name  Lamarckism 
(after  Jean-Bap tiste  Monet,  Chevalier  de  Lamarck), 
although  he  did  not  originate  this  approach.  Like  stellar  evolution,  on  this  view  biological 
change  too  is  transformational:  all  individual  organisms  making  up  a  population  change  – 
each  giraffe’s  neck  gets  longer  reaching  for  the  treetops  –  and  as  a  result  of  individual 
change, the population property in question as a whole changes. 

7.	

In  contrast,  Darwin  seems  to  have  been  the  first  to  introduce  a  completely  novel  account  for 
evolution,  the  variational mode  of  evolutionary  explanation.  In  a  variational  story,  no  single 
individual  undergoes  evolutionary  change  within  its  lifetime.  Rather,  already  existing 
variation  among  individuals  is  selected  (sieved)  and  the  group  population  property  as  an 
ensemble  changes because different  individuals  are  selected  to make up  the group. Or:  In  the 
variational mode,  there  is variation  among  the  individual units  comprising  the whole  system. 
The system changes  in  time by a change in  the proportions of the different kinds of units, as a 
consequence  of  differential  survival  and  reproduction  of  the  units.  In  Darwin’s  scheme,  the 
group  as  a  whole  changes  through  time  because  objects  with  different  properties  leave 
different numbers of descendants. 

8.	

It  is  important  to understand  that different domains of phenomena evolve by different modes. 
The  transformational  mode,  which  is  correct  for  galaxies  and  embryos,  is  not  correct  for 
species. 

9.	 The  essential  nature  of  the  Darwinian  revolution  was  not  the  introduction  of  evolution  as  a 
worldview.  This  is  historically  not  the  case.  It  is  rather  the  replacement  of  a  metaphysical 
view  of  variation  among  organisms  by  a  materialistic  view.  Darwin’s  materialistic  view 
replaced  the  Aristotelian,  Platonic  conception  that  there  is  a  single  ideal  ‘type’  –  an  ideal 
squirrel,  or whale,  or  E.  coli  –  and  so,  and  that  the  ‘failings’  of  organisms  in  their  perfection 
of  adaptation  somehow  to  be  related  to  their  failure  attain  this  ideal  –  they  are  imperfect 
approximations  to  their ‘true nature.’  The  failure of individual cases  to match  the ideal was a 
measure  of  the  imperfection  of  nature.  (Compare  this  to  the  Newtonian  idealizations  about 
frictionless  planes,  etc.)  Darwin  overthrew  this  metaphysical  picture  and  replaced  it  with  a 
materialistic  one:  what  matters  in  Darwinian  evolution  by  natural  selection  is  the  actual 
variation  in actual  individuals.  This  individual variation  is of the essence – as we’ll see many 
times  in  the  course:  the  rate  of  evolution  by  natural  selection  is  directly  proportional  to  the 
amount  of  standing  variation.  Variation  is  the  fuel  that  evolution  burns.  (And  in  addition, 
unlike a fire, evolution has to ‘make’ its own fuel .) 

10.  So:  Darwin’s  explanation  for  the  ‘clumping’  that  we  see  in  the  biological  world  is  the 
conversion  of  the  standing  variation  between  individuals  into  variation  between  species  and 
groups. 

11. All  ‘vulgar’  versions  of  evolution  at  the  time  of  Darwin  thus  already  included  variation  and 
inheritance.  Darwin  added  the  key  notion  of  selection ,  dubbed  natural  selection  by  analogy 
with  the  artificial  selection  that  Darwin  observed  amongst  pigeon,  dog,  horse  breeders. 
Selection  ‘sieves’  existing  variation  by  letting  ‘pass  through’  individuals  with  certain 
properties,  but  not  other  properties  –  like  panning  for  gold.  Inheritance  then  transmits  these 
individuals,  with  their  selected  properties,  to  the  next  generation.  These  comprise  the  three 
key components of Darwin’s theory: 
a.	 Variation: Among individual members within any population, there is variation (in 
genes, morphology, physiology, behavior, …) 
b.	 Heredity (information transmission): Offspring resemble their parents more than they 
resemble individuals to which  they are unrelated 
c.	 Selection: Some forms are more successful at surviving and reproducing than other 
forms in a given environment. (aka,  the ‘misnomer’ “survival of the fittest”) 
It  is  a  valuable  exercise  to  consider  whether  these  three  components  are  necessary  and 
sufficient  for  evolution  by  natural  selection  –  alternatively,  whether  it  is  possible  to  design 
some  other  system  that  would  work  to  create  the  living  world  around  us.  At  least 
superficially,  it  should  be  clear  that  without  variation,  evolution  can  do  nothing  –  there  is 
nothing  that  selection  can  do  to  separate  out  a  group  with  different  ensemble  properties . 
Similarly, without some fo rm of inheritance, a differen tially selected set of  individuals would 
not be  ‘passed on’  to  future generations.  And of course, some kind of  selection must be part 
of ‘natural selection’. 

12.  But  what  sort  of  variation,  heredity,  and  selection?  Consider  heredity.  There  are  interesting 
constraints  on  the  kind  of  ‘information  transmission’  systems  that  can 
(easily)  lead  to 
evolution by natural  selection.  One of  these  constraints was  first  driven home  in perhaps  the 
most  devastating  review of Origin of Species –  at  least  the one  that  troubled Darwin  the most 
- by  the Scottish engineer Fleeming Jenkin. This EECS pioneer almost sunk Darwin’s  theory. 
Jenkin’s  point  had  to  do  with  the  nature  of  inheritance.  In  Darwin’s  time,  the  most  widely 
accepted  notion  of  ‘inheritance’  was  essentially  that  of  blending  inheritance  - ‘mixing  by 

blood’ –  like blending paint  (a very old  idea).  But  blending  inheritance  runs  afoul  of natural 
selection’s  demand  for  variation.  It  is  easy  to  see  that  if  in  fact  inheritance  worked  by 
blending,  then  any  variation would  be  quickly  swamped within  a  few  generations  –  in  fact  it 
is  halved  at  ever  generation  –  and  so  turned  into  a  kind  of  uniform  brown mud. We  wind  up 
with  nothing  for  natural  selection  to  ‘select’.  Darwin  himself  was  unable  to  refute  this 
argument ,  and  wound  up  embracing  Lamarck’s  inheritance  of  acquired  characteristics,  along 
with  a  theory  of  ‘hyper  mutation’  that  would  pump  in  enough  variation  to  keep  selection 
going  (if ½  of  all  variation  is  lost  each  generation,  then ½  the  variation we  see  in  the  current 
generation must be due to mutations introduced by the immediately preceding generation). 

13.  The problem was  resolved by Mendel’s discovery  that  inheritance is quantal, or particulate in 
nature,  and  not  blending  (the  particles  of  course  ultimately  turned  out  to  be  genes).  R.A. 
Fisher  (1911,  1930)  demonstrated  exactly  how  blending  inheritance  would  halve  variance  at 
each  generation:  Let  x  denote  the  deviation  of  one  parent  from  the  mean  of  any  trait  (e.g., 
height,  or  “Paul Newman  blue  eyes”),  and  y  denote  the  deviation  from  the  mean  of  that  trait 
for  the  other  parent.  The  variance  of  the  trait  is  the  expected  (mean)  value  of  the  square  of 
deviations  from  the  mean ,  or  E[x2].  On  the  model  of  perfect  blending  inheritance,  then  the 
deviation  of  the  offspring  would  be  ½(x+y)  –  exactly  half-way  in  between.  We  can  now 
calculate  the  expected value  of  the  square  of  this deviation: E[{½(x+y)}2]=E[¼  (x2+2xy+y2)]. 
The  quantity  E(xy)  must  be  zero ,  since  the  expected  value  of  deviations  from  the  mean  is 
always 0.  The expected value of x2= the expected value of y2, so we have, E[¼ (x2+2xy+y2)]=
2
E[¼(2x ]=E[½ (x2)]= ½ E[x ] – that  is, exactly half the original variance. Thus under blending 
2
inheritance  variance  declines  exponentially  with  each  generation.  We  also  must  show  how 
‘particulate’  inheritance  removes  this  problem.  Intuitively,  if  inheritance  works  via  ‘quanta’ 
that  we  call  genes,  and  these  genes  are  not  blended  –  neither  created  nor  destroyed  –  during 
reproduction, then  the variance remains constant (all other things  like mutation being equal) – 
we  can  juggle  a  handful  of  different  colored  jelly  beans  around,  and  mix  them,  but  the 
individual  numbers  of  different  colored  jelly  beans  will  remain  the  same.  This  can  be 
demonstrated  more  precisely  via  the  so-called  “Hardy-Weinberg  laws”,  which  we  turn  to 
below.  Sadly,  though Mendel’s work was published during Darwin’s  lifetime –  Darwin  even 
had a copy of Mendel’s publications – it seems  that he never read about  them, and  the articles 
were found uncut (unopened) in Darwin’s  library at  the  time of his death.  Mendel’s algebraic 
system  evidently  did  not  appeal  to  Darwin,  who  claimed  in  his  autobiography  to  be  all  in  a 
muddle about mathematics. 

14.  We next pursue an  elaboration of  the notion of a dynamical  system mapping  as our model of 
evolutionary  change.  We  describe  any  (array  of)  organisms  via  two  key  descriptive  spaces: 
Genotype  space  and  Phenotype  space.  By  “genotype”  we  mean  the  full  array  of  genes  in  an 
organism or  set of organisms  (for now,  think  of it as  a very  long  vector, say, 20,000  elements 
in  the case of humans.)  For now we don’t  say  what  the  ‘axes’ are  in  this  space.  Genes occur 
in  variants,  called  alleles.  The  variants  within  a  species,  over  all  genes,  specify  distinct 
genotypes.  For  example,  we  saw  that  there  is  a  particular  gene  that  specifies  normal  human 
hemoglobin  in  red  blood  cells,  and  another,  which  differs  in  exactly  one  DNA  ‘letter’  (the 
nucleotide adenine, A, is replaced by a thymine, T), whose corresponding protein has a valine 
instead  of  a  glutamic  acid,  which  in  turn  yields  a  hemoglobin  that  forms  ‘bent’  crystals  and 
causes  red  blood  cells  to  become  crooked  and  ‘sickle’  shaped  instead  normally  elliptical. 
These  are  two  alleles  of  the  gene  fo r  hemoglobin  (more  precisely,  the  beta-chain  of  one  part 
of  hemoglobin),  or  two  ‘genotypes’.  By  “phenotype”  we  mean  the  ‘form  that  shows’  –  i.e., 
the  actual  biological  form  that  an  organism  presents  to  the  world  (and  so  casually  interacts 
with  it  in  the  sense  of  affecting  the  outcome  of  select ion).  In  our  example,  the  two  distinct 
hemoglobins (and consequently distinct red blood cell shapes) are two different ‘phenotypes’. 
Of  course,  genotypes  can  also  differ  between  species  as  well  as  between  individuals.  A 
genotype, then, is simple the string of nucleic acids, the  ‘genetic code’ that make up  the DNA 

of  an  individual  organism. Selection  acts  on  phenotypes  (note  that we  have  been  a  bit  vague 
as  to whether a phenotype might  include the notion of a genotype or DNA sequence – doesn’t 
this  casually  interact with  the world? More  later.)  In  the case  of normal vs. sickle-shaped  red 
blood  cells,  we  know  that  the  latter  are  extremely  deb ilitating  and  lead  to  early  death  –  the 
sickle-cell  phenotype  is  ‘selected  against’.  We  stress  that  a  full  evolutionary  theory  must 
pass  back  and  forth  between  these  spaces  by  means  of  (as  yet)  unspecified,  and  current 
unknown, mappings.  Here is a picture: 

15. 

If we  start off  in genotype space, in some state G0 , then we must pass back  and forth between 
genotype  space  and  phenotype  space  several  times  in  order  to  reach  the  next  possible 
genotype  state  G0’:  first,  the  genotype  must  be  realized  as  a  phenotype  P0;  (the  actual 
organisms)  –  this  via  a  set  of  ‘developmental  laws’  T0  that  turn  genotypes  into  organisms; 
then  these organisms must meet and mate, again via some set of laws T1; then  the mated pairs 
produce the ‘raw’ DNA,  the gametes (e.g ., egg and sperm), which brings us back  to genotype 
space  via  another  mapping  T2  specifying  how  gametes  get  produced  from  mated  organisms; 
the  genes  then  reassort  and  combine  via  the  rules  commonly  known  as  Mendelism,  T3;  then 
the  fertilized  egg(s)  (a  zygote) develops  into offspring, via developmental  transformations T4; 
natural  selection  then  acts  on  the offspring,  winnowing  them,  T5;  then  finally  these  surviving 
offspring produce an array of genotypes (via their games, i.e., sperm and eggs) which become 
the  new  G0’  to  start  the  process  all  over  again.  Whew.  It  almost  goes  without  saying  that 
except  in  extremely  limited  cases we have no  knowledge whatsoever about  these T’s, or how 
to compute them.  We can say, however, that our theory will have to be both dynamically and 
empirically  sufficient.  As  it  stands,  to  do  this  would  result  in  a  theory  concerning  a  vastly 
more complex domain than any yet dealt with by physics or molecular biology. 

(Aside 1: We should remark  that even under naïve assumptions  the size of these spaces might 
be  enormous  –  for  example,  suppose  we  take  genotype  space  to  be  ‘discrete’  and  consist  of 
the  set  of  possible  gene  sequences  for  an  organism. 
If  there  are  10 ,000  genes  in  an 
organism’s  gene  sequence  –  not  far  off  - with  3  gene  types  or  ‘alleles’  each,  that  amounts  to 
10,000  possible  genotypes  or  ‘points’  in  this  space.)  (Aside  2:  as  correctly  pointed  out,  we 
3
really  ought  to  included  another  space  in  this  analysis,  namely,  the  external  environment  or 
context in which G and P reside.) 

16.  If  we  have  no  knowledge  of  these  T  mappings  then  how  can  evolutionary  biology  proceed? 
In fact, there are two moves  that are made, the obvious ones.  We can either ‘assume away’ P, 
and do our modeling only  in genotype space; or we can assume away G, and do our modeling 
only  in  phenotype  space.  Both  strategies  are  adopted.  We  can  collapse  G=P,  and  work 
entirely  in  Phenotype  space.  This  is  the  province  of  biometrics  –  we  put  this  to  one  side  for 
now.  Or,  we  can  collapse  G  and  P,  and  work  entirely  in  genotype  space.  This  is  the  strategy 
of  most  of  evolutionary  population  genetics:  to  study  the  origin  and  dynamics  of  genetic 
variation within populations. 

17.  While  this  is  a  much  more  modest  goal  that  all  of  evolutionary  theory,  it  is  an  essential 
ingredient.  If  we  adopt  this  subgoal,  we  are  in  effect  equating  evolution  as  “change  in  gene 
frequencies”,  as  is  common  in  this  approach.  However,  while  population  genetics  has much 
to  say  about  changes  or  the  stability  of  the  frequencies  of genes  in  populations  and  about  the 
rate  of  divergences  in  gene  frequencies  in  populations,  it  has  contributed  little  to  our 
understanding of speciation and nothing to our understanding of extinction. 

18. Still,  the  sufficient  set  of  state  variables  for  describing  an  evolutionary  process  within  a 
population  must  include  some  information  about  the  statistical  distribution  of  gene 
frequencies .  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  empirical  and  mathematical  study  of  population 
genetics  has  always  begun  with  and  centered  on  the  characterization  of  the  genetic  variation 
in populations. 
19. We  begin  then  by  adopting  the  “evolution  as  change  in  gene  frequencies”  view,  and 
describing  the  simplest  dynamical  system modeling  this. We  want  to  know what  theory  says 
about  the  reproduction  of  genotypes  in  a  population.  This  results  in  the  derivation  of  the  so-
called  Hardy-Weinberg  proportions.  We  imagine  a  population  reproducing  without  any 
natural  selection  or  any  interference  by  any  other  forces  such  as  mutation  or  migration.  The 
Hardy-Weinberg  result  serves  as  a kind of “Newton’s  First Law”  fo r  the genetics  of evolving 
populations,  because  it  says  that  under  such  conditions gene  frequencies  (and  their  variance) 
will  “remain  at  rest” –  that  is, gene  frequency  proportions will  remain  in  equilibrium  as  long 
as  there  is  no  other  force  to  disturb  them.  We  use  this  as  a  ‘baseline’  model  and  then 
introduce selection, migration, etc. as  ‘forces’ that disp lace a population from its equilibrium. 
H-W  is  the  second half of  the demonstration  that Mendelism actually goes hand-in-hand with 
Darwin’s  theory  –  it  is  virtually  a  necessary  part  of  Darwinism,  since  it  serves  to  maintain 
variation  unless  there  is  some  other  force  to  disturb  it.  It would  be  an  interesting  exercise  to 
see  whether  one  could  develop  an  alternative  that  could  replace Mendelism,  and  still  get  the 
conditions for the evolution of complex life. 
20. The Hardy-Weinberg “law” is based on following assumptions: 
•	 A single random mating population 
Infinitely many individuals (Why do we need this assumption? Follow it out in the 
•	
analysis below) 
•	 No mutation 
•	 No selection (no differential fertility, viability) 
•	 No immigration or emigration 
•	 Non-overlapping generations 

21.  Suppose we have one gene that comes  in  two variants, or alleles, denoted A and a.  If we have 
genotypes with  current  genotype  frequencies  P,  Q,  and  R  of  genotypes  AA,  Aa,  and  aa,  they 
have  a  fraction  p  =  P  +  1/2  Q  of  their  genes  being  A  rather  than  a .  The  value  p  is  the  gene 
frequency  (note  the  difference  between  gene  frequency  and  a  genotype  frequency,  e.g.,  P). 
The  gene  frequency  of  the  a  allele  is,  for  the  same  reasons,  q  =  1/2  Q+R.  These  can  also  be 
computed by counting the fractions of A and a among the individuals. 

22.  Random  mating  is  equivalent  to  random  union  of  gametes.  Imagine  making  a  pot  of  female 
gametes ,  a  pot  of  male  gametes,  and  drawing  a  pair,  one  from  each .  The  equivalence  comes 
because  a  random  member  of  the  offspring  generation  is  descended  from  a  random  female 
and  a  random  male,  and  Mendelian  inheritance  ensures  that  the  gametes  each  contributes 
contain  a  random  one  of  the  two  copies  (at  this  locus)  in  that  individual.  Drawing  a  random 
parent,  and  then  having  it  choose  one  of  the  two  copies  by  Mendelian  segregation,  is 
equivalent  to  drawing  one of  the copies  from  the population  at  random. [Indeed ,  the variance 

of this draw,  in  the case of just  two alleles  in  fractions p and (1-p ) is ½ p(1-p) as per standard 
sampling  theory  from  a  binomial  distribution,  a  result  we  shall  draw  on  below  –  or  refer  to 
appendix A in your Sean Rice textbook. 

23.  The  probability  that  the  offspring  gets  an  A  from  the  female  parent  is  p,  and  the  probability 
that  it  gets  an  A  from  the male  parent  is  also  p .  Because  these  are  independent  as  a  result  of 
random mating, the probability that the individual is AA is then p2. 

24.  The result is that AA, Aa, and aa have expected genotype frequencies p2, 2pq and q .

25.  The gene frequency in this offspring population is again p, since in that generation P is p2  and 
Q is 2pq, so that p = P + 1/2 Q = p2  + 1/2 (2pq) = p . 

26.  If we again mate these individuals randomly, the gene frequencies in the second generation 
are again p and q. 

27.  Thus the genotype frequencies become these “Hardy-Weinberg” proportions, and stay  that 
way forever. The gene frequencies remain forever p. If we are talking about just one gene 
‘location’ (= “locus”) then  the frequencies for two alleles are forever p and (1-p). 

28.	 Mendelian genetic systems thus do not tend to lose genetic variability just because of random 
mating.  Blending  inheritance  would  lose  it.  The  fundamental  reason  is  that  segregation  in  a 
heterozygote yields  gametes  that  are  1/2  A  and 1/2 a, whereas  in blending  inheritance  it  is  as 
if  they  were  all  medium-sized  A’s .  [Q:  what  would  happen  in  a  non-Mendelian  world? 
Variation lost?  No evolution of complex life?] 

29.  When we relax  the assumption of no differential viability and no differential fertility, we now 
have natural  selection  going on.  We can  count  genes  to  define  the notion of absolute  fitness. 
More about this next time.
