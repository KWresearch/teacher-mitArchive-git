1. Rates of amino acid replacement 
The initial motivation for  the neutral  theory came from observations on  the rate of amino 
acid  replacements  in  proteins. When  extrapolated  to  the  entire  genome,  the  inferred  rate 
of  evolution  was  several  nucleotide  substitutions  per  year.  This  rate  was  regarded  as 
much  to  high  to  result  from  natural  selection,  because  the  intensity  of  selection must  be 
limited  by  the  total  amount  of  differential  survival  and  reproduction  that  occurs  in  the 
organism.  Direct  DNA  sequencing  later  revealed  that  rates  of  nucleotide  substitution 
vary according to the function or presumed absence of function of the nucleotides. 
The  first  18  amino  acids  in  the  amino  terminal  end  of  the  human  and  mouse  gamma 
interferon  proteins  are  a  signal  peptide  that  is  used  in  the  secretion  of  molecules.  The 
sequences are: 

Hum: Met Lys Try Thr Ser Tyr Ile Leu Ala Phe Gln Leu Cys Ile Val Leu Gly Ser

Mou: Met Asn Ala Thr His Tyr Cys Leu Ala Leu Gln Leu Phe Leu Met Ala Val Ser


We  could  simply  count  the  number  of  sites  that  differ  in  the  two  sequences:  there  are 
10/18 that differ, or 0.56. 
To  interpret  this,  let  us  assume  that  amino  acid  replacements  occur  at  the  rate  λ  per  unit 
time.  Consider  two  independently evolving sequences,  initially  identical, which at  time t 
are found  to differ  in proportion Dt  of their amino acids.  After  the next  time interval,  the 
proportion  of  differences  is  just  Dt+1=  (1–Dt)(2λ)+Dt,  so  we  add  to  the  already  existing 
proportion  of  differences  those  that  might  have  arisen  in  the  current  time  interval.  The 
factor  of  2  is present  because  the  total  time  for  evolution  is 2t  time  units  (t  units  in  each 
lineage).  The  equation  ignores  the  unlikely  possibility  of  an  amino  acid  replacement 
making two previously different sites identical. 
If  λ  is  the  rate  of  amino  acid  replacement  per  unit  time,  then  the  probability  that  a 
particular  site  remains  unsubstituted  for  t  consecutive  intervals  along  each  of  two 
independent  lineages  is  (1-λ)2t  which  is approximately  e –2λt  if λt  is not  too  large.  So,  the 
probability of 1 or more replacements is just 1 minus this quantity, or about (1–e –2λt). 

Since  λ  is  the  rate  of  amino  acid  replacement  per  unit  time,  the  expected  proportion  of 
differences  between  two  sequences  at  any  time  t  is K=2λt.  Substituting  and  rearranging 
gives  the  estimate  of  K  from  the  observed  differences  K  =  –ln(1–Dt).  This  quantity  is 
used  in  preference  to  D  because  it  takes  multiple  substitutions  into  account,  especially 
over a long period of time. 

Rates  of  amino  acid  substitution  vary  over  a  500-fold  range  in  different  proteins.  The 
rate  of  amino  acid  replacement  in  gamma  interferon  is  one  of  the  largest  rates  known. 

Among  the  slowest  rates  is  that  of  histone H4,  for which  the  substitution  rate λ  is 0.01 x 
-9  per  year.  The  average  rate  for  many  proteins  is  very  close  to  the  rate  found  in 
10
hemoglobin, which is about 1 x 10-9  amino acid replacement per amino acid site per year. 

So  far  we  have  done  our  computations  on  polymorphism  sequences  based  on  just  the 
observed counts, all on the assumption that we were looking at individuals from the same 
species.  However, when we look across species,  or even within species,  if  the time since 
common  divergence  is  long  enough,  there  is  always  the  possibility  that  the  same 
nucleotide  site  position  could  have  changed  more  than  once.  For  example,  position  1, 
say,  could  first  be  an A;  then  be  substituted with  a T;  and  then once more back  to A.  In 
this  case,  we would  not  ‘see’  any  change  from  the  ancestral  state  even  though  a  change 
had occurred.  We call this a ‘multiple hit’.  (So in a way this relaxes the constraint of the 
infinite  sites  model.)  In  general  then,  the  number  of  nucleotide  substitutions  that  we 
observe,  and  that  we  have  been  calling  mutations,  are  always  an  undercount  of  the  true 
number.  There  are many models  of  nucleotide  substitutions  that  have  been  proposed  to 
provide a ‘correction factor’ for this possibility. 

Nucleotide  sequences  are  analyzed  in  the  same manner  as  amino  acid  sequences,  but we 
have  to  correct  for  cases where  a  substitution makes  two  previously  different  nucleotide 
sites  identical.  This  is  significant  because  an  expected  1/3  of  random  substitutions  will 
make  two  previously  different  nucleotides  identical,  while  the  chance  is  only  1/19  for 
amino acids. 

Many  models  of  nucleotide  substitution  have  been  proposed,  which  differ  mostly  in  the 
assumptions  about  rates  of  mutations  between  pairs  of  nucleotides.  The  simplest  model 
for  nucleotide  substitution  assumes  that  mutation  occurs  at  a  constant  rate,  and  each 
nucleotide  is  equally  likely  to  mutate  to  any  other,  the  Jukes-Cantor  model.  If  α  is  the 
rate of mutating from one nucleotide to another, then in any time interval, A mutates to C 
with  probability  α,  A  mutates  to  T  with  probability  α,  and  A  mutates  to  G  with 
probability α. The probability  that  it does not mutate in  this time interval  is therefore (1– 
3α),  The  probability  that  a  particular  site  is  A  at  time  t+1  is  the  probability  of  having 
been A at time t and not mutating, plus the probability of being at any other nucleotide an 
mutating  to  A:  PA(t+1)=  (1–3α)PA(t) +α(1–PA(t)  ).  From  this  we  can  obtain  a  simple 
differential equation: 

which as we know show has the solution: 

To solve this, we can use an integrating factor, multiplying both sides by f(t): 

dPA(t)dt=!4"PA(t)+ "PA(t)=14+34e!4"tSubstitution this value for f, we get: 

To  find  the  value  of  C,  we  use  the  fact  that  at  time  t=0,  PA(0)=1  (we  start  at  A).  This 
gives us: 

If we observe two sequences that have been  separated for  time t,  then  the probability  that 
they continue to carry the same nucleotide at a particular site is: 

The  proportion  of  sites  that  differ  between  the  two  sequences  is  just  1  minus  this,  or 
D=(1–PAA). Therefore, 

In  our  previous  symbols,  λ  is  the  rate  of  mutation  to  a  nucleotide  different  from  the 
current  nucleotide,  so  relating  this  to  α,  we  have  λ=3α. 
This  implies  that 
K=2λt=2(3α)=6αt. Taking logs of both sides of the equation above, we get: 

and since K=3/4(8αt), 

This is the Jukes-Cantor correction factor.  If one lets t go  to  infinity,  the divergence will 
approach  ¾  ,  which  makes  sense:  after  enough  time,  the  common  ancestry  of  the  two 
sequences has been erased, and ¼ of all sites will match by chance.

If  25%  of  observed  sites  are  different,  D=0.25,  then  plugging  this  into  the  formula,  the 
actual number of substitutions is K=0.3404, higher, as expected. 

Felsenstein’s intuitive picture. 
To  construct  a  more  general  picture,  we  can  posit  a  4x4  transition  probability  matrix, 
whose  entries give  the probability  that  a particular  site will  change  to  another  site  in one 
time-step.  Let  u  be  the  mutation  rate  per  unit  per  site;  Pij=  the  probability  that  base  i 
changes  to  base  j  in one generation.  If  t  is  large  and u  is  small, we  can  approximate  the 
process as a Poisson, on a continuous scale, with a constant risk of mutation.  Note that if 
we  had  a  type  of  mutation  that  changed  a  base  to  any  one  of  the  four  bases  chosen  at 
random,  with  equal  probability  of  the  four  outcomes,  it  would  almost  be  like  Jukes-
Cantor,  except  that  ¼  of  the  time  it  would  make  no  change  at  all  (it  would  do  nothing, 
i.e.,  no  event  would  occur  at  all).  Now  we  imagine  that  we  alter  this  new  model  by 
increasing  the  mutation  rate  to  4/3u.  In  this  (rescaled)  model,  the mutations  that  change 
the bases occur at rate u, continuously in time (this includes the events that change, e.g., a 
base A to the same base A). 

Now  this  is  just  a  Poisson  model  with  mean  rate  of  change  4/3u,  so  we  can  write  the 
probability that k mutations occur, given that time t has passed, as follows: 

Now  we  can  easily  compute  the  probability  that  we  wind  up  with  base  j  having  started 
with  a base  i. The probability  that  zero base-changing  events occur  at  all  during  time  t  is 
just  the  0th  term  of  the  Poisson,  which  is  just  exp(–4/3ut)  (The  (4/3u) term  drops  out 
j
when j=0, as usual.).  Therefore, the probability that there is at least one event that picks a 
base ¼ at random is 1–this probability, or (1–exp(–4/3ut)).  ¼ of the time this change will 
be to some particular base. Putting this all together, we have: 

because  in  the  second  case we must  add  the  probability  that  no  base-changing  event  has 
happened  at  all,  leaving us at base  i.  Thus,  if we add up  the  expected  proportion  of sites 
that  two sequences will differ after  time t,  it is just 3  times the first case above, giving us 
the expected fraction of sites that differing: 

Note  that  the  re-parameterization  via  the  ut  term  is  meant  to  replace  the  parameter  K  in 
the  earlier  derivation:  the  value  of  t  here  is  actually  the  time  2t  (total  divergence  time 
since common ancestor) given earlier.

The  Jukes-Cantor model  suffers  from  several  biological  inaccuracies.  For  one  thing,  all 
transitions  are  assumed  equal.  However,  it  is  well  known  that  the  rate  of  mutations 
between  the  two  chemically  similar  purine  bases  (Adenine  and  Guanine,  A  and  G)  or 
between  the  two  chemically  similar  pyrimidine bases  (Cytosine  and  Thymine,  C  and T), 
is much higher (generally more than double) the rate of mutations between a purine and a 
pyrimidine  (e.g.,  from  an  A  to  a  T).  This  is  particularly  true,  e.g.,  in  mammals.  The 
purine-purine  or  pyrimidine-pyrimidine  mutations  are  called  transitions  and  the  purine-
pyrimidine mutations, transversions.  If there were only one mutation parameter, as in the 
JC model,  we would  expect  a  2:1  ration  of  transversions  to  transitions.  Estimates  from 
mammalian sequences,  however, show that 57% of changes are actually transitions. 
There  are  two  possible  transition  pairs  (A-G  and  C-T)  and  four  possible  transversion 
pairs 
(A-T,  A-C,  G-T,  G-C),  discounting  self-loops.  So,  in  all  there  are  4  possible 
transitions, 8 transversions, and 4 self-loops. This suggests that one ought to move from a 
one  parameter,  single  rate  model  to  at  least  a  2  parameter  rate  model,  one  for  the 
transition mutation rate (often denoted ts) and one parameter for the transversion mutation 
rate  (often denoted  tv). This  is what Kimura  suggested;  this model  is known  as K2P.  In 
the  formulations  of  this  model,  we  will  often  see  the  difference  between  the  transition 
transversion  mutation  rate  expressed  as  a  ratio,  R= 
mutation  rate  and 
the 
transition/transversion rates, or R=ts/tv. 

We  can  set  up  a  differential  equation  as  before  to  solve  for  the  K2P  model  and  its 
correction  factor.  If  the  time  divergence  is  not  too  great,  this  will  be  close  to  Jukes-
Cantor.  We can also solve this model using general methods for continuous time Markov 
chains,  as  shown  later  for  a  slightly  different  model.  Or,  one  can  do  the  same  sort  of 
reparameterizing  ‘trick’  as with  the  Jukes-Cantor model, which we  also  defer  to  the next 
section.  For  now,  we  simply  give  the  solution.  If  P  denotes  the  total  frequency  of 
transitions and Q the total probability of transversions then the K2P says that: 

For  the  Kimura  model,  we  can  show  that  the  equilibrium  frequency  for  all  bases  is  ¼, 
irrespective of their initial frequency – this follows from the symmetry of the model, as in 
Jukes-Cantor.  However,  turning  this  around,  also  like  Jukes-Cantor,  the  formulas  are 
applicable irrespective of  the initial base frequency,  so  the model  is applicable to a wider 
range  of  cases  than  many  other  models  that  are  more  complex.  Further,  the  more 
complex models  require one to  estimate more parameters.  We’ll  probe this  further  a bit 
later. 

P=(1/4)(1!2e!4("+#)t+e!#t)Q=(1/2)(1!e!8#t)K=2$t=2"t+4#t=!(1/2)ln(1!2P!Q)!(1/4)(1!2Q)Example.  You  are given  two  sequences  (50  bp  each)  of  the homologous pseudogene  in 
two  species  of  yeast. 
(Pseudogene:  non-transcribed  gene  that  has  ‘decayed’  and  is 
subject to purely neutral evolution.) The alignment is shown below: 
Species 1: CCTCGACGGCTTAGATCTGATCTGACCTAATGCTGCAATCGTTACAAAGT 

Species 2: CCTCCACGAGTAAGAGTTGATCCGACTTAGTCCTGCGATCGTTAGATAAT 


Note  that  Jukes-Cantor  isn’t  exactly  applicable here because  there  are 7  transitions and 7 
transversions,  14  substitutions  out  of  50  base  pairs.  However,  the  Jukes-Cantor  model 
assumes  that  there  are  twice  as  many  transversions  as  transitions.  To  apply  the Kimura 
correction,  if we knew, say,  that  the two species diverged 10 million years ago, and  there 
are 50 generations per year,  the divergence time is 2 x 500 million or 109, but we’d also 
have to get estimates of the transition/transversion ratio.  In this data, it looks to be 1. 

The  Jukes-Cantor  correction  would  proceed  as  follows:  There  are  14  substitutions  in  50 
bp.  D  =  14/50  =  0.28.  K  =  (3/4)*ln(1-(4/3)*D)=0.35.  You  should  figure  out  what  the 
difference is for the Kimura model, given R=1.  Finally, notice that if we have these figures, 
we can determine the mutation rate (assuming that it is equal for the two species): 
K = 2t (years)*μ(mutations per bp per year)
μ = 0.35/20 Myr = 1.75× 10 -8  mutations per bp per year 

Forthcoming: the matrix method of solution for estimating substitution corrections.
