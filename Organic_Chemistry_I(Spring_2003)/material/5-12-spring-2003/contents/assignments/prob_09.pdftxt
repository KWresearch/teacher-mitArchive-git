CHEM 5.12 
PROBLEM SET #9 - Due in Friday May 2, 2003 
1. (9 points total) Show the steps necessary for the following transformations.  Remember to 
pay attention to directing effects when you plan your synthesis.  Note in some cases it may be 
impossible to avoid getting mixtures of isomeric products; if this is the case please indicate it. 
Br 

B. Imperiali 

O2N 

O2N 

The only other cabon-
containing starting material is 
chlorocyclohexane 

OH	

The only other cabon-
containing starting material is 
formaldehyde 
H2C=O 

2. (6 points).  When the compound shown below is treated with aluminum trichloride it

undergoes an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction.

Despite the fact that there are several sites for the EAS cyclization only a single MAJOR product

is formed.


c 

O 

Cl 

NO2 

O 

b 

AlCl3

? 

a	

Note: Because of ring strain, you will 
want to limit your discussion to 
substitution at positions a. b. and c. 

a. (4 pts) Deduce the MAJOR product of the reaction . In your answer, you must EXPLAIN why
it is obtained by showing the mechanism of the reaction and the stability of the various 
intermediates that may be formed in the rate determining step.  (You will want to consider both 
electronic and steric effects.) 
b. (2 pts) Construct an energy diagram showing the course of the reaction and the relative 
stabilities of the statrting material, the s complex and the product. 

3. (2 points) Would you expect the Friedel-Crafts reaction of (R)-2-chlorobutane to yield an

optically active or racemic product?

EXPLAIN your answer by detailing the mechanism of the reaction.


3. (3 points) Give the structures of the intermediates in the following reactions. 
NaBH4 
AlCl3 
O 

Cl 

1. NaNH2 
2.
