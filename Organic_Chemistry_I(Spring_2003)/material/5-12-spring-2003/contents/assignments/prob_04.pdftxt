b)  Based on the number of atoms you circled in part a, what is the maximum number of 
stereoisomers possible for A? 

c)  Draw all of the possible stereoisomers of A and label their stereoisomeric relationships 
(diastereomers, enantiomers). 
d)  Label each stereocenter with its R or S configuration. 

5.  a)  Provide a complete detailed mechanism for the following reaction 
(including initiation, propagation, and termination steps).

c)  Draw a reaction-energy diagram for the propagation steps from part a. 
d)  Label  H°  for each step,  H° overall, and the rate-determining step.
