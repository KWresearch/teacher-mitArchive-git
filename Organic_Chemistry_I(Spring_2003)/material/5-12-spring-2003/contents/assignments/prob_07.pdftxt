CHEM 5.12 
Prof. B. Imperiali 
PROBLEM SET #7 (this really is PS#7 and the last one was actually PS#6!)
Due in Friday April 11th at 4 pm 
1. (3 points total) a. For the following compounds estimate the pKa  of the hydrogen 
indicated by the arrow and rank the compounds from the MOST acidic to the LEAST acidic. 

OH 

A

OH 

O 
B

H

C 

OH

D

H 
N 

E 

MOST 
LEAST 
ACIDIC 
ACIDIC 
b. You need to selecte a base to deprotonate ethyne.  Using the information derived above -what base 
would you select if you could choose the conjugate base of any of the acidic species shown above? 

2. (3 points) For the following reaction show the stepwise mechanism and identify the different 
isomeric products that are formed. You may want to build a model of the methylcyclohexene as you 
think about how the mCPBA will react and then when you think how the product of that reactions 
reacts. 

1. mCPBA 
2. H+/H2O 

3.  (8 points)  Design syntheses of compounds I and II.

The pool of carbon-containing starting materials that you can use are shown in the square

brackets.  You may use any other common reagents. A clear retrosynthetic analysis will

help you plan the synthesis

I. 

II.

4.  (6 points)  Provide a detailed stepwise mechanism to account for the following 
reactions.
