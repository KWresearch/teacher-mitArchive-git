Problem Set #1, 5.12 Spring 2003 
Due Monday, 2/10 at 4pm 

1.  Draw out valid Lewis structures (lines or dots) for the following formulas.  Circle structures 
that have ionic bonds.  (Show lone pairs and formal charges.) 
[CH3CH2OCH2]+ 
NaHCO3 

C2H2 

LiN[CH(CH3)2]2 

2.  Draw a valid Lewis structure for AlF3.  Would you expect the aluminum atom to be 
electrophilic or nucleophilic?  Why? 

3.  You learned in lecture that phenol is more acidic than cyclohexanol because its conjugate 
base (phenoxide ion) is stabilized by resonance.  Strong acids have stable conjugate bases. 

a)  Draw the relevant resonance structures for the conjugate bases of A and B. 
b)  Which would you expect to be more acidic?  Why? 

OH 

A 

NO2 

OH 

O2N 

B 

4.  Circle the following pairs of structures that do not  constitute resonance structures.  For the 
proper resonance pairs, draw curved arrows to convert the first structure to the second.  Draw 
in all lone pairs that you move.

5.  a)  Draw all of the relevant resonance structures for A, and rank them by energy (1 = lowest 
energy).  If two or more resonance structures are similar in energy, give them the same 
ranking. 
b)  Label the electrophilic atoms in A.

ranking. 
d)  Label the nucleophilic atoms in B.
