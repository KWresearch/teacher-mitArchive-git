Problem Set #3, 5.12 Spring 2003 
Due Monday, March 3, 4pm 

1.  a)  Using Newman projections, draw all of the staggered and eclipsed conformers of 2,3-
dimethylpentane with respect to rotation about the C2–C3 bond. 

b)  Assign the relative energies of each of the conformers in part a. 
Hint:  Assume that an ethyl group behaves similarly to a methyl group. 

c)  Starting with the highest energy eclipsed conformer, draw a potential energy diagram for a 
360°  rotation around the C2-C3 bond of 2,3-dimethylpentane.

d)  What is the barrier to rotation around the C2-C3 bond of 2,3-dimethylpentane? 

2.  You learned in lecture that cyclopentane prefers to adopt a low-energy envelope conformation. 
What you didn't learn is that mono-substituted cyclohexane derivatives favor the envelope that puts 
the substituent (X) at the "flap" of the envelope (A) rather than at the "base" (B).

Draw Newman projections along the indicated bonds in A and B.  Use these Newman 
projections to help you explain the energy difference between the two.

4.  As you would expect based on A-values, cis-1-tert-butyl-4-methylcyclohexane prefers the 
conformation in which the tert-butyl group is equatorial (eq 1).  A related molecule, cis-5-tert-butyl-2-
methyl-1,3-dioxane, prefers to put the tert-butyl group axial (eq 2).  Use what you know about the 
conformational analysis of cycloalkanes to explain this apparent contradiction.
