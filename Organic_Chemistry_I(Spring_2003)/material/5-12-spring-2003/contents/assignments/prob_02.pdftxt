6.  Alkaloid A is extremely popular on college campuses all over the world.  In fact, it is possible that 
you are consuming some while you work on this problem set.  (Can you guess what it is?) 

The lone pairs on three of the four nitrogen atoms in A can participate in resonance (N1–N3). 
Nitrogen 4 cannot donate its lone pair because it sits in an orbital orthogonal to the rest of the π-
system.
