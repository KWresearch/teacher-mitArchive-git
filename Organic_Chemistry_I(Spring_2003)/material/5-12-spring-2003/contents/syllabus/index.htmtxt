Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
This subject deals primarily with the basic principles to understand the
structure and reactivity of organic molecules. Emphasis is on substitution and
elimination reactions and chemistry of the carbonyl group. There will be three
lectures per week and two recitation sections devoted to discussion of the
assigned problems and lecture material.
***** Class Outline *****
1st half of the semester (PDF)

2nd half of the semester (PDF)
***** Textbook *****
L. G. Wade, Jr. Organic Chemistry. 5th ed.
***** Recitations *****
Recitations will begin the second week and meet twice per week. Recitation
sections are assigned by the registrar. Changes are closed as of the 3rd
session of the 2nd week.
***** Grading *****
Grades for the subject will be based on the following:
10% - Graded homework assignments
50% - Best three scores of four graded 1h exams
40% - One final exam
***** Academic Honesty *****
It is expected that students will maintain the highest standards of academic
honesty.
With respect to homework assignments, it is expected that no student will turn
in work that is not his or her own by copying the work of another student or by
using the work or solutions from this course given in previous years.
Discussion of approaches to solving the homework problems after attempting to
work the problems independently, however, is permitted and encouraged.
It is expected that during a test or examination, a student will not:
   1. Accept or use information of any kind from other students;
   2. Represent the work of another student as his or her own;
   3. Use aids to memory other than those expressly permitted by the examiner.
Following a test or examination, a student will not try to deceive teachers or
graders by misrepresenting or altering his or her previous work. In advance of
a test or exam, a student will not knowingly obtain access to the exam
questions.
Departures from the above standards are contrary to fundamental principles of
MIT and of the larger scientific community. Such departures are considered
serious offenses for which disciplinary penalties, including suspension and
expulsion, can be imposed.
