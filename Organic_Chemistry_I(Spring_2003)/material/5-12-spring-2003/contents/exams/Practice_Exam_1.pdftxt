Practice Exam #1

Chemistry 5.12

Organic Chemistry


• 	Midterm exam #1 will be held on Friday, February 21, 
from 12–1pm. 

•  Notes and calculators will not be allowed in the exam. 

•  You will be free to use molecular models during the exam. 

•  You will be given a periodic table. 

• 	The exam will cover reading (Ch. 1, 2, 3.1–3.9) and lecture material 
through Tuesday, February 18. 

• 	Dr. Tabacco will give a review session at 7pm on Tuesday, February 18 
 

• 	Additional suggested problems from the book (some of these were 
already suggested during lecture):  1-23,25,27,34,36,37,39–43, 45–47, 2-27– 
31,33, 3-34,35,38,39,41a,b,42. 

• 	For best results, take this test as if it were your exam.  That way, you'll 
know which areas need extra work before you get to the real exam.
