for given molecular formulas.  Don't forget lone 
pairs and formal charges! 

•  Draw/interpret 3-D structures with dashes and 
wedges.

mechanisms.  Hint:  You will frequently start an 
arrow on a negative charge (electrons!) , but never 
start an arrow on a positive charge (no electrons!).

II.  Resonance 
A.  Drawing Resonance Structures 
B.  Energy of Resonance Structures 
C.  Structure and Reactivity from Resonance 

1.  For each pair, circle the most stable 
resonance structure, and use curved arrows to 
convert the structure on the left to the structure

O 

You need to be able to: 

•  Recognize resonance structures. 
•  Interconvert resonance structures. 
•  Predict relative energies and importance. 
•  Predict reactivity/physical properties using 
resonance structures. 

Hint:  Generating charges is bad!! 

•  When you start with a neutral molecule, don't 
generate more than two formal charges. 
•  When you start with a charged molecule, don't 
generate any other formal charges.
