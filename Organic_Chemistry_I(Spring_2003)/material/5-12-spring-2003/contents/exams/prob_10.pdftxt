There  are  a  lot  of  problems  here.  They

are   representat ive   of   the   types   of

long  questions  that  will  be  on  the

f ina l   exam .

A  key  for  the  practice  problems  will  be

posted  next  Wednesday .


The  final  will  focus  on  material  from

the  second  half  of  the  semester .

3. When naphthalene is treated with Cl2  in the presence of FeCl3  the major product from 
the reaction is product A and the minor product is B.

A
B 
Using the mechan ism of electrophilic aromatic substitution EXPLAIN the product

outcome.  Your answer must include a detailed stepwise mechan ism and a discussion

of the stability of the intermed iates formed in the reaction.

The carbon framework of naphthalene is predrawn to save you time you just need to

add the ch lorine substituent, the doub le bonds and the charge.
