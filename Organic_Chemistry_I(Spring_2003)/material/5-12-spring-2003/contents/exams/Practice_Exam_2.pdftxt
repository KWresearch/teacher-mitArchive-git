Practice Exam #2

Chemistry 5.12

Organic Chemistry


•	 Midterm exam #2 will be held on Friday, March 14, 
from 12–1pm. 

 

 

•  Notes and calculators will not be allowed in the exam. 

•  You will be free to use molecular models during the exam. 

•  You will be given a periodic table and a table of BDEs. 

•	 The exam will cover reading (Ch. 3–5, 6.1–6.8) and lecture material 
through Monday, March 10th.  Material from the first three weeks is 
still fair game. 

•	  Dr. Tabacco will give a review session at 7pm on Tuesday, March 11. 
Please download the review handout to bring to the review 
session. 

•	 Additional suggested problems from the book (some of these were 
already suggested during lecture):  3-42–44,46; 4-35–37,39–42,44,46,48,54; 
5-30,31,34–36,38. 

•	 For best results, take this test as if it were your exam.  That way, you'll 
know which areas need extra work before you get to the real exam. 
(Don't worry, it's a bit longer than your actual exam.)

7.  For each molecule, draw the two possible chair conformers and circle 
the preferred conformer. 

a)  cis-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane 

b)  trans-1,4-dimethylcyclohexane 

c)  The energy difference between the two chair conformers is greater in part a 
than in part b.  Why? 

8.  The oxygen–oxygen bond in hydrogen peroxide (HO–OH) is very weak (BDE = 
51 kcal/mol).  As a result, radical oxidation proceeds by a similar mechanism as 
radical halogenation.

a)  Provide a complete and detailed reaction mechanism for the above reaction. 
Include at least two possible termination steps. 

b)  Calculate ΔH° for each of the propagation steps. 

c)  Draw and label the reaction-energy diagram for the propagation steps from 
part b.

expect the selectivity of radical oxygenations to compare to the analogous 
chlorination and bromination reactions?
