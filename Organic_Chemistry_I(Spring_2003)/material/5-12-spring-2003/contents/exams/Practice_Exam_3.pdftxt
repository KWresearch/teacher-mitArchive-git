Prof. B. Imperiali


Practice Exam #3 

Exam will be held on Monday April 14th at noon. 

Notes and calculators will not be allowed in the 
exam but you will be provided with a periodic 
table and you may bring use molecular models 
to use. 

The exam will cover material from 3/12-4/11. 

The practice exam key will be posted as a 
separate file so that you can print up the exam 
and take it as a “real practice” before you
check out the answers.
