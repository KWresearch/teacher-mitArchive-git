OH 

II 

You may only use the carbon containing starting materials in the square brackets

Pay careful attention to directing effects in the key reactions that you plan to carry out

on the benzene ring.

A clear retrosynthetic analysis will help in planning the synthetic strategy and will be

given partial credit if you don't get all the details of the synthesis completed.

13. (26 points) The outcome of electrophilic aromatic substitution on 
functionalized benzene rings can be predicted by considering the effect of 
substituents on the intermediate formed in the rate determining step of the 
reaction. 

HNO3/H2SO4 

OMe 

For the reaction shown above carry out the following: 
a) (3 points) Identify the active ELECTROPHILE in the reaction. 

b) (9 points) Show the stepwise mechanism that accounts for the formation of a product 
in which the position indicated by the arrow is substituted with an -NO2  group.  You 
must identify all the important resonance structures in the positively charged 
intermediate 

Page 6 

c) (6 points) Construct an energy diagram for this electrophilic aromatic substitution 
reaction.  On the diagram you should indicate the starting material, the high energy 
intermediate (  complex), the product and the energy of activation for the rate 
determining step.

d) (8 points) Explain why a single major product is obtained by considering the features 
of the  complex when attack occurs at the other sites on the ring.

13.  (8 points) Explain why the reaction shown affords only a single addition product 
upon treatment with HBr.  In your answer you need to explain, by illustrating the 
intermediate formed in the reaction why none of the other double bonds in the staring 
material react and why the bromine adds to the carbon indicated in the scheme.
