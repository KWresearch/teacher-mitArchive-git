4.  Bicyclic Ring Systems 

You need to be able to: 
•  Provide the approximate ring strains and pre ferred 
conformations of the rings discussed in class. 
•  Analyze ring strain in terms of torsional and angle strain. 
•  Draw Newman projections to compare conformations of 
cycloalkanes. 
•  Draw and flip cyclohexane chairs.  Be sure you carefully 
different iate between axial and equatorial bonds. 
•  Provide the details of a cyclohexane ring flip. 
•  Use A-values and diaxial interactions to predic t the 
preferred conformers of substituted cyc lohexanes.  Know 
your A-values! 
•  Draw and differentiate between cis- and trans-isomers. 

2.  Draw chair conformers for cis- and trans-decalin. 
Which would you expect to be more stable? 

1.  Draw the two possible chairs for each molecule, 
and indicate the preferred conformer. 

Me

Et

H

Which molecule would you expect to have 
the largest conformational preference.  Why? 

3.  Using Newman projections, predict the energy 
difference between the two.  Hint:  Look for gauche-
butane interactions in the higher energy structure.

2.  Molecules with >1 Stereocenter 

You need to be able to: 
•  Recognize stereoisomers: enantiomers & diastereomers. 
•  Draw all possible stereoisomers for  a given molecule: 
Remember the 2n rule . 
•  Determine whether  molecules are chiral or achiral:  a)  
Count stereocenters; b) Look for mirror planes; c) 
Compare mirror images. 
•  Recognize meso compounds. 
•  Assign R/S stereochemistry to stereocenters. 
•  Correlate chirality w ith optical activity. 
•  Describe ratios of enantiomers us ing optical activity 
( optically pure, racemic, etc.). 

1.  Draw all of the stereoisomers of 1,2- and 1,3-
dimethylcyclohexane.  Assign each stereocenter 
as R or S.  How many are chiral?  Achiral? 

Try to draw a chiral stereoisomer of 1,4-
dimethylcyclohexane.  Can you do it?  Why or 
why not? 

2.  Practice assigning  R and S stereochemistry 
until you feel like your head will explode! 
There are ample examples  in the book and 
lecture. 

3.  All of the above molecules are achiral; however, 
hexahelicene (below) is chiral.  Why? 

Hexahelicene
