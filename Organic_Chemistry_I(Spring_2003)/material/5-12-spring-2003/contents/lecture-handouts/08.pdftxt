There are two possible products!  Why? 

•  Propane has two inequivalent types of hydrogens that can be abstracted in the 
first propagation step. 

•  The first propagation step determines which product will be formed (1°  or 2° ).

•  There are six primary hydrogens and two secondary hydrogens, 
but the secondary chloride is favored. 

• How can we explain the selectivity of this reaction? 

• Radical formation is under kinetic control, so abstraction of the 2° 
hydrogen to form the 2°  radical must be faster than abstraction of 
the 1°  hydrogen to form the 1°  radical. 

•  In other words, the secondary hydrogens are more reactive 
than the primary hydrogens under these conditions!

•  The secondary hydrogens are 4.5 
times more reactive than the primary 
hydrogens. 

Why? 

We can answer this using thermodynamics, kinetics, and reaction-energy diagrams!

overall: 

form H–Cl:  –103 kcal/mol 
break 2° C–H:  +95 kcal/mol 
ΔH° = –8 kcal/mol 

overall: 

•  2° C–H bonds are weaker than 1° C–H bonds. 

•  This means that it is thermodynamically more favorable to break a 
2° C–H bond than a 1° C–H bond. 

•  But how does this control the kinetic selectivity?

•  This reaction is under kinetic control, so the product ratio is determined by  Ea. 
• How can you predict the value of  Ea? 

Analyze the Reaction-Energy Diagram! 

Comparing the transition states for the two products: 

•  The energy of a transition state will always depend, to differing extents, on the energies of 
the reactants and the products. 

•  In this case, the reactants are the same for both processes (same energy). 

•  The only energy difference is in the products:  the 2°  radical is lower in energy than the 1° 
radical. 

•  This means that the transition state leading to formation of the 2°  radical is slightly lower in 
energy than the transition state leading to formation of the 1°  radical. 

•  The secondary radical is formed faster! 

•  It is important to remember that  Ea depends on, but will never exceed  H° !

• Radical brominations are generally much more selctive than radical halogenations. 

• How can we explain this difference?

overall: 

form H–Br:  –88 kcal/mol 
break 2° C–H:  +95 kcal/mol 
ΔH°  = +7 kcal/mol 

overall: 

•  The H–Br bond (BDE = 88 kcal/mol) is much weaker than the H–Cl bond (BDE = 103 
kcal/mol). 

• HYDROGEN ABSTRACTION WITH Br· IS ENDOTHERMIC!

•  This diagram looks slightly similar to the one we drew for the chlorination of propane. 

•  The big difference is that this step is now endothermic.  So what? 

•  THINK HAMMOND POSTULATE! 

Remember the Hammond Postulate: 

•  In an exothermic reaction, the transition state more closely resembles the reactants. 

•  In an endothermic reaction, the transition state more closely resembles the products. 

What this means: 

•  The 3 kcal/mol energy difference between the 1°  and 2°  radicals will have the biggest 
effect on the transition state energies in the endothermic abstraction with bromine. 

•  This is why radical brominations are more selective than radical chlorinations!

•  Bond dissociation energies depend on radical stability. 

•  It's easier to homolytically cleave a bond when more stable radicals are formed.

To understand this trend, we need to take a closer look at the electronic

• Radicals are electron-deficient because they have less than an octet. 

•  As you might expect based on this, radical stability depends on hybridization 
(effective electronegativity). 
Stability: sp 3 > sp 2 > sp 

•  Alkyl groups stabilize electron-deficient radicals by donating electron density in two ways: 
induction and hyperconjugation. 

1.  Alkyl groups are inductive electron-donating groups (EDGs). 

•  Alkyl substituents donate electron density through the sigma-bond framework.

2.  Hyperconjugation:  Alkyl groups stabilize radicals through overlap 
between filled σC–H  orbitals and the half-filled p-orbital.

H.  General Selectivity of Radical Halogenations 
• Radical brominations are highly selective when one type of hydrogen is particularly 
reactive (resonance-stabilized). 
eg.  Cyclohexene has thre types of hydrogens:

• OKAY:  These hydrogens act like 
regular 2°  hydrogens. 

• GOOD:  This radical is delocalized 
(stabilized by resonance). 

•  The radical halogenation of cyclohexene is selective, BUT cyclohexene can react 
with Br2  in other ways when the concentration of Br2  is too high. 

• N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) is used because it releases bromine slowly.

•  The initially formed bromine radical 
abstracts a hydrogen from 
cyclohexene to form cyclohexyl radical 
and HBr. 

•  This starts the chain!
