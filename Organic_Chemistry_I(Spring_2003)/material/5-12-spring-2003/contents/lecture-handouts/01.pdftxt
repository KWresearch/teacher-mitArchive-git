Organic Chemistry:  What is it? 

1780:  Organic compounds very complex and only obtained from living sources (vitalism) 

Vitalism:  Belief that a "magic" vital force, present in plants and animals, is necessary for 
the synthesis of organic compounds 

1789:  Antoine Laurent Lavoisier observed that organic compounds are composed 
primarily of carbon and hydrogen 

1828:  Friedrich Wohler synthes ized an organic compound (urea) from inorganic 
compounds (lead cyanate and ammonium hydroxide).

Why Carbon? 

•  Carbon forms a variety of strong covalent bonds to itself and other atoms. 

•  This allows organic compounds to be structurally diverse.

Why Does Carbon Bond in This Way? 

I.  Review of Lewis Bonding Theory (READ CH 1) 
•  Atoms transfer or share electrons to gain a filled valence shell of electrons. 

A.  Ionic Bonding 
•  Between atoms of widely different electronegativity (∆EN>2); usually a metal and 
a non-metal; atoms held together by electrostatic attraction, not electron sharing 

e.g.  LiF is ionic (EN: Li = 1.0. F = 4.0)

B.  Covalent Bonding (Electron Sharing) 
•  Very important in organic molecules! 
•  Between atoms of similar electronegativity; usually non-metallic 

e.g.  CCl4  is covalent . . . Why? 

•  Large thermodynamic penalty for ionization of carbon to C4+

•  Instead, each chlorine atom shares one valence electron with carbon so that every 
atom has a filled octet.

•  Not all atoms are neutral in a Lewis or Kekule structure 
•  Formal charges help chemists to keep track of the placement of electrons in molecules 
•  Does not indicate that all of the charge is actually localized on one atom 

Formal Charge = (group #) – (# non-bonding e – s) – 1/2 (# shared e –s)

Rules for Drawing Line-Angle Formulas 

•  Bonds are represented by lines (one line = two shared electrons) 

•  Do not draw carbon or hydrogen atoms, except at termini (for aesthetics) 

•  Assume carbon atoms are at ends of lines and where they meet 

•  Assume enough C–H bonds to give each carbon atom four bonds (an octet) 

•  Draw heteroatoms and attached hydrogen atoms (N,O,S,P,F,Cl,Br,I, etc.)

Representing Molecules 

Lewis/Kekule Structures:  Represent atoms sharing electrons to form bonds 

Line-Angle Structures:  Simplify the drawing of complex molecular structures 

Dashes and Wedges:  Allow chemists to draw molecules in 3-D 

BUT!  These simplified structures do not accurately represent the 
electronic nature or reactivity of organic molecules! 

It helps to think about electrons in motion . . .


BUT HOW DO WE REPRESENT ELECTRONS IN MOTION?


3.  Curved Arrow Formalism (Arrow Pushing) 

•  Chemists use arrows to represent the motion of electrons within and between molecules. 

double arrow: 
2 electrons moving 

fishook arrow: 
1 electron moving 

1. 
2. 

The tail starts at the electrons that are moving (lone pair or bond). 
The head shows where the electrons end up (lone pair or bond). 

e.g. electron motion in a substitution reaction (much more detail later) 

(l.p. to bond)

Sample Problem:  Using What You Know

following reaction.  Remember to indicate formal charge.  Use curved arrows

B:  3 – 0 – 4 = –1 

• 	Chemical reactions generally involve  the movement of electrons between two 
or more molecules, but electrons also move within a molecule. 

II.  Resonance:  Electronic Motion Within a Molecule 

•  The reactivity of a molecule  is not always explained by one Lewis structure. 

•	 Molecules can be thought of as hybrids or weighted averages of two or more Lewis 
structures, each with a different placement of electrons. 

•	 These structures, called resonance structures, are not real or detectable, but they are a 
useful conceptual tool for understanding  the reactivity of molecules.

A.  Rules for Drawing Resonance Structures


1.  Only electrons move!  Nuclei and the sigma- (single bond-) framework are


unchanged (Resonance occurs in the pi-system:  conjugated lone pairs and pi-bonds).


2.  Every resonance structure must be a valid Lewis structure.


3.  Keep track of lone pairs and formal charges.


4.  Use arrow-pushing formalism to interconvert and identifiy possible resonance 


structures.


5.  Always use double-headed arrow (

 ) in between resonance structures.


6.  Lower energy resonance structures contribute most to the overall structure of the 


molecule.


How do you predict the relative energies of resonance structures?

idelines for Predicting Energies of Resonance Structures 
(In Order of Importance) 

i)  Filled Octets:  Second row elements (C, N, O , F) want an octet (filled valence 

shell of electrons).  Because C is the least electronegative, structures in which C has 

6 electrons, 3 bonds and a positive charge are possible (not possible with N, O, F). 

ii)  Negative charges on most electronegative atoms. 

iii)  Minimize charge separation.

•  Drawn  this way, benzene appears to have two types of carbon– 
carbon bonds (single and double). 

•  Experimental data indicates that all  of the carbon–carbon bonds 
in benzene are equivalent and rather unreactive. 

•  Benzene is approximately 35 kcal/mol more stable than would be 
expected because the electrons are delocalized around the ring.
