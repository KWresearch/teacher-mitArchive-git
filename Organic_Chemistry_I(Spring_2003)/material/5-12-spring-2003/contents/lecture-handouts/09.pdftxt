Substitution Reactions (SN2 versus SN1)
SN2

SN1

Mechanism:

Concerted

Two Steps
(Look for carbocation rearrangements.)

Rate Equation:

Rate = kr[R–X][Nuc]

Rate = kr[R–X]

Stereochemistry:

Substrate:

Stereospecific
(inversion)

Sterics
(methyl > 1° > 2°)
No SN2 with 3°!
Orbital Overlap
(methyl @ benzylic > allylic > 1°)

Nucleophile:

Strong/Moderate Required
strong:  RS–, I–, R2N–, R2NH, RO–, CN–
moderate:  RSH, Br–, RCO2
–

Loss of Stereochemistry

Cation Stability
(benzylic > allylic > 3° > 2°)
No 1° or methyl R+
without extra stabilization!

Not Important

Leaving Group:

Moderately Important
(same trend as SN1)

Very Important
(–OTf >> –OTs @ –OMs >> 
–I > –Br > –Cl)

Solvent:

Polar Aprotic

Polar Protic

Elimination Reactions:  E2 versus E1

E2

E1

Mechanism:

Concerted

Two Steps
(Look for carbocation rearrangements.)

Rate Equation:

Rate = kr[R–X][Base]

Rate = kr[R–X]

Stereochemistry:

Substrate:

Base:

Leaving Group:

Stereospecific
(antiperiplanar TS)

Alkene Stability
(3° > 2° > 1°)

Strong Base Required
(RO–, R2N–)

Moderately Important
(same trend as SN1)

Not Stereospecific

Cation Stability
(benzylic > allylic > 3° > 2°)

Not Important:  Usually Weak
(ROH, R2NH)

Very Important
(same trend as SN1)

Solvent:

Wide Range of Solvents

Polar Protic

Product Ratio:

Saytzeff Rule:  The most highly substituted alkene usually predominates.

Hofmann Product:  Use of a sterically hindered base will result in formation of 
the least substituted alkene (Hofmann product).

Is Nuc/Base bulky?

no

What kind of substrate?

yes

yes

Unimolecular
Reaction

E2

mostly E1*

yes

Is Nuc/Base bulky?

methyl or 1°

SN2 + E2

SN2

no

mostly SN1*

*  Under conditions that favor a unimolecular reaction (weak nuc/base and polar protic solvent), 
mixtures of SN1 and E1 are usually obtained.
