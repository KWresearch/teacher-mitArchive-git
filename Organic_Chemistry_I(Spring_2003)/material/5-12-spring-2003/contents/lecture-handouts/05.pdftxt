* In Wade, a Me/Me-ec lipsing interaction is said to 
be worth 3.0 kcal/mol.  Either value w ill be 
acceptable in this class, but most other sources 
assign the value of 4.0 kca l/mol.  A Me/Me-eclipsing 
interaction is significantly higher than an H/H- or 
H/Me-eclipsing interact ion because the hydrogens 
on the two methyl groups can  ac tually bump into 
each other (steric strain).

experience 1,3 -diaxial 
interactions; "bump into" 
other axial groups.
