•  Why is light or heat necessary?
•  How fast does it go?
•  Does it give off or consume heat?
•  How fast are each of the successive reactions?
•  Can you control the product ratio?

To answer these questions, we need to:

1.  Understand the mechanism of the reaction (arrow-pushing!).

2.  Use thermodynamics and kinetics to analyze the reaction.

1.  Mechanism of Radical Chlorination of Methane
(Free-Radical Chain Reaction)

Free-radical chain reactions have three distinct mechanistic steps:

•  initiation step:  generates reactive intermediate

•  propagation steps:  reactive intermediates react with stable molecules to generate 
other reactive intermediates (allows chain to continue)

•  termination step:  side-reactions that slow the reaction; usually combination of two 
reactive intermediates into one stable molecule

Initiation Step:  Cl2 absorbs energy and the bond is homolytically cleaved.

(Remember to use fishhook arrows!)

•  The first-formed reactive intermediate is a chlorine radical.

reactive intermediate:  short-lived species that reacts quickly as it is formed

radical:  species with an unpaired electron (usually just draw the unpaired electron)

Propagation Steps:  The Meat of the Reaction

a)  Chlorine radical abstracts a hydrogen from methane to form a methyl radical.
b)  Methyl radical abstracts a chlorine from Cl2 to form product and another chlorine radical

•  Termination steps slow down and eventually stop the chain reaction.

•  Termination reactions become most important at the end of a reaction, when 
there are very few reactant molecules left.

Before we investigate the energetics of this particular reaction, let's review 
some general thermodynamics and kinetics.

B.  Thermodynamics:  energy changes that accompany chemical and physical 
transformations

•  Thermodynamics are used to describe systems that are in their equilibrium state

Equilibrium Constant:     Keq =

[B]

[A]

Gibbs Free Energy:      G =  H – T S = –RT(lnKeq)

R = 1.987 cal/K·mol

T = temperature (K)

Gibbs Free Energy:      G =  H – T S = –RT(lnKeq)

entropy ( S):  disorder or freedom of motion; an increase in entropy (DS > 0) is 
favorable

enthalpy ( H):  the amount of heat evolved or consumed in a reaction (bonds 
broken/formed)

endothermic:  DH > 0; need to put energy into the reaction (uphill)
exothermic:  DH < 0; energy given off by the reaction (downhill)

•  In the Gibbs Free Energy equation, the enthalpy term (DH) is generally much larger 
than the entropy term (TDS).  In other words, the change in enthalpy (bond 
breaking/bond formation) usually governs the favorability of a reaction.

Standard Gibbs Free Energy:  DG° =  DG at 298K and 1 atm

The 1.4 Rule:  At 25 °C (298 K), every  1.4 kcal/mol change in  G°  results in a 
factor of 10 difference in Keq (useful for estimating conversion of a reaction).

Note:  Similar rules apply at different 
temperatures:  100 °C (1.7), 50 °C (1.5), 0 °C 
(1.3), –78 °C (0.9), etc.

C.  Kinetics:  Reaction Rates

reaction rate:  how fast products appear and reactants disappear (measured 
experimentally)

rate equation:  relationship between concentration of reactants and observed reaction 
rate (determined experimentally and used to deduce reaction mechanisms)

[A]

[B]

[C]

[D]

observed rate = –d[A]/dt = d[C]/dt
= kr[A]a[B]b
(kr = rate constant)

a:  order of the reaction with respect to A
b:  order of the reaction with respect to B
a + b:  overall order of the reaction

These all depend on the 
reaction  mechanism.

5

•  The rate constant is dependent on the activation energy and the temperature.

Arrhenius Equation:     kr = Ae–Ea/RT

A = Arrhenius prefactor

Ea = activation energy (minimum energy the reactants must 
        have for the reaction to occur)

•  In this class, we'll also refer to the activation energy of a reaction in terms of 
DG ‡  (free energy of activation).

Enough equations!  Now let's look at pictures!

D.  Reaction-Energy Diagrams
•  A reaction-energy diagram is a plot of the potential energy as reactants are 
converted to products (also called a reaction-coordinate diagram); very useful 
for understanding thermodynamics and kinetics!

•  X-axis is the progress 
of the reaction.

•  Y-axis can be either 
G or  H.

•  The transition state 
is state of highest 
energy between 
reactants and products.

•  Transition states are 
transient (written in 
brackets).  

•  Transition states are 
unstable, do not have a 
finite lifetime, and 
cannot be isolated.

If more than one product is formed in a reaction, what determines the 
ratio of products?  It depends on the reaction!

Thermodynamic Control:  When the reaction is reversible (reactants and products are 
in equilibrium), the reaction is said to be under thermodynamic control, and the 
product ratio is determined by the relative energies of the products.

Kinetic Control:  When the products are formed irreversibly, the reaction is said to be 
under kinetic control, and the product ratio is determined by the difference in the 
activation energies (the difference in the energies of the transition states (DDG ‡ )).

Is there any way to estimate the relative energies of transition states?

Hammond Postulate:  Related species that are similar in energy are similar in structure.
  
The structure of a transition state resembles the structure of the closest stable species.

•  Endothermic reactions have 
late transition states.

•  In an endothermic reaction, 
the transition state is product-
like (close in energy and 
structure to the product).

•  In an endothermic reaction, 
anything that changes the energy 
of the product will also change 
the energy of the transition state.

•  The local maxima are 
transition states.

•  The local minima are 
reactive intermediates 
(short-lived species that are 
never present in high 
concentration because they 
react quickly as they are 
formed).

•  The overall reaction rate 
is determined by the 
highest energy transition 
state.

•  The rate-determining 
step is the step with the 
highest energy transition 
state.

5.  Reaction-Energy Diagram for Radical Chorination of Methane

•  Now we have the tools to examine the energetics of a free-
radical halogenation.
•  We can use bond dissociation energies to estimate DH° 
for each step (p. 134 in Wade).

•  It is important that the initiation step involves cleavage of a fairly weak 
bond like Cl–Cl.

•  Other than that, the initiation step is not important in the overall 
thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction.  This is because one 
initiation step starts a chain that can go through thousands of 
propagation cycles.

•  The termination steps are also unimportant in the overall energetic 
picture of the reaction, so let's focus on the propagation steps.
