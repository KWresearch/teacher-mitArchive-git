the ring has an
unhybridized p orbital
perpendicular to the ring

Annulenes

•

Initially, all cyclic
conjugated hydrocarbons
were proposed to be
aromatic.
• However, cyclobutadiene is
so reactive that it dimerizes
before it can be isolated.
• And cyclooctatetraene
adds Br2 readily.
• Look at Molecular Orbitals
    (MO’s) to explain
aromaticity in benzene-like
molecules.

Constructing Molecular Orbitals
• Pi molecular orbitals are the sideways overlap of p
orbitals.
• p orbitals have 2 lobes.  Plus (+) and minus (-) indicate
the opposite phases of the wave function, not
electrical charge.
• When lobes overlap constructively, (+ and +, or - and -)
a bonding MO is formed.
• When + and - lobes overlap,  waves cancel out and a
node forms; antibonding MO.

MO Rules for Benzene
• Six overlapping p orbitals must form six molecular
orbitals.
• Three will be bonding, three antibonding.
• Lowest energy MO will have all bonding interactions, no
nodes.
• As energy of MO increases, the number of nodes
increases.
• System symmetric so 2 pairs of degenerate orbitals

Energy Diagram for Benzene
6 atomic orbitals - 6 molecular orbitals
System symmetric so 2 pairs of degenerate orbitals

The six electrons fill three bonding pi orbitals.
All bonding orbitals are filled (“closed shell”), an extremely
stable arrangement (AROMATIC STABILIZATION).

Energy Diagram for Cyclobutadiene

Following Hund’s rule,
two electrons are in
separate orbitals
because they are at
same energy.
Most stable if filled with
an electron pair (as
with benzene)
If cyclobutadiene adopted a coplanar
geometry - two of the molecular
orbitals would each have a single
unpaired electron - very unstable.
Applies to any (4 n) system
Cyclobutadiene is ANTIAROMATIC

THE ACIDITY OF THE PYRIDINIUM ION
• Heterocyclic aromatic compound.
• Nonbonding pair of electrons in sp2 orbital,
so weak base, pKb = 8.8.
