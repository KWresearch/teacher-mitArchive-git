III.  Molecular Orbital Theory

Electrons Are Waves!
They Exist as 3-D Standing Waves (Orbitals).

atomic orbitals:  unhybridized orbitals on an atom (s, p, d)

Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO):  Individual wave 
functions (orbitals) combine to form hybrid atomic orbitals (sp, sp2, sp3) 
and molecular orbitals (σ, σ*, π, π*)

Hybrid Atomic Orbital:  Combination of atomic orbitals from the same 
atom

Molecular Orbital:  Combination of atomic orbitals from different atoms

Conservation of Orbitals:  When you add orbitals together, you always 
end up with the same number of orbitals that you started with.

A.  Atomic Orbitals
•  The s- and p-orbitals are the most important in organic compounds.
•  Orbital pictures are actually electron probability clouds.

s-orbitals:  spherical, electrons held close to nucleus, one sign

p-orbitals:  two lobes with opposite signs, electrons further from nucleus

•  Remember, the sign of the orbital does not indicate charge.  
It represents the sign of the wavefunction and lets us think 
qualitatively about whether orbital interactions are constructive 
(bonding) or destructive (anti-bonding).

B.  Sigma-Bonding (σσσσ)
•  Sigma-bonding orbitals are cylindrically symmetrical molecular orbitals.
•  Electron density is centered along the axis of the bond.
•  Single bonds are sigma-bonds.

e.g.  H2 is the simplest sigma-bond
node

σσσσ (bonding)

H–H

bonding:  (+/+ or –/–) electron 
density centered between 
nuclei

anti-bonding:  (+/–) generally 
has a node between nuclei

node:  area of zero electron 
density

•  In stable bonding situations, 
usually only the bonding 
orbitals (σ, π) are occupied.

C.  Pi-Bonding (ππππ)
•  Pi-bonding orbitals are not cylindrically symmetrical.
•  Electron density is located above and below the axis of the bond.
•  Double and triple bonds are pi-bonds.

Orbital Overlap
•  Orbitals must have the correct symmetry to overlap.
•  Orthogonal orbitals do not overlap.
Good Overlap
Orthogonal:  No Overlap

•If all bonding occurred between simple s- and p-orbitals, then all bond 
angles would be approximately 90°.

We know that isn't true!

•  Most bond angles in organic molecules are ~109°, ~120° and ~180°.

How do we account for this?

D.  Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)

•  Electrons repel each other!

•  Lone pairs and bonds want to be as far apart as possible.

But, how do we think about this in terms of orbitals?

•  In 1930, Linus Pauling introduced a theory that combines VSEPR with 
quantum mechanics (orbitals).

IV. Hybridization (Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals)

•  Atomic orbitals on the same atom combine to form
hybrid atomic orbitals.

Why?

•  Hybrid orbitals are more directional, so they have more effective bonding 
interactions.

•  Second row elements hybridize using their s- and p-orbitals (sp, sp2, sp3).

Remember conservation of orbitals!

Assigning Hybridization to Atoms in a Molecule
(You need to be able to do this!)

Count the hybrid atomic orbitals.
# of hybrid orbitals = # of σσσσ-bonds + # of lone pairs

1.  Rotation of Ethane versus Ethylene
•  Sigma-bonds are cylindrically symmetrical:  rotation does not disrupt bonding.
•  Sigma-bonds rotate freely.
