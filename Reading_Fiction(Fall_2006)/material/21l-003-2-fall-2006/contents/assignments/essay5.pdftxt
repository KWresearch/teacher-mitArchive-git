Essay 5  - due in Ses #26  (5 pages) 
 
 
Choose one of the following and write a five page essay in which you do your 
best to convince readers to share your understanding of Woolf’s To the Lighthouse by 
using the novel’s specific words, speeches, and scenes.  Try your best to distinguish 
between observations and analyses.  Try, too, to captivate your reader’s interest in your 
opening and concluding paragraphs; strive toward a clear logical arrangement of 
paragraphs.  Read out loud.  Give your essay a thoughful title, double space 
throughout, number your pages, and proofread very carefully.  Remember that if you 
would like to explore another topic, talk to me ahead of time. 
 
 
 
1. 

With her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer 
in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked, and 
then, as she moved and took Minta’s arm and left the room, 
it changed, it shaped itself differently; it had become, she 
knew, giving one last look at it over her shoulder,  already 
the past.  (111) 

 
In what sense can you argue that the triumphant dinner party at the end of “The 
Window” represents Mrs. Ramsay’s equivalent of her husband’s philosophical 
treastises, Lily Briscoe’s painting, or Augustus Carmichael’s poetry? 
 
 
2.   

   James looked at the Lighthouse.  He could see the white-
washed rocks; the tower, stark and straight; he could see 
that it was barred with black and white; he could see 
windows in it; he could even see washing spread on the 
rocks to dry.  So that was the Lighthouse, was it? 
   No, the other was also the Lighthouse.  For nothing was 
simply one thing.  The other Lighthouse was true too.  (186) 

 
Although Woolf wrote in a letter that “directly I’m told what a thing means, it becomes 
hateful to me,” clearly she used the lighthouse as a central symbol of her work.  What 
does it mean to six-year-old James?  to sixteen-year-old James?  to Mrs Ramsay?  to 
Mr Ramsay?  to other characters?  How can one image mean so many different things? 
 
 
3.  Why are most of the references to the Ramsays and their guests bracketed in “Time 
Passes,” the second part of To the Lighthouse?

4.  Why do you think Woolf specified that it was Prue Ramsay who both married and 
died in childbirth?  Why was it Cam who survived and accompanied her father and 
brother to the lighthouse? 
 
 
 
5.  

 “He has landed,” she said aloud.  “It is finished.” (208) 
 
Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I 
have had my vision. (209)   
 
Why does Woolf’s novel end by not merely juxtaposing Mr Ramsay’s arrival at the 
lighthouse and Lily’s completion of her painting but by representing them as 
simultaneous actions?
