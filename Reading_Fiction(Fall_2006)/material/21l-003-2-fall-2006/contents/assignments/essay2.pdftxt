Essay 2  -  due in Ses #9  (3 pages) 
 
Choose one of the following and write a 3 page essay in which you do your best to use 
 
specific words and scenes from Scott’s “The Highland Widow” to convince your readers of your 
thesis.  Try your best to distinguish between plot summary and argument, to captivate your 
reader’s interest in your opening and concluding paragraphs, and to strive toward a clear logical 
arrangement of paragraphs.   Read out loud.  Give your essay a thoughtful title, double space 
throughout, number your pages, and proofread very carefully. 
 
Finally, do not feel obliged to answer each and every question I pose.  The questions are 
designed to help you clarify your thoughts, not to trap you into a rigid format. 
 
1.  In his book The Historical Novel, the Hungarian critic Georg Lukacs wrote that “Scott’s 
greatness lies in his capacity to give living human embodiment to historical-social types.  The 
typically human terms in which great historical trends become tangible had never before been so 
superbly, straightforwardly and poignantly portrayed.”  Think about Hamish and Elspat 
MacTavish in these terms.  Consider one or two scenes in which their distinctive characters and 
their historically determined personalities are impossible to distinguish.  Then, drawing upon 
your discussion, consider why Scott chose to write historical novels rather than straight history.   
[Note: you might prefer to restrict your discussion to a single character.]   
 
 
2.  One could argue that Oedipus was not responsible for the killing of his father since the oracle 
had foretold that he would do so.   Early in his novella, Scott compares Elspat MacTavish with 
Oedipus: “she was regarded by the Highlanders in the neighbourhood,” he writes,   
 as the Greeks considered those who were pursued by the Furies, 
and endured the mental torment consequent on great criminal 
actions.  They regarded such unhappy beings as Orestes and 
Oedipus, as being less the voluntary perpetrators of their crimes, 
than as the passive instruments by which the terrible decress of 
Destiny had been accomplished; and the fear with which they 
beheld them was not unmingled with veneration. (75) 

     
Examine several scenes in which Elspat is depicted as the “passive instrument” not so much of 
Destiny as of History and then consider whether she, like Greek tragic heroes, is the object of not 
only fear, but also veneration. 
 
 
3.  Consider how Hamish’s last gesture and execution are depicted very differently from his 
father’s bloody death.  Consider too the narrator’s comment that, “The untamed and angry 
passions which he inherited from father and mother, were awakened by the supposed hostility of 
those who pursued him; and the restraint under which they were held by his sober judgment, 
began gradually to give way” (109).  Is Hamish more like or unlike his father?  Is his murder of 
Cameron out of character or a revelation of his true character?

4.   

The moral principle which so naturally and so justly occurs to 
the mind of those who have been educated under a settled 
government of laws that protect the property of the weak against 
the incursions of the strong, was to poor Elspat a book sealed and a 
fountain closed.  She had been taught to consider those whom 
they called Saxons, as a race with whom the Gael were constantly 
at war, and she regarded every settlement of theirs within the reach 
of Highland incursion, as affording a legitimate object of attack 
and plunder.  (83) 
 
 
How do the highlighted words in the passage above betray the narrator’s ambivalence 
about “poor Elspat”?
