***** Final Portfolio of Essays *****
Due in Ses #26
On the last day of class, you must turn in your completed portfolio of essays
written during the semester. You must preface the portfolio with a one to two
page statement in which you consider how you read and write differently than
you did at the beginning of the semester. You might want to consider whether
you approach literary works differently now. Can fiction be clearly
distinguished from other genres, such as social criticism, autobiography,
biography, hagiography, history, anthropology, etc.? Do you find historical
contextualizing illuminating? Do you question the author's choice of title,
narrator, framing, description, pacing, etc?
Similarly, consider how your writing has developed over the course of the
semester. Do you write five-paragraph deductive essays or do you experiment
with other styles? Do you try to prove a thesis or to ask intriguing questions?
Do you apply your own ideas and beliefs to the work or try to develop new ideas
from the work? Do you incorporate textual passages to support your claims or as
material to be read closely and discussed? How do you open and close your
discussions? With statements, questions, passages, or analogies?
These are suggestions; your statement can be what you want it to be. Have fun.
Note: I can no longer leave work outside me office door, so if you want your
portfolio returned to you (and I certainly hope you do!), you must provide me
with a self-addressed and stamped mailer.
Final note: Please turn in your portfolio in the smallest possible binder or
pocket folder! Do not submit large looseleaf binders! Thank you.
Oral Presentations
Each student will have the opportunity to research a specific historical or
literary reference in one of the assigned works and prepare a factual oral
presentation of no more than five minutes. I will provide the references;
research can be done on-line or in the library. Students should be sure to
introduce their subjects and provide a brief overview; they should arrange
supporting details logically, and draw several connections with the text in
which the reference appears. Students should also speak clearly, slowly and
loudly enough to be heard by all present; they should maintain eye contact
rather than reading from a print-out, and, and finally, students should
practice ahead of time so that the presentation takes no more than five
minutes. Presentations will be graded and each student will receive a written
response.
