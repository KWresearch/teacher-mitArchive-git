Essay 4  -  due in Ses #20  (5 pages) 
 
 
Choose one of the following and write a five page essay in which you do your 
best to convince readers to share your understanding of either Flaubert’s “A Simple 
Heart” or Chopin’s The Awakening by using the work’s specific words, speeches, and 
scenes.   Try your best to distinguish between observations that arise from plot 
summary and analyses that advance an argument.  Try, too, to captivate your reader’s 
interest in your opening and concluding paragraphs, and to strive toward a clear logical 
arrangement of paragraphs.  Vary the types of sentences you use.  Read out loud.  
Give your essay a thoughtful title, double space throughout, number your pages, and 
proofread very carefully.  Remember that if you would like to explore another topic, talk 
to me ahead of time. 
 
 
1.   

In church she was forever gazing at the Holy Ghost, and one 
day she noticed that it had something of the parrot about it.  
This resemblance struck her as even more obvious in a 
colour-print depicting the baptism of Our Lord.  With its red 
wings and its emerald-green body, it was the very image of 
Loulou.  (50) 

 
Do we laugh at Felicite’s identification of Loulou with the Holy Spirit?  Should we? 
     
 
2.   What is the significance of the Corpus Christi festival?  What does it celebrate?  
Why do you think Flaubert used the almost-cinematic technique of going back and forth 
between the festival and Felicite’s death?      
 
3.  Why do you think that Chopin adapted the traditional elements of a Bildungsroman in 
The Awakening rather than dispensing with them entirely?     
 
4.  “’The trouble is,’ sighed the Doctor, grasping her meaning intuitively, ‘that youth is 
given up to illusions.  It seems to be a provision of Nature; a decoy to secure mothers 
for the race.  And Nature takes no account of moral consequences, of arbitrary 
conditions which we create, and which we feel obliged to maintain at any cost’” (120).  
Why is it that a medical doctor is the only one who can understand exactly what has 
been plaguing Edna Pontellier?
