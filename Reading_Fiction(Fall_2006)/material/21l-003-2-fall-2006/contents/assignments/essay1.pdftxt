Essay 1  -  due in Ses #6 (3 pages) 
 
 
Choose one of the following and write a 3 page essay in which you do your best 
to use specific words and scenes from Austen’s Northanger Abbey  to convince your 
readers of your thesis.  Try your best to distinguish between plot summary and 
argument, to captivate your reader’s interest in your opening and concluding 
paragraphs, and to strive toward a clear logical arrangement of paragraphs.   Read out 
loud.  Give your essay a thoughtful title, double space throughout, number your pages, 
and proofread very carefully. 
 
Finally, do not feel obliged to answer each and every question I pose.  The 
questions are designed to help you clarify your thoughts, not to trap you into a rigid 
format.   
 
 
 
1.   By the time you sit down to write this essay, we will have devoted quite a lot of class 
discussion to the idea of the Bildungsroman--or, as it is often translated, the novel of 
education, development, or formation.  Northanger Abbey is very obviously in this 
novelistic tradition.  By comparing the Catherine Morland we meet at the novel’s outset 
with the Catherine Morland of the final chapters, come up with your own definition of the 
Bildungsroman.  [Note: Rather than applying a definition to the novel, draw your 
definition from the specifics of this particular novel.]   [Second note: Bildungsroman is a 
German noun and as such it is both italicized and capitalized.  Its plural, by the way, is 
Bildungsromane.] 
 
 
2.  On the back cover of the Penguin edition of Northanger Abbey we read that 
Catherine Morland “learns how to tell the difference between books and real life.”  
Compare an early scene in which she confuses the two with a later one in which she 
clearly distinguishes between them.  Then ask yourself why, in her famous “Defense of 
the Novel” (I.5), Austen described the genre as “only some work in which the greatest 
powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human 
nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour 
are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language” (chapter 5). 
 
3.     

“Remember the country and the age in which we live.  
Remember that we are English, that we are Christians.  
Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the 
probable, your own observation of what is passing around 
you--Does our education prepare us for such atrocities?  Do 
our laws connive at them?  Could they be perpetrated 
without being known, in a country like this, where social and

literary intercourse is on such a footing; where evey man is 
surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and 
where roads and newspapers lay every thing open?  Dearest 
Miss Morland, what idea have you been admitting?” (172) 

 

“I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible.” (118) 

 
 
Many readers of Northanger Abbey assume that Austen is speaking through 
Henry Tilney, especially in the passage quoted above.  Why, though,  do readers 
assume that she is less ironic with Tilney than she is with her other characters?  How 
does she suggest that he reads both Gothic novels and the world in which he lives too 
literally?  
 
 
 
4.   
 
 
 
Think about Isabella Thorpe’s excessive use of language, Mrs. Allen’s parrot-like 
use of language, John Thorpe’s hyperbolic use of language, and--most of all--Henry 
Tilney and Catherine’s bantering dialogue throughout Northanger Abbey.  Then ask 
yourself why, at the novel’s end, Catherine and Henry are entirely unable to speak.  
Why does the chapter that brings Henry to Fullerton completely lack the dialogue that 
earlier in the novel characterized the scenes between the two?  What might Austen be 
suggesting about language, deception, and sincerity?
