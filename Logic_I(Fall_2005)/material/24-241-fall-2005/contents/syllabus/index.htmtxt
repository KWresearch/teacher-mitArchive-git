***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Course Description *****
This course provides an introduction to the aims and techniques of formal
logic. Logic is the science of correct argument, and our study of logic will
aim to understand what makes a correct argument good, that is, what is it about
the structure of a correct argument that guarantees that, if the premises are
all true, the conclusion will be true as well? Our subject (though, to be sure,
we can only scratch the surface) will be truth and proof, and the connection
between them.
***** Course Requirements *****
There will be a homework assignment every week or every other week, and a
mandatory 3-hour, open-book final exam. The final will carry the same weight as
three homework assignments.
***** Collaboration Policy *****
I encourage you to work together on the problems, but when you sit down to
write up your final answers, do it by yourself, without looking at anyone
else's work.
***** Course Calendar *****
The calendar below provides information on the course topics, which are taken
from chapters in the course manuscript. The manuscript entitled Logic: The Art
of Persuasion and the Science of Truth was written by the faculty member and is
available in the readings section.
