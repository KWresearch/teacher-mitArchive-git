1.  Introduction  and  Plato’s  The  Sophist 

To  progress   any  further,  we  are  going  to  need  an  analysis  that  goes 
deeper than looking  at how complex  sentences are formed  out  of simple 
sentences.   We  will  have  to  look  at  the  internal  structures  of  the  simple 
sentences.  
A  good  place  to  begin  is  the  Sophist,  where  Plato  gives  an  account 
of  what  makes  the  very  simplest  sentences  true  or  false.  Unlike  the 
typical  Platonic  dialogue,  where  Socrates  plays  the  dominant  role,  the 
principal  role  in  this  dialogue  is  played  by  Theætetus.  Theætetus  will 
go  on  to  distinguish   himself  as  a  courageous  leader  in  battle  and  also 
as  a  geometer.  It  was  Theætetus  who  ﬁrst  discovered  the  ﬁve  regular 
solids—polyhedra  all  of  whose  sides  and  angles  are  congruent—namely, 
the  cube,  the  tetrahedron,  the  octahedron,  the  dodecahedron,  and  the 
icosahedron.  But  I  digress.  Here  is  a  quote  from  Benjamin  Jowett’s 
translation: 
Stranger.  Then,  as  I  was  saying,  let  us  ﬁrst  of  all  obtain 
a  conception  of  language  and  opinion,  in  order  that  we 
may have clearer grounds for determining,  whether not­
being  has  any  concern  with  them,  or  whether  they  are 
both  always  true,  and  neither  of  them  ever  false. 
Theætetus.  True. 
Stranger. Then, now, let  us  speak  of  names, as before 
we  were  speaking  of  ideas  and  letters;  for  that  is  the 
direction  in  which  the  answer  may  be  expected. 
What  they  decided  about  ideas  and  about  names  was  that  some  ﬁt 
together  and  others  do  not.  For  example,  you  cannot  get  a  word  by 
forming  a  string  of  consonants,  but  you  can  get  a  word  by  combining 
consonants  and  vowels  in  the  right  way. 
Theætetus.  And  what  is  the  question  at  issue  about 
names?  

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS

Stranger.  The  question  at  issue  is  whether  all  names 
may  be  connected  with  one  another,  or  none,  or  only 
some  of  them. 
Theætetus.  Clearly  the  last  is  true. 
Stranger.  I  understand  you  to  say  that  words  which 
have  a  meaning  when  in  sequence  may  be  connected, 
but that words which have no meaning  when in  sequence 
cannot  be  connected? 
Theætetus.  What  are  you  saying? 
Stranger.  What I thought that you intended  when you 
gave your assent; for there are two  sorts of intimation of 
being  which  are  given  by  the  voice. 
Theætetus.  What  are  they? 
Stranger.  One  of  them  is  called  nouns,  and  the  other 
verbs.  
Theætetus.  Describe  them. 
Stranger.  That  which  denotes  action  we  call  a  verb. 
Theætetus.  True. 
Stranger.  And  the  other,  which  is  an  articulate  mark 
set  on  those  who  do  the  actions,  we  call  a  noun. 
Theætetus.  Quite  true. 
Stranger. A  succession of  nouns only is not  a  sentence 
any  more  than  of  verbs  without  nouns. 
Theætetus.  I  do  not  understand  you. 
Stranger.  I  see  that  when  you  gave  your  assent  you 
had  something  else  in  your  mind.  But  what  I  intended 
to  say  was  that  a  mere  succession  of  nouns  or  of  verbs 
is  not  discourse. 
Theætetus.  What  do  you  mean? 
Stranger. 
I  mean  that  words  like  “walks”,  “runs”, 
“sleeps”,  or  any  other  words  which  denote  action,  how­
ever  many  of  them  you  string  together,  do  not  make 
discourse. 
Theætetus.  How  can  they? 
Stranger.  Or,  again,  when  you  say  “lion”,  “stage”, 
“horse”,  or  any  other  words  which denote  agents—neither 
in this way  of  stringing  words together do you attain to 
discourse;  for  there  is  no  expression  of  action  or  inac­
tion,  or  of  the  existence  or  non-existence  indicated  by 
the  sounds,   until  verbs  are  mingled  with  nouns;  then 
the  words  ﬁt,  and  the  smallest  combination  of  them 

4

formslanguage,  and  is  the  simplest  and  least  form  of 
discourse. 
Theætetus.  Again  I  ask,  “What  do  you  mean?” 
Stranger. When any one says,  “A  man learns,” should 
you  not  call  this  the  simplest  and  least  of  sentences? 
Theætetus.  Yes. 
Stranger.  Yes, for he  now  arrives  at the point of giving 
an intimation about  something  which is, or is becoming, 
or  has  become,  or  will  be.  And  he  not  only  names,  but 
he does  something, by connecting  verbs with  nouns; and 
therefore  we  say  that  he  discourses,  and  to  this  connec­
tion  of  words  we  give  the  name  of  discourse. 
Theætetus.  True. 
Stranger.  And  as  there  are  some  things  which  ﬁt  one 
another,  and  other  things  which  do  not  ﬁt,  so  there  are 
some  vocal  signs  which  do,  and  others  which  do  not, 
combine  and  form  discourse. 
Theætetus.  Quite  true.

Stranger.  There  is  another  small  matter.

Theætetus.  What  is  it?

Stranger.  A  sentence  must  and  cannot  help  having  a

sub ject. 
Theætetus.  True. 
Stranger.  And  must  be  of  a  certain  quality. 
Theætetus.  Certainly. 
Stranger.  And  now  let  us  mind  what  we  are  about. 
Theætetus.  We  must  do  so. 
Stranger.  I  will  repeat  a  sentence  to  you  in  which  a 
thing  and  an  action  are  combined, by  the help  of  a  noun 
and  a  verb;  and  you  shall  tell  me  of  whom  the  sentence 
speaks.  
Theætetus.  I  will,  to  the  best  of  my  power.

Stranger.  “Theætetus sits”—not  a very long  sentence.

Theætetus.  Not  very.

Stranger. Of  whom does the  sentence speak, and  who

is  the  sub ject  that  is  what  you  have  to  tell. 
Theætetus.  Of  me;  I  am  the  sub ject. 
Stranger.  Or  this  sentence,  again. 
Theætetus.  What  sentence? 
Stranger.  “Theætetus, with  whom i  am now speaking, 
is  ﬂying.” 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS

Theætetus.  That  also  is  a  sentence  which  will  be  ad­
mitted  by  every  one  to  speak  of  me,  and  to  apply  to 
me. 
Stranger.  We  agreed  that  every  sentence  must  neces­
sarily  have  a  certain  quality. 
Theætetus.  Yes. 
Stranger.  And  what  is  the  quality  of  each  of  those 
two  sentences?  
Theætetus.  The  one,  as  I  imagine,  is  false,  and  the 
other  true. 
Stranger.  The  true  says  what  is  true  about  you? 
Theætetus.  Yes. 
Stranger.  And  the  false  says  what  is  other  than  true? 
Theætetus.  Yes. 
Stranger.  And  therefore  speaks  of  things  which  are 
not  as  if  they  were?’ 
Theætetus.  True. 
Stranger.  And  say  that  things  are  real  of  you  which 
are  not;  for,  as  we  were  saying,  in  regard  to  each  thing 
or  person,  where  is  much  that  is  and  much  that  is  not. 
Theætetus.  Quite  true. 
Stranger.  The  second  of  the  two  sentences  which  re­
lated  to  you  was  ﬁrst  of  all  an  example  of  the  shortest 
form  consistent  with  our  deﬁnition. 
Theætetus.  Yes,  this  was  implied in  recent  admission. 
Stranger.  And,  in  the  second  place,  it  related  to  a 
sub ject? 
Theætetus.  Yes. 
Stranger.  Who  must be you,  and  can be  nobody  else? 
Theætetus.  Unquestionably. 
Stranger.  And  it  would  be  no  sentence  at  all  if  there 
were no  sub ject, for as we proved, a  sentence which has 
no  sub ject  is  impossible. 
Theætetus.  Quite  true. 
Stranger.  When  other,  then,  is  asserted  of  you  as  the 
same,  and  not-being  as  being,  such  a  combination  of 
nouns  and  verbs  is  really  and  truly  false  discourse. 
Theætetus.  Most  true. 

In  our formal language, individual constants,  usually lowercase letters 
from  the  early  part  of  the  alphabet,  will  play  the  role  of  names,  and 
predicates,  usually  uppercase  letters,  will  play  the  role  of  verb.  Thus 

6

“t”  will  denote  Theætetus,  and  “S”  and  “F”  will  represent  the  actions 
of  sitting  and  ﬂying,  respectively.  “Theætetus  sits”  will  be  symbolized 
“St.”  and  “Theætetus ﬂies” will be  “Ft.”  The  sentence is true just in 
case  the individual  named  by  the  name performs  the  action designated 
by  the  verb. 

2.  Extension  of  Plato’s  The  Sophist 

We  want  to  start  with  Plato’s  account  and  extend  it,  as  far  as  we 
can,  beyond  the  very  simple  sentences  Plato  considers.  The  ﬁrst  thing 
we  notice  is  that  simple  sentences  of  the  form 
name  +  copula  +  adjective 

or 

like 

or 

name  +  copula  +  indeﬁnite  article  +  common  noun 

Theætetus  is  brave. 

Theætetus  is  a  Greek. 
can  be  readily  covered  by  Plato’s  account.  Thus,  we  take  a  simple 
sentence  to  consist   of  a  proper  name,  such  as  “Theætetus,”  and  a 
predicate,  such  as  “sits”  or  “is  brave”  or  “is  a  Greek.”  The  proper 
name designates  an individual  and  the predicate designates  a property 
or  action.  The  sentence  is  true  just  in  case  the  individual  has  the 
property or performs the action.  We’ll symbolize  “Theætetus is brave” 
as  “Bt,”  and  we’ll  use  “Gt”  to  symbolize  “Theætetus  is  a  Greek.” 
We can combine the simple  sentences by  means of  sentential  connec­
tives,   so  that  “Theætetus  is  a  brave  Greek”  will  be 

(B t ∧ Gt) 
“Theætetus  either  sits  or  ﬂies”  will  be 

(S t ∨ T t) 
“Theætetus  sits  but  he  does  not  ﬂy”  is 

(S t ∧ ¬F t) 
“If  Theætetus  is  brave,  so   is  Socrates”  is 

(B t →  B s) 
It  is  tempting  to  try  to  treat  “Something  ﬂies”  as  analogous  to 
“Theætetus  ﬂies.”  The  temptations  should  be  resisted.  One  way  to 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS

see that there is a big diﬀerence between  “Theætetus ﬂies” and  “Some­
thing  ﬂies”  is  to  observe  that  “Theætetus  ﬂies”  and  “Theætetus  is  a 
man”  together  imply  “Theætetus  is  a  man  who  ﬂies,”  whereas  “Some­
thing  ﬂies”  and  “Something  is  a  man”  do  not  imply  “Something  is  a 
man  who  ﬂies.” 
The  correct  analysis,   due  to  Frege,  is  this:  Whereas  “Theætetus 
ﬂies”  and  “Theætetus  is  a  man”  are  to  be  understood  as  attributing 
a  property  (ﬂying;  manhood)  to  an  individual  (Theætetus),  “Some­
thing ﬂies” is to be understood  as attributing  a property  to a property. 
Namely  “Something  ﬂies”  says  about  the  property  of  ﬂying  that  it  is 
instantiated.  Similarly,  “Something  is  a  man”  says  about  the  prop­
erty  of  manhood  that  it  is  instantiated.  We  represent  the  property 
of  ﬂying  in  English   by  an  open  sentence  “x  ﬂies,”  and  in  the  formal 
language  by  an  open  sentence  “F x.”  We  indicate  that  something  ﬂies 
in  the  formal  language  by preﬁxing  the  existential  quantiﬁer  “(∃x)” to 
the  open  sentence  “F x,”  getting  “(∃x)F x.”  “(∃x)”  is  read  “for  some 
x”  or  “there  is  such  an  x  such  that.”  Similarly,  the  property  of  man­
hood  is  indicated  in  English  by  the  open  sentence  “x  is  a  man”  and 
in  the  formal  language  by  the  open  sentence  “M x.”  We  indicate  that 
something  is  a  man  by  preﬁxing  the  existential  quantiﬁer  to  the  open 
sentence  “M x,”  getting  “(∃x)M x.”  The  property  of  being  a  man  who 
ﬂies is indicated in English by  the open  sentence  “x  is  a  man  who  ﬂies” 
or  “x  is  a  man  and  x  ﬂies”  and  in  the  formal  language  by  the  open 
sentence  “(M x ∧  F x).”  We  indicate  that  some  men  ﬂy  by  preﬁxing 
the  existential  quantiﬁer  to  the  open  sentence  “(M x ∧  F x),”  getting 
“(∃x)(M x ∧ F x).” 
Similarly,  it  would  be  tempting  to  treat  “Everything  is  a  man”  as 
analogous  to  “Theætetus  is  a  man.”  The  resemblance  between  the 
two  is  superﬁcial,  however,  as  we  can  see  from  the  following  example: 
“Theætetus  is  either  a  man  or  a  woman”  and  “It  is  not  the  case  that 
Theætetus is a woman” together imply  “Theætetus is a man,” whereas 
“Everything  is  either  a  man  or  a  woman”  and  “It  is  not  the  case  that 
everything  is  a  woman”  do  not  imply  “Everything  is  a  man.”  Whereas 
“Theætetus is  a  man”  indicates that  a  certain individual (Theætetus) 
has  certain  property  (manhood),  “Everything  is  a  man”  attributes 
a  property  to  a  property.  Namely,  “Everything  is  a  man”  tells  us 
about the property  of  manhood  that it is possessed by  everything.  We 
indicate  that  everything  is  a  man  by  preﬁxing  the  universal  quanti­
ﬁer  “(∀x)”  (read  “for  all  x”  or  “for  every  x”)  to  the  open  sentence 
“M x,”  getting “(∀x)M x.”  We indicate that  everything ﬂies by  writing 
“(∀x)F x.”  We indicate that  all  men ﬂy by  writing  “(∀x)(M x →  F x),” 
so  that,  for  every  x,  either  x  is  not  a  man  or  else  x  ﬂies.

3.1.  Quantiﬁed  Statements.  We  can  use  Venn  digrams  to  illustrate 
quantiﬁed  statements.  

Example  3.1.  “Everyone  is  a  man  or  a  woman”  [“(∀x)(M x ∨  W x)”] 
is  indicated  by  shading  Cell  4  in  Figure  1,  to  indicate  that  there  is 
nothing  in  Cell  4.

“Everyone  is  a  man  or  a  woman”  [“(∀x)(M x ∨  W x)”] 
is  indicated  by  shading  Cell  4,  to  indicate  that  there  is

Example  3.2.  “All  men  ﬂy” [“(x)(M x →  F x)”] is indicated by shading 
Cell  2  in  Figure  2.

“All  men  ﬂy” 
[“(x)(M x →  F x)”]  is  indicated  by  shading  Cell  2.  The 
shading  in  Cell  2  means  there  is  nothing  in  Cell  2.

Example  3.3.  “Everything  that  ﬂies is a man”  [“(∀x)(F x →  M x)”] is 
indicated  in  Figure  3  by  shading  Cell  3. 

Example  3.4.  “Everything  that  ﬂies  is  either  a  man  or  a  woman” 
[“(∀x)(F x →  (M x ∨ W x))”] is  indicated  by  shading  Cell  7  in  Figure  4. 

Figure 3.  Everything that  ﬂies (F ) is  a  man (M ).  “Ev­
erything  that  ﬂies is a man”  [“(∀x)(F x →  M x)”]  is  in­
dicated  by  shading  Cell  3.  The  shading  in  Cell  3  means 
there  is  nothing  in  Cell  3. 

Figure 4.  Everything that  ﬂies (F ) is  either  a  man (M ) 
or  a  woman (W ).  “Everything  that  ﬂies  is  either  a  man 
or  a  woman”  [“(∀x)(F x  →  (M x ∨  W x))”]  is  indicated 
by  shading  Cell  7.  The  shading  in  Cell  7  means  there  is 
nothing  in  Cell  7.

Example  3.5.  “Everyone who is either a man or a woman  ﬂies” [“(∀x)((M x∨ 
W x) →  F x)”] is  indicated  by  shading  Cells  2,  4,  and  6  in  Figure  5. 

Figure  5.  Everyone  who  is  either  a  man  (M )  or  a 
woman  (W )  ﬂies  (F ).  “Everyone  who  is  either  a  man 
or  a  woman  ﬂies” [“(∀x)((M x ∨  W x)  →  F x)”]  is  indi­
cated  by  shading  Cells  2,  4,  and  6.  The  shading  in  Cells 
2,  4,  and  6  means  there  is  nothing  in  those  cells. 

Example  3.6.  For  “Everyone  who  is  both  a  man  and  a  woman  ﬂies” 
[“(∀x)((M x ∧  W x)  →  F x)”]  we  shade  Cell  2  in  Figure  6,  while  for 
“Everyone who  ﬂies is both  a man and  a woman”  [“(∀x)(F x →  (M x ∧ 
W x))”] we  shade  Cells  3,  5,  and  7  in  Figure  7. 

3.2.  Statements Beginning With  an Existential Quantiﬁer.  How 
about  sentences  that  begin  with  an  existential  quantiﬁer?  If  we  want 
to  illustrate  the  sentence  “Someone  who  is  either  a  man  or  a  woman 
ﬂies”  [“(∃x)((M x ∨  W x) ∧  F x)”],  we  want  to  indicate  that  there  is 
something  in  at  least   one  of  the  three  Cells  1,  3,  and  5.  We  can  do 
this  by  drawing  a  curve  that  passes  through  Cells,  1,  3,  and  5,  as  in 
Figure  8.  You  can  think  of  the  curve  as  like  a  train  track;  there  is  a 
locomotive  somewhere  along  the  track.

Cells  3,  5,  and  7.  The  shading  in  Cells  3,  5,  and  7  means 
there  is  nothing  in  those  cells.

curve  that  passes  through  Cells  1,  3,  and  5. 

Example  3.7.  “There  are  some  men  who  either  sit  or  ﬂy”  [“(∃x)(M x ∧

some  men  who  do  neither”  [“((∃x)(M x  ∧  S x) ∧  (∃x)(M x  ∧  F x) ∧ 
(∃x)(M x ∧ ¬(S x ∨ F x)))”] is  indicated  in  Figure  12  by  having  a  curve 

Figure  10.  There  are  some  men (M ) who both  sit (S ) 
and  ﬂy (F ).  For  “There  are  some  men  who  both  sit  and 
ﬂy”  [“(∃x)(M x ∧  (S x ∧  F x))”],  the  curve  is  contained 
entirely  within  Cell  1. 

Figure  11.  There  are  some  men (M ) who  ﬂy (F ),  and 
there  are  some  men  who  do  not.  For  “There  are  some 
men  who  ﬂy,  and  there  are  some  men  who  do  not” 
[“((∃x)(M x ∧  F x) ∧  (∃x)(M x ∧ ¬F x))”],  one  curve  is 
contained  entirely  in  within  Cell  1  and  another  curve  is 
entirely  in  Cell  2.

that  passes  through  Cells  1  and  2,  a  second  curve  that  passes  through 
Cells  1  and  3,  and  yet  another  curve  that  is  contained  entirely  within 
Cell  4. 

Figure  12.  There are  some men (M ) who  sit (S ),  some 
men  who  ﬂy  (F ),  and  some  men  who  do  neither.  For 
“There  are  some  men  who  sit,  some  men  who  ﬂy,  and 
some  men  who do  neither” [“((∃x)(M x∧S x)∧(∃x)(M x∧ 
F x) ∧ (∃x)(M x ∧ ¬(S x ∨ F x)))”],  there  are  three  curves: 
one  that  passes  through  Cells  1  and  2,  one  for  Cells  1 
and  3,  and  one  entirely  in  Cell  4. 

3.3.  Statements  Containing  Proper  Names.  Sentences  that  con­
tain proper names are indicated  the  same way, except that  we label  the 
curves.  

Example  3.11.  “Theætetus is a man who either  sits or  ﬂies” [“(M t ∧ 
(S t ∨ F t))”] is indicated in Figure 13 by having a curve marked  “t” pass 
through  cells  1,  2,  and  3.  Theætetus  is  a  locomotive  that  is  located 
somewhere  along  the  track. 

Example  3.12.  “Theætetus is a man who both  sits and  ﬂies” [“(M t ∧ 
(S t ∧ F t))”] is  indicated  in  Figure  14  by  a  curve  marked  “t”  contained 
entirely  within  Cell  1.

Figure  13.  Theætetus (t) is  a  man (M ) who  either  sits 
(S )  or  ﬂies  (F ).  For  “Theætetus  is  a  man  who  either 
sits  or  ﬂies” [“(M t ∧ (S t ∨ F t))”],  the  curve  marked “t” 
passes  through  Cells  1,  2,  and  3. 

Figure  14.  Theætetus (t) is  a  man (M ) who  both  sits 
(S )  and  ﬂies  (F ).  For  “Theætetus  is  a  man  who  both 
sits and  ﬂies” [“(M t ∧ (S t ∧ F t))”],  the  curve  marked “t” 
is  contained  entirely  in  Cell  1.

Example  3.13.  “Rambo,  who  is  a  man,  does  not  ﬂy,  but  Dumbo,  who 
is not a man, does  ﬂy”  [“((M r ∧ ¬F r) ∧ (¬M d ∧ F d))”] is  illustrated 
in  Figure  15  by  two  curves,  one  marked  “r ,”  contained  within  Cell  2, 
and  the  other,  marked  “d,”  contained  within  Cell  3. 

Figure  15.  Rambo (r),  who is  a  man (M ),  does  not  ﬂy 
(F ),  but  Dumbo  (d),  who  is  not  a  man,  does  ﬂy.  For 
“Rambo,  who  is  a  man,  does  not  ﬂy,  but  Dumbo,  who  is 
not a man, does  ﬂy”  [“((M r ∧ ¬F r) ∧  (¬M d ∧  F d))”], 
the  curve  marked  “r”  is  contained  within  Cell  2  and  the 
curve  marked  “d”  within  Cell  3. 

3.4.  Validity  of  Arguments.  We  can  use  Venn  diagrams  to  show 
that  certain  arguments  are  valid. 

Example  3.14.  For  example,  consider  this  argument: 
All  terriers  are  dogs. 
All  dogs  are  mammals. 
Therefore  all  terriers  are  mammals. 
In  symbols,  
(∀x)(T x →  Dx) 
(∀x)(Dx →  M x) 
∴  (∀x)(T x →  M x). 
We  see whether it is possible to have the premise true and  the conclu­
sion  false.  The  ﬁrst   premise  is  indicated  in  Figure  16  by  shading  Cells 
3  and  4.  The  second  premise  is  indicated  by  shading  Cells  2  and  6.  If 
the  conclusion  were  false,  there  would  be  something  either  in  Cell  2  or 
in Cell 4;  we indicate this by  a train track passing  through Cells 2  and 
4.  But,  while  the  train  track  would  indicate  that  there  is  something 
either  within  Cell  2  or  Cell  4,  the  fact  that  Cells  2  and  4  are  both 
shaded  indicates  that  there  is  nothing  in  either  of  those  cells.  So  the 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS 

17 

attempt to diagram a  situation in which  the premises are true and  the 
conclusion  false  ends  up  with  an  impossibility.  So  the  argument  must 
be  valid. 

Figure  16.  All  terriers  are  mammals.  All  terriers (T) 
are dogs (D).  All dogs are mammals (M). Therefore all 
terriers  are  mammals.  (∀x)(E x →  M x) (∃x)(E x ∧ F x) 
∴  (∃x)(M x ∧ F x).  The  curve  runs  through  Cells  2  and 
4.  The  shading  of  cells  2,  3,  4,  and  6  indicates  there  is 
nothing  in  those  cells. 

Example  3.15.  Another  example: 

All  elephants  are  mammals.

Some  elephants  can  ﬂy.

Therefore  some  mammals  can  ﬂy.


In  symbols,  
(∀x)(E x →  M x)

(∃x)(E x ∧ F x)

∴  (∃x)(M x ∧ F x).

In  Figure  17,  we  try  to  diagram  a  situation  in  which  the  premises 
are  true  and  the  conclusion  is  false.  The  ﬁrst  premise  is  indicated  by 
shading  Cells  3  and  4.  The  second  premise  is  indicated  by  a  train 
track  passing  through  Cells  1  and  3.  To  say  the  conclusion  is  true  is 
to  say  that  there  is  something  either  in  Cell  1  or  in  Cell  5.  Thus,  to 
indicate  that  the  conclusion  is  false,  we  shade  Cells  1  and  5.  But  this 
has  the  train  track  passing  entirely  through  shaded  territory,  which  is 
impossible.  So  the  argument  must  be  valid. 

Example  3.16.  Here  is  an  inference  to  consider: 

18 

PROFESSOR  VANN MCGEE 

Dumbo  is  an  elephant. 
Dumbo  ﬂies.  
Therefore  some  elephants  ﬂy. 
In  symbols,  
E d

F d

∴  (∃x)(E x ∧ F x).

To  represent  the  ﬁrst   premise,  we  draw  a  train  track  marked  “d” 
through  Cells  1  and  2  in  Figure  18.  We  indicate  the  second  premise 
by  crossing  out  the  part  of  this  train  track  which  lies  outside  circle 
“F .”  To  indicate  the  falsity  of  the  conclusion,  we  shade  Cell  1.  But 
this  gives  us  a  train  track  every  part  of  which  is  either  crossed  out  or 
shaded,  which  represents  an  impossible  situation. 

Example  3.17.  Now  consider  this  inference: 
Traveler  is  a  horse. 
All  horses  eat  oats. 
Therefore  Traveler  eats  oats. 
In  symbols,  
H t

(∀x)(H x →  Ox)

∴  Ot.


Figure  17.  Some  mammals  can  ﬂy.  All  elephants (E) 
are mammals (M). Some elephants can  ﬂy (F). Therefore 
some  mammals  can  ﬂy.  (∀x)(E x  →  M x).  (∃x)(E x ∧ 
F x).  ∴  (∃x)(M x ∧ F x).  The  curve passes through Cells 
1  and  3.  The  shading  in  Cells  1,  3,  4,  and  5  indicates 
there  is  nothing  in  those  cells. 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS 

19 

The  ﬁrst premise is indicated in Figure 19 by  a curve marked  “t” pass­
ing  through  Cells  1  and  2,  and  the  second  premise  is  indicated  by 
shading  Cell  2.  We  indicate  the  falsity  of  the  conclusion  by  crossing 
out  the  part  of  curve  “t”  which  lies  inside  circle  “O .”  But  this  means 
the  whole  curve  is  either  crossed  out  or  shaded,  which  is  impossible. 

Example  3.18.  As   a  ﬁnal  example,  consider 
Everyone  is  either  a  man  or  a  woman. 

Figure  18.  Some  elephants  ﬂy.  Dumbo (d)  is  an  ele­
phant (E ).  Dumbo  ﬂies (F ).  Therefore  some  elephants 
ﬂy.  E d.  F d.  ∴  (∃x)(E x ∧ F x).  The  curve  marked  “d” 
passes  through  Cells  1  and  2. 
In  Cell  2,  the  curve  is 
crosshatched.  The  shading  in  Cell  1  indicates  there  is 
nothing  in  the  cell. 

Figure  19.  Traveler  eats  oats.  Traveler (t)  is  a  horse 
(H ).  All  horses  eat  oats  (O).  Therefore  Traveler  eats 
oats.   H t. (∀x)(H x  →  Ox).  ∴  Ot.  The  curve  marked 
“t”  passes  through  Cells  1  and  2.  In  Cell  1,  the  curve  is 
crosshatched;  Cell  2  is  shaded  to  indicate  nothing  in  the 
cell.

Not  everyone  is  a  man.

Therefore  someone  is  a  woman.

In  symbols 
(∀x)(M x ∨ W x) 
¬(∀x)M x 
∴  (∃x)W x. 
The  ﬁrst premise is indicated in Figure 20 by shading Cell 4.  “(∀x)M x” 
says that there is notheing in either Cell 3  or Cell 4.  “¬(∀x)M x” denies 
this,   so  it  says  that  there  is  something  either  in  Cell  3  or  in  Cell  4,  a 
fact  we  can  indicate  by  drawing  a  curve  passing  through  Cells  3  and 
4.  The  conclusion  says  that  there  is  someone  either  in  Cell  1  or  in  Cell 
3.  So  we  can  indicate  the  falsity  of  the  conclusion  by  shading  Cells  1 
and  3.  But  this  has  the  train  track  passing  entirely  through  shaded 
territory,  which  is  impossible. 

Figure  20.  Someone 
is  a  woman.  Everyone 
is  ei­
ther  a  man (M )  or  a  woman  (W ).  Not  everyone  is  a 
man.  Therefore  someone  is  a  woman.  (∀x)(M x ∨ W x). 
¬(∀x)M x.  ∴  (∃x)W x.  A  curve  passes  through  Cells  3 
and  4.  Cells  1,  3,  and  4  are  shaded  to  indicate  nothing 
in  the  cells.  

4.  Formal  Development 

We  now  turn  to  a  more  formal  development.  A  language  for  the 
monadic predicate  calculus (MPC)  is  given  by  specifying  two  kinds  of 
things:  
individual  constants  (usually  lowercase  letters  from  the  early 
part  of  the  alphabet),  which  play  the  role  of  proper  names,  and  pred­
icates  (usually  uppercase  letters),  which  play  the  roles  of  intransitive 
verbs,   common  nouns,   and  adjectives.  An  atomic  formula  consists  ei­
ther  of  a predicate followed by  an individual  constant  or  of  a predicate 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS 	

21 

followed  by  the  variable  “x.”  The  formulas  of  the  language  constitute 
the  smallest   class   of  expressions  which 
contains  the  atomic  formulas: 
contains (φ ∧ ψ), (φ ∨ ψ), (φ →  ψ),  and (φ ↔  ψ) 
whenever  it  contains  φ  and  ψ ;  and 
contain  ¬φ, (∀x)φ,  and (∃x)φ  whenever  it  contains  φ. 

Proposition  4.1  (Unique  Readability).  A  formula  is  built  up  from 
atomic  formulas  in  a  unique  way. 
The  subformulas  of  a  particular  formula  are  just  the  formulas  that 
are contained  within the given formula,  where a formula is counted  as a 
subformula of itself.  If  an occurence of  the letter  “x”  within  a particular 
formula  is  contained  within  a  subformula  beginning  with  “(∀x)”  or  with 
“(∃x),”  the  occurence  is  said  to  be  bound.  Otherwise  it  is  said  to  be 
free.  A  formula  with  no  free  occurrences  of  “x”  is  a  sentence.  Where 
φ  is  a  formula  and  c  is  a  constant,  we  write  φ x
c  for  the  sentence  that 
results  from  replacing  each  free  occurrence  of  “x”  in  φ  by  “c.” 

Example  4.2.  In  “(F x ∧  (∀x)(Gx ∧ ¬(∀x)J x)),”  the  ﬁrst  occurrence 
“(F x  ∧  (∀x)(Gx  ∧ 
of  “x”  is  free,  and  the  other  four  are  bound. 
d  is  the  sentence  “(F d ∧ (∀x)(Gx ∧ ¬(∀x)J x)).” 
¬(∀x)J x))” x
Example  4.3.  In  “((∀x)(F x  ↔  Gx) ∧  ((∃x)F x  ↔  (H x ∧  J c))),”  the 
ﬁrst   ﬁve  occurrences  of  “x”  are  bound  and  the  remaining  occurrence  is 
c  is  “((∀x)(F x ↔ 
free.  “((∀x)(F x ↔  Gx) ∧ ((∃x)F x ↔  (H x ∧ J c)))” x
Gx) ∧ ((∃x)F x ↔  (H c ∧ J c))),” which  is  a  sentence. 

Example  4.4.  In “(((∀x)F x ↔  Gx) ∧ (∃x)(F x ↔  (H x ∧ J c))),”  only the 
third  occurrence  of  “x”  is  free;  the  other  ﬁve  are  bound.  “(((∀x)F x ↔ 
Gx) ∧ (∃x)(F x ↔  (H x ∧ J c)))” x
e  is  the  sentence  “(((∀x)F x ↔  Gx) ∧ 
(∃x)(F x ↔  (H e ∧ J c))).” 

Example  4.5.  “F c”  and  “(∀x)F x”  are  both  sentences. 

Example  4.6.  In  general,  if  φ  is  a  formula  and  c  is  a  constant,  φ x
c  is 
a  sentence.  Also,  every  formula  which  begins  with  either  “(∀x)”  or 
“(∃x)” is  a  sentence. 

Deﬁnition  4.7.  An   interpretation  (of  a  language  of  the  MPC)  is  a 
function  A  deﬁned  on  {“∀”} ∪ {individual  constants  of  the  language} 
∪ {predicates  of  the  language} that  meets  the  following  conditions: 
•	 A(“∀”),  also  written  |A|,  is  a  nonempty  set,  called  the  universe 
of  discourse  or  the  domain  of  the  interpretation. 
•	 If  c  is  a  constant,  A(c),  also  written cA,  is  an  element  of  |A|. 
•	 If  R  is  a  predicate,  A(R),  also  written RA,  is  a  subset  of  |A|. 

22 

PROFESSOR  VANN MCGEE 

The  universe  of  discourse  of  a  particular  discussion  consists  of  the 
things  we  are  talking  about  within  that  discussion.  When  I  say,  sitting 
at the dinner table with  the family,  “Everybody  who ﬁnishes her Brus­
sel  sprouts  will  get  ice  cream,”  I’m  not  promising  to  reward  everyone 
in the whole world  who eats her Brussel  sprouts, just everyone  sitting 
there  at  the  table.  For  any  formula  φ,  there  will  be  a  set  of  members 
of  the  universe  of  A  that  satisfy  φ  in  A.  If  this  set  is  nonempty,  the 
sentence (∃x)φ  will  be  true  in  A.  If  every  member  of  |A| satisﬁes  φ  in 
A, ((∀x)φ)) will  be  true  in  A.  If  the  member  cA  of  |A| satisﬁes  φ  in  A, 
then  the  sentence  φ x  will be  true in  A.  It  makes  no  sense  to  talk  about 
c 
a  sentence  of  the  formal  language  being  true  or  false  absolutely.  A 
sentence  can  be  either  true  or  false  under  an  interpretration;  a  formula 
with  free  variables  cannot. 
Intuitively,  we  have  three  fundamental  semantic  notions,  truth,  fal­
sity, and  satisfaction.  A sentence expresses a thought that is either true 
or false, whereas a formula that is not  a  sentence represents a property, 
and  the formula is  satisﬁed by  those elements of  the universe that have 
the  property.  We  shall  simplify  our  treatment  by  departing  from  our 
intuitions a little bit, applying the notion of  satisfaction to all formulas, 
whether  or  not  the  formulas  contain  free  variables,  stipulating  that  a 
true  sentence  is  satisﬁed  by  every  member  of  the  universe  of  discourse, 
whereas  a  false  sentence  is  satisﬁed  by  nothing.  Speciﬁcally,  we  have 
the  following: 

Proposition  4.8.  Given  an  interpretation  A, 
an  atomic  formula  of  the  form  Rx  is  satisﬁed  by  the 
members  of  A(R); 
an  atomic  formula  of  the  form  Rc  is  satisﬁed  by  ev­
ery  member  of  the  universe  if  A(c) is  an  element  of 
A(R); 
otherwise,  Rc  is  satisﬁed  by  nothing; 
a  formula  of  the  form  (φ ∧ ψ) is  satisﬁed  by  those  mem­
bers  of  the  universe  of  discourse  which  either  satisfy 
both  φ  and  ψ ; 
a  formula  of  the  form  (φ ∨ ψ) is  satisﬁed  by  those  mem­
bers  of  the  universe  of  discourse  which  either  satisfy 
either  φ  and  ψ  (or  both); 
a formula  of  the form  (φ →  ψ) is  satisﬁed by  those  mem­
bers  of  the  universe  of  discourse  which  either  satisfy 
ψ  or  fail  to  satisfy  φ; 
a formula  of  the form  (φ ↔  ψ) is  satisﬁed by  those  mem­
bers  of  the  universe  of  discourse  which  satisfy  both 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS 

23 

φ  and  ψ  and  also  by  those  members  of  the  domain 
which  satisfy  neither  φ  nor  ψ ; 
a  formula  of  the  form  ¬φ  is  satisﬁed  by  those  members 
of  the  universe  of  discourse  which  fail  to  satisfy  φ; 
if  every  member  of  the  universe  satisﬁes  φ,  then  every 
member  of  the  universe  satisﬁes  (∀x)φ; 
if  some  member  of  the  universe fails  to  satisfy  φ,  nothing 
satisﬁes  (∀x)φ; 
if  some  member  of  the  universe  satisﬁes  φ,  every  mem­
ber  of  the  universe  satisﬁes  (∃x)φ; 
if  no  member  of  the  universe  satisﬁes  φ,  no  member  of 
the  universe  satisﬁes  (∃x)φ; 

Example  4.9.  As   an  example  of  an  interpretation,  let’s  let 
|A|  =  {animals} 
A(“b”)  =  Bonzo  the  chimpazee 
A(“c”)  =  Celia  the  canary 
A(“r”)  =  Reagan,  the  former  president 
A(“B ”)  =  {animals  that  bay  at  the  moon} 
A(“D”)  =  {dogs} 
A(“F ”)  =  {animals  that  ﬂy} 
A(“C ”)  =  {chipmunks} 
Since  Celia  can  ﬂy,  A(“c”)  is  an  element  of  A(“F ”),  and  so  every 
animal  will  satisfy  “F c”.  A(“r”)  ∈/ A(“F ”),  since  Reagan  can’t  ﬂy,  so 
nothing  will  satisfy  “F r.”  “Bx”  will  be  satisﬁed  by  the  animals  that 
bay  at  the  moon  and  “Dx”  will  be  satisﬁed  by  the  dogs.  “(Dx ∧ Bx)” 
will  be  satisﬁed  by  the  dogs  that  bay  at  the  moon.  “¬F x”  will  be 
satisﬁed by the animals that don’t ﬂy.  “(Dx∧¬Bx)” will be  satisﬁed by 
the dogs that don’t bay  at the moon.  Since  some dogs bay at the moon, 
every  animal  will  satisfy  “(∃x)(Dx ∧ Bx).”  Since  no  dogs  ﬂy,  nothing 
will  satisfy  “(∃x)(Dx ∧  F x).”  Nothing  satisﬁes  “(∀x)(Dx  →  Bx),” 
since  not  every  dog  bays  at  the  moon.  Since  Reagan  isn’t  a  chipmunk, 
nothing  satisﬁes  “C r.”  So  every  animal  satisﬁes  “^¬C r.”  So  every 
animal  satisﬁes  “(∀x)¬C r.”  � 

Let’s introduce  some technical jargon.  A formula that begins with 
“(∀x)” is  a  universal  formula.  One  that  begins  with  “(∃x)” is  an  exis­
tential  formula.  Formulas that begin either with  “(∀x)”  or  with “(∃x)” 
are  said  to be  initial ly quantiﬁed.  Conjuctions,  disjunctions,  negations, 
conditionals,   and  biconditionals  are  referred  to  as  molecular  formulas. 
Every  formula  which  isn’t  either  atomic  or  initially  quantiﬁed  is  built 
up  from  atomic formulas  and from initially quantiﬁed by  means  of  the 
connectives  “∧,”  “∨,”  “¬,”  “→,”  and  “↔.”  We  refer  to  those  atomic 

24

and initially quantiﬁed  sentences out of  which  a given  sentence is built 
as  its  basic  truth-functional  components. 

Deﬁnition  4.10.  A  sentence which is  satisﬁed by  every  member of  |A| 
under  an interpretation  A is  said  to be true under  A.  A  sentence  which 
is  satisﬁed  by  no  member  of  |A| under  A  is  false  under  A. 

Theorem  4.11  (Law  of  Bivalence).  Given  an  interpretation  A,  every 
sentence  is  either  true  under  A  or  false  under  A. 

Proof.  Since every  sentence is built  up from atomic  sentences and from 
initially  quantiﬁed  sentences  by  means  of  the  sentential  connectives,  it 
will  be  enough  to  show  that,  given  an  interpretation  A,  every  atomic 
sentence  and  every  initially  quantiﬁed  sentence  is  either  true  or  false 
under  A and that  every  sentence formed from  sentences which  are either 
true  or  false  under  A  by  means  of  the  sentential  connectives  is  either 
true  or  false  under  A. 
An   atomic  sentence  takes  the  form  “F c.”  Such  a  sentence  is  true 
under  A  if  A(c) ∈  A(F ) and  false  under  A  if  A(c) ∈/ A(F ).  A  universal 
sentence (∀x)φ  is  true  under  A  if  every  member  of  |A| satisﬁes  φ under 
A,  and  it  is  false  under  A  otherwise.  An  existential  sentence (∃x)φ  is 
true  under  A  if  at  least   one  member  of  |A| satisﬁes  φ  under  A,  and  it 
is  false  under  A  otherwise. 
A  conjuction is  true  under  A if both  conjuncts  are  true  under  A,  and 
it  is  false  under  A  if  either  conjunct  is  false  under  A.  A  disconjuction 
is  true  under  A  if  either  disjunct  is  true  under  A,  and  it  is  false  under 
A  if both disjuncts  are false  under  A.  A  negation  is  true  under  A  if  the 
negatum  is  false  under  A,  and  it  is  false  under  A  if  the  negatum  is  true 
under  A.  A  conditional  is  true  under  A  if  the  antecedent  is  false  under 
A  or  the  consequent  is  true  under  A;  if  the  antecedent  is  true  under  A 
and  the  consequent  is  false  under  A,  the  conditional  is  false  under  A. 
A  biconditional  is  true  under  A  if  both  components  are  true  under  A 
or  both  components  are  false  under  A;  if  one  component  is  true  and 
the  other  is  false,  the  biconditional  is  false  under  A.

Corollary  4.12.  For  any  sentence  φ,  interpretation  A,  and  element  a 
of  |A|,  φ  is  true  under  A  iﬀ  a  satisﬁes  φ  under  A. 

Proof.  If  φ  is  true  under  A,  then,  by  defnition  of“true,”  every  element 
of  |A� | satisﬁes  φ  under  A.  So  in  particular,  a  satisﬁes  φ  under  A.  If, 
on  the  other  hand,  φ  isn’t  true  under  A,  then,  by  bivalence,  φ  is  false 
under  A,  so  that,  by  deﬁnition  of  “false,”  nothing  satisﬁes  φ  under  A; 
so,  in  particular,  a  doesn’t  satisfy  φ  under  A.

The  following  deﬁnition  is  taken  over  directly  from  the  sentential 
calculus:  

Deﬁnition  4.13.  A  normal  truth  assignment  (N.T.A)  is  a  function 
which  assigns  a  number,  either  0  or  1,  to  each  sentence,  sub ject  to  the 
following  conditions 
•	 A  conjuction  is  assigned  1  iﬀ  both  conjuncts  are  assigned  1. 
•	 A  disconjuction  is  assigned  1  iﬀ  one  or  both  disconjuncts  are 
assigned  1. 
•	 A  negation  is  assigned  1  iﬀ  the  negatum  is  assigned  0. 
•	 A  conditional  is  assigned  1  iﬀ  the  antecedent  is  assigned  0  or 
the  consequent  is  assigned  1. 
•	 A  biconditional  is  assigned  1  iﬀ  both  components  are  assigned 
the  same  value. 

Deﬁnition  4.14.  A  sentence  is  tautological  iﬀ  it  is  assigned  the  value 
1  by  every  N.T.A.   A  sentence  is  valid  iﬀ  it  is  true  under  every  N.T.A 

For the  sentential calculus, the words  “tautological” and  “valid” were 
diﬀerent  words  for  the  same  thing.  Now  that  we’ve  started  on  the 
predicate  calculus,   we  need  to  distinguish  them.  Validity  is  the  notion 
we  are  really  interested  in,  but  we  need  the  notion  of  tautology  as  a 
technical  notion. 

Proposition  4.15.  Every  tautology  is  valid,  but  not  vice  versa. 
Proof.  Suppose  that  θ  is  a  tautology,  and  take  an  arbitrary  interpreta­
tion  A. We get a normal  truth  assignment by  stipulating  that, for any 
φ, 

F(φ)  =  1 if  φ  is  true  under  A 
=  0  otherwise 
So  F(θ)  =  1.  Hence  θ  is  true  under  A.  Since  A  was  arbitrary,  this 
shows  that  every  tautological  formula  is  valid.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
tautological  formula  “((∀x)F x →  F c) is  not  tautological. 
� 

A  tautological  sentence  is  a  valid  sentence  whose  validity  is  deter­
mined  by  the  sentence’s  truth  functional  structure. 
If,  instead,  the 
validity  of  a  sentence’s  truth  functional  structure.  If,  instead,  the  va­
lidity  of  a  sentence  depends  upon  the  meaning  of  the  quantiﬁers,  the 
sentence  won’t  be  tautological. 
We  can  test   whether  a  sentence  is  tautological  by  the  method  of 
truth  tables,   examining  each  possible  way  to  assign  a  truth  value  to 
the  sentences’   basic  truth  functional  components.  Alternatively,  we 
can  test   the  sentence  by  the  search-for-counterexample  method.  For

example,  to  show  that  “(((∃x)F x →  (∀x)Gx ∨ (¬H c →  (∃x)F x))” is 
tautological,  we  have  the  following: 

(((∃x)F x →  (∀x)Gx) ∨ (¬H c →  (∃x)F x))

Deﬁnition  4.16.  A  sentence  φ  is  a  logical  consequence  of a  set of 
sentences  γ  iﬀ  φ  is  true  under  every  interpretation  under  which  all 
the  members  of  γ  are  true.  φ  is  a  tautological  consequence  of  a  set of 
sentences  γ  iﬀ  φ  is  assigned  the  value  1  by  every  N.T.A.  which  assigns 
the  value  1  to  every  member  of  γ . 

The  same  reasoning  which  gave  us  the  last  proposition  yields  the 
following: 

Proposition 4.17.  Every  tautological  consequence  of  a  set  of  sentences 
is  a  logical  consequence,  but  not  vice  versa. 

The  following  deﬁnitions  and  theorems  are  lifted  directly  from  the 
sentential  calculus:  

Deﬁnition  4.18.  A  sentence  is  contradictory  (or inconsisent) iﬀ  it  is 
false  under  every  interpretation.  A  sentence  is  indeterminate  iﬀ  it  is 
true  under  some  interpretations  and  false  under  others.  A  sentence  φ 
implies  (or entails) sentence  ψ  iﬀ  ψ  is  true  under  every  interpretation 
under  which  φ  is  true.  φ  and  ψ  are  logical ly  equivalent  iﬀ  they  are  true 
under  precisely  the  same  interpretations.  An  argument  is  valid  iﬀ  the 
conclusion  is  true  under  every  interpretation  under  which  the premises 
are true.  A  set  of  sentences is  consistent  iﬀ there is  some interpretation 
under  which  all  its  members  are  true. 

Theorem  4.19.  A  sentence  is  a  valid  iﬀ  its  negation  is  contradictory. 

Theorem  4.20.  A  sentence  is  contradictory  iﬀ  its  negation  is  valid. 

Theorem  4.21.  A  sentence  is  indeterminate  iﬀ  its  negation  is  inde­
terminate. 

Theorem  4.22.  A  conjuction  is  valid  iﬀ  both  its  conjuncts  are  valid. 

Theorem 4.23.  If a  conjunction is  contradictory if (but  not  necessarily 
only  if )  either  of  its  conjuncts  is. 

Theorem  4.24.  A  disjunction  is  valid  if(but  not  only  if )  either  dis­
junct  is  valid. 

Theorem  4.25.  A  disjunction  is  contradictory  iﬀ  both  disjuncts  are 
contradictory.

Theorem  4.35.  An  argument  is  valid  iﬀ  the  conditional  whose  an­
tecedent is the  conjunction  of  the premises  and  whose  consequent is the 
conclusion  is  valid. 

Theorem  4.36.  φ  is  a  logical  consequence  of  {γ1 ,  γ1 ,  . . . ,γn}  if  and 
only  if  the  argument  with  γ1 ,  γ2 ,  . . . ,γn  as  premises  and  with  φ  as 
condition  is  valid. 

Theorem  4.37.  A  sentence  is  a  logical  consequence  of  the  empty  set 
iﬀ  it  is  valid. 

Theorem  4.38.  A  sentence  is  valid  iﬀ  it  is  a  logical  consequence  of 
that  set  of  sentences. 

Theorem  4.39.  Each  member  of  a  set  of  sentences  is  a  logical  conse­
quence  of  that  set  of  sentences. 

Theorem  4.40.  If  every  member  of  Δ  is  a  logical  consequence  of  Γ 
and  φ  is  a  logical  consequence  of  Δ,  then  φ  is  a  logical  consequence  of 
Γ. 

Theorem  4.41.  If  Δ  is  a  subset  of  Γ  and  φ  is  a  logical  consequence 
of  Δ,  then  φ  is  a  logical  consequence  of  Γ. 

Theorem  4.42.  For  any  sentence  ψ  and  set  of  sentences  Γ,  ψ  is  a

same  logical  consequences.

Theorem  4.51  (Substitution Principle).  For  any  interpretation  A,  in­
c  is  true  under  A  iﬀ  A(c) satisﬁes 
dividual  constant  c,  and formula  φ,  φ x
φ  under  A. 

Proof.  I  am  going  to  write  out  this  proof  in  excruciating  detail,  just 
so you will  see what one of  these proofs looks like when written out in 
utter  detail.  I  promise  not  to  do  it  again. 
Let  A  be  an  interpretration  and  c  a  constant,  and  let  Σ  be  the  set 
of  formulas  φ  such  that  φ x
c  is  true  under  A  iﬀ  A(c)  satisﬁes  φ  un­
der  A.  Clearly,  {formulas} ⊆  Σ.  But  also,  since  {formulas}  is  the 
smallest   class   of  expressions  which  contains  the  atomic  formulas  and 
which  is  closed  under  conjunction,  disjunction,  formation  of  condition­
als,   formation  of biconditionals,  negation,  universal quantiﬁcation,  and 
existential quantiﬁcation, if  we can  show that Σ is a class of  expressions 
which  contains  the  atomic formulas  and  which is  closed  under  conjunc­
tion,  disjunction,  formation  of  conditionals,  formation  of  bicondition­
als,   negation,  universal  quantiﬁcation  and  existential  quantiﬁcation, 
this  will  tell  us  that  {formulas} ⊆  Σ.  This  will  tell  us  that  {formulas} 
= Σ,  which  is  what  we  want. 

Lemma  4.52  (Atomic  formlas  are  in  Σ).  If  φ  is  an  atomic  formula, 
then  either  it  has  the  form  F x  or  it  has  the  form  F d.  If  φ  has  the  form 
F x,  then  φ x  is  F c.  We  have

So  (φ ∧ ψ) is  in  Σ.

If  our language has just three predicates,  “F ,”  “G,”  and  “H ,”  then 
any  interpretation  of  the  language  divides  the  universe  into  8  cells, 
numbered 1 through 8 in the ﬁgure (where  some of the cells may be 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS

empty).  If  two members of  the universe lie in the  same cell, they  satisfy 
all  the  same  formulas.   This  observation  is  perfectly  general: 

Theorem  4.60  (Indiscernibility  Principle).  Given  an  interpretation 
A,  let  us  say  that  two  elements  of  |A|  are  in  the  same  cel l  if  they  are 
in  the  extensions  in  A  of  al l  the  same  predicates.  Any  two  members  of 
|A| that  are  in  the  same  cel l  satisfy  al l  the  same  formulas  under  A. 

Proof.  Suppose  that  a  and  b  are  in  the  same  cell.  Let  Σ  be  the  set  of 
formulas  φ  such  that  a  satisﬁes  φ under  A  iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  φ under  A.  We 
want  to  see  that  Σ  is  equal  to  the  set  of  all  formulas.  To  show  this,  we 
need  to  show  that  Σ  contains  the  atomic  formulas  and  that  it  is  closed 
under  conjunction,  disjunction,  formation  of  conditionals,  bicondition­
als,   negation,  universal  quantiﬁcation,  and  existential  quantiﬁcation. 

Lemma  4.61  (Atomic  formulas  of  the  form P x  are  in  Σ).  Because  a 
and  b  are  in  the  same  cel l,  we  know  that  a ∈  A(P ) iﬀ  b ∈  A(P ).  Thus 
a  satisﬁes  P x  under  A  iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  P x  under  A. 

Lemma  4.62  (Atomic  sentences—formulas of the form  P c—are in Σ). 
If  P c  is  true,  a  and  b  both  satisfy  it.  It  it  is  false,  neither  does. 

Lemma  4.63  (Σ  is  closed under  conjunction).  Suppose  that  φ  and  ψ 
are  both  in  S igma.  We  have 
a  satisﬁes  (φ ∧ ψ) under  A 
iﬀ  a  satisﬁes  both  φ  and  ψ  under  A 
iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  both  φ and  ψ  under  A  [because φ and  ψ  are 
both  in  Σ] 
iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  (φ ∧ ψ) in  Σ. 
So  (φ ∧ ψ) is  in  Σ. 

Lemma  4.64  (Σ  is  closed under  disjunction,  formation  of  conditional, 
and  formation  of  biconditionals.).  Similar. 

Lemma  4.65  (Σ  is  closed  under  universal  quantiﬁcation.).  Suppose 
that  φ  is  in  Σ.  We  have 
a  satisﬁes  (∀x)φ  under  A 
iﬀ  (∀x)φ  is  true  under  A  [by the  corol lary  to  bivalence, 
(Corol lary  4.12,  page  24)] 
iﬀ  b satisﬁes  (∀x)φ under  A [by the  corol lary  to bivalence 
again]. 
So  (∀x)φ  in  in  Σ. 

Lemma  4.66  (Σ  is  closed  under  existential  quantiﬁcation).  Similar.

To  see whether a  sentence is true under an interpretation, you have to 
see what the universe of  the interpretation is, and you have to  see what 
values  the  interpretation  assigns  to  the  constants  and  predicates  that 
appear within that  sentence.  That’s all you have to look  at.  You don’t 
have  to  look  at  the  values  the  interpretation  assigns  to  the  constants 
and predicates that don’t  even occur within the  sentence.  The following 
theorem  makes  this  observation  precise: 

Theorem  4.67  (Locality  Principle).  Let  A  and  B  be  two  interpreta­
tions  with  the  same  universe  of  discourse  that  assign  the  same  values 
to  al l  the  constants  and  predicates  that  occur  in  the  formula  φ.  Then 
precisely  the  same  individuals  satisfy  φ  under  A  and  under  B. 

Proof.  Given  interpretations  A  and  B  with  the  same  universe  of  dis­
course,  let  Σ  =  {formulas  φ:  if  A  and  B  assign  the  same  values  to  all 
the  constants  and predicates  that  occur in  φ, then the  same individuals 
satisfy  φ under  A  and  under  B}.  We  want  to  show  that  Σ  is  the  set  of 
all  formulas.   To  show  this,  it  will  be  enough  to  show  that  Σ  contains 
the  atomic  formulas  and  that  it  is  closed  under  conjunction,  disjunc­
tion,  formation  of  conditionals,  formation  of  biconditionals,  negation, 
universal  quantiﬁcation,  and  existential  quantiﬁcation. 

Lemma  4.68  (Σ  contains  the  atomic  formulas).  Let  φ  be  an  atomic 
formula  such that  any  constant  or predicate  that  appears in  φ is  assigned 
the  same  value  by  A  and  by  B.  Take  a  ∈ |A|.  Either  φ  has  the  form 
F x  or  else  it  has  the  form  F c. 
If  φ  has  the  form  F x,  we  have 
a  satisﬁes  φ  under  A 
iﬀ  a ∈  A(F ) 
iﬀ  a ∈  B(F ) 
iﬀ  a  satisﬁes  φ  under  B. 
If  φ  has  the  form  F c,  we  have 
a  satisﬁes  φ  under  A 
iﬀ  A(c) ∈  A(F ) 
iﬀ  B(c) ∈  B(F ) 
iﬀ  a  satisﬁes  φ  under  B. 

Lemma  4.69  (Σ  is  closed under  conjunction).  Suppose  that  φ  and  ψ 
are  both  in  Σ,  and  take  a ∈ |A|. Suppose that  any  constant  or predicate 
that  occurs  in  (φ ∧  ψ)  is  assigned  the  same  value  by  A  and  B.  Then 
every  constant  or  predicate  that  occurs  in  φ  is  assigned  the  same  value 
by  A  and  by  B,  so  that,  since  φ  is  in  Σ,  a  satisﬁes  φ  under  A  iﬀ  a 
satisﬁes  φ  under  B.  Similarly  for  ψ .  Hence

The  Indiscernibility  Principle  talks  about  members  of  the  domain 
of  a  single  interpretation.  There  is  a  generalization  of  it  that  applies 
across   intepretations:  

Theorem  4.71  (Generalized  Indiscernibility Principle).  Let  A  and  B 
be  interpretations  of  a  MPC  language  L .  Suppose  that  precisely  the 
same  cel ls  are  nonempty  in  A  and  in  B.  That  is,  for  each  element  a 
of  |A|,  there  is  an  element  of  b  of  |B|  such  that,  for  any  predicate  P 
of  L ,  a ∈  A(P ) iﬀ  b ∈  B(P ),  and  likewise,  for  each  element  b  of  |B|, 
there  is  an  element  a  of  |A|  such  that  a  and  b  are  in  the  extensions 
of  the  same  predicates  in  their  respective  models.  Suppose  further  that, 
for  each  constant  c  of  L ,  A(c) is  in  the  same  cel l  in  A  that  B(c) is  in 
B.  Then  the  same  sentences  are  true  in  A  and  in  B 
Proof.  We  prove  something  stronger,  namely,  that  if  a  occupies  the 
same  cell in  A that  b occupies in  B, then  a satisﬁes all the  same formulas 
in  A  that  b  satisﬁes  in  B.  To  show  this,  let  Σ  be  the  set  of  formulas 
φ  such  that,  whenever  an  element  a  of  |A|  occupies  the  same  cell  in 
A  that  b  ∈ |B|  occupies  in  B,  a  satisﬁes  φ  in  A  iﬀ  it  satisﬁes  φ  in 
B.  We  intend  to  show  that  every  formula  is  in  Σ,  by  showing  that  Σ 
contains the atomic  sentences and is closed  under the  seven procedures 
for  building  larger  formulas  out  of  smaller  ones. 

Lemma  4.72  (Atomic  formulas  of  the  form  Px  are  in  Σ).  What  it 
means  to  say  that  a  occupies  the  same  cel l  in  A  that  b  occupies  in  B 
is  that,  for  each  predicate  P,  a ∈  A(P )  iﬀ  b ∈  B(P ).  Consequently,  a 
satisﬁes  P x  under  A  iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  P x  under  B. 

Lemma  4.73  (Atomic  formulas  of  the  form  Pc  are  in  Σ).  By  hy­
pothesis,  A(C )  occupies  the  same  cel l  in  A  that  B(C )  occupies  in  B 
Consequently,  we  have: 
a  satisﬁes  P c  in  A

iﬀ  P c  is  true  in  A

iﬀ  A(c) ∈  A(P )

iﬀ  B(c) ∈  B(P )

iﬀ  P c  is  true  in  B

iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  P c  in  B(P ) 

Lemma  4.74  (Σ  is  closed  under  conjunction).  Suppose  that  ψ  and 
θ  are  in  Σ  and  that  a  and  b  occupy  the  same  cel ls  in  their  respective 
interpretations.  We  have: 

a  satisﬁes  (ψ ∧ θ) in  A 
iﬀ  a  satisﬁes  both  ψ  and  θ  in  A 
iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  both  ψ  and  θ  in  B  [because ψ  and  θ  are  in 
Σ] 
iﬀ  b  satisﬁes  (ψ ∧ θ) in  B 

Lemma  4.75  (Σ  is  closed  under  disjunction,  conditionals,  bicondi­
tional,  and  negations).  Similar. 

Lemma  4.76  (Σ  is  closed  under  existential  quantiﬁcation).  Suppose 
that  ψ  is in  Σ,  and  that  a and  b occupy  the  same  cel ls in  their  respective 
models.  Suppose  that  a  satisﬁes  (∃x)ψ  in  A.  Then  (∃x)ψ  is  true  in  A, 
which  means  that  there  is  an  element  c  of  |A| that  satisﬁes  ψ  in  A.  By 
hypothesis,  there  is  an  element  d  of  |B| that  occupies  the  same  cel l  in 
B  that  c  occupies  in  A.  Because  ψ  is  in  Σ,  it  fol lows  that  d  satisﬁes 
ψ  in  B.  Consequently,  (∃x)ψ  is  true  in  B,  and  so  b  satisﬁes  (∃x)ψ  in 
B.  The  converse  - if  b  satisﬁes  (∃x)ψ  in  B,  a  satisﬁes  (∃x)ψ  in  A  ­
is  similar. 

Lemma  4.77  (Σ  is  closed under  universal  quantiﬁcation).

If  our  language  has  n  predicates,  then  an  interpretation  A  of  the 
language partitions the  universe  of A into 2n  cells,  which  we  can  number 
1 through 2n .  (Some  of the  cells  may be  empty.)  Form  an interpretation 
B  as  follows:  
|B|  =  {numbers  k :  under  A,  the  kth  cell  is  empty}. 
B(F ) =  {numbers  k :  the  kth  cell  is  a  nonempty  part  of  A(F )}, 
for  F  a  predicate. 
the  number  k  such  that  A(c) is  in  the  kth  cell,  for  c  an 
individual  constant. 

B(c)  = 

It  follows  from  the  Generalized  Indiscernibility  Principle  that  the 
same  sentences  are  true  in  A  and  in  B.  Let  us  call  B  the  canonical 
model  associated  with  A. 
As   an  example,  let  L  be  the  language  whose  predicates  are  “M”, 
“W”,  and  “F”  and  whose  only  individual  constant  is  “t”’,  and  let  A be 
the  interpretation  of  L  given  by:

|A|  =  {animals} 
A  =  {mammals} 
A  =  {warm-blooded  animals} 
A  =  {animals  that  ﬂy} 
A  =  Termin  the  dog 

We  assign  numbers  to  the  cells  by  specifying,  for  each  number  be­
tween 1  and 8,  the  combination  of  atomic  and  negated  atomic formulas 
of  the  form  P x  that  are  satisﬁed  by  the  occupants  of  that  cell.  Thus 

Occupants  of  cell  1  satisfy  “(M x ∧ (W x ∧ F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  2  satisfy  “(M x ∧ (W x ∧ ¬F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  3  satisfy  “(M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  4  satisfy  “(M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ ¬F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  5  satisfy  “(¬M x ∧ (W x ∧ F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  6  satisfy  “(¬M x ∧ (W x ∧ ¬F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  7  satisfy  “(¬M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ F x)).” 
Occupants  of  cell  8  satisfy  “(¬M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ ¬F x)).” 

There  are  animals  that  occupy  each  of  the  cells  other  than  3  and  4. 
Bats,   for  example,  occupy  cell  1,  dogs  cell  2,  canaries  cell  5,  penguins 
cell  6,  butterﬂies  cell  7,  and  banana  slugs  cell  8.  Tarmin  is  in  cell  2. 
Our  canonical  model  B  associated  with  A  looks  like  this: 

|B|  =  {1,2,5,6,7,8}

B(“M �� ) =  {1,2}

B(“W �� ) =  {1,2,5,6}

B(“F �� ) =  {1,5,7}

B(“t�� )  =  2


Theorem  4.78.  Given a language with  ﬁnitely  many predicates, a sen­
tence  is  valid  iﬀ  it  is  true  in  al l  the  canonical  models  for  that  language. 
A  sentence  is  a  logical  consequence  of  a  set  of  sentences  Γ  iﬀ  the  sen­
tence  is  true  in  every  canonical  model  in  which  each  member  of  Γ  is 
true. 

A  sentence  containing  n  predicates  is  valid  iﬀ  it  is  true  under  every 
interpretation  whose  universe  is  contained  in  the  set  {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n}. 
How  many  canonical  models  are  there?  Given  a  language  L  with  n 
predicates  and k  constants,  the domain  of  a  canonical  model  which  will 
be  a  nonempty  subset  of  {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n} there  are  22n 
such  nonempty 
subsets.   If  the  model  has  i  nonempty  cells,  there  will  be  ik  ways  to 
apportion  k  constants  into  nonempty  cells.  Consequently,  the  total 
number  of  canonical  models  for  L  will  be:

to  choose  i elements from  a 2n  element  set.  Thus there are a great many 
canonical  models.   Even  so,  there  are  only  ﬁnitely  many,  and  each  of 
them  is  a  ﬁnite  structure,  so  we  could,  in  principle,  test  a  sentence  for 
validity by  examining  all  the canonical  models to  see if  we can ﬁnd  one 
in  which  the  given  sentence  is  false.  This  gives  us  the  following: 

Corollary  4.79.  There is  an  algorithm—that is,  a  mechanical procedure— 
for  testing  whether  a  sentence  is  valid. 

The  algorithm just desribed is  not  at  all practical, for the  canonical 
interpretations  are  far  too  numerous  for  it  to  be  feasible  to  examine 
them all.  The theoretical possibility  of  testing  a  sentence  φ  for  validity 
by  examining  all  the  models  of  φ  whose  universe  is  contained  within 
{1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n} remains  only  that,  a  theoretical  possibility. 
In  the  next  chapter,  we  are  going  to  learn  a  more  practical  method 
for  showing  valid  sentences  valid. 
If  our language has  n predicates  and k  constants,  we  can  write down, 
for  each  interpretation  of  the  language,  a  canonical  description  that 
completely  describes  the  model.  The  canonical  description  is  a  long 
conjunction  with two kinds  of  conjuncts.  First,  there  are  conjuncts that 
tell  us, for  each individual  constant,  which  cell  the individual  named by 
the constant  occupies.   For our model above that had  as its  sole constant 
“t”  denoting  Tarmin,  the  conjunct  would  be  “(M t ∧  (W t ∧ ¬F t)).” 
Second,  for  each  of  the  cells  not  occupied  saying  whether  the  cell  is 
empty.  Thus  for  cell  1,  the  conjunct  is  “(∃x)(M x  ∧  (W x  ∧  F x)),” 
whereas  for  cell  3  the  conjunct  is  “¬(∃x)(M x ∧  (¬W x ∧  F x)).”  The 
canonical  description  of  the  model  is  the  following  long  sentence: 
(M t ∧ (W t ∧ ¬F t) ∧ ((∃x)(M x ∧ (W x ∧ F x)) 
∧(¬(∃x)(M x ∧  (¬W x ∧  F x)) ∧  (¬(∃x)(M x ∧  (¬F x ∧ 
¬W x)) 
∧((∃x)(¬M x ∧ (W x ∧ F x)) ∧ ((∃x)(¬M x ∧ (W x ∧ ¬F x)) 
∧((∃x)(¬M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ F x)) 
∧(∃x)(¬M x ∧ (¬W x ∧ ¬F x))))))))). 
We  know  from  the  Generalized  Indiscernibility  Principle  that  deter­
mining  which  cells  the  individuals  named  by  the  constants  are  in  and 
which  of  the  remaining  cells  are  nonempty  is  enough  to  decide  which 
sentences  are  true.  It  follows,  for  every  sentence,  a  canonical  descrip­
tion  entails  either  the  sentence  or  its  negation.  What  we  say  is  that 

MONADIC  PREDICATE  CALCULUS

the  canonical  descriptions  are  complete.  Every  complete,  consistent 
sentence  is  logically  equivalent  to  a  canonical  description. 
For  a  given  sentence  φ  (still  talking about  a  language  with  n  predi­
cates  and  k  constants),  the  normal  form  of  φ  is  the  disjunction  of  all 
the  canonical  descriptions  of  models  in  which  φ  is  true.  For  any  model 
A of  φ,  the  canonical description  of  A will be  one  of  the disjuncts  of  the 
normal  form  of  φ,  and  so  the  normal  form  of  φ will  be  true  in  A.  Con­
sequently,  φ  entails  its  normal  form.  Moreover,  each  of  the  disjuncts 
of  the  normal  form  of  φ  entails  φ,  and  so  their  disjunction  entails  φ.  It 
follows  that  a  sentence  is  logically  equivalent  to  its  normal  form.  (If φ 
happens  to  be  a  contradiction,  there  will  not  be  any  disjuncts.  In  this 
case,  we  can  choose,  say  “(∃x)(M x ∧ ¬M x)” to  be  the  normal  form  of 
φ. 

Every  sentence  is  logically  equivalent  to  its  normal  form,  and  no  two 
normal  forms  are  logically  equivalent,  since  they  are  true  in  diﬀerent 
models.   If there  are m canonical  models,  there  will be 2m  normal forms, 
one  for  every  subset  of  the  m  models.  It  follows  that  it  is  possible  to 
give  a  list   of  2m  sentences  such  that  no  two  sentences  on  the  list  are 
logically  equivalent  and  such  that  every  sentence  of  the  language  is 
logically  equivalent  to  a  sentence  on  the  list.
