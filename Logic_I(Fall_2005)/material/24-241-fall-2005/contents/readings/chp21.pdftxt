Russell’s Theory of Definite Descriptions 

 

“The person who wrote Waverley wrote Ivanhoe” logically implies “There is someone 
who wrote both Waverley and Ivanhoe.” Bertrand Russell1 figured out a clever way to formalize 
the inference, using machinery we already have on hand. Up until now, we’d have to symbolize 
“the person who wrote Waverley” by an individual constant, so that our inference would take the 
form: 
 

Ia 
 ( ∃ x)(Wx ∧

 Ix) 

 
which is obviously invalid. (Let us restrict our universe of discourse to human beings, so we 
don’t have to symbolize “person.”)  Russell introduced a new symbolism for expressions 
consisting of “the” + a singular common noun. He symbolized “the person who wrote Waverley” 
as “(ιx)Wx,” and he symbolized “The person who wrote Waverley wrote Ivanhoe” as “I(ιx)Wx.” 
 

According to Russell, “The person who wrote Waverley wrote Ivanhoe” is logically 
equivalent to the conjunction of these three statements: 
 

At least one person wrote Waverley. 
At most one person wrote Waverley. 
Anyone who wrote Waverley wrote Ivanhoe. 

At least one person wrote Waverley. 
At most one person wrote Waverley.

Equivalently, and more simply, 
 

( ∃ x)((∀ y)(Wy ↔

 y=x)  ∧

 Ix). 

(((∃ x)Wx ∧

 ¬( ∃ x)( ∃ y)(¬x=y ∧

 (Wx ∧

 Wy)))  ∧

 ( ∀ x)(Wx →

 Ix)). 

 
Russell proposed to use this last sentence to symbolize “The person who wrote Waverley wrote 
Ivanhoe.” 
 
In general, a sentence of the form “The F is a G” is symbolized “G(ιx)Fx,” which is 
regarded as an abbreviation of “( ∃ x)((∀ y)(Fx ↔
 y=x)  ∧
 Gx).” 
 

“The person who wrote Waverley exists” is, according to Russell, equivalent to the 
conjunction of two sentences: 
 

∴

In symbols, 
 

( ∃ x)Wx 
¬( ∃ x)( ∃ y)(¬x=y ∧

 (Wx ∧

 Wy)) 

 
which can be written more simply thus: 
 

( ∃ x)( ∀ y)(Wy ↔

 y=x). 

 
In general, Russell proposed to symbolize sentences of the form “The F exists” as “E!(ιx)Fx,” 
which he treated as an abbreviation for “( ∃ x)( ∀ y)(Fy ↔
 y=x).” 
 

“The present king of France is bald” — in symbols, “B(ιx)Kx” — is false, says Russell, 
because it entails “The present king of France exists” — “E!(ιx)Kx” — and there is, at present, 
no king of France. We can prove this by doing a derivation:

We symbolize

The author of Waverley is a poet. 
Therefore, Scott is a poet.

There is an annoying ambiguity in the story we have told so far. Consider the sentence 
“The present king of France is not bald.” There are two ways we might symbolize the sentence. 
We might read it as the negation of the sentence obtained by substituting “the present King of 
France” for “x” in the open sentence “x is bald.” Alternatively, we might understand it as the 
result of substituting “the present king of France” for “x” in the open sentence “x is not bald.” 
 y=x)  ∧
The first choice gives us “¬(∃ x)((∀ y)(Ky ↔
 Bx),” which is true, whereas the second 
gives us the false sentence, “(∃ x)((∀ y)(Ky ↔
 y=x)  ∧
 ¬Bx).”  
 

Russell developed an unambiguous notation that made room for both readings. While 
admirably precise, it was rather cumbersome. The simplest policy would simply be always to 
cash out a definite description by applying  Russell’s method to the atomic open sentence that 
contains the description. This policy will make out “The present king of France is not bald” to be 
true, which I would regard as intuitively correct. Under this policy, “The present king of France 
is either bald or not bald” comes out as a tautology, “(( ∃ x)((∀ y)(Ky ↔
 y=x)  ∧
 Bx) ∨
 

Russell’s Theory of Descriptions, p. 5 
 
¬( ∃ x)((∀ y)(Ky ↔
 

 y=x)).” 

There’s still an ambiguity. What do we do with an atomic sentence that contain several 
definite descriptions? And how do we cash out a definite description that contains another 
definite description inside it? These are small problems that we don’t need to address here.
