We are tempted to symbolize "At least two dogs have fleas" the same way: 
 
(2) 
 
but that would be a mistake, since (2) is logically equivalent to (1), because we haven't said 
that "x" and "y" refer to different dogs. To say "At least two dogs have fleas," we need the 
identity sign "=":

A language for the predicate calculus with identity is a language for the predicate 
calculus, as we defined it before, that satisfies the further stipulation that, among the 
predicates of the language is the binary “=.” An interpretation A of such a language is 
required to satisfy the condition: 
 

A(“=”) = {<a,a>: a ∈

  A }. 

Identity 
 
Quantifiers are so-called because they say how many. So far, we've only used the 
quantifiers to give the crudest possible answers to the question "How many dogs have 
fleas?": "All," "None," "Some," "Not all," "Some but not all." Now we are going to see 
how to use the quantifiers to express more detailed numerical information. 
 

"At least one dog has fleas" is translated by an existential quantifier" 

 
To strictly obey the definition of "formula," we should write the predicate "=" at the 
beginning, writing "=xy" rather than "x=y"; but doing so makes the formulas harder to 
read. 
 

 

With “=” in our language, we can answer “How many?” questions much more 
precisely. "At most one dog has fleas" is the denial of (3): 
 
(4) 
 

¬(∃ x)( ∃ y)(¬x=y ∧

 ((Dx  ∧

 (Dy ∧

 Fx) ∧

To say "Exactly one dog has fleas" is to say that at least one dog has fleas and at 
most one dog has fleas," so we can symbolize it as the conjunction of (1) and (4): 
 
(5) 
 
or we can symbolize it more directly, as follows: 
 
(6) 

 ¬( ∃ x)( ∃ y)(¬x=y ∧

(∃ x)( ∀ y)((Dy ∧

((∃ x)(Dx ∧

 Fy)))) 

 ((Dx  ∧

 (Dy ∧

(7) 

For larger numbers, we go on the same way. "At least three dogs have fleas" is this: 

 

(∃ x)( ∃ y)( ∃ z)((¬x=y  ∧
 (Dz  ∧
 Fz)))) 

 (¬x=z ∧

 ¬y=z)) ∧

 ((Dx  ∧

"At most two dogs have fleas" is the denial of (7), namely: 
 
(8) 

 ¬y=z)) ∧

 (¬x=z ∧

 ((Dx  ∧

 

¬(∃ x)( ∃ y)( ∃ z)((¬x=y ∧
 (Dz  ∧
 Fz)))) 

 Fx) ∧

 ((Dy  ∧

"Exactly two dogs have fleas" can be written as the conjunction of (3) and (8), thus:

  ¬y=z))  

((∃ x)( ∃ y)((Dx ∧

 ((Dy  ∧

 (Dy ∧

 (Dz  ∧

 ¬( ∃ x)( ∃ y)( ∃ z)((¬x=y  ∧

or we can write it more simply: 
 
(10) 
 

( ∃ x)( ∃ y)(¬x=y ∧

 

"At least four dogs have fleas" is this: 

 ( ∀ z)((Dz ∧

 Fz) ↔

 (z=x ∨

 z=y)))

 (¬x=z ∧

 ((Dz ∧

 (¬y=z ∧
 (¬x=w ∧
 (¬y=w ∧
 (Dw  ∧

 Fw))))) 

 ¬z=w))))) 

 
(How we group the various conjuncts is arbitrary.) "At most three dogs have fleas" is the 
denial of ((11), namely: 
 
(12) 

¬( ∃ x)( ∃ y)( ∃ z)( ∃ w)((¬x=y ∧
 (¬x=z ∧
 (¬x=w ∧

 Fx) ∧
 ((Dx  ∧
¬z=w))))) ∧

 (¬y=z ∧
 (¬y=w ∧

"Exactly three dogs have fleas" can be written as the conjunction of (7) and (12): 
 
(13) 

 ((Dy  ∧

 ((Dx  ∧

 ((Dy  ∧

or more concisely: 
 
(14) 

 

 

( ∃ x)( ∃ y)( ∃ z)((¬x=y  ∧
 (¬x=z ∧
(w=x ∨
 (w=y ∨

And so it goes for larger numbers. The same techniques will permit us to write "at 
least thirty" or "at most  sixty-four" or "exactly five thousand two hundred eighty."

Identity, p. 3 
 
 

If we let Γ be the infinite set consisting of sentence (1) (“At least one dog has fleas”), 
sentence (3) (“At least two dogs have fleas”), sentence (7) (“At least three dogs have fleas”), 
sentence (11) (“At least four dogs have fleas”), and so on. Then for all the members of Γ to be 
true, there would have to be infinitely many dogs with fleas. So there is an infinite set of 
sentences that are jointly true in all and only the models in which there are infinitely many 
individuals that satisfy “(Dx  ∧
 Fx).” 
 

By contrast, there is no set of sentences that are jointly true in all and only the models in 
which only finitely many individuals satisfy “(Dx ∧
 Fx).” For suppose there were such a set ∆. 
Then Γ ∪ ∆ would be inconsistent. By the Compactness Theorem, there is a finite subset Γf of Γ 
and a finite subset ∆f of ∆ such that Γf ∪
 ∆f is inconsistent. There is a largest number n such that 
the sentence that formalizes “At least n dogs have fleas” occurs in Γf. Let A be a model in which 
 satisfy “(Dx  ∧
exactly n individuals satisfy “(Dx  ∧
 Fx).” Since at least n members of   A
 
Fx),” all the members of Γf are true in A. Since only finitely many members of   A
 satisfy 
“(Dx  ∧
 Fx),” all the members of ∆ are true in A, hence all the members of ∆f are true in A. 
So Γf ∪
 ∆f is consistent. Contradiction. 
 

There is no single sentence true in all and only the models in which infinitely many 
individuals satisfy “(Dx  ∧
 Fx).” If γ were such a sentence {¬γ} would be a set of sentences 
true in all and only the models in which only finitely many individuals satisfy “(Dx  ∧
 Fx).” 
 

Our insistence that, within every interpretation, “=” stands for the identity relation 
on the domain of the interpretation validates some additional rules of inference, namely: 
 
IR 

(Identity is reflexive.) You may write any sentence of the form c=c, with the empty 
set of 
premisses. 

 
SI 

 

(Substitution of identicals) If you’ve written either c=d or d=c with premiss set Γ 
and  
you’ve written φv/c with premiss set ∆, you may write φv/d with premiss set Γ ∪ ∆. 

To see that SI preserves logical consequence, suppose that A is an interpretation 
under which φv/c is true and under which either c=d or d=c is true. Let σ be a variable 
assignment for A with σ(v) = A(c) = A(d). Then, by the Substitution Principle, φv/c is true 
under A iff σ satisfies φ under A iff φv/c is true under A. 
 

A relation R is said to be reflexive just in case it satisfies the condition ( ∀ x)Rxx. As 
our first example of a derivation, we show that identity is reflexive: 
 

1 c=c 
 
2 ( ∀ x)x=x

A relation R is symmetric iff it satisfies ( ∀ x)( ∀ y)(Rxy →
symmetric: 
 

 Rxy).  We show identity is 

 
 
1 c=c 
 
 
 
2 c=d   
 
 
3 d=c   
4 c=d  →
 
 d=c

In applying rule SI at line 3, we are taking our formula φ to be “y=c.” Line 1 is φy/c, and 
line 3 is φy/d. 
 

We now show that identity is transitive, that is, that it satisfies the condition
