MPC Completeness 

There is no requirement that, within a given interpretation, every individual in the 
domain be named by some individual constant, and consequently there is no assurance that a 
universal sentence (b'x)cp  will be true under an interpretation under which all its substitution 
instances (sentences got from cp  by substituting individual constants for free occurrences of "x") 
are true. Thus we might have interpretation whose domain consists of all human beings, in which 
the extension of "G" is the set of Greeks and in which all the individual constants happen to 
denote ancient Greek philosophers. Under such an interpretation, all the substitution instances 
for "@'x)Gx"  are true, but "@ir)Gx"  isn't true. 

If it just  so happens that every element of IUI is named by some individual constant in U 
-in such cases, U is said to b e h l l y  named -this it will be the case that a universal sentence is 
true in U iff all its substitution instances are true in U, because we have: 

@'x)cp is true under U 
iff every element of IUI satisfies cp  under U 
iff (because every element of IUI is named by some individual constant), for each 
individual constant c, the element of IUI named by c in U satisfies cp  if U 
iff (by the Substitution Principle) for each individual constant c, cpX/, is true in U. 

Similarly, an existential sentence is true in U iff at least one of its substitution instances is true in 
U. This means that, so long as we are dealing with fully named interpretations, we can give the 
truth conditions for complex sentences directly in terms of the truth conditions of simpler 
sentences, without bringing satisfaction into the picture, thus substantially simplifying the 
semantic theory. If U is fully named, we have: 

An atomic sentence of the form PC is true under U iff U(c)  E  U(P). 

A disjunction is true under U iff one or both disjuncts are true under U. 

A conjunction is true under U iff both conjuncts are true under U. 

A conditional is true under U iff its consequent is true under U or its 

antecedent is not. 

A biconditional is true under U iff both its components are true under U or 

neither is. 

A negation is true under U iff its negation is not. 

An existential sentence is true under U iff at least one of its substitution 

instances is true under U. 

A universal sentence is true under U iff all its substitution instances are 

true under U. 

Definition. A complete story with witnesses is a set of sentences n that 

meets the following seven conditions: 

A disjunction is in 
iff one or both disjuncts are. 

A conjunction is in n iff both conjuncts are. 

A conditional is in n iff its consequent is in n or its antecedent is not.

iff both it components are in n or neither is. 

A biconditional is in 
A negation is in n iff its negatum is not. 

An  existential sentence is in n iff at least on of its substitution instances 

is. 

iff all its substitution instances are. 

A universal sentence is in 

The set of sentences true under a fully named interpretation form a complete story with 
instances. 

Complete stories with witnesses are important because of the converse result, 
which was first noticed by Leon Henkin.' Given a complete story with witnesses n in a 
language with at least one individual constant:  we can construct a fully named 
interpretation under which all and only the members of 
are true. The construction is 
not trivial, like the transition from a complete SC story to a NTA. This is because 
interpretations have a more complex structure than NTAs. 

Given a complete story with witnesses n ,  we want to define an interpretation U under 
which all and only the elements of n are true. We begin by listing the individual constants in 
the language in a (finite or infinite) list c,,  el, c,,  c3, ..., and we stipulate that U(ci) = i, and that 
IUI  is to be the set of natural numbers less that n (if the language has n constants) or else the set 
of natural numbers (if the language has infinitely many  constant^).^ Now let U p )  = {i: p c i  E

This because, when we were defining "interpretation,"  we chose, more-or-less arbitrarily, to 
exclude interpretations with the empty domain. Making the opposite choice wouldn't have made 
a whole lot of difference. See W. V.  Quine, "Quantification and the Empty Domain," Journal  of

I am taking for granted that, if the individual constants, if there are infinitely many of them, can 
be paired off with the natural numbers like this: c,,  e l ,  c,,  c3 ,  .... Later on, I'll assume the same 
thing holds true of the predicates. These two assumptions together will assure us that the 
sentences of the language can be arrayed in an infinite list E,,  El, E,,  E3, .... These assumptions is 
certainly satisfied by any language that people actually use, but there appear in pure mathematics 
centain purely abstract formal languages whose symbols can't be arrayed in such a list. The 
result that, for any complete story with witnesses, there is an interpretation under which all its 
members are true, and the completeness theorem in whose proof we apply the result, continue to 
hold in these abstract languages, but the proof has an extra twist.

n } ,  for each predicate P. Thus pCi is true in 2l  iff U(CJ  E U p )  iff i E U p )  iff PC,  E n, so that 
an atomic sentence is true in 2l  iff it's an element of n. An  easy induction extends this 
observation to all the sentences. 

We want to prove the Completeness Theorem, that is, we want to prove that,  if an MPC 
sentence x is a logical consequence of a set I? of MPC sentences, then there is a derivation of x 
whose premiss set is included in I?. The plan is to assume that there is no derivation of x whose 
premiss set is included in I?, and then show that there is a complete story with witnesses that 
includes I? without including X.  This will show that x isn't a logical consequence of I?. 

The proof closely resembles the corresponding proof for SC, but there are a couple of 
small complications arising from the fact that now we are providing witnesses. Here is one: 
Suppose our set I? consists of all the sentences Gc, for c an individual constant, and let x be 
(Vx)Gx. I? doesn't entail X ,   and so there isn't any derivation of x from I? (by soundness -any 
sentence derivable from a set of premisses is a logical consequence of those premisses). 
However, there isn't any complete story with witnesses that contains all the Gcs without 
containing (Vx)Gx. The way around this difficulty is to add infinitely many new individual 
constants at the beginning. Having an infinite supply of individual constants that don't appear 
either in I? or in x will give us the maneuvering room we need to construct our complete story 
with witnesses. 
Let I?, = I?.  By hypothesis, x isn't derivable fiom I?. We want to build up I?, into a 
complete story with witnesses by building up larger and larger sets of sentences I?, c I?, c I?,  c 
..., going through the sentences one by  one, and adding the sentence if doing so doesn't disrupt 
the property that x isn't derivable. The only complication is that, in order to make sure that the 
complete story we are forming has witnesses, whenever we add in an existential sentence, we 
need to add one of its substitution instances. 
Enumerate all the sentences of the extended language as E,,  El, E,,  .... Given I?, with the 
property that x isn't derivable fiom I?,,  we fiom the set I?,,,, 
as follows: 
Case 1. If x is derivable from I?,  u  {En}, let I?,,,  = I?,. 
Case 2.  If x isn't derivable fiom I?,  u  (6,)  and 5,  isn't existential, let I?,,,  = I?,  u  {En). 
Case 3.  If x isn't derivable fiom I?,  u  (6,)  and 5,  has the form (3x)@ ,  pick the first constant c 
that doesn't appear in I?,  u  {En, x ) ,  and let I?,,,  = I?,  u  {En, v l , ) .  We can do this because at the 
very beginning we introduced an infinite supply of new constants. 
We want to persuade ourselves that x isn't derivable fiom I?,,,.  Cases  1 and 2 are trivial. For 
Case 3, notice that, if we had a derivation of x whose premiss set included vl,,together with 
various members of I?,  u  {En}, then we could utilize rule ES to replace vl,in our premiss set 
by (3x)$.  But this would give us a derivation of x whose premiss set was contained in I?,  u 
{En}, contrary to hypothesis.

Let I?,  be the union of the I?$.  Then x isn't derivable from I?,,  but whenever a sentence 
cp  isn't in I?,,  x is derivable from I?,  u  {cp). It follows that every sentence derivable from I?,  is 
an element of I?,,  and also that, whenever cp  isn't an element of I?,,  (cp  - X)  is an element of 
I?,.  Also, whenever I?,  contains an existential sentence, it contains a substitution instance of the 
existential sentence; if the existential sentence is t k ,  then a substitution instance of the 
existential sentence is introduced in I?,+,. 

We need to see that I?,  is a complete story with witnesses. The proofs of the first five 
clauses in the definitions of "complete story with witnesses" -that is, the proof that I?,  is a 
complete story -are unchanged from the sentential calculus, and there's no point in repeating 
them here. We just noted that if an existential sentence is in I?,,  then at least one substitution 
instance is in I?,.  That an existential sentence is in I?,  if any of its instances are follows from the 
fact that the existential sentence is derivable from each of its instances by EG. This leaves the 
clause for universal sentences. In proving it, we take advantage of the fact that we already have 
the first six clauses in the definition of "complete  story with witnesses": 
iff - (Vx)cp isn't in I?,  (by the fifth clause) 

(Vx)cp is in I?, 

iff ( 3 x )  - cp  isn't in I?, 
(because I?,  is closed under rule ES) 

iff no sentence of the form - cpxIc is in I?, 

iff no substitution instance of (3x)-  cp  is in I?,  (by the sixth clause) 

iff every sentence of the form cpxIc is in I?, 

iff every substitution instance of @ir)cp is in I?,. 


Compactness Theorem. A set of MPC sentences is consistent if every 

finite subset is consistent. 


The proof is unchanged from the sentential calculus. 

Lowenheim-Skolem  Theorem. Every consistent set of MPC sentences 
has model whose domain is the set of natural numbers. 

If I? is consistent, then we can produce, in a language obtained from the language of I? by 
adding infinitely many new individual constants, a complete story with witnesses that includes 
I?. The Henkin model for this complete story with witnesses has the set of natural numbers as its 
d ~ m a i n . ~  

4Unlike our other results, the Lowenheim-Skolem theorem does depend on the 
assumption that the sentences can be put into one-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
