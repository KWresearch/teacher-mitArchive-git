 

Introduction. The Place of Logic Among the Sciences. 

Logic is the science of correct argument. 

 

A good example of an argument is a prosecuting attorney's summation to a jury. 
The prosecutor will suppose that the jury, at the end of the trial, having heard the 
testimony and seen the evidence, is convinced of certain propositions. The prosecutor will 
suppose that the jury already accepts that the gun identified by the ballistics expert as the 
murder weapon was registered in the defendant's name, that Mrs. McIvers, the cleaning 
lady, overheard the defendant quarreling with the deceased an hour before the shooting, 
and so on. These propositions that the prosecutor supposes that the jury already accepts 
are the premisses of the prosecutor's argument. The prosecutor's job is to convince the 
jury that these premisses give them compelling reason to accept the conclusion that the 
defendant is guilty of murder. The purpose of the argument is to lead the jury from the 
premisses to the conclusion, to persuade them that, having accepted the premisses, they 
ought to accept the conclusion as well. 
 
A correct argument is one in which anyone who accepts the premisses ought to 
accept the conclusion. A correct argument is not the same as a persuasive argument. An 
argument can be persuasive without being correct (an appeal to the racial prejudices of the 
jury, for instance) or it can be correct without being persuasive (maybe the jurors were 
dozing off). A correct argument is an argument that ought to persuade, whether or not it 
actually succeeds in persuading. 
 

To see whether an argument is correct, you look at the connection between the 
premisses and the conclusion. In judging whether an argument is correct, you don't look to 
see whether there are good reasons for accepting the premisses. You look at whether, once 
a person has accepted the premisses, for whatever reasons, good or bad, she ought also to 
accept the conclusion. If the argument is the only reason to accept the conclusion, and if the 
person does not have good reason to accept the premisses, she will not have good reason to 
accept the conclusion. But that's not the argument's fault; it's the premisses' fault. 
 

There are two purposes for which we use arguments: to persuade others and to 
persuade ourselves. An example of the former is a prosecutor trying to persuade a jury. An 
example of the latter is a proof in geometry, in which you use an argument to prove a 
theorem, based on things you already know. If you are sure the argument is correct, then 
you can be at least as confident of the conclusion as you are of the premisses. Logic doesn't 
give you the premisses, but, once you have the premisses, it enables you to expand your 
knowledge by drawing new conclusions. The techniques of proof logic gives you are the 
same, whether the person you want to convince is your neighbor or yourself. 
 

Logic, like the rest of western science, began in ancient Egypt, with the annual 
flooding of the Nile River. Every spring the Nile, richly loaded with silt from the melting 
snows of central Africa, flooded its banks. When the waters subsided, the land beneath was 
extremely fertile, and hence extremely valuable. But the floods washed away all 
conventional boundary markers, such as fences and posts. So how could the owners of the 

Introduction, p. 2

valuable land on the flood plain keep track of their property lines? To solve this problem, 
the Egyptians invented geometry. Using geometry, they could determine the property lines 
by triangulation, using objects that weren't disturbed by the floods ─ pyramids and 
whatnot ─ as reference points. 
 

Egyptian geometry was a haphazard affair. Formulas were discovered 
experimentally and written down. Most, but not all, the formulas were accurate. A few of 
them gave more-or-less accurate answers for the particular examples on which they had 
been tried out, but weren't generally valid. The Greeks took over the Egyptian geometry 
and reorganized it, and the Greek geometry was a marvel of careful and systematic 
organization. 
 

Ancient Greek geometry, whose classic exposition in Euclid's Elements, started out 
from certain basic principles, called axioms or postulates, which were regarded as obvious, 
self-evident, and in no need of demonstration. From these axioms, one derived theorems. 
These theorems were then used, together with the original axioms, in deriving still further 
theorems. In this way, starting with the axioms and building up, very sophisticated 
geometric laws that weren't at all obvious were obtained from basic axioms that were 
entirely obvious. The axioms expressed a great deal of information in a compact form, so 
that, for virtually any geometrical problem you started with, you could solve it, eventually, 
by deriving the answer from the axioms. 
 

Aristotle made two important observations. First of all, sciences other than 
geometry could be organized in geometric fashion, starting out from basic axioms and 
building up. Second, the basic argumentative principles that you use in deriving the 
theorems from the axioms are the same in all the sciences. Aristotle hit upon the idea of 
singling out the principles of argument common to all the sciences for study in their own 
right. Thus the science of logic was born. 
 

The patterns of argument Aristotle singled out for study were particularly simple 
patterns called syllogisms. Examples are: 
 

All trout are fish. 
All fish swim. 
Therefore, all trout swim. 

All Capricorns are lazy. 
No woodcutters are lazy. 
Therefore, no Capricorns are woodcutters. 

 

 

Aristotle's logic was quite crude by today's standards. Certainly the reasoning one 
encounters in Greek geometry is much more sophisticated than the mere chaining together 

Introduction, p. 3

of syllogisms. Still, we must not undervalue Aristotle's contribution. He created a science of 
logic where before there was nothing. 
 

For the ancient Greeks, geometry was the paradigm of the sciences; Euclid's 
Elements was what a scientific theory ought to look like. Over the centuries, the geometric 
model has pretty much been abandoned. The problem has been that axioms that have 
seemed self-evident have often turned out to be false. Thus it seemed obvious to Aristotle 
that a moving body will come to rest unless something is pushing it. In fact, as Galileo 
discovered, moving bodies only come to rest because something stops them; without 
interference, a moving body will keep moving with a constant velocity.  
 
Again, it seemed obvious to Aristotle that heavy bodies ─ bodies made up mostly of 
earth and water ─ naturally fall downward toward the center of the universe, while light 
bodies ─ bodies made of air and fire ─ naturally rise away from the center of the universe. 
It turns out that heavy bodies near the earth naturally fall toward the center of the earth, 
but the center of the earth isn't the center of the universe; and heavy bodies near Mars fall 
toward the center of Mars. Light bodies near the earth naturally fall toward the center of 
the earth, the same as heavy bodies. When we see light bodies rising, it’s not because rising 
is their natural tendency but because heavier bodies have shoved them aside. 
 

The final blow came when it was discovered that even the axioms of Euclid's 
Elements aren't all true. Einstein showed that two points don't necessarily determine a line. 
 

On the modern conception, you should accept an axiom, not because it seems self-
evident to you, but because it is confirmed by observation and experiment. The good 
scientific theory is the one that successfully predicts and explains the outcomes of 
observations. Once you get the basic axioms, science proceeds pretty much the way 
Aristotle said it did. Starting with the axioms, you use logic to derive more and more 
sophisticated and specialized theorems and to obtain solutions to particular problems. The 
difference between the modern conception and Aristotle's conception is that (apart from 
pure mathematics), modern science starts from observation. 
 

In principle, there should be two parts to logic. There should be inductive logic, 
which tells you how to get general laws out of particular observations, and deductive logic, 
which tell you how to go from general laws to specialized laws and particular predictions. 
In practice, we hardly understand anything about how to get from observations to general 
laws. Although people have had some interesting things to say about inductive reasoning, 
there isn't, as of today, anything that really deserves to be called a science of inductive 
logic. So deductive logic is what we’ll study here. 
 

The Renaissance brought two great changes in the way we do science. The first was 
the experimental method: observation and experiment became paramount. The second was 
the much greater use of mathematical methods. The Greeks had used mathematical 

Introduction, p. 4

methods in geometry and in geometry-based sciences like astronomy and optics. Galileo 
started using mathematical methods in mechanics, and nowadays mathematics is used 
everywhere. 
 

The first successful use of mathematical methods in logic came in the last half of the 
nineteenth century. In fact, from the time of Aristotle until the last half of the nineteenth 
century, logic stagnated. A lot of people worked on logic and had some interesting ideas, 
but the ideas were never pursued very far, so that in 1850 logic was in basically the state in 
which Aristotle had left it. 
 

In 1854 George Boole wrote a book called The Laws of Thought in which he applied 
the methods of algebra to the study of logic. (Leibniz had attempted the same thing a 
century and a half earlier, but without making a lot of progress.) Boole's book was the first 
of many works to apply, with increasing sophistication, the methods of modern 
mathematics to the study of logic. The result was to revolutionize the way we do logic, in 
much the way Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton revolutionized the way people did physics. 
Aristotle's theory of the syllogism is now entirely obsolete. 
 

I said this before, but I want to emphasize it.  In spite of the fact that the details of 
Aristotle’s logical theory no longer have value for us, the fundamental value of his 
contributions must never be forgotten: He created a science of logic where before there was 
nothing. 
 

Aristotle conceived of the sciences as arrayed in a hierarchy.  The higher sciences 
were general and fundamental, whereas the lower sciences were specialized and derivative. 
Thus physics, which studies the properties of all bodies, lay above biology, which restricts 
its attention to living bodies. The laws of physics apply to all bodies, living or not, whereas 
the laws of biology are applicable to only a special kind of body. 
 

At the top of the hierarchy there is a first science. Each of the other sciences studies 
some special kind of being, but the first science is the fully general science of being. 
Everything is within its scope. The first science has two parts: Ontology addresses questions 
like “What is the ultimate stuff the universe is made of?” and “Does the universe have a 
beginning and an end?”  The other part is logic, which is included in the first science 
because the methods of reasoning it studies are employed throughout the sciences. 
 

What Aristotle called the first science was more-or-less what people nowadays call 
philosophy, but no one nowadays regards philosophy as the first science. Nowadays, I 
suppose you’d say that mathematics plays the role Aristotle envisaged for the first science. 
 

Philosophy’s role has become dramatically narrower. In Aristotle’s time, questions 
about the ultimate constituents of matter were philosophical questions; “natural 
philosophy” was the subdivision of philosophy that focused on them.  Today, such 

Introduction, p. 5

questions are the province of theoretical physics. Hitherto philosophical questions about 
the nature of space and time are now questions for cosmology, a branch of astronomy. 
More recently, the study of mind was the business of philosophy until the last century or so, 
when it broke of to become a separate science of psychology.  Linguistics and 
microeconomics have made the break from philosophy even more recently. Logic appears 
to be making the transition from a part of philosophy to a part of mathematics even as we 
speak. In a typical contemporary university, about half the logic courses are taught in the 
philosophy department and the rest in the math department.   
 

No longer the first science, philosophy today is the primordial ooze from which the 
sciences emerge. Before we understand a subject well enough to formulate even the most 
basic laws, before we lack the needed vocabulary even to ask the right questions, the 
subject is a topic of philosophical inquiry. Once we have secured the vocabulary and a 
basic framework of laws, the discipline can take a place among the sciences. That, at least, 
is my understanding of the place of philosophy among the sciences. J.L. Austin had a 
similar view; let me quote him: 
 

In the history of human inquiry, philosophy has the place of the initial 
central sun, seminal and tumultuous: from time to time, it throws off 
some portion of itself to take station as a science, a planet, cool and 
well regulated, progressing steadily towards a distant final state. This 
happened long ago at the birth of mathematics, and again at the birth 
of physics: only in the last century we have witnessed the same 
process once again, slow and at time almost imperceptible, in the 
birth of the science of mathematical logic, through the joint labours of 
philosophers and mathematicians. Is it not possible that the next 
century may see the birth, through the joint efforts of philosophers, 
grammarians, and numerous other students of language, of a true and 
comprehensive science of language? Then we shall have rid ourselves 
of one more part of philosophy (there will still be plenty left) in the 
only way we ever can get rid of philosophy, by kicking it upstairs. (P. 
232 of “Ifs and Cans,” Philosophical Papers, 2nd ed. (Oxford 
University Press, 1970), pp. 205-32.)
