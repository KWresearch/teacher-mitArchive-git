Substitutions 
 
A substitution is a function s associating SC sentences with SC sentences that meets the 
following conditions: 
 

 ψ)) = (s(φ) ∨
s((φ ∨
 ψ)) = (s(φ) ∧
s((φ ∧
 ψ)) = (s(φ) →
s((φ →
s((φ ↔
 ψ)) = (s(φ) ↔
s(¬φ)= ¬s(φ) 

 s(ψ)) 
 s(ψ)) 
 s(ψ)) 
 s(ψ)) 

 
For example, if s(“A”) = “(C  →
 ¬(D  ↔
 ¬E)).” 

φ. 
 

 

 

 

 D)” and s(“B”) = “(D  ↔

 ¬E), then s(“(A  ∧

 ¬B)”) = “((C →

 D) 

If φ is a sentence and s is a substitution, then s(φ) is said to be a substitution instance of 

If s is a substitution and  ℑ

 is a N.T.A., let ℑ° s be the N.T.A. given by 

ℑ° s(φ) = ℑ

(s(φ)), 

 
for every atomic sentence φ.  It’s easy to convince ourselves that the equation 
 

ℑ° s(φ) = ℑ

(s(φ)) 

 
holds for all sentences, complex as well as simple. 
 
Substitution Theorem 1.  Any substitution instance of a tautology is a 
tautology.  Any substitution instance of a contradiction is a contradiction. 
 
Proof: Suppose that φ is a tautology and s is a substitution.  Take any N.T.A. ℑ
.  Because φ is a 
tautology and  ℑ° s is a N.T.A., ℑ° s(φ) = 1. So s(φ) is true under ℑ
.  Since ℑ
 was arbitrary, we 
conclude that s(φ) is true under every N.T.A., and hence that φ is a tautology. The argument for 
contradictions is similar. _X 
 

Substitution Theorem 2. Let s be a substitution.  If φ implies ψ, then s(φ) 
implies s(ψ). If φ and ψ are logically equivalent, s(φ) and s(ψ) are 
logically equivalent. If φ is a logical consequence of Γ, then s(φ) is a 
logical consequence of {s(γ): γ ∈
 Γ}. 
 
Proof: Similar. _X 
 

In analogy with the theorem before last, you might expect that every substitution instance 
of a consistent sentence is consistent. But that’s not true. A counterexample is the inconsistent

sentence “((Q ∧
 P),” which is a substitution instance of the consistent sentence “(A  ∧
 ¬Q) ∧
What we have instead is this: 
 

Substitution Theorem 3.  A sentence φ is consistent if and only if some 
substitution instance of φ is tautological. 
 
Proof: (⇒)Let ℑ
 

 be a N.T.A. under which φ is true. Define a substitution s by: 

s(ψ) = “(P ∨
        = “(P  ∧

 ¬P)” if ψ is an atomic sentence that is true under  ℑ
 ¬P)” if ψ is an atomic sentence that is false under  ℑ

 

 

 B).” 

   
It is easy to convince ourselves that, for any sentence θ, if θ is true under  ℑ
, then s(θ) is a 
tautology, whereas if θ is false under ℑ
,s(θ) is a contradiction. To show this in detail, we’d give a 
proof by reductio ad absurdum: Assume that the thing you’re trying to prove is false, then show 
that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So assume that there a sentence θ such that either 
(θ)= 1 but s(θ) isn’t tautological or ℑ
(θ) = 0 even though s(θ) isn’t contradictory. Let θ be a 
simplest such sentence. The proof the breaks down into six cases, depending on whether θ is 
atomic, a disjunction, a conjunction, a conditional, a biconditional, or a negation. I won’t go 
through the details. 
 

Since ℑ

(φ)= 1, s(φ) is a tautological substitution instance of φ. 

 
( ⇐
) If φ is inconsistent, then every substitution instance of φ is inconsistent. So no substitution 
instance of φ is tautological. _X 
 

Substitution Theorem 4. A sentence φ is tautological iff every 
substitution instance of φ is tautological iff every substitution instance of 
φ is consistent. A sentence ψ is contradictory iff every substitution 
instance of ψ is contradictory iff every substitution instance of ψ is 
invalid. 
 
Proof: Let (a) be “φ is tautological,” (b) be “Every substitution instance of φ is tautological,” 
and (c) be “Every substitution instance of φ is consistent. We show, first, that (a) implies (b), 
next that (b) implies (c), and finally that (c) implies (a). 
 
(a) ⇒ (b): Substitution Theorem 1. 
 
(b) ⇒ (c): Immediate. 
 
(c) ⇒ (a): What we’ll actually prove is that the negation of (a) implies the negation of (c), which 
comes to the same thing. If φ isn’t tautological, then ¬φ is consistent. So, by Substtution 
Theorem 3, there is a substitution s such that s(¬φ) is tautological. Since the negation of s(φ) is 
tautological, s(φ) is contradictory. So φ has a substitution instance that is inconsistent.

We could prove the second part of Substitution Theorem 4 the same way, but a quicker 
proof appeals to the first part of Substitution Theorem 4, thus: 
 

,” “ ∨
Let φ be a sentence whose only connectives are “∧
,” and “¬.” Let φDual be the 
sentence obtained from φ by exchanging “ ∧ ”s and “ ∨ ”s everywhere. Let d be the substitution 
that replaces each atomic sentence by its negation. It’s easy to convince ourselves, using de 
Morgan’s laws, that φDual is logically equivalent to the negation of d(φ). Hence: 
 

Substitution Theorem 5. Let φ and ψ be sentences whose only 
connectives are “∧
,” “ ∨
,” and “¬.” Then if φ implies ψ, ψDual implies φDual. 
If φ is logically equivalent to ψ, φDual is logically equivalent to ψDual.  
 
Proof: If φ implies ψ then, by Substitution Theorem 2, d(φ) implies d(ψ).  So the negation of 
φDual  implies the negation of ψDual. So there is no N.T.A. under which the negation of φDual is 
true and the negation of ψDual is false.  Hence there is no N.T.A. under which ψDual is true and 
φDual is false; that is, ψDual implies φDual. 
 

The second part of Substitution Theorem 5 appeals to the first. If φ is logically equivalent 
to ψ, then φ implies ψ and ψ implies φ. It follows by the first part of the theorem that ψDual 
implies φDual and φDual implies ψDual. Consequently, φDual is logically equivalent to ψDual. _X
