Sets and Functions: Key Ideas 

The notion of set is one of the central ideas of modern mathematics. I cannot define the 

notion for you. To define a notion, you  explain it in more basic terms, and there the notion of set 

is rock-bottom basic. I can, however, give you  some rough synonyms: 

class 


collection 


totality 


plurality 


group 

family 

ensemble (in French) 

Menge (in German) 

One feature of the notion of set is that, whereas the members of a family are all related  somehow, 

the members of a set need have nothing in common. Thus there is a set whose members are me, 

the number  19, Socrates' nose,  and Mark Twain's sense of humor. Also, a set is determined by  its 

elements. This distinguishes sets from properties. The property of being  a creature with a heart is 

a different property from being  a creature with kidneys, even if it turns out that exactly the same 

creatures have both. But if every creature with a heart has kidneys and vice versa, then the set of 

creatures with a heart and the set of creatures with kidneys are one and the same. Thus we have: 

Axiom of Extensionality. For any sets A and B, A = B if and  only ifA  and B 

have exactly the same elements. 

One way to  name a set is by  listing its elements, thus: {Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars). 

The axiom of extensionality tells us that, in naming a set by  listing it, order and  repetitions don't

matter. 

Another way to  name a set is by  giving some feature its elements share that nothing else 

has, thus: {x: x is an inner planet). We use the symbol "E"  to  indicate set membership, thus: 

Mercury E  {x: x is an inner planet) if and  only if Mercury is an inner planet. As a general rule, we 

have this: 

For any a, a E  {x: x is 

) if and  only if a is 

This naive comprehension principle cannot be upheld  in full generality, however. If it 

could, we would have this: 

For any a, a E  {x: x is a set that isn't an element of itself) if and  only if a is 

a set that isn't an element of itself 

Putting in "{x: x is a set that isn't an element of itself)"  for "a,"  we get: 

{x:x is a set that isn't an element of itself) E  {x:x is a set that isn't an 

element of itself) if and  only if  {x: x is a set that isn't an element of itself]. 

which is absurd. This is Russell 'sparadox, discovered by Bertrand Russell in  1901. Figuring out a 

principled way to  restrict the naive comprehension principle so as to  avoid Russell's paradox 

while maintaining enough of the principle to  satisfl the needs of mathematics was one of the 

central challenges of twentieth century mathematics. I hope we get a chance to  talk about it, but 

not today. For now,  let me  ask you to  take my word for it that the things we use here to  fill in the 

blank in the naive comprehension principle are all legit. 

For any sets A and B, A c B if and  only if every element ofA is an element of B. We have:

A = B i f a n o n l y i f A c B a n d B c A .  

0 ,  the null set or the empty set is the set that has no elements. 0 c A,  for every set A. 

For any sets A and B, A  u  B, the union ofA and B, = {x: x E A or x E B (or both)). We 

A u B = B u A . .  

( A u B ) u  C = A u  ( B u  C)A 

A u A = A .  

A c B i f a n d o n l y i f A u B = B .  

For any sets A and B, A n B, the intersection ofA and B, = {x: x E A and x E B ) .  We 

have: 

have: 

A n B = B n A  

( A n B ) n C = A n ( B n C )  

A n A = A  

A c B i f a n d o n l y i f A n B = A .  

( A n B ) u C = ( A u C ) n ( B u C )  

( A u B ) n C = ( A n C ) u ( B n C )  
For any sets A and B, the difference, A - B = {x: x  E A and x  B B ) .  We have: 

A - A = @  
(A u B) - C = ( A -   C) u  (B - C) 
A - ( B   u C ) = ( A - B )   n ( A - C )  

)Sets and Functions, p. 4 

( A n B ) - C = ( A - C ) n ( B - C )   


A - ( B   n C ) = ( A - B )   u  ( A - C )   


( A - B ) - C = A - ( B u C )   


A - ( B   - C ) = ( A - B )   u  ( A n  (B n C)) 


( A - B ) u ( A n B ) = A .   


( A - B ) n ( A n B ) = @ .   

( A - B )   u  (B - A )   = (A u B) - (A n B)  


( A - B ) n ( B - A ) = @ .   


If F i s  a set of sets, U S ,  the union of F ,  is {x: x is an element of at least one element of 

~ . T ~ u s A u B = U { A , B ) .  

If F i s  a nonempty set of sets, n F ,  the intersection of F ,  is {x: x is an element of every 
element of 9).Thus A n B = n {A, B ) .  We have, for Fa nonempty set of sets and C a set: 
( U s t > - c = U { ~ - c : ~ ~ q .  

( n s t > - ~ = n { ~ - ~ : ~ € q  

C - ( U ~ ~ ) = ~ { C - A : A E ~  

c - ( n s t > = u ( c - ~ : ~ € q .  

For given individuals a and b,  the set  {a, b )  is the uno rd i redpa i r  formed by a and b. It's 

unordered, because we have  {a, b )  = { b , a ) .  It's u s e h l  also t o  have a way of putting two things 

together where you keep track of the order. Thus, for given a and b, we form the unordered pair 

<a, b>  so that (unless a = b), <a, b> will be different from <b,a>. The hndarnental principle 

governing ordered pairs is this: 

)Sets and Functions, p.  5 

Law of Ordered Pairs. For any a, b,  c,  and d, <a,b> = < c , b  if and  only 

i f a = c a n d b = d .  

The notion of ordered pair is especially useful in geometry, where we associate a 

point P with an ordered pair <x,y>, where x represents P's horizontal location and y 
represents its vertical location. More precisely x is * the distance of P from the y-axis, 
positive if x is to  the right of the axis, negative if it's to  the lee, 0 if its on the axis. y is * 

the distance of P from the x-axis, positive if P is above the axis, negative if it's below, 0 

if it's right on the axis. This association permitted  a marriage of geometry and  algebra 

that has been both happy and  fruitful. 

Set theorist's sometimes treat the notion ordered pairs as a defined notion, 

stipulating that <a,b> is to  be  {{a ) ,  { a , b ) ) .  If you make that stipulation, you  can derive 

the law of ordered pairs from the axiom of extensionality. Doing this has the advantage 

of reducing the number of primitive notions, so that you  can build your theory on a very 

small number of basic ideas, treating all the other ideas as defined. For our purposes, 

however, the only thing we need to  know about ordered pairs is the law of ordered 

pairs. 

Now that we have ordered pairs, we want to  go on to  introduce ordered triples, 

ordered quadruples, and  so on. We can enlist the notion of ordered pair to  do all the 

work. The ordered triple <a,b,c> is defined to  be the ordered pair <<a,b>,c>. The 

ordered quadruple <a,b , c , b  is defined as the ordered pair <<a,b , c > , b  ,which is 

<<<a ,b> ,c> ,b .  And  so on. The ordered n+l-tuple <a1, a,,  ..., a,,  a,+,> is the ordered 

pair whose first component is the ordered n-tuple <a1, a,,  ..., a,>  and whose second 

component is a,,,,.  It will be convenient t o  fill things out by taking the  l-tuple <a> t o  be

For sets A and B, the Cartesianproduct A  x  B is {<a,b>: a E A and b  E B ) .  A 
subsetf of A  x  B is said t o  be a function  from A t o  B (in syrnbols,f: A - B) just  in case, 
for each element a of A there is exactly one element b of B with <a, b>  E J :  You  can 

think off  as a machine that, given an element of A as input, always gives an element of 
B as the output; the output is uniquely determined by the input. Iff:  A - B and <a,b> E

Iff:  A - B and g :  B - C, the composition gof  is the hnc t ion :  A - C given by 
gofla)  = gm a ) ) .  You  screw the output hose from f onto the input hose for g. If h: C -
D, we have (hog)of  = ho(goA. 

A hnc t ion  f from A t o  B is said t o  be one-one or injective just  in case, whenever 
we haveflx) =m),  y,  so that you never get the same output for two 
we have x = 
different inputs. 

Iff  is a hnc t ion  from A t o  B, A, the set of inputs, is said t o  be the domain o f f ,  

while the range off  is the set of all b  E B  such that, for some a in A , f l a )  = b; that is, the 

range off  is the set of outputs. If the range off  is all of B, f is said t o  be onto or 

surjective. 

Iff  is both injective and  surjective, it is said t o  be bijective or a one-one 

correspondence. In particular, the identity map on A,  IDA = {-,a>:  a E A )  is a bijection 
from A t o  itself  Iff  is a bijection: A - B, the inverse, f 1   is the bijection: B - A given by 
f-'= {<b,a>: <a,b>  Ef). We have f -'of  = IDA andfofl  = ID,.

Where R  is the set of real numbers,  {<x,  2 > :  is a bijection: R  - R .  The function 
{<x, 2 - 6 2  + 11,  - 6: x E  R )  is surjective but not one-one,  since the inputs 1 , 2 ,  and  3 
all give the output 0.The arctangent function, {<x,y>: - "I, <y < "', and x = tan y ) ,  is 

injective but not  surjective; it's an increasing function whose range is the set of numbers 

between - "I, and "I,. The function {<x,  2 > :  x E  R )  is neither injective nor surjective. It 

isn't injective because it gives the output 4 for both the input 2 and the input -2., and it 

isn't surjective because none of the negative numbers are in its range. 

Let B be the set  {Al, Bruce),  and let G be the set  {Xochitl, Yolanda, Zaida). 

Then B  x  B is the 4-element  set  {<a,a>, <a,b>, +,a>,  <b,b>)  (using "a"  and " b  t o  

abbreviate "Al" and "Bruce").  B  x  G is the 6-element  set  {<a,x>, <a,y>, <a,z>, <b,x>, 

<b,y>, <b,z>). G x  B is the 6-element  set  {<x,a>, <x,b>, <y,a>, <y,b>, <z,a>, <z,b>). 

G x  G is the 9-element  set  {<x,x>, <x,y>, <x,z>, <y,x>, <y,y>,<y,z>, <z,x>, <z,y>, 

<z,z>). 

There are four functions from B t o  B, namely: 

{<a,a>, +,a>) 

{<a,a>, +,b>) 

{<a,b>, +,a>) 

{<a,b>, <b,b>) 

The  second and third are bijective, whereas the other two are neither injective nor 

surjective. 

There are nine functions from B t o  G, namely: 

{<a,x>, <b,x>) 

)Sets and Functions, p.  8 

{<a,x>, -+,Y>) 


{<a,x>, <b,z>) 


{<a,y>, -+,x>) 


{<a,y>, -+,Y>) 


{<a,y>, -+,z>) 


{<a,z>, <b,x>) 


{<a,z>, -+,Y>) 

{<a,z>, <b,z>) 

Of these, the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and  eighth are injective. None of the 

functions are surjective. 

There are eight function from G to  B, namely: 

{<x ,O ,  <Y ,O  < z , W  

{<x ,O ,  <Y ,O ,  <z,b>) 


{<x ,O ,  <y,b>, < z , W   


{<x,a>, <y,b>, <z,b>) 


{<x,b>, <Y ,O ,  < z , W  

{<x,b>, <y,a>, <z,b>) 

{<x,b>, <y,b>, <z,a>) 

{<x,b>, <y,b>, <z,b>) 

Of these eight functions, all but the first and  last are surjective. None are injective. 

There are twenty-seven functions from G to  G, namely: 

{<x,x>, <y,x>, <z,x>)
