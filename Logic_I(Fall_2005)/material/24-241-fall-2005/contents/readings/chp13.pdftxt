and 

Now that we've learned the formal language of the sentential calculus, we want to 
see how we can use the formal language to help illuminate the structure of arguments in 
English. Our plan is to translate an English argument into the formal language by 
translating simple English sentences by atomic sentences of the formal language, then 
translating the connectives used to build compound English sentences out of simple ones 
into SC connectives. If all goes well, we'll get a translation from the English argument into 
an SC argument that is truth value preserving in the following sense: If we specify a N.T.A. 
for the formal language by saying an atomic sentence is true if and only if the simple 
English sentence it translates is true, then compound SC sentences will likewise be true 
under the N.T.A. when and only when the compound English sentences they translate are 
true. 
 

In speaking of English sentences as being either true or false, I am being sloppy. The 
only kinds of sentences of which it makes sense to ask whether they are true or false are 
sentences that make assertions. Other sentences, like questions or commands or expletives, 
are neither true nor false. Even the sentences used to make assertions can't normally be 
said to be either true or false. The sentence "I just ate" isn't true or false. Whether a 
particular utterance of the sentence is true will depend upon when the sentence was uttered 
and by whom. An utterance of the sentence is true iff the speaker ate directly before the 
time of utterance. Similarly, "The cat is on the mat" is neither true nor false. To see 
whether an utterance of the sentence is true, one must look to the context of utterance to 
see what cat and mat are salient. It's only with respect to a particular context of utterance 
that a sentence can be said to be true or false, so that we shouldn't say that a sentence is 
true but only that it's true in a context. With that said, let me persist in my sloppy but 
convenient habit of simply saying that a sentence is either true or false. 
 

The connectives of the formal language are all truth functional connectives, 
meaning that whether a compound sentence is true is determined by seeing whether its 
simple components are true. Connectives in English often fail to be truth functional. As an 
example, consider the English sentence "He hit me because I insulted him." In order for 
this sentence to be true, "He hit me" and "I insulted him" both have to be true. But 
knowing that "He hit me" and "I insulted him" are both true won't be enough to tell you 
whether "He hit me because I insulted him" is true. So "because" isn't truth functional. 
 

The name of the game is to find, for each English connective, a truth functional 
connective that approximates its meaning as nearly as possible; recall that, because the 
connectives of SC are expressively complete, every truth functional connective can be 
represented in the formalism. The hope is that the approximation will be good enough so 
that the translation will take true sentences to true and false sentences to false. 
 

"∧ " is the catch-all connective. A large preponderance of English connectives are 
translated, with greater or less success, as "∧
." Among them are the following: 
 

both ... and 
but 
yet 
still 
however 
so 
and so 
for 
although 
even though 
since 
moreover 
thus 
hence 
; 
 
There are significant differences in meaning among the words on this list.  
 

He kissed me, so I let him stay the night. 

 
means something very different from 
 

He kissed me, yet I let his stay the night. 

 
The first sentence suggests that his kissing me was a reason for letting him stay the night. 
The second suggests that his kissing me was a reason to not let him stay, though I let him 
stay anyway. The theory is that nuances of English speech are often lost when we translate, 
but raw truth value is preserved, so that ideas that are suggested or intimated but not 
directly stated by an English expression are lost in translation, but still the translation 
takes true sentences to true and false to false. 
 

"¬" translates "not," and a "¬" can also be extracted from a host of other negative 
words, among them: 
 

"∨ " is easier. It translates 

or 
either ... or 

 

 

nobody 
no one 
no 
nowhere 
nothing 
neither ... nor 
never 

SC Translations, p. 3

 
"Neither Angela nor Beulah would help Jorge with his `problem’" is cashed out as "It's not 
the case that either Angela or Beulah would help Jorge with his `problem,'" which is 
translated "¬(A ∨
 B)." Where "G" translates "I gave him money," "I gave him no money" 
is translated "¬G." 
 

"→ " is a little complicated. Most often, it translates "if" or "if ... then." "If you 
study, you'll pass" is translated "(S  →
 P)." You can say the same thing with a different 
word order, so that "You'll pass if you study" is also translated "(S  →
 P)." The rule is that 
the antecedent is whatever comes right after "if," whether or not it's the first clause in the 
sentence. 
 

"Only if" is different from "if." "You'll pass if you study" is something you might 
say to someone who was doing well in the course, so that she had a good chance of passing 
even without studying, but, if she studies, she'll pass for sure. So "You'll pass if you study" 
is consistent with "(P  ∧
 ¬S)"; what it rules out is "(¬P ∧
 S)."  
 

"You'll pass only if you study" is something you might say to someone who's doing 
so badly in the course that there's no way she'll pass without studying, but she might fail 
even if she studies. That is, "You'll pass only if you study" is consistent with "(¬P  ∧
 S)" but 
inconsistent with "(P  ∧
 ¬S)."  
 

"You'll pass if you study" is translated "(S  →
 P)," while "You'll pass only if you 
study" is "(P  →
 S)." "Only if you study will you pass" and "You will only pass if you 
study" are also translated "(S  →
 P)." The rule is that, when you have an "only if" 
construction, the consequent is the clause that comes right after "if." 
 

 

 

 

Other phrases that get translated by "→ " include: 

provided that 
given that 
assuming that 
supposing that 
even if 
in case 

"→ " is sometimes read "implies," but this is a mistake. "Implies" is a transitive 
verb; what go before and after "implies" are names of sentences, as in 
"No one went to the party" implies "Sam didn't  
go to the party." 

SC Translations, p. 4

"→ " is what logicians call a connective and what grammarians call a conjunction. What do 
on either side of " → " are sentences, not names of sentences. Where "P" translates 
"Someone went to the party" and "S" translates "Sam went to the party," "(¬P  →
translates 
 

 ¬S)" 

If no one went to the party, then Sam didn't go to the party. 

"↔ " translates the following: 

if and only if 
when and only when 
just in case 

 

 

 

 

 
"You'll pass if and only if you study" can be expanded into a conjunction, "You'll pass if 
you study and you'll pass only if you study," which would be translated "((S  →
 P) ∧
 (P →
S))." But the "if and only if" construction occurs often enough that it's worthwhile to be 
able to write it more concisely as "(P′
 P) ∧
 S)," which is logically equivalent to "((S  →
 (P 
 S))." 

 

No one knows precise rules for doing translations. What I've been giving you are 
guidelines, but they don't constitute a precise recipe. You learn how to do translations by 
practice.* So let's look at some examples. 
 

If he asks us to stay, we'll go, but we'll only go if he asks us to stay. 
 
This is a conjunction, whose first conjunct is an "if" conditional we can translate "(S  →
 
G)," while the second is an "only if" conditional we can translate "(G  →
 S)." So the whole 
sentence is this: 
 

((S  →

 G)  ∧

 (G  →

 S)) 

If you don't bribe the judge or the jury doesn't like you, you won't be 
acquitted. 
 
This is a conditional whose antecedent is a disjunction. "You don't bribe the judge," "The 
jury doesn't like you," and "You won't be acquitted" can all be translated as negations, say 
"¬B," "¬L," and "¬A," respectively. So the whole sentence is this: 

*

Gilbert Ryle made a big deal of the distinction between "knowing how" and 
"knowing that," the idea being that knowing how to swim, say, isn't just a matter of 
knowing that a bunch of propositions are true. Translation lore is a matter of 
knowing how.

↔

SC Translations, p. 5

((¬B  ∨

 ¬L) →

 ¬A) 

 
Here's another sentence logically equivalent to the last one: 
 

You will be acquitted only if you bribe the judge and the jury likes 
you. 
 
This is an "only if" conditional whose consequent in a conjunction. It's translation is this: 
 

 (B ∧

 L)) 

(A →
 
I only like country and western music if I'm drunk, but if I'm drunk I 
like nothing better. 
 
This is a conjunction, whose first conjunct is an "only if" conditional, 
 

(I like country and western music  →

 I'm drunk) 

 
The second conjunct is an "if" conditional:  
 

(I'm drunk  →

 I like nothing better than country and western music) 

 
The negative word "nothing" tells us to translate the consequent of this conditional as a 
negation: 
 

¬ I like something better than country and western music 

 
Putting it all together, we get this: 
 

 

 

((I like country and western music  →
 I'm drunk) ∧
 
(I'm drunk  →
 ¬ I like something better than country and   western music)) 

 
or, putting in letters for the simple English sentences: 
 

((L →

 D)  ∧

 (D  →

 ¬B)) 

This illustrates a good technique for translating complicated sentences. Translate 
the sentence in stages. First find the main connective of the sentence. Then look at each of 
the components, and find the main connectives in each of them. Continue until you've 
gotten down to the simple sentences. You'll produce a sequence of hybrid 
English/sentential calculus sentences. As you go further along the sequence, you'll replace 

SC Translations, p. 6

more and more English connectives by SC connectives, until you've gotten them all; then 
put in letters for the simple English sentences. This is a good technique. A bad technique is 
to stare at the English sentence for five minutes, then, in a burst of energy, to write down a 
long formula. 
 

The example illustrates something else. We commonly pretend that a correct 
translation only depends on the meanings of the English connectives, and not on the 
meanings of the other words in the sentence. That’s not strictly correct. To translate “I like 
country and western music” properly, you have to know that there’s one kind of music 
called “country and western music,” rather that two kinds of music, called “country 
music” and “western music.” If you didn’t know this, you’d translate “I like country and 
western music” as “I like country music  ∧
 I like western music,” “(C  ∧
 W).” 
 

Here's an example of stage-by-stage translation: 

 

If you want to try for slam, you should either bid four no trump or 
cue bid diamonds, but you should only bid four no trump if you want 
to try for slam. 
 
(If you want to try for slam, you should either bid four no trump or 
cue bid diamonds ∧
 you should only bid four no trump if you want to 
try for slam) 
 
((You want to try for slam  →
 you should either bid four no trump or 
cue bid diamonds) ∧
 (you should cue bid diamonds  →

for slam)) 
 
((You want to try for slam  →

Angel will drive his truck to the picnic if we ask him to, but otherwise 
he'll go to his girlfriend's house in Sonoma. 
 
The interesting thing here is "otherwise." The sentence amounts to the conjunction of two 
conditionals, where the antecedent of the second conditional is the negation of the 
antecedent of the first conditional: 
 

(Angel will drive his truck to the picnic if we ask him to ∧
, if we don't 
ask Angel to drive his truck to the picnic, Angel will go to his 
girlfriend's house in Sonoma)

You have to be careful about collapsed clauses. "Consuela knew that Mary or Sue 
had taken her jacket" doesn't mean “Consuela knew that Mary had taken her jacket or 
Consuela knew that Sue had taken her jacket." The former, but not the latter, would be 
true if she knew that one of them had taken her jacket but she didn't know which. "Bert 
and Ernie ate a pizza" doesn't mean the same as "Bert ate a pizza and Ernie ate a pizza"; it 
means that Bert and Ernie ate a pizza together. "George and Gracie were married" could 
mean the same as "George was married and Gracie was married," but it could also mean 
"George and Gracie were married to each other." The sentence is ambiguous, though you 
can usually tell from the context which was intended. 
 

Fred will sing or Fred will dance and Ginger will dance 

Sometimes the consolidation of repeated phrases introduces ambiguities, but other 
times it overcomes ambiguities. In the formal language, we have unique readability, but in 
English, we can sometimes build up the same sentence in two different inequivalent ways. 
Thus 
 
(1) 
 
could be either of these: 
 
(2) 
 
(3) 
 
Now if (1) is intended as a disjunction (2), it contains the sentence 
 
(4) 
 
which can be rewritten as

Jones came and Smith stayed or Robinson left, 

"Either ... or" is generally nothing more than a stylistic variation of "or," but 
sometimes the "either" serves a bigger purpose. Consider  
 
(10) 
 
which is ambiguous between these: 
 
(11) 
 
(12) 
 
"Either" is placed before the first disjunct. In (11), the whole sentence is a disjunction, and 
the first disjunct is "Jones came and Smith stayed," so that inserting "either" gives us 
 
(13) 
 
In (12), the disjunction is "Smith stayed or Robinson left," whose fist disjunct is "Smith 
stayed." So inserting "either" gives

Now we know two important things. We know how to translate an English 
argument into SC, and we know how to test whether an SC argument is valid. Now we 
want to put those skills together. If the SC argument is valid, we can conclude that the 

SC Translations, p. 13

English argument was valid. (Though, let me remind you, from the fact that the SC 
argument is invalid, you can't tell one way or the other about the English argument.) So we 
have a method of showing that an English argument is valid. 
 

Our first example is due to the Stoic philosopher Chryssipus, who used it to show 
that even dogs are capable of reasoning logically. According to Chryssipus, when a dog 
chasing a rabbit comes to a point where the path branches into three direction, the dog will 
first sniff along one of the paths, and, if he smells the rabbit, he'll dash after it. If not, he'll 
sniff along the second path, and, if he smell's the rabbit, he'll dash after it. But if he doesn't 
smell the rabbit down either of the first two paths, he'll rush down the third path without 
hesitating to smell, because he'll know that, if the dog hasn't gone down either of thee first 
two paths, he must have gone down the third. That is, the dog reasons as follows: 
 

The dog went down either the first path or the second or the third. 
The dog didn't go down the first path. 
The dog didn't go down the second path. 
Therefore the dog went down the third path. 
 

In symbols, 

 (S ∨

 T)) 

 
(F ∨

We can show that this argument is valid by the search-for-counterexample method, looking 
for a N.T.A. which makes the premises true and the conclusion false:

I have no idea whether dogs really do this. 
 

Our next example is from Catch 22 by Joseph Heller: 

 

You will receive a medical discharge just in case you apply for one 
and you are judged to be insane. Applying for a medical discharge is 
regarded as a sign of sanity, so if you apply for a medical discharge, 
you will not be judged to be insane. Thus you will not receive a 
medical discharge.

him, the race will be canceled.

Another example: 
 
If !Kumsa captured the springbok he wounded yesterday, he would 
have brought it home and there would have been cries of joy from his 
hut, but otherwise he's still on the trail of the springbok. Therefore, 
since there weren't cries of joy from !Kumsa's tent, he must be still on 
the trail of the springbok.

Our last example is from Quine's Methods of Logic: 
 
If Jones is ill or Smith is away, then neither will the Argus deal be concluded

away and Robinson does not come to his senses, the Argus deal will not be 
concluded.
