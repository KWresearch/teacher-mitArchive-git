State Descriptions, Disjunctive Normal Form,  
and Expressive Completeness 
 
We have already learned how to find the truth table for a given SC sentence. We 
now want to attack the opposite problem: Given a truth table, how can we find a sentence 
that has that truth table? 
 

Under any N.T.A., exactly one of the following eight SC sentences is true: "(A  ∧
 (B 
 (¬B  ∧
 C))," "(A  ∧
 ¬C))," "(A  ∧
 C))," "(A  ∧
 C))," "(¬A  ∧
 (B ∧
 ¬C))," "(¬A  ∧
 (¬B  ∧
 (B ∧
 
(B ∧
 ¬C))," "(¬A  ∧
 (¬B  ∧
 C))," and "(¬A  ∧
 (¬B  ∧
 ¬C))." These eight sentences are said to 
be the state descriptions for "A," "B," and "C," since they completely describe the state of 
the world with respect to these three sentences. Each of the state descriptions is associated 
with a line of the truth table, as follows: 
 

A         B        C         Associated state description

(A ∧
 C))

A state description is true at the line of the truth table it's associated with, and nowhere 
else. 
 

With the notion of state description in hand, the solution to our problem of getting a 
sentence with a given truth table is simple: We take our sentence to be the disjunction 
whose disjuncts are the state descriptions associated with those lines of the truth table 
where "1"s appear. 
 
Example: Find an SC sentence whose truth table is this: 
 

A         B         C                   
1          1

Solution: "1" appears in the truth table at line two, three, and six, with which the 
associated state descriptions are "(A  ∧
 (B ∧
 ¬C))," "(A  ∧
 (¬B  ∧
 C))," and "(¬A  ∧
 (B ∧
¬C))," respectively. So the sentence we want is the disjunction of those three state 
descriptions, namely: "((A ∧
 (B ∧
 ¬C)) ∨
 ((A ∧
 (¬B  ∧
 C)) ∨
 (¬A  ∧
 (B ∧
 ¬C))))."

Solution: Here there is only one "1," so we don't need to form a disjunction. We just take 
the single state description corresponding to the line where "1" appears, namely, "(A  ∧
 (¬B 
 ¬C))." 

 
Exception: Our procedure tells us to form the disjunction of the state descriptions 
associated with lines of the truth table where "1"s appear. But what do we do if there 
aren't any "1"s? How do we find a sentence with the truth table 
 

 
Solution: This is easy. We just use "(A  ∧
 

 ¬A)." 

The procedure we have been developing is perfectly general. Given atomic sentences 
α1, α2, ..., αn, a truth table for α1, α2, ..., αn will have 2n rows, one row for each possible 
assignment of "1"s and "0"s to α1, α2, ..., αn. Given a column of 2n “0”s and “1”s, we want 
to find a sentence that has that column as its truth table. With each line of the truth table, 
we associate a state description, a conjunction of 2n conjuncts whose ith conjunct is either αi 
or ¬αi, depending on whether "1" or "0" appears under αi in that line. As our sentence 

∧
Disjunctive Normal Form, p. 3

whose truth table is the given column, we take the disjunction of the state descriptions of 
the state descriptions associated with positions in which “1” appears, assuming there is 
more than one such position. If “1” appears in only one position, we take our sentence to be 
the state description associated with that position. If there are no “1”s at all, we take our 
sentence to be (α1 ∧
 ¬α1). 
  

In every case, the sentence we obtain by our procedure has a special form. The 
sentence we get is a disjunction of one or more sentences each of which is a conjunction of 
one or more atomic sentences or negated atomic sentences. A sentence that has this form is 
said to be in disjunctive normal form. Thus we have shown that, for any given truth table, 
we can find a sentence in disjunctive normal form that has that truth table. 
 

Given any sentence, we can find a logically equivalent sentence in disjunctive 
normal form by writing out the truth table for the given sentence, then using the procedure 
given above to find a sentence in disjunctive normal form that has that truth table.  
 

," "∧
A sentence in disjunctive normal form contains only the connectives " ∨
," and 
"¬." Thus we see that, for any given truth table, we can find a sentence that contains only 
the connectives "∨
," "∧
," and "¬" that has that truth table. A set S of sentential 
connectives is said to be expressively complete iff, for any given truth table, you can find a 
sentence containing only connectives from S that has that truth table. Thus we see that 
{"∨
,""∧
,""¬"} is expressively complete. 
 

Now " ∨ " can be defined in terms of " ∧ " and "¬," since (φ ∨
 ψ) is logically 
equivalent to ¬(¬φ ∧
 ¬ψ). This tells us that, for any given SC sentence, we can find a 
logically equivalent sentence whose only connectives are "∧ " and "¬" by the following 
procedure: First find a sentence in disjunctive normal form which is logically equivalent to 
the given sentence. Next look within the sentence in disjunctive normal form for a 
subsentence of the form (φ ∨
 ψ); replace this subsentence with ¬(¬ φ ∧
 ¬ψ). Continue 
eliminating "∨ "s until they're all gone. This gives us a sentence whose only connectives are 
"∧ " and "¬." So {"∧
," "¬"} is expressively complete. 
 

Similarly, for any given truth table, we can find a sentence with that truth table 
which contains only the connectives " ∨ " and "¬," by first finding a sentence in disjunctive 
normal form that has that truth table, then replacing each subsentence of the form (χ ∧
 θ) 
by ¬(¬χ ∨
 ¬θ). Hence {"∨
,""¬"} is expressively complete.  
 

," "¬"} is expressively complete, since we can write (φ ∨
{"→
can write (χ ∧
 θ) as ¬(χ →
 ¬θ). 
 

 ψ) as (¬φ →

 ψ), and we 

By contrast, {"↔
," "¬"} isn't expressively complete, since any four-line truth table 
constructed out of "↔ " and "¬" will have "1"s on an even number of lines.

Similarly, the set {"∨
,""∧
,""→
,""↔ "} is not expressively complete, as we can see 
by observing that any sentence constructed out of these connectives is sure to have "1" at 
the top line of its truth table.
