Derived Rule for Substitution of Equivalents 

Our system of rules in complete; if cp  is a consequence of I?,  then there is a derivation of 
cp with a premiss set that is included in r.The system is also reasonably efficient,  so long as we 
restrict ourselves to inferences that contain only the connectives "-"and "-,"but the clumsiness 
of rule P C )  makes inferences involving the other connectives awkward. Now we'll introduce a 
new derived rule that makes things easier. 
has been derived &om the premiss set I?,  that (X - 0)  has been derived 
Derived Rule for the Substitution of Equivalents (SE).  Suppose that cp 
with premiss set A,  and that $ has been obtained fiom cp  either by 
replacing x with 0 or by replacing 0 with X.  Then you may derive @ with 
premiss set I'  u  A. 

This is a "derived" rule because everything you can prove with the rule you can prove more 
laboriously without it. I'll postpone the proof of this for a while. 
The basic strategy for proving biconditionals is clear. If we want to prove (cp  - $), we first prove 
For rule SE to be useful, you need a large supply of biconditional theorems on hand. 
(cp  - $) and then prove ($ - cp).  TH16 gives us ((cp  - $) - ((6 - cp)  - (cp  - $))), so we derive (cp 
- $) by two applications of MP.  In practice, the relevant instance of TH16 is long enough that 
writing it out is a real nuisance, enough so that we adopt a new derived rule: 
both (cp  - $) and (@  - cp), you may write (cp  - @),  taking as premiss set

the union of the premiss sets of the two conditionals.

TH25 

It's now time to think about the status of SE as a derived rule. The most straightforward 
way of showing that rule SE doesn't give us anything genuinely new is by a detailed 
examination of the ways the formula cp might have been constructed. showing that, no matter 
how the formula cp was built up, the formula $. The required examination would be entirely 
unproblematic, but lengthy. 

Because we have the soundness and completeness theorem in hand,  and because the 
the rule, cp  is derivable fiom I?  and either (X - 0 ) or (0  - X )  is derivable fiom A.  It follows by 
proof of the theorem didn't employ SE,  a shorter argument is available. Under the hypotheses of 
soundness that cp  is a logical consequence of r and that either (X - 0)  or (0  - X) is a logical 
consequence of A.  SC Theorem  10 informs us that, under these circumstances, $ is a logical 
consequence of r u A,  and hence, according to the completeness theorem,  $ is derivable 
(without using SE) fkom I?  u  A. 

The more direct proof is more informative than the argument that appeals to the 
completeness theorem, since it shows us how to convert a proof that employs SE into a proof 
that does not. The argument ftom completeness tells us that a proof without SE exists, but it 
doesn't tell us how to find it. So the short cut through completeness loses information. On the 
other hand, life is short. 

Basic Rules of Deduction 

Rule SE, p.  7 

You may write down any sentence you like if you take the sentence as its own premiss set. 
If you have derived $ with premiss set I?,  you may write (4 - $) with premiss set I? -

{(PI. 

If you have derived cp with premiss set I? and (cp  - $) with premiss set A,  you may write $ 

with premiss set r u  A. 

If you have derived $ with premiss set r and (- cp  - - $) with premiss set A,  you may 

write cp with premiss set r u  A. 


You may write an instance of any of the following six schemata with the empty premiss 

set: 

$1) 

( (cpv$ ) - (7cp -
((cp A $1  - -(cp  - - $1) 

(cpV$)) 

((-cp-$1-
(-(cp  - - $1  - (cp  A $1) 
((cp  - $1  - ((cp - $1  A  ($ - cp11) 
(((cp - $1 
('4  - cp))  - (cp  - $1) 
Derived Rules 

If you have already proved cp  f?om the empty set, you may, at any time in any derivation, 
write down any substitution instance of cp again, with the empty premiss set. 
Suppose that cp has been derived fkom the premiss set I?,  that (X - 0)  has been derived 
with premiss set A,  and that $ has been obtained fkom cp either by replacing x with 0 or by 
replacing 0 with X.  Then you may derive $ with premiss set I? u A. 
If you have derived both (cp  - $) and ($ - cp), you may write (cp  - $), taking as premiss 
set the union of the premiss sets of the two conditionals.
