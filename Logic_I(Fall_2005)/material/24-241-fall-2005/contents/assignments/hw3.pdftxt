1. 	

Write a sentence with the following truth table: 

P O R  
1 1 1   0 

1 1 0   1 

1 0 1   1 

1 0 0   0 

0 1 1   1 
0  1 0   1 
0 0 1   0 
0 0 0   0 
2a)  Write a sentence that is logically equivalent to "(P  - (Q - R))"  and that is a disjunction 
b)  Write a sentence that is logically equivalent to "(P  - (Q - R))"  and that is a conjunction 
of conjunctions of atomic and negated atomic sentences. 
of disjunctions of atomic and negated atomic sentences. 
3 .   	 Write a sentence logically equivalent to "(P  - - Q)"  whose only connective is "NOR," 
and then write such a sentence whose only connective is "NAND,"  where these 
connectives are described by the following truth table:

4. 	

How long is the longest list of SC sentences with the following two properties: None of 
the sentences on the list contains any atomic sentence other than "P,"  "Q,"  "R,"  or "S"; 
and no two sentences on the list are logically equivalent? You don't need to write out the 
list; just  tell me exactly how long it is. 

5 .   	

Test each of the following sentences for validity by using the method of truth tables, then 
test each sentence again by the search-for-counterexamples method:
