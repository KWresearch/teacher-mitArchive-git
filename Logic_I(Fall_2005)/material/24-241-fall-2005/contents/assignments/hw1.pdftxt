Subject 24.241.  Logic I. Homework due Thursday, Sept. 22. 

For these problems, use the version of the sentential calculus in which the atomic 
sentences are English capital letters. 

1. 	

Classify each of the following five expressions as either an atomic sentence, a 
negation, a conjunction, a disjunction, a conditional, a biconditional, or not an SC 
sentence. For each of the expressions that is an SC sentence, give a structure 
tree: 

a) - ( P V   ( Q A  1R))  

b) ( 1 P V  ( Q A  1R))  

c) ( ( -PV   a) A  l R )   

e) (((A - B )  - C )  - ((A - C )  - C ) )  
d ) l l ( l l c p " l l l l  LV) 
Give an example of each of the following: 

a) a disjunction both of whose disjuncts are atomic 
b) a disjunction both of whose disjuncts are conjunctions both of whose 
conjuncts are disjunctions. 
c) a conditional whose antecedent is a biconditional and whose consequent is a 
negated biconditional. 

Describe an algorithm that, given an SC sentence as input, determines which of 
the six categories (atomic, negation, conjunction, disjunction, conditional, or 
biconditional) it falls into. Explain why your algorithm gives the correct 
classification of each of the SC sentences from problem 1. 

A substitution is an operation that replaces each atomic sentence by an SC 
sentence, making sure that the same replacement is made for all instances of a 
given atomic sentence. In other work, a substitution is is a function sassociating 
SC sentences with SC sentences that meets the following conditions:

4. 	

Let s be a substitution with s("P')= " ( P V  a)," s('Q')  = " ( (PV  a)  - R),"  and s(cp)  = 
cp  for cp  an atomic sentence other than "P' or "Q." 

a) What is s ( " (PV  R)")?  

b) What is s ( " (PV  a)")? 

C) What is s(s("(PV  R)"))? 

d) Give two distinct SC sentences cp  and LV  with s(cp)  = S(w).
