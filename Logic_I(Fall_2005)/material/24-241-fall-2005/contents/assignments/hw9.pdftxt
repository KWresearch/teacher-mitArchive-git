I. 	

Let U be an interpretation whose domain consists of the nine planets of the Solar System, 
with U("FW) = {<x,y>: x is a planet that is farther from the sun than planet y ) ,  U("L")  = 
{<x,y>: x and y are planets and x is larger than y ) ,  U("1")  = {the inner planets), a("=")  = 
{<x,x>: x is a planet), U("e')  = Earth, and U("s")  = Saturn. Let a be the variable 
assignment with a("vW) = Venus, a("x")  = Mars, and a(every other variable) = Neptune. 
Which of the following formulas are satisfied by  a  in U? Explain you answers: 
a)  (Fxv - Lvx) 

C)  ( ( ~ Y ) ( I Y  - F Y ~ )-. IY) 

(-(Ix  A Lxv) A  (3x)(Ix A Lxv)) 

b) 
d)  (3x)(3y)(Vz)(Fez - (z = x V  z = y)) 

e)  (3x)(3y)(Vz)(Lzs  - (z = x V  z = y)) 

Note: In order of increasing distance from the sun, the planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto; the first four of these are the inner 
planets. In order of increasing size, the planets are Pluto, Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, 
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter.

Translate the following sentences, taking the domain to be the set of human beings, and 
using "c"  to translate "Consuela,"  "r"  to translate "Ruben,"  "g"  to translate "Gregor," 
"Jxy"  to translate "x  wears y's jacket,"  "Wxy"  to translate "x  can wear y's cape,"  "Txy" 
to translate "x  is taller than y,"  "Mx"  to translate "x  is a man,"  "Wx"  to translate "x  is a 
woman,' and "Cx"  to translate "x  is a child." 

a)  If Consuela wears her own jacket, Ruben can wear Consuel's cape. 

b)  Consuela wears her own jacket, while Ruben wears Gregor's jacket.

m)  Consuela is at least as tall as Ruben. 

n)  Gregor is taller than some women, but not all. 

o)  Some children are taller than some women, but there is no child taller than every woman. 

p)  Every child who is taller than every woman is taller than at least one man.
