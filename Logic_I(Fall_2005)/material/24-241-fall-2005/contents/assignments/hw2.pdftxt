by any numbers other than themselves and one), and let Sbe the set of integers greater 
than  1 and less than  10. 
a)  List the members of S- P. 
b)  List the members of S- ( P  u E) 

c)  List the members of P n E. 

d)  List the members of (S  - P )  - E. 

e)  List the members of S- ( P  - E). 

For this problem, let I be  {Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars), and let C = {Spock, McCoy).
